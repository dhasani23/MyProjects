    "content": "Hello Yasiri,  Both bones and tendons can be lengthened.  These are not necessarily straight forward surgeries, though.  They are often done when the short issue is causing significant pain or limitation.  I suspect that if you are able to play football the orthopedic surgeon isn't going to be to quick to do this procedure for you.    I would recommend you see an orthopedic surgeon, though.  They may be up for doing the procedure if they think it will help.  Additionally, physical therapy or some other treatment option may be available for you to get you some relief without surgery (always a nice alternative).  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello. I am a young woman with cerebral palsy, epilepsy, hydrocephalus, autism, Asperger syndrome, and nonverbal learning disorder. Because of the CP affecting my mobility in different ways, if I ever became pregnant my sister said I would be unliveable. I asked her if she might be a surrogate mother for me someday and she replied that she might, if she was still having children. I also hate periods. I was wondering, do the ova usually survive for very long after a hysterectomy without oophrectomy? I take Seroquel, Epival, Ativan (antipsychotic PRN) Haldol (another antipsychotic PRN), an antiemetic that I don't know the name of, and a beta blocker, which is being used to prevent the physiological conditions that make tantrums possible, that I also don't know the name of. Do prescription medications usually affect how long the ova can live after a hysterectomy without oophrectomy?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, There is no reason that the ovaries would cease functioning as a result of a hysterectomy without oophorectomy.  This is the reason the ovaries are often left intact - because they continue to function until natural menopause.  This means you continue to benefit from the hormones supplied by the ovaries.    At birth you have all the eggs you will ever have so it appears aging can be a concern with increased risk of Down Syndrome in older eggs.  When surrogacy is done, frequently donor eggs are used if the mother is older.  If you suspect it would be quite a bit later when you would be interested in this procedure, perhaps you could harvest and freeze eggs at a younger age.  There is no guarantee that this will be successful but it sometimes makes sense if it is possible financially.    Good luck with your future plans.\n\n",

After recently having some RUQ discomfort I was diagnosed by USN to have a solitary 2.7-cm gallstone.  Am having surgical consult next week.  I have been doing medical transcription for many years, including many op notes for cholcystectomies, and do not ever recall hearing of any gallstone that large!  Not sure why I ended up with one big one instead of many tiny ones like most people, but I am somewhat concerned about how its size might affect treatment.  Can I still have a lap chole, or will it have to be open because of the size, or might there be another alternative such as lithotripsy?  Thank you in advance for your input.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: MY USN SHOWS A 2.7-CM GALLSTONE",
    "content": "Hi, Gall stones come in several sizes. They can be  - solitary or  - multiple.   The multiple stones can be  - of uniform size (belong to the same generation), or  - may be of different sizes(belonging to different generations).  The multiple, small stones tend to pass down the biliary tract causing complications such as  - biliary colic, - common bile duct obstruction, - acute pancreatitis and  - cholangitis.  The larger gall bladder stones also can cause several problems including, - acute or chronic calculus cholecystitis, - they may get into the part of the gall bladder called as the  neck of the gall bladder and cause obstruction leading to an empyema of the gall bladder, - they may get lodged in the Hartmann's pouch, fistulate into the common bile duct and cause obstructive jaundice(Mirrizi's syndrome), or - large solitary gall stones, sizes ranging from 2-5 cms may enter the bowel through a cholecystoduodenal fistula and cause small gut obstruction (\"gall stone ileus\"). Sometimes, a large stone may fistulate into the stomach and cause gastric outlet obstruction (Bouveret's syndrome).  For an overview on gall stone disease please click on the following URL. http://www.doctorslounge.com/forums/vie ... all+stones  A single large stone (>2cm) in the Hartmann's pouch can cause inflammatory changes and adhesions in that area and result in increased conversion rates (conversion to open cholecystectomy). (Jansen S, Jorgensen J, Caplehorn J, et al. Preoperative ultrasound to predict conversions in laproscopic cholecystectomy. Surg Laparosc Endosc 1997;7:121-3).  Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) for gallstones may be appropriate when all of the following criteria are met: - when the procedure is performed in conjunction with bile acid therapy, and - the patient has symptomatic non-calcified solitary gallstone measuring 20 mm or less, and - the small subset of symptomatic patients for whom surgical removal of the gallbladder is contraindicated for some reason or the small subset of symptomatic, high-risk patients who actively refuse surgery.  The FDA approved use of biliary lithotripsy includes the administration of bile acid (ursodeoxycholic acid) 2 weeks prior to the procedure and continues up to 20 months after or until a stone-free state is achieved. The best results have been seen in patients with a single non-calcified gallstone measuring less than 20 mm in diameter. Patients with fragments of 3 mm or less 24 hours following lithotripsy have a higher probability of fragment disappearance than those with larger fragments.    However, cholecystectomy still represents the treatment of choice, due to the prompt resolution of symptoms in well selected patients and the absence of stone recurrence, which may recur at a rate of 10% per year in the absence of cholecystectomy.  In your case,a solitary stone of 2.7cms in itself, is not a contraindication for laparoscopic cholecystectomy, but conversion rates may be higher if it is in the Hartmann's pouch or if there have been many past episodes of acute cholecystitis. Lithotripsy may not be a suitable option based on the size. Best wishes!\n\n",

I had it looked at about 6 years ago, and the doctor said it was normal and blamed it on me growing. I am now 6'2\" but this still worries me as it is really the only spot on my body without a muscle covering it. It really feels like I could put the tips of my fingers together and push all the way into my chest.

    "content": "Hi, It is not very clear from your description whether it s a horizontal or a vertical scar. Generally a horizontal incision is preferred for the 'Ramstedt's pyloromyotomy\" procedure. It is possible that the underlying tissues have thinned out in the process of healing and with growth. As long as there is no true incisional hernia, there is no particular hurry to deal with this.But this determination should be done by a surgeon. There are a number of ways of reinforcing abdominal wall defects and you may discuss with your surgeon about the need(if any) and the various options(if needed). Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "I broke my nose about 5 years ago. At the time, since it did not hurt as much as I would assume a broken nose would hurt, I did not go to the doctor. About 2.5 years after the incident, my nose still had a bump in it which I decided to get surgically fixed. The doctor told me the swelling should be gone after 6 months, but 2.5 years after surgery, I still see some swelling. I have a small face and my nose is the same size and shape as it was before (just without the bump) so any swelling makes a pretty big difference in my appearance(in my opinion, at least). What should I do? Is there anything I can do at this point to make the swelling go away or do I just need to wait? I once heard steriod injections in the spot can help but I have no idea if this is true, and I can't really afford expensive treatments at this point.  Is this normal? I can't afford at this point to visit my plastic surgeon again (I have different insurance) unless I can get a free checkup since I am having abnormalities?  I would like to add that the swelling is not massive, nor is it very obvious to most people as far as I am aware, but it does bother me.  Any input would be greatly appreciated. I searched the internet but did not come up with any answers to this. Thanks a lot.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, In nasal trauma, the structures that are commonly injured are  - the nasal bones, and - the septal cartilage.  Untreated, or inadequately treated, both of these are capable of resulting in nasal deformities. These deformities can persist and at times, even aggravate (in children and adolescents, during the growth period).  Rhinoplasty is a very complex surgical procedure and has its own share of serious and distressing long term complications. If as you say, that the deformity is so minimal, you should give serious consideration to the prospect of leaving it alone, rather than to risk the potential complications of a re-do rhinoplasty (which is far more difficult, as the tissue planes are more than likely to be distorted).

    "title": "Re: Gall Bladder Surgery",
    "content": "Hi, Cholecystectomy is generally advised for individuals with gall bladder stones because of the risk of certain complications, which at times may even be life threatening. two major concerns. - the risk of complications (biliary colic, acute cholecystits,empyema of the gall bladder, acute pancreatitis etc) and - a risk for carcinoma of the gall bladder.  Generally, only about 10-20% of known silent stones will become symptomatic.In individuals who do become symptomatic, 15-20% will develop acute cholecystitis (independent of age). 8% will develop obstructive jaundice \u2013 this tends to rise with age.  In one follow \u2013 up study of individuals with asymptomatic gallstones at the University of Michigan, it was found that over a 20 year period, only 18% developed biliary pain and that the mean yearly probability of the development of as non\u2013lifethreatening biliary colic wa 2% during the first 5 years; 1% during the second 5 years; 0.5% during the third 5 years; 0% during the fourth 5 years. A very important observation noted in that study, was that no person ever presented a biliary complication as an initial manifestation of his biliary disease. None of these individuals died because of gall stone disease. Gracie WA, Ransohoff : The natural history is not a myth. New Eng J of Med.1982;309:78-800. Mcsherry CK, Ferstenberg , Calhoun WF , et al. The natural history of diagnosed gall stone disease in symptomatic and aysmtomatic patients. Ann Surg 1985;202;59-63.  The progression from asymptomatic to symptomatic state usually follows a step-wise pattern. Non-specific symptoms-to biliary colic- and later, complications such as acute cholecystitis. It is rare for acute cholecystitis to develop without antecedent biliary colic.  In contrast,the presence of common bile duct stones, even when incidental, warrants active intervention to remove the stones. More than 50% of patients with retained bile duct stones are likely to develop symptoms and 25% will develop serious complications.  Although gall stones are known to be associated with cancer of the gall bladder  (> 70% of patients developing gallbladder carcinoma have gallstones), the risk in patients with aysmptomatic  gall stones is  < 0.01%\u2014less than the mortality associated with Cholecystectomy. Calculations show that at least 100 cholecystectomies need to be done to prevent one death from gallbladder carcinoma. The conclusions drawn from several studies indicates that prophylactic cholecystectomy for asymptomatic gallstones can not be recommended for this reason.  However, the American Indian women and the Chilean Hispanic and Indian population with gallstones represent the only exceptions to this recommendation. Because of the early onset of gallstones in that population, there is an increased risk of gallbladder cancer and therefore, prophylactic cholecystectomy appears to be justified.  Prophylactic cholecystectomy appears to be justified in certain situations such as, -  Patients with porcelain gall bladder (a rare occurrence of a calcified gall bladder wall, which has an associated risk of gall bladder carcinoma in 13\u201322% of patients), - certain populations(as already alluded to), - individuals residing far from urgent medical help, - patients with sickle cell disease(early onset of gall stone disease, difficulties in distinguishing vaso-occlusive crisis and biliary symptoms), - other hemolytic anemias, - immune suppression( e.g. post- organ transplantation).  You indicate that you will be moving to a country where you may be far from expert medical help. Depending on the length of  planned stay there, depending on the presence or absence of aforementioned factors, and in consultation with your surgeon, you must take the final decision. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, As you have not mentioned the exact site of the abscess, i will assume it to be a 'perianal' abscess(an anorectal abscess, to be more precise). Usually, following drainage, the abscess cavity is packed. The protocol for removal of the pack following surgery varies between surgeons.  Exercising may not be advisable at this stage without an express approval from your surgeon.There are certain problems that can arise from exercising. Exercises involving squatting may stretch the wound and can cause it to bleed.This may also displace the pack. Moreover, any strenuous exercise that would result in profuse sweating may result in the sweat tracking down between the buttocks onto the pack or the wound itself, causing infection.  Therefore, either you should get in touch with your surgeon and clarify this aspect or put off the exercising until after your next appointment. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: sclerotherapy for internal Piles worsened my external ones.",
    "content": "Hi, As your internal pile masses were injected recently, swelling of the external ones is not unusual. The sclerosing agent causes a chemical inflammation which induces fibrosis and eventual occlusion of the internal pile masses.The sclerosant injection, by causing local lymphatic blockade,may temporarily aggravate the exteranal pile masses.  It is advisable(as you are symptomatic),not to sit for too long. It will help you to elevate the foot end of your bed and lie down most of the time for a couple of days. This will aid lymphatic drainage and reduce the local edema(and pain). Sitz baths also help. Avoid straining. I am sure, your doctor might have advised you already abut these aspects. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Severe RUQ Pain Post Lap Chole",
    "content": "I had my gallbladder removed 3 weeks ago due to gallstones. There was no inflammation found but since I was symptomatic, my doctor decided that my gallbladder needed to come out. Three days post surgery, I was in the ER. I had horrible pain despite taking 1-2 Darvocet every 4 hours and I was not able to have a bowel movement. I still have a lot of trouble with bowel movements and have to take a lot of laxatives. People told me I would have diarrhea after I ate but I don't have that problem. In fact, I don't really eat much. In spite of that, I am gaining weight. I have almost constant pain in my RUQ, similar to before my gallbladder was removed and it gets worse of exertion or bending. I went from running 2 miles everyday to barely feeling like leaving bed. I am nauseated a lot as well. My doctor did tests (a double contrast CT scan and a blood test for liver function) but I won't know anything until tomorrow. The lady that did my CT said that the doctor ordered an abnormally high amount of radiation for me.. an amount normally used to diagnose cancer. My surgeon is mum.. he barely says anything about what he is doing, why, or what he is looking for. I ask and I get condescending looks. Unfortunately, I cannot change doctors because he is the only one my insurance company participates with. I also have constant heartburn. The surgeon said the heartburn and bowel movements have nothing to do with the surgery but I did not have problems with either prior to surgery. Right now, I am in so much pain that I just want to cry. I pray to have my gallbladder back everyday, as ridiculous as it sounds. I feel like I can't go back to work because my jobs are physical (one job I clean, the other I am an emergency medical technician). The surgeon wants to send me back to work tomorrow. What am I going to do? Why do I hurt? What can I do to make him listen? If nothing else, does anyone do gallbladder transplants (ha ha ha)? I want my life back. Oh, and my hair is also now really dry and stringy... has been since surgery and my nails are brittle now as well. I'm only 26.. this was supposed to be an easy surgery and I was supposed to be back to work after a week.\n\n",

The pain is being managed (now about 12 hours later) with morphine, lortab, ativan, zofran and ibuprofen, but episodes of pain still occur every few hours (last one was 2 hours after morphine administered).

    "title": "Re: What can I expect after peripheral endarterectomy?",
    "content": "Hi, You have not indicated which artery was operated upon. Even the carotid endarterectomy comes under peripheral endarterectomies.  Peripheral endarterectomy will be typically done under general anesthesia. The surgery is generally an open surgical procedure. Following a routine peripheral endarterectomy(mostly in the thigh), the total hospital stay may be two to three days. You allege that you came home the very next day. Are you certain it was an  endarterectomy or was it perhaps, an angioplasty +/- stenting?  Post operative surgical site infection (SSI) to manifest within 2 days is rather unusual. Typically, evidence of local infection manifests around the fourth or fifth day following a surgical procedure.But a local hematoma is capable of causing your symptoms.  In the absence of relevant information, i can only urge you to immediately get it touch with your surgeon rather than to speculate. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Plastic and cosmetic surgeries didn't become common until the 20th century. In the 19th century the first cleft palate was repaired in the United States by a surgeon who designed his own tools, but the first plastic surgeries were developed around World War I due to numerous casualties having damage done that altered their way of living and had permanently disfigured them. The greatest discovery from this plastic surgery was the flap surgery techniques. Flap surgery involves moving sections of tissue from one area of the body, usually the side of the back, to other parts of tehbody while keeping the tissues blood flow in tact. This allows for greater success in repairing and rebuilding the body after injury.Read more...\n\n",

    "title": "Re: puffy nipples",
    "content": "Hi,  \"Puffy Nipple Areola Complex\" is one of the the most common subtypes of gynecomastia. This apperance can occur in females as well. The glandular and/or adipose tissue accumulation (in varying proportions), is chiefly located under the nipple-areola complex or can slightly be extended outside the perimeter of the areola, resulting in a dome shaped appearance to this part of the breast.This form of Gynecomastia has been observed in all age groups but is more common in young adults.It is frequently bilateral.  It is benign and needs correction chiefly for aesthetic reasons. Correction may involve, - surgical excision, - liposuction or - a combination of both of these.  Goals of treatment are, - to achieve the optimal reduction in the size of the  nipple-areola complex, and  - to achieve bilateral symmetry.  Although these goals are likely to be best achieved by surgeons experienced in this type of procedure, final results(especially symmetry) may vary from case to case based on various factors.

    "title": "Re: AV Malformation",
    "content": "Hello Mohit12345,  An AV Malformation (AVM) is an abnormal connection between veins and arteries.  It is usually a congenital (present at birth) condition, but is not usually genetic, or inherited.  AVMs can appear at any location in the body, but the most common is within the central nervous system, particularly in the brain.  Approximately 300,000 Americans have AVMs.  Depending on location and size, some are more serious than others, but most are problematic to some degree.  Arteries and veins are parts of the cardiovascular system in the body.  Except for the pulmonary artery, which carries unoxygenated blood to the lungs, arteries carry oxygenated blood from the heart to the body's cells, and veins carry unoxygenated blood back to the heart.  Arteries subdivide again and again, becoming smaller and smaller, until they form what is known as a capillary bed.  Arterial blood enters the capillary bed, where oxygen is delivered from the blood to the cells, and Carbon Dioxide (CO2) and cellular wastes are deposited back into the blood, which then exits the capillary bed into veins, which combine and become larger and larger, until it reaches the heart.  An AVM lacks the effects of the capillaries and the surrounding area is deprived of effective delivery of nutrients to the cells and effective removal of CO2 and wastes away from the cells.  There is a tangle of blood vessels instead, which is fragile and bleeds easily.  In some cases, there are no symptoms until the AVM ruptures and hemorrhages.  Treatment of AVMs can consist of simply addressing symptoms, as with pain or other medications, surgical intervention, or radiation therapy.  In small AVMs, sometimes embolization, or cutting off the blood supply to the tangle of blood vessels via a radiographically-guided catheter, is the treatment of choice.  Embolization is often unsuccessful in larger AVMs.  A radiation procedure, called the Gamma Knife procedure, does not involve scalpels but a beam of radiation.  The beam damages the AVM vessels, which forms scar tissue.  Blood can no longer flow through the tangled vessels, and the body forms collateral circulatory vessels to the area.  In smaller AVMs, some researchers contend that the best approach is to accept the risk of damage resulting from the AVM itself should it rupture.  However, bleeding from an AVM can have devastating consequences, particularly in cerebral and renal AVMs.  Potential complications depend on the size of the AVM and its location.  Complications of surgery can be nerve or tissue damage, or formation of blood clots, though complications are not frequent.  Complications of the Gamma Knife radiation approach are uncommon, and would consist of more extensive radiation damage than planned.  This approach generally requires a one-night hospital stay.  The success rate of surgical intervention is good, and with radiation is high.  However, it really does depend on the size and location of the AVM whether surgery or radiation is the better choice; your doctor can help you decide on the best surgical intervention for your AVM.    There is an internet support organization, called AVM Survivors, which can give you personal experiences with AVM.  Most of them  have had cerebral, renal or spinal AVMs, but their information may be helpful to you.  The website is at AVMSurvivors.org.  I hope this information helps you in making your decision.  Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello everyone, my name is Keith.  I recently had 4 lipoma removed; two from my arm and two on my leg.  The fourth and final cut is not healing well as it was located behind my right knee (near the surface and just above the joint on the thigh).  It has been 5 days and what I originally assumed was anaesthetic I now believe to be nerve damage for I have a fair bit of numbness throughout the top section of my calf.  All in all, I believe the scars are healing well, except the one behind my knee which is healing slower.  But to make matters worse, and the real reason I'm here, I also experience severe pulling in the popliteal region when I try to extend my leg beyond 95%.  I can't walk without a severe limp which puts pressure on my knee and ankle.  I can move my ankle and toes just fine, though.  I should also mention that I'm suffering from effusion in each knee (from months ago) and it's only making matters worse.  Can someone tell me what I'm going through and how I recover from this?  The nerve damage doesn't bother me so much anymore...  (Oh, and the doctor told me nothing.  The surgery itself is a whole other story.  But after stitching me up and freezing my leg he allowed me to walk out and drive home..)\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Problems after lipoma extraction",
    "content": "Hi, It is not very clear from your account whether the lipoma which was removed from the back of the knee was a subcutaneous lipoma or a deep seated lipoma(intramuscular or within the popliteal fossa).  The skin behind the knee and the skin overlying the calf are supplied by - posterior cutaneous nerve of thigh(mid part), - saphenous nerve(inner aspect), and - lateral cutaneous nerve of leg(outer aspect).  Cutaneous nerves and their smaller branches are not generally visible in the course of surgical procedures.In the back of the thigh and popliteal fossa, these are all vertically oriented. Thus, although vertical incisions over the back of the thigh or the popliteal fossa have the advantage of sparing these nerves but, they have the chief disadvantage of causing scar contractures which may adversely affect movement of the knee joint.This is the reason why vertical (longitudinal) incisions across joints are discouraged.  Many a times the cutaneous nerves happen to get affected adversely by traction maneuvers in the course of surgical procedures(neurapraxia) rather than actually being severed.These deficits are temporary and recover with time.Small areas of sensory deficit tend to get covered by neighboring dermatomes.  Hopefully, your symptoms should get better soon. As for the restriction of joint movement , it should get better once the incision heals well and pain goes away.A bit of physio may be useful.\n\n",

But you ought to consult with a physician to make sure the ligaments in the ankle are not torn and the ankle joint itself is stable.  Although most of the neurovasculature to the foot is located on the other side (medial side of the ankle/foot), it is still important to monitor for good circulation and light touch sensation in the foot.  If either of these or excessive swelling (which can lead to compartment syndrome) develop, you will need to have a physician re-evaluate the foot/ankle.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "I was diagnosed with a right inguinal hernia this past october. We decided to have it repaired laparoscopically. I thought everything was going great with my recovery until now, 7-8 months later, I am experiencing pain where the uppermost internal staple has been placed (right below my belt line off center a couple of inches to the right) for the mesh I assume. I can feel the staple from the outside. The pain seems to happen when I wear pants that have any weight to them (jeans with phone and wallet) or tightness around the belt line. I especially feel the pain while I am walking or flexing in certain positions. I am a skinny young man who can't stand when his pants are sagging, so I keep my belt relatively snug. Is this something that will go away? Should I revisit my surgeon? Should I attempt more ab exercisises to build the muscle around it? I am about to head off to college, and I do not particularly want this nagging pain.   Thanks, Braden\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Laparoscopic Hernia Repair",
    "content": "HI, I would prefer not to get into the get into the ongoing debates on \"to fix or not to fix a mesh\".  Mesh fixation in laparoscopic hernia repairs typically involves the use of tacks(mesh fixation devices), transabdominal sutures(transfascial sutures/transparietal sutures), or both of these.   Modern meshes get sufficiently (sufficient enough not to get displaced) incorporated into the body in approximately 2 weeks following insertion. This occurs by in growth of fibroblasts into the pores present in these mashes and subsequent laying down of collagen.In course of time, the meshes undergo a small degree of contraction(shrinkage).Some form of fixation is thought to be necessary during the first 2 weeks at least to prevent mesh from getting displaced.Generally. the sutures are inserted 2-3 cm apart and tacks are typically placed less than 1 to 2 cm apart.  Anecdotally, pain is generally believed to be worse after repair with sutures than with tacks causing reluctance among some surgeons to use multiple trans-parietal sutures. Sutures penetrate through the full thickness of abdominal wall musculature and fascia and this have a potential to cause muscular ischaemia or entrapment neuropathy. .  Whether tacks afford  a reliable anchorage to the mesh(in comparison to sutures) is another aspect which is debated. Tacks are usually 4 or 5 mm long. A 4 mm-long tack would be expected to penetrate only 2 mm into the abdominal wall. In obese patients, the tack may only penetrate up to the extra-peritoneal fat without significant purchase into the muscle layer. At least one experimental study has demonstrated that the tensile strength of trans-parietal sutures is up to 2.5 times greater than that of tacks.These are some of the reasons why some surgeons prefer to use both sutures and tacks during a hernia repair.  Several studies which have compared use of sutures and tacks have found no significant differences between them as far as the post operative pain is concerned.   Newer modifications(among other benefits,to reduce the incidence of post operative pain) include, - use of delayed-absorbable suture-material, such as PDS, - use of absorbable tacks.  Most authors recommend the use of oral anti-inflammatory medications or injections of a local anesthetic to alleviate the symptoms in the majority of cases. Also, there are reports of  re-explorations for persistent pain, demonstrating prompt relief after the release of an offending suture ot tack from the site of pain.  The pain attributable to the sutures or tacks usually starts soon after surgery. In your case, it has taken 7-8 months since the procedure, which is rather unusual.Tacks have been reported to migrate within the peritoneal cavity but i am not aware of any reports of migration outwards through the abdominal wall.  In your case,certain details should be ascertained before any conclusions are drawn or management is planned. - was the mesh fixed or not fixed?, - whether tacks, sutures or both had been used, - whether newer techniques such as use of absorbable tacks, absorbable sutures or fibrin glue fixation had been used. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "I was circumcised at birth, but they used absorb-able sutures. Well, i guess they didnt absorb fast enough because i was left with stitch tunnels. At 15, i had surgery to have them removed. This left me with ugly scars around where my circumcision line should have been.   Just recently, at 18, i had a revision. It is now 1 month later, and all the scabs have fallen off. However, the scar is indented in from the rest of the skin, and has created what looks like a bump pattern along the scars that has been caused by the stitches. it has lines where the stitches was, so the tissue in between the stitch lines is slightly more elevated. The scar is also unsightly and currently looks worse than it did before the revision.  Has it just been too soon? Should I be putting anything on it? What kind of results can I expect, and when can I expect my healing to take a better turn? Will this smooth out or look better?   Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, In areas of the body, where the skin is very thin(such as the penile skin) and in certain other individual circumstances, there may be need for \"everting\" sutures to overcome the tendency of the skin to \"invert' (and thereby delay healing). For achieving this, one preferred suturing technique is a \"mattress\" suture. This technique of suturing often gives an appearance of a 'bumpy' suture line and this appearance fades away in due course as scar modulation takes place. I expect you scar will also (in all likelihood) behave this way and get well given time. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: fistula repair",
    "content": "Hello, The details of the surgery depend upon the type of fistula but basically the surgeon will close the opening with sutures, sometimes using a skin flap \"patch\".  This can be done laparascopically, abdominally, or through the vagina.  There are always risks with surgery of any kind but this should heal well without complications in most cases.  The time for healing will also vary with the individual and the procedure used.  Usually an abdominal surgery requires a longer healing time with the muscle repair and six weeks is considered a normal recovery period, though you could feel fine much sooner.    Your body may repair itself faster or slower so it is hard to predict recovery time.  Some people may also feel lingering pain of some kind - often due to scar tissue formation but there is no way to determine this in advance.  The benefits of the procedure definitely outweigh the risks inherent in surgical procedures.  Risks include the procedure not working, a new fistula could develop later, potential injury to other organs in the vicinity, and possible vaginal shortening (usually not a serious concern).  Good luck with the procedure and recovery.  I'm sure it will help your quality of life immensely.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Will I need surgery on my umbilical hernia?",
    "content": "Hi, 'True' umbilical hernias are common in children. However, they may occur in adults infrequently (usually in association with conditions causing increased intra-abdominal pressure such as, massive ascitis, obesity, pregnancy, intra-abdominal tumors etc).Some untreated congenital umbilical hernias may go on into adulthood.  More common in adults are the 'Para-umbilical hernias', which protrude from a defect in the linea alba close to the umbilicus (usually above the umbilicus).  They usually contain the greater omentum(omentocele). However, sometimes, they may contain the transverse colon or small gut. Frequently, they are multiloculated. Many of them are only partially reducible.These are very prone to get 'complicated' (incarceration, obstruction and strangulation).  Any evidence of redness, tenderness or tenseness should alert one to the possibility of strangulation and should lead to an emergency consultation with a surgeon. Redness may indicate a srangulation or an infection in a strangulated hernia. Strangulated omentoceles can go on to form abscesses.  In your instance, there are two possible scenarios: - a congenital umbilical hernia (which was too small and thus overlooked), which got aggravated by pregnancy, or  - this is a para-umbilical hernia which got aggravated by pregnancy.   Ideally.you must consult a surgeon to confirm the nature of this hernia. If it happens to be a para-umbilical hernia, it should be operated upon at the earliest convenience. On the other hand, if it turns out to be a congenital umbilical hernia, there is a likelihood that it may enlarge with future pregnancies or even otherwise. Abdominal training also increases intra-abdominal pressure and can worsen it. However, it's management does not have the same level of urgency that is attached to the para-umbilical hernias.

    "content": "I had a planned Cholecystectomy on 7/7/10 , i have had no complications and generally feel good.I am curious about the clips left in after the surgery.How long does it take scar tissue to form over these clips and if no tissue does, how long does it take for the bile duct to deal itself?I am nervous that a clip is going to migrate or slip off and i will have a leak, the surgeon did not explain if the bile duct seals itself off after awhile.  My second question is weather or not the cystic artery was cauterized, i have a clip on the artery as well but what would happen if that clip came loose, would i have significant bleeding inside?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: When can i stop worrying about a bile leak after surgery",
    "content": "Hi, When exactly the scar tissue will form deep inside the body cavities in relation to structures that have been traumatized is difficult to answer as it may depend on a number of variables.  But, i will try to provide you with some information about the clips that are routinely used nowadays during laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedures.  Clips in common use can be - non-absorbable(titanium) or - absorbable(biodegradable polydioxanone-PDS).  Clips may also be, - simple clips(non-locking), or - the newer 'locking' absorbable clips  Clip applicators can be - single clip delivering applicators or - the newer multiple fire clip applicators.  The advantage of the multiple fire clip applicators is mainly that multiple clips may be applied one after the other without multiple instrument changes.Whereas, for the single clip delivering applicators, following one clip application, the applicator needs to be brought out of the abdomen, re-loaded and re-inserted(often multiple times).This has the potential for causing unintended trauma(including to the bile duct or cystic duct).   Cystic duct leak is an infrequent but potentially serious complication of open or laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Several studies indicate that incidence of cystic duct leak using simple clips is approximately 0.11\u20132%. Locking clips are reported to be a safe and effective means for cystic duct closure. The incidence of bile leaks associated with simple metallic clips appears to be about five times greater than those associated with locking absorbable clips.  Factors that may increase the risk of clip slippage are, - selection of incorrect size of clip for the vessel or cystic duct   (selected clip too small), - failure of clip to project beyond the whole width of the         vessel or duct, - clip that is not applied at right angles to the vessel or duct, - clip includes fat or adventitial tissue around the vessel, - clip subjected to undue traction.  The correctly applied clips generally are said to offer a pressure between 450 and 700 mbar. Clips with pressure less than 100 mbar are not tight enough and may slip off.  Post-cholecystectomy clip migration (PCCM): is rare and can lead to complications which include clip-related biliary stones.  It is suggested that metallic clips can migrate from their initial location at various intervals within the peritoneal cavity or into the common duct and serve as a nidus for biliary stone formation. Metallic clip migration in most cases is due to technical factors and can usually be prevented. However, it is not always possible to prevent clip migration in every case, since even well applied clips are known to migrate due to local ischemic damage or local suppuration.  You are well past the risk of a reactionary hemorrhage. As the surgery seems to have been uneventful, hopefully you should do well. In any individual who undergoes biliary surgery, occurrence of late biliary complications and the risks such as  clip migration can not be predicted.I hope this information is helpful. Good luck!\n\n",

Am able to walk and even sit without much of a pain  But i have few doubts ,if anyone can clarify i would be glad  now I cant see any piles coming out as was the case before the surgery ,but have some flesh (or) skin (or) some thread like thing around the anal part . IS IT NORMAL  1) While i walk there is no real pain but a sense of uncomfort and i feel some sort of  wound around that ANAL part, and even while i cough or sneeze that generates some pain.  2) Bleeding while bowel moments ,not regularly though.  3) A sense of itch thrugh out the day, really bothers me . Is it normal even after so many days of operation. \"BACILAC(20 days)\" thats the only tablet am still continuing with, which was prescribed to me after the review (Review was done 10 days after the surgery with proctoscope)  3) am still continuing with the sitzz bath ,and till how many days i have to do that.  4) Can i go for Non-veg food and as of now i am driving a Two-wheeler,will that do any harm   If the above cases are all normal how many days more does it generallly take for it to get absoluetly normal  I hope someone has the patience to answer these Questions.

    "content": "Most patients are satisfied with the results of the surgery and recover without any problems. Complications associated with hemorrhoidectomy are rare and include:      * Anal fistula or fissure     * Constipation     * Excessive bleeding     * Excessive discharge of fluid from the rectum     * Fever of 101\u00b0F or higher     * Inability to urinate or have a bowel movement     * Severe pain, especially when having a bowel movement     * Severe redness and/or swelling in the rectal area     * Side effects of anesthesia (e.g., spinal headache)   The surgeon should be notified if any of these symptoms are experienced during the immediate postoperative period. The stringy tissue could be small amounts of packing(guaze) left over which is nothing to worry about. Without knowing what type of hemmorrhoidectomy you had, stapled, banded, internal or external. In a stapled procedure the surgeon uses tissue further in the anus to close the wound, you may be seeing this tissue. The fact that you are itching means you are healing. Complete recovery takes 6-8 weeks. Make sure you are taking stool softeners so you don't strain during a bowel movement also make sure you don't do any heavy lifting as this may put extra strain on the surgical site. Follow your discharge instructions and if any of the above symptoms appear contact your surgeon  Good luck,  Paul\n\n",

Stools are smooth enough and i cant c any bleeding during that.  However two things that are bothering me are   1) After the stools when i sprinkle water it burns. Just as it happens when water is sprinkled on a open wound.  2) Outside the rectum part and little above it , there is some pain which doesnt allow me to sit for long time.This is happening on a  'boney\" part .  I tried to contact my surgeon but he is out of station. and am really worried abt visiting another surgeon.  So any idea why this could be happening, is this because the operated place is opened up again or wat could be the cause?  will wait for ur reply, thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, The fact that you are experiencing a burning sensation somewhere just behind the anus, especially while washing that area indicates that the skin in that area is perhaps raw.  First condition to be excluded is an intertrigo(an inflammation of the body folds). The natal cleft is one such area. This area is prone to getting moist and an element of friction in this area is unavoidable(especially while sitting, during subtle changes of posture during prolonged sitting or while walking. As this area can collect moisture, and coupled with a lack of adequate ventilation, superadded infections(bacterial/candidial) may occur.  Due to the proximity to the anus and genitals, feces, urine, and vaginal discharges may gain access to this area and worsen the situation.Obesity is a major predisposing factor, apart from diabetes mellitus, hot, humid environments, hyperhidrsis, incontinence(urinary/fecal), and decreased immunity.  The other conditions that merit consideration are - an inflammed pilonidal cyst, - an early perianal suppuration,and - a boil/furuncle.  It is unlikely to be related to your previous surgery.  I feel that you should show to your regular family doctor first who will be able treat some of these conditions and be able to refer you to a surgeon if necessary. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Loss of ejaculate after laparoscopic bilateral inguinal surg",
    "content": "Hi,  Several types of sexual dysfunctions have been reported infrequently following inguinal hernia repairs(both the traditional \"open\" as well as the laparoscopic repairs).  One study indicated erectile dysfunction in just over 1%, pain related erections in 2% and shooting pains during ejaculation (dysejaculation) in 1.5% of cases. Overall sexual activity was allegedly affected in 4% of patients. As many hernia patients are younger men this is a particularly problematic situation following hernia surgery. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/article ... 846/?page=  The cause of the painful ejaculation is not clear. Also, reduced quantity of the ejaculate is difficult to explain- even in bilateral repairs( by an injury or entrapment of the vasa deferentia), as the major part of the total seminal volume is made up of the seminal vesicular and prostatic secretions which are not transported via the vasa [approximately, seminal vesicles (65% by volume) and prostate (35% by volume) and 5% via the vasa].   Apart from the aforesaid complications, ischemic orchitis can arise if the blood vessels which travel within the spermatic cord are injured. This results in a painful testicle on the side of the hernia repair. Eventually the testicle may shrink in size and become nonfunctional. Fertility is generally not affected in unilateral involvement, as the remaining testicle compensates for the loss of the other.  As the other causes for male sexual dysfunctions among men in the general population are very much more common than post-hernia repair related ones, to attribute the surgical procedure as the definite cause becomes immensely difficult.  As you have no pain associated with ejaculation, this could well be a temporary setback and should recover soon. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello after reading all the articles concerning about lumps on the neck i have been extremely worried it. I am 18 years old and found more than 1 lump on the neck area. i found the first one when i was taking a shower one day, it was at the back of my neck on the bottom where my hairline is. i didnt think of it that much until i found others in the same area. There are 5 lumps in total, three of them are hard and the rest are soft to the touch. two of them are behind my left ear, one is on the left side of my neck, one is at the centre of my head at the back and the last is the first one ive found first which is at the bottom where my hairline is. As days gone by two of the hards ones seem to hurt by touch. when feeling it it feels delicate to touch because of the pain. the hard lumps are behind my ear and at the back of my head where my hairline is. Ive been getting these throbbing pains at the back too, it seems to come and go and im worried due to this other symptom...Not only do the lumps hurt but the back of my head does too when i put pressure on it, my sister could feel and see vague bumps aswell at the back and left side of my head.   i went to my gp and my doctor gave me tablets which are called flucloxacillin caps, ive been taking them 4 times a day for a couple of days now but still no result. Also took a blood test but will get my results in two weeks. i cant really wait that long for my results, paranoya is getting to me and its putting me down too. please help.  thanks! CHRISTIAN\n\n",

And, since then, everyone's been telling me not to worry about the ominous lumps I have on the back of my neck. \"They're small,\" they say.  \"And they've been there for so long w/ no visible change occuring...so don't worry\". Yet, I still worry.  I can't help it; I'm a hypochondriac.  But w/ college/scholarship apps...I just don't have time to act upon my worry.    I just wanted you to know that you're not alone.  Hopefully, our doctors and family members are right and we don't have anything to worry about. I really hope that's the case.  Please keep me posted on your situation...let me know what your doctor says.  And maybe someone else, someone who can offer us some more information on our infamous lumps, will post soon.  Your fellow worrier, Lily  P.S. sorry for not being of any \"real\" help.  But, in case you didn't know, I've heard a number of times that if the lumps don't change in size, shape, color, etc., the problem really isn't as immediate as you're probably making it seem. In other words, if you do have anything malignant, it's slow-growing and waiting a couple of weeks for your doctor's response won't make your situation any worse.  Yet, after saying all this, I can understand how difficult it is to wait...waiting really is worse than knowing.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi christian, Yourself as well as others have been rightly concerned about lumps in the back of the neck, mostly in an area just below the hairline. Based on the description, i would venture to say that the lumps are probably not lymph nodes, as there are no known lymph nodes in that area. That is an area prone to excessive sweating (esp if some of you happen to be living in the tropics or subtropics) and therfore more prone to skin infections such as furuncles. Also,the nape of the neck is an area where sebaceous cysts are fairly commonly found (and these get inflammed often).This can in turn lead to enlargement of lymph nodes in the neck. But if lymph nodes in the neck persist despite antibiotic therapy, they need to be investigated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, It is not very clear from your account, the duration of the parotid swelling that your mother has. The FNAC report indicates a pleomorphic adenoma.  Pleomorphic adenomas of the parotid gland: 80% of parotid tumors are benign, of which 80% are pleomorphic adenomas, and 80% arise from the superficial lobe of the parotid.  Although it is classified as a benign tumor, pleomorphic adenomas have the capacity to grow to large proportions and may undergo malignant transformation to what is known as Carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma. This risk increases with the duration.  In pleomorphic adenomas, delays in presentation often occur due to - lack of pain or other symptoms, and - apparent slow growth.  The reality is such that the longer surgery is delayed, risk of a malignant(cancerous) change increases. There is no alternative treatment option available presently. Therefore, i urge you to heed to the advise of your surgeon and persuade her to undergo surgery at the earliest convenience. Good luck!\n\n",

Infection causing the swelling is less likely so early ( 48 hours post surgery). Bruising + swelling so early, could indicate bleeding- perhaps controlled on its own(tamponade).

If the cholecystectomy had been a planned ('elective') procedure, had been 'straightforward', no other procedure had been performed concurrently, you don't have any associated co-morbidities, and the port incisions (as determined by your surgeon) are healing satisfactorily, early routine sexual activity should not generally cause any significant harm if performed in such a way as not to cause undue increases in the intra-abdominal pressures and if precautions are taken to avoid direct pressure on the incisions or to disturb the incisions in any way.  The decision regarding this is best left to your surgeon. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: At what stage can a hernia burst?",
    "content": "Hi,  Although very rare, spontaneous ruptures of incisional hernias have been reported.  Factors which are thought to contribute to the rupture of a hernia are - thin atrophic skin,   - constant friction caused by the patient's clothing or an abdominal support(if being used),and - lack of any adhesions between bowel and sac, allowing the bowel to act as a hammer-head upon the skin.  Progressive thinning of the overlying skin and associated capillary thrombosis may result in formation of a dystrophic ulcer at the summit of the bulge and eventually the ulcerated area may give way following any event which acutely increases the intrabdominal pressure like coughing or lifting a heavy weight.  Excessively thin overlying skin is mentioned as an indication for surgical repair.If ulceration has already occurred, it will have to be treated prior to the hernia repair.  There have been Isolated reports of spontaneous ruptures during pregnancy.    Evisceration of bowel or omentum is an indication for  emergency surgery and this may or may not be combined with an attempt at definitive hernia repair. If the bowel can be reduced easily and the defect readily closed, it has been recommended that primary repair may be carried out, but if strangulation necessitates  bowel resection, then primary repair will be hazardous.  If your hernia shows features of thin atrophic skin (even in some areas) or ulcerations, it is better to plan for early repair.It will be best to consult a surgeon who will be able to decide on the management based on the prevailing clinical findings.

    "title": "Re: Orbital Rim Contouring Questions",
    "content": "Hi, Compete transformation of a male to female involves among others, - hormonal treatment and - sex reassignment surgery (SRS).   The number of individuals seeking Facial feminization surgery (FFS) has steadily increased over the years. A vast majority of them are  transsexual women.This is so because, a womanly facial appearance is highly important to help them integrate socially as women. Some non-transsexual women who feel that their faces are too masculine also opt for FFS.   A male skull has a prominent fullness over the brow bone known as 'brow bossing' or a 'supraorbital prominence'.A female forehead lacks this and their foreheads are smoothly rounded. These two features have to be addressed in most individuals undergoing FFS.  As with any other surgery there are a number of risks common to any type of surgery under an anesthetic.I will not discuss them here.  There are some 'specific'  complications related to this form of surgery which include, - Numbness: to varying extents may occur. This may render the person unaware of saliva or food on the face and cause social embarrassment. Also, the affected is at increased risk from potentially damaging hot or cold things.  - Visual changes: Some clients report visual problems due to tightened tissue and swelling in the vicinity of the orbits. Those who have diplopia(double vision) or distortion in one or both eyes which usually  resolve in course of time. In severe cases, one may require a temporary eye patch and rarely, even surgical correction. Potential for blindness exists,but is fortunately extremely rare.  - Pain: permanent pain in some areas arising from a severed nerve may occur.   - Hyperasthesias:  (increased skin senstivity) may occur.  - Scarring (variable), keloids( racial predilection).   The worst possible outcome from a plastic/reconstrutive surgical viewpoint is unsatisfactory cosmesis.  This includes,  - too much or too little change, - Sometimes changes following surgery make the face appear disproportionate, as they throw off the balance of one's facial features. This can make it look like \"you had work done\"!, and  - Facial asymmetry.  Before contemplating this form of surgery, one should seriously weigh the potential gains against the complications enumerated above. Best wishes!\n\n",

You should be healed, but be sure to take it slowly and make sure you have lots of lubrication handy.  Unless you have other complications, your repaired tear should not interfere.

    "content": "Hi,  As you have not mentioned about it, i take it that fortunately, there are no problems with continence of feces although, you feel that the anal opening looks elongated 'anteroposteriorly'.  As the actual details of the surgical procedure are not available, it is difficult to guess how or why this appearance of the anal opening came about.  Any further procedure done to correct this stands the risk of potential damage to the sphincters and consequent problems with continence.  The anal canal is normally described in the text books of anatomy as an \"anteroposterior slit in the skin\"(appears as a 'vertical' slit in the lithotomy or the jack-knife positions).  It is possible that the normal anteroposterior slit appears to you longer or more exaggerated following the surgery.  Following most anal surgical procedures, the anal opening  almost certainly looks a bit different that how it used to be prior to the surgery.Most patients undergoing these surgical procedures rarely if ever know how their anal opening looked like before surgery or thereafter.  Colo-rectal surgeons specialize in in surgery involving the ano- rectum and colon. Who among them has experience in this kind of plastic surgery in your place of residence, i am not aware of.   I feel that one must seriously weigh the small benefit(if any) of  another surgical procedure, with the very real prospect of life- long misery of fecal incontinence. Good luck!\n\n",

The next day, I was able to remove a rather large sliver.  5 days later, I knew there was more in there so I went to a Nurse Practitioner and she removed several very small pieces.  3 days later, it was very sensitive to the touch in a specific area so I went to an Urgent Care.  The Physician Assistant found something but wasn't able to remove it with the tools he had so he referred me to a General Surgeon.  He looked at it today in his office and after poking around on it for a while basically said there is nothing we can do about it and that he wasn't even sure if there was anything in there.  I am certain there is as he did say he felt something hard at times and the fact that the PA and I saw it the day before.  I know have stitches and a very painful thumb that still has glass in it.  I am beyond frustrated at this situation.  Please advise as to where to go next.  I can't leave it in there; it is very much interfering with my daily activities (ie taking care of my kids, work, eating, etc)!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Firstly, i would like to refer you to the following link where i had addressed a a similar query. (http://www.doctorslounge.com/forums/vie ... under+nail).  In your case, as the exploration has been done fairly recently, nothing useful may be gained by re-exploring in a hurry(most surgeons may concur with this view). It is better to wait for the wound to heal fully before re-exploration is considered.If after full healing of the incision, your pain completely disappears(it is probable), nothing further may be needed.  For the time being, you should keep the limb elevated (to reduce pain and swelling) and follow medications as prescribed by your surgeon. Good luck!\n\n",

The stitches will be removed next Wednesday... but I have plans to go to Six Flags tomorrow (Saturday). Since roller coasters don't involve arm movement and what not, I don't THINK riding on them will be an issue as far as the healing process goes for my stitches, but I wanted to check to make sure, especially since Six Flags has some intense roller coasters.  Will my stitched wound still heal properly if I go on a bunch of roller coasters tomorrow?  Thanks in advance!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Although you seem to be too confidant that no arm movement occurs during a roller-coaster ride, you may not be entirely right.Some arm movements can potentially occur(consciously or unconsciously). Also, sudden grasping of the restraints may occur, resulting in bulging of the muscles, thereby increasing the girth of the limb and straining the suture line adversely. Another factor is the arm movements of the person next to you(on whose movements you may not have any control!).   I would tend to dissuade you from undertaking the ride till the sutures are out. For the present, you may undertake the ride at your own risk only. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Is it possible for an Inguinal Hernia to reappear?",
    "content": "Hi, Recurrence is perhaps,the most common long-term complication of inguinal hernia repair.   Recurrence following inguinal hernial repairs is related to many factors, some of which are...  - Inadequate preoperative preparation of  patient, - Type of hernia, - Size of the hernia, - quality of the abdominal wall,   - Type of operation, &  - Postoperative wound infection.  Reported reccurrence rates vary widely. These variations are primarily related to the period of post-operative follow up. Approximately 50% of recurrences presentat least five years after the repairs. An additional 20% of recurrences may present much later (15 to 25 years). A fair number of reports tend to be published after 3-5 years of follow-up. Based on such reports, the indications are that following the modern \"Open\", \"Tension-Free\" mesh repairs, the recurrence rates for inguinal hernias is 0.1 to 0.3% (certainly less than 1%), compared to the 'Tension' repairs of the past (ex, Bassini's repair: 15-20%).  Longer follow-up (in some studies) indicates that the recurrence rates may be higher( 5 - 8 % for indirect inguinal hernias and  slightly higher for direct inguinal hernias).  Laparoscopic repairs also have been reported to be showing very low recurrence rates.  In your case,it is very difficult to say whether those red bumps are due to recurrence or otherwise without actually examining you.They could be anything from simple inflammatory nodules to a strangulated hernia.   Therefore, you must consult a surgeon immediatly to be assessed. Best wishes!\n\n",

There are a number of possibilities for a hard lump within the scrotum. - a tense hydrocele, - an hydrocele with calcified walls (as in some cases of filarial hydroceles), - an organized/calcified hematocele,or  - a testicular tumor. Of course, one must exclude an inguinal hernia in all these cases.  Kindly let us have more details so that we can guide you better.You may also consult your doctor without undue delay, as in any hard swelling in the scrotum, a testicular tumor must be considered.

    "title": "Long thin wood foreign body in neck/shoulders",
    "content": "I am 31 yrs old, female.  A long, thin, sharp wooden foreign body under the skin / in the soft tissues of the head/neck/shoulders region retained for several years.  Apologise for the lengthy description, but please bear with me to get the whole picture.  Nov 1994: While sitting on an old wooden bench, I felt a sharp pain under the upper thigh.  Stood up and felt (with hand) a sharp, thin stick protruding slightly out of back of thigh and pushing onto the underside of my (short) skirt.  However, as there were many people around, I did not pull it out.  Subsequently over the next few days, I felt a long, thin, sharp foreign body under the skin down the length of the back of the thigh and upper calf, even while walking.  Estimated length: abt 1 foot in length, quite near skin surface.    Whenever I squatted (we had a squatting type of toilet), I could feel the foreign body being pushed higher up under the skin due to the squatting.  After abt 1 week, it had been pushed up to the buttocks area and whenever I sat down, I could feel distinct sharp pain in that area.  Over a few mths, felt the object slowly shift/slide upwards under skin into lower back area.  Whenever I sat down, felt upward pressure under the skin caused by the foreign body.  However, there was no pain, only discomfort, pressure and the feeling of something under the skin/in the tissues, which was not supposed to be part of the body.  (One cannot feel one\u2019s own bones and muscles.)  The object felt like a long, thin and sharp stick consistent with the wooden stick/shaving from the edge of the bench I had sat down on.  I consulted a doctor.  As she pressed my back, I could vividly feel a long coiled up and thin object being pressed and pushed higher up my back.  It felt quite near the skin surface.    Over the next few mths, felt the upward pressure of the foreign body under the skin at my back whenever I sat down, but there was no pain.  Slowly, it settled into an area under the shoulder blades and was stable/did not move for some time.  As such, I thought perhaps there wasn\u2019t any foreign body in the first place.  So proceeded to do more physical actions like bending e.g. sideways from a chair to pick up things, or carrying bags on one shoulder etc.  However, these led to the feeling of the foreign body loosening up/sliding out of position, causing greater discomfort.  I could feel the length of the object sliding slightly under the skin.   Over time, sitting caused the foreign body to be pushed higher up to collarbone area.  The upward pressure of the object felt worse whenever I sat down.  I consulted another doctor, who sent me for an X-ray, which didn't show anything.  (Wooden material can\u2019t be imaged by X-ray).  Subsequently, I also saw another doctor, who sent for a CT scan, but it also didn't show anything.  Over time, the foreign body slowly shifted into a position around back of the neck, collarbone and shoulder area.   As the neck and throat area is a very mobile region, where muscles move a lot, esp when eating and talking, I could also feel more vividly the sliding of the foreign body in the tissues, esp after swallowing or talking for some time.    Mid-2003: At a salon hair wash, I felt my head/neck position was slightly lower than my back.  Over next few days, felt the foreign body slowly loosen up (likely to have been dislodged by lowered head/neck position).  Part of it shifted upwards from the shoulder higher into the neck, causing more discomfort.  Current situation: Due to circumstances over the years, the whole length of the foreign body had slowly shifted/been pushed up along under the skin/fat layer in the back to the current position. Portions of it had reached the same height as the jaw region/base of the neck/below the hairline at the back of the neck.  It feels like it\u2019s entwined/lodged around back of the neck, with some parts in the shoulders and the ends of it at the sides of the neck.  It feels long and extends to the upper shoulder area.  The pressure of the object under the skin can be felt all the time, except when sleeping. The discomfort is generally worse towards later part of the day (waking hours) or when sitting too long. I usually feel least pressure or discomfort when in lying down position on the back (e.g. after a night\u2019s sleep).  As it's of substantial length, I can often feel it shift position/slide slightly in the tissues as a result of activities involving movement of the area such as swallowing, talking, moving etc. (But there's no pain).    If it shifts too near the mouth (e.g. sharp end pierces near side of jaw/gum), then it would cause discomfort there.  On a few occasions, I could actually feel (with my finger) the tangible sharp, thin (not more than 1 mm thickness) and slightly flexible tip of the object pushing very slightly out from inside the gum.   If part of it shifts into a position near the throat, then it would cause some discomfort after swallowing for some time, especially towards end of a meal, or last meal of the day (dinner). Once the object moves into a position that irritates the throat or mouth, the muscles usually automatically pull to try to dislodge/move the object away from the throat/mouth area.  I can then feel the long thin stick sliding/pulling away in the tissues.    If I step too hard on the floor, i.e. the step is more forceful than usual, I can sometimes feel the impact/vibration of a long horizontal thin thing around the back of the neck under the skin (near the base of the bottom hairline).  During a holiday to Universal Studios USA, I sat on an \u201cearthquake\u201d ride, which involved our carriage jerking and tilting.  After the ride, the feeling of discomfort caused by the foreign body became worse, as I felt it loosen up and slide slightly in the tissues/under the skin, caused by the jerking physical motions during the ride.  As the foreign body shifted nearer the throat, swallowing was affected for some days.   I know wooden foreign bodies are very difficult to image, especially very thin ones, which is probably why it couldn\u2019t be detected by X-ray and CT.  Unless it can be detected by diagnostic imaging techniques, it\u2019s difficult to get medical help, from my experience with previous doctors.    I understand my situation sounds very unusual.  However, the above account are the facts of the matter.  The pressure and feeling is vivid and consistent with the long thin foreign body described and has been constantly felt all these years.   It generally worsens with external pressure on the skin, sitting too long and physical activities affecting the neck/shoulders.    Pls. advise what kind of imaging technique would have a higher chance of detecting such a thin wooden foreign body.  I would appreciate any advice and hope for a reply.  Thank you very much for your patience.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for writing.  As my situation is so unusual and bizarre, I thought I was the only one with this problem.  What is your case like?  Do you also have wooden foreign body?  How long have you had it?  You mentioned \u201cPut myself in dept that lead to me losing everything that I had worked hard for\u201d \u2013 what do you mean?  Hope nothing bad happened.  No, I have not managed to resolve the problem and am trying my best to live with it.  From my experience, there is nothing the doctor can help, unless the foreign body can actually be imaged.  In fact, a doctor I consulted even made things worse by pressing my back, causing it to move higher up the back.  They are unlikely to believe the case unless there is actual evidence.  Even my own family members/relatives are sceptical about it, except my parents.  I have done some research and it is nearly impossible to image wooden objects, esp. thin ones. The doctors usually think it\u2019s impossible for a foreign body to travel in the tissues, as they think it is just a small splinter.  So, they think I am crazy or stressed, or it is another medical condition, which may result in taking unnecessary medication, which is harmful.  This is why I have not consulted another doctor about this problem for so many years.  I agree that a small splinter is unlikely to travel.  However, my case involves a sharp and rather long thin stick and it is indeed possible for such a sharp object to move in the soft tissues/fat layer.  I am reluctant to go for an ultrasound scan or consult a doctor about this problem, as from previous experience, physical actions such as pressing on the skin actually makes it worse, i.e. the foreign body slides/moves out of position.  (An ultrasound scan involves physical pressing on the skin).  Also, the neck/collar bone area is an awkward area for ultrasound scanning as it\u2019s very bony.    I find that the foreign body is still as sharp as ever after all these years (since end 1994) and also very mobile in the soft tissues.  In fact, I recently felt the sharp end stick slightly into my throat for a few weeks and it caused great discomfort.  Luckily, it has since moved to another position, but still very near the throat.  I have to avoid eating or talking too much at one time to prevent it from moving too near or sticking into the throat (and sometimes mouth/upper soft palate).  I am worried that in the event the foreign body does cause medical problems and I need to seek medical help, it\u2019s going to be very difficult, as the doctors don\u2019t believe the case and wood can\u2019t be imaged.  Also, surgery on neck/throat area is dangerous.  So, I\u2019m trying to prevent it from becoming worse by avoiding the causes that worsen it \u2013 mainly physical actions that are likely to affect it.    How are you dealing with your situation?  Did you manage to research any imaging technique that can image wood (non-metallic/non-bone)?  BTW, I have cultivated hobbies/interests to help me cope with this physical problem.  Maybe you can try this method.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi  wibblypig, You should have consulted a specialist long ago(it is an incredible 15 years since the foreign body entered your thigh!). There are certain aspects which are intriguing to me. a)  metallic foreign bodies(needles,wires Etc) certainly tend to migrate for prolonged periods. But the  wooden foreign bodies absorb water from the tissues and become soft, sodden and lose their stiffness over a period of time - thus they become less likely to coil, uncoil or move much. b) wooden foreign bodies are less likely to retain their sharp tip(digestion by body defences) - again hampering their ease of migration. I urge you to consult a specialist soon and get it sorted out once and for all.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for your post.  What type of specialist do you suggest?    As my case is so unusual, it is not easy for most doctors to accept my explanation of what had happened, as not everyone is as open-minded as yourself. (Pls. refer to maddawg63\u2019s post on 8 Sept.)  From my past experience, unless the foreign body can actually be imaged, the doctor can\u2019t help.  In fact, a doctor I consulted even made things worse by pressing my back, causing the foreign body to move higher up.  That was about a few mths after it first entered.  Physical actions such as pressing on the skin make the discomfort worse, by causing the foreign body to slide/move out of position.  I understand through some research that it is difficult for wooden foreign bodies, esp. thin ones, to be detected by diagnostic imaging techniques.  What imaging technique (other than ultrasound) do you recommend to image a long, thin wooden foreign body?  (Dr Chan Lowe previously suggested ultrasound, but this involves physical pressing on the skin.  Also, the neck/collar bone area is an awkward area for ultrasound scanning as it\u2019s very bony.  If the scan cannot successfully detect it, then I will be worse off, because the foreign body would have been moved by pressing during the scan and cause more discomfort, but yet can\u2019t be detected and removed.)  As for the 2 points you mentioned: I agree that the foreign body is likely to have absorbed water and become softer, but the current position is around the bony parts of the body, i.e. near or around shoulder blades, collar bones, throat, possibly windpipe, jaw areas.  This area is very mobile as we talk, eat and move during the day.  So the foreign body also moves when the muscles move.  This is likely the reason why it usually feels better after a night\u2019s sleep. (The foreign body has been in the neck/throat/shoulders region for most of the 15 years).  I also agree that the sharp tip is likely to be less sharp than when it first entered, otherwise it would have caused more damage, e.g. although I can sometimes feel the sharp end stick slightly into my throat or mouth/gum, but it doesn\u2019t really poke/pierce through.\n\n",

I need to find out which forum that I have spilt my guts out on the most, then I will let you know so you can read my story! They are nearly identical in many ways. We have felt the same pains, the same sorrows. I sometimes feel ashamed for the weakness's that this has brought upon me. But why, when we know we are right. When I said that I had lost everything I was referring to my home and my financial situation that lead to bankruptcy because of the med. bills that I accrued to prove my sanity. I know that you are probably only one of the few that can understand and conceive what I mean by this. I to can not talk to family members about this. I have shut out friends that I had for 34yrs because they where skeptics. That is a said thing in its self!! It effects you in ways that others can not understand until they have walked in your shoes, they never will until they do.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I have read your post on the eHealth forum.  I do understand your case, as it is similar to mine, except that is plastic instead of wood and is different shape and size.  I suggest that since it did sort of show up on an ultrasound, why don't you consider following up with another doctor?  (From your post - \"On an ultra-sound that I had done the radiologist read \"that there was a shadowing of an object 4X4X5m\".\")  As it is quite short/small (as compared to my case), there may be a chance of having it removed.  BTW, do you have any problem if the doctor presses to try to feel for the foreign body, or when having an ultrasound scan done?    For my case, any pressing tends to cause the foreign body to shift into another position, causing further discomfort.  Also, the current position is precarious and performing ultrasound (i.e. exerting pressure on the skin) is risky as it may cause the object to move into a dangerous position.  It is very thin so that's not much chance of it being imaged.    It would be wonderful if a researcher manages to discover a technique of successfully imaging radio-opaque plastic or wooden foreign bodies, however thin they may be.  This would solve the detection problem and doctors will not doubt what we are saying.  However, there seems to be not much research done for this.  If you do manage to find any info, pls. let me know.  In the meantime, we have to be careful not to jerk or move the foreign body into a dangerous position.  So far, I am still able to put up with it.\n\n",

What are the long-term risks?  Is it safe to leave it alone and just try to tolerate it?  It is a dilemma for me, as there are risks on both sides - leaving it alone or seeking treatment.  Surgery on this area is dangerous and as I mentioned before, ultrasound scan is also risky.  Do you advise any other imaging techniques that may have a higher chance of detection?  (I did try X-ray and CT scan around 1995.)   I wanted to send a private message to you, but I don't have the access rights.  Do you have an email address if I need to contact you?

    "title": "Re: Long thin wood foreign body in neck/shoulders",
    "content": "This is an update to my posts on this case.  I have a few questions at the end of this post.  The position of the long and thin wooden foreign body has shifted and I am worried it may injure the lung.  The foreign body\u2019s current position is such that it is no longer pressing at the back of the neck, but instead part of it is now pressing at the front upper right chest/shoulder.  This is how the position change occurred.  One Sunday night about 3 weeks ago (end of May), as I was opening the refrigerator door using my right hand, I felt part of something thin and long (foreign body) shift/slide inside the shoulder joint area and around the shoulder blade.  (The refrigerator door has quite tight suction, and some effort is needed to open the door.)  After that, I felt a sharp pain in the right shoulder under the collar bone.  I could feel the pain when lying down (on my back), and it was difficult to sleep.    Over the next 3 weeks, the foreign body has stayed in the similar position (i.e. one part/one end pressing in the front of the right shoulder/upper chest under the collar bone).  The rest of the foreign body still extends to the side of the neck (right side) and behind the shoulders (near the shoulder blades) at the back to the left side.  Whenever it presses in a certain position, I can feel pressure and sharp pain similar to an injection needle inside the tissues.  I can feel the object (possibly the tip) shift and slide in the area, sometimes nearer the arm and sometimes nearer the sternum, sometimes higher (nearer the collar bone) and sometimes lower.  The pain can be at slightly different places at different times, depending on the position of the foreign body, but it is around the same area.  Physical movements/exertion of the right arm cause more movement/sliding of the object and in turn causes more pain.  When I lie on my back to sleep at night, I can also feel the pain if the position of the foreign body is not good, and it became difficult to sleep.  (I used to have no problems sleeping as the position of the foreign body was pressing at the back, not the front, thus not causing pain, only pressure).  When I sit down, the pain and pressure also gets worse and I need to stand up often.  If I walk or move too much, it also gets worse, esp. if it is in a moveable position affected by movements of the muscles.  Appreciate if these questions could be answered:  1) Whenever I feel the pain in the front upper right chest/shoulder near the collar bone, it means the foreign body is pressing against a body structure, but what is it likely to be \u2013 muscles, nerves, or organ (lung)?  2) How deep are the lungs with reference to the skin surface of the chest (i.e. distance from the skin surface and the ribs)?  Are the lungs protected by muscles?    3) I have considered seeking treatment, but as physical movements/pressure have been causing it to move so easily, I am worried that it may be made worse by the doctor pressing or by ultrasound scan.  Thin wooden material is not easy to be imaged.  It is risky to try to remove it surgically without knowing the position, since the process of attempting to remove it (e.g. by pulling one end of it) may result in damage to the tissues, blood vessels or organs.  Also, it may break during removal and part of it could be left inside the body unknowingly, since the surgeon has no idea how long it is or its position.  Broken end is also likely to be sharper than the original tip.  I would appreciate advice on this.  Thank you.\n\n",

As you seem to have pain, it is probable that the foreign body is still in situ.I presume you had shown to a doctor and updated your tetanus immunity status.You have not mentioned when this injury happened.If it is very recent,under supervision,one may decide on a  wait and watch policy under antibiotic cover.If the pain persists, a surgical exploration may be warrented.

    "title": "Re: genetic disorder from anestesia",
    "content": "Hi, I am not certain what exactly you are referring to by 'rigors'...  'Rigors' could either mean - chills or  - rigidity.  Chills in the immediate post operative period following recovery from anesthetics are well known.This may be attributed to the body's way of recovering from hypothermia. This is generally accompanied by increases in the heart rate and metabolic rate.This phenomenon is not genetic and can occur in anyone.  However, if you are referring to rigidity, then one condition with a familial basis which is of relevance is 'Malignant Hyperthermia' (MH).This susceptibility is an autosomal-dominant disorder with probably a multifactorial inheritance.  The classic signs of MH include tachycardia, tachypnea, marked hyperthermia , increased carbon dioxide production, increased oxygen consumption, acidosis, muscular rigidity, and rhabdomyolysis. All these indicate a hypermetabolic response. The syndrome is could be fatal if not recognized early & treated.  The pathophysiology: it is believed to be triggered by increased release of myoplasmic calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in the muscle cells leading to  - depletion of ATP(adenosine-tri-phosphate),  - loss of muscle membrane integrity  - hyperkalemia and  - rhabdomyolysis.

    "title": "Re: genetic disorder from anestesia",
    "content": "Hello there,  I am sorry that you've had problems with Anaesthesia in the past.  Hopefully I can try to shed some light on what might be causing your problems.  Seizure-like activity during and after Anaesthesia can be caused by a number of factors;  Some gaseous anaesthetic agents, specifically Enflurane, Isoflurane and Sevoflurane have been associated with seizure-like activity on induction of anaesthesia, as well as intraoperatively and post-operatively.  Although these epileptogenic reactions are uncommon, it has been documented in research studies.  Isolfurane has also been shown to cause Electroencephalogram spikes intraoperatively.  It is unlikely that these would cause seizure-like activity for 12 hours post-anaesthetic, as you have described, but it should be something to bear in mind.      Other induction and maintainance anaesthetic agents, such as Propofol and Etomidate have been known to cause an involuntary muscular response.  It is less likely that Etomidate would be used for anaesthesia in today's anaesthetics, but Propofol, a lipid-based hypnotic, is used frequently in today's anaesthetics and there is a significant chance that you would have been administered this medication if you had a general anaeasthetic.     A significant number of patients suffer with post-anaesthetic shivers, which interestingly can be experienced even if body temperature is normal.  To elaborate, when you have a general anaesthetic, you are usually kept warm on the operating table by using a warm blanket that fills with hot air.  This, along with warm intravenous fluids and hot operating lights pointing at your body make you rather warm on the operating table.  Once these have been taken away and you're taken to the Post-Anaesthesia unit, your body has to adjust to the change in environmental temperature, which could result in shivers.       I recommend you see your family physician to rule out anything sinister, specifically, as mentioned by Dr Kamath, Malignant Hyperthermia/Hyperpyrexia, which is a genetic disorder associated with anaesthesia, although from the symptoms you describe, I doubt this very much.    I also recommend you don't worry about this too much; if anything significant occured during your anaesthetic, a member of the anaesthetic team should inform you and your family doctor.    I hope this has shed some light on the situation, please let me know how you get on,  Kind Regards,  Mark\n\n",

Some of the methods recommended to alleviate this are by medication,moisturizing,& massage.Usually the changes in skin sensation following abdominoplasty tend to be temporary.Your surgeon will be in a better position to guide you through this.

In some parts of the world, a single, mobile inguinal lymph node may be fairly easily biopsied under local anesthesia as a 'day-case'.Some surgeons however may insist on a general anesthetic. Inguinal  lymphadenectomy (or ilio-inguinal lymphadenectomy)on the other hand, are more extensive procedures involving removal all the inguinal lymph nodes and other structures.These are best performed under general/spinal/epidural anesthesia.

    "title": "Re: xanax and general anesthesia/spinal",
    "content": "Hi, You are right in saying that you are worried about discontinuing alprozolam abrubtly.   Rebound or withdrawal symptoms, even seizures may occur following abrupt discontinuation or large decreases in dosage (patients receiving >4 mg/day or those on prolonged treatment are more vulnerable). Dose tapering or reductions must be approached with extreme caution. Breakthrough anxiety may also occur.  Daily dose reduction by 0.5 mg every third day or even a slower reduction should be considered. If withdrawal symptoms occur,previous dosage should be re-started or discontinuation schedule should be made less rapid.  Ideally, after >4 months of therapy re-evaluation must be done to determine the patient's need for the drug.If the patient's condition has improved and does not warrent continuation of therapy, it should be gradually withdrawn.  In the context of surgery under general or spinal anesthesia, chronic use of this agent may increase the perioperative benzodiazepine dose needed to achieve a desired effect.  Finally, alprozolam is known to produce genito-urinary side effects such as  incontinence, micturition difficulty, sexual dysfunction etc. It may be worth discussing with your urologist as to how much (if any) this drug may be contributing to your BPH symptoms.  I hope this information is useful to you. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi! I am aware that the person who posted this question most likely already had their surgery - and I sincerely hope that the urologist didn't decide on taking him off the Xanax. But other people out there might have the same question and I am very happy to provide this information.  As a Specialist in Anesthesiology I see these things all too often. Unless the drug interferes with the surgery itself, it should not be withheld because of the damage withdrawal syndrome and rebound effects can cause! Surgeons often don't understand the implications such a decision can have on the individual patient. Because they often focus only on the aspects of the surgery they loose track of \"the bigger picture\".  Seriously, I cannot think of one single indication that Xanax should be withheld because of surgery. It will not interfere with the anesthetic, general or spinal. On the contrary - us anesthesiologists might actually cancel or postpone the surgery if the patient is in actute withdrawal. We always titrate an anesthetic to effect, so even if the patient needs a slightly higher dose for the induction of anesthesia, we will still be able to provide a quality anesthetic under highest safety standards.  If your surgeon insists on stopping a benzodiazepine before surgery, have him or her explain exactly why you should and ask to speak with the anesthesiologist as well.  Hope this helps!

    "content": "Hi, It appears that you may have a mononeuritis involving the common peroneal nerve or one of its branches(superficial or deep peroneal nerves) causing pain in your foot.It could be an 'entrapment neuropathy'.  Confirmation of the origin of the pain due to irritation of a nerve is often done by injecting a local anesthetic around the nerve to assess the response.  From your account it is unclear if the surgeon is planning a 'neurolysis' to free the nerve or a 'neurectomy' (actual division of the nerve).  If a nerve is divided, there is bound to be paralysis of the muscles supplied by the nerve and loss of sensation over the skin supplied by the said nerve.  But,in cases where the action of those muscles has already been compromised by disease(ex, joint has become fixed),division would affect the sensory distribution(amelioration of pain)  and the motor deficit would not matter much.

    "content": "Hi, Smoking adversely affects wound healing in a number of ways. Some of the important adverse effects of smoking are as follows...  - smoking increases the carbon monoxide levels in the blood and thereby decreases the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood - Smoking increases chances of surgical site infection(SSI)  - Often many plastic surgeons will not perform free tissue transfers in active smokers because of the concerns of poor wound healing.  - Smoking increases stresses on the surgical wound as a result of coughing and breathing problems.Risk of pneumonia is higher.  - Smoking reduces the levels of Vitamin C, which is essential in wound healing  - Because of all the above complications, hospital stay & overall costs of treatment increases.  Therefore it is best to avoid smoking in a peri-operative situation.  Good luck!\n\n",

Problems with perineal wound healing after surgery for inflammatory bowel disease (Perineal wound morbidity) have been noted since long.  Significantly poorer healing has been noted in patients with Crohn's colitis, in men with ulcerative colitis, and in patients with ulcerative colitis who underwent one-stage operations. The risk of perineal wound morbidity is higher if anorectal sepsis is present at the time of proctectomy.  Other factors that appear to contribute to delay in healing are younger age of patients and presence of anorectal fistulas.  You have not mentioned the clinical details or details of the procedure you had undergone.It is possible that there is an underlying surgical site infection.I suggest that you must see your surgeon who will be in a better position to assess the cause for the discharge from the perineal wound.

    "content": "Hi, I am hoping you you can help me. I had a double Cervical Fusion(c5-6,6-7) in Sept.09. Since the surgery it seems things are getting worse. First I still feel like I have a knot in my throat, my skull and right side of my head goes numb, my right shoulder, arm and fingers still tingle and now even my right knee and buttocks goes numb and then tingles. My problem is I went to an ENT and he told me that I had a preexisting condition with acid reflux(never had this problem before), my right shoulder and arm(mostly at the bicep area) constantly hurts. I can not even pick up my right arm or hold it out straight. The pain is enough to make me sick at my stomach. I have frequent headaches, and still can not be up for more that 2 hours at a time before I have to lay or sit with my head back because my head feels like it is just to heavy to hold up. The burning has now come back from my neck to down between my shoulder blades. I have had the shot in my neck with no results, and a nerve conduction test. I am now getting ready to have them again. I went to an Ortho Dr. and he did an MRI and said the results showed no damage to my shoulder. My pain management Dr has put me on Lyrica 3 times a day but I am scared of it because of my kidney disease. No one has mentioned checking my levels to  make sure this medicine is not hurting me more. I feel like they think I am making this up because they are telling me basically it is all in my head. But I know the pain I am feeling. My boyfriend has stayed up with me because I was in so much pain the meds would not even let me sleep. Is this normal to have this many problems after having a fusion done? I fell and got hurt in May 09 and didn't have the surgery until Sept.. Could not having this surgery sooner have caused more problems because of the wait? I am also being treated for depression. I basically feel like a shell of my former shelf and don't get out much anymore. I don't drive because I get dizzy a lot and get disoriented. I am even taking otc meds just to have a bowel movement. I feel like I am trapped and don't know what else to do. I do know that the pain I am feeling is very real. I can not even pick up my grandchild who is only 4 months old. It is getting more and more frustrating for all of us. Please tell me what else I need to do to get this under some kind of control.  I just had x-rays a month ago by the surgeon that done the fusion and he says everything looks good. If it looks so good why am I not getting any better? He just keep sending me to other doctors. Will this ever get any better or is this just the way it is going to be? My right hand is also getting very cold and looses color. It gets so cold and hurts to the point that I have to put a glove on it or run it under really hot water just to get some relief. I have been to PT on 2 different times (before and after the surgery) and the PT after surgery was worse. They could not put the machines on me at all because of the pain in my shoulder. I don't even wear a bra on the shoulder most of the time and this is most uncomfortable for the fact that I am large breasted. I just don't know if the pain is spreading down my right side to the lower body or what.  I am currently on Lyrica, Loritab 10, Amitriptyline ,and Pepsid,and have been on Flexaril, Cymbalta, and Skelaxtin,.I know this is long and I really thank for taking time to read it.   Thank You\n\n",

    "title": "reopened perianal hematoma",
    "content": "I was struggling to pass a large bowel movement 4 days ago and when I was done noticed some bleeding.  I didn't think of it at the time but a few days later I noticed a building pain in my anus.  When I checked it in the mirror I found a pea sized dark blue spot on the edge of my anus.  Looking online I was pretty sure that it was a perianal hematoma.  After a few days the pain started to subside but I had been unable to pass another bowel movement so I began taking stool softners.  Finally today I had a bowel movement and noticed more blood when I was finished.  Upon inspection I noticed that the hematoma had a whole in it and was leaking blood.  I am worried that the pain is going to become as bad as it was before if not worse.  On some websites I found that if gotten to quickly enough a doctor can remove the blood before it clots avoiding the pain of a blood filled sac stretching my anus.  Should I immediately try to have that done or is it going to continue healing on its own?  Should I apply pressure to stop the bleeding?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: reopened perianal hematoma",
    "content": "Hi, Peri-anal hematomas are due to rupture of tiny veins that normally exist in the peri-anal region subcutaneously.These may rupture while straining at stool.They can be acutely painful if they are tense.In a few days time, they tend to become lax and the pain passes off. In the acute phase, evacuation may be needed if the hematoma is very painful(tense).Hematomas that are not tense or painful may be managed conservatively (cold compresses, sitz baths & NSAIDs).  You need to be examined by a surgeon to a) assess the hematoma and  b) to exclude any other co-existing cause for the bleeding.  Continued bleeding despite conservative management may even need surgical removal of the hematoma. Good luck!\n\n",

I will insert a link at the end of this post for you to contact. If this particular program can not offer assistance then they should be able to direct you to someone who can. Now, for the \"lump\", please confirm the nature of your finding by direct clinical examination by your physician. It is probably a lymph node as it occurs in a lymph node region, however this must be confirmed by your physician. The submandibular lymph nodes are located along the underside of the jaw on either side. They drain the tongue, submaxillary gland, lips and mouth, conjunctivae. Common causes of enlargement include infections of head, neck, sinuses, ears, eyes, scalp, pharynx. If this enlargement is indeed due to an enlarged lymph node you may possibly have an underlying infection which of course may require treatment with an antibiotic. Regardless of whether the cause of enlargement is due to an infection or another cause you should have an evaluation by your physician. Click here! Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

There are other differential diagnoses as well - but one has to clinically examine before arriving at a diagnosis. So, i suggest that you should consult your GP first.  Good luck\n\n",

    "title": "Re: breast reduction without surgery?",
    "content": "Hi,  As you feel that the difference in size between your breasts is 'too much', it indicates that you seem to have a cosmetically significant inequality.  Firstly, consult your doctor to exclude any pathology in either of your breasts.If none is found, then if you have a size difference that can't be concealed easily and is bothering you,then, it may be wiser to consult a cosmetic surgeon.  Exercises cannot increase the size or shape of the breasts per-se, but they can only increase the bulk of the pectoral muscle mass underlying the breasts.It may be somewhat useful & easier in 'bilateral' breast enhancement but, performing 'unilateral' pectoral exercises is not going to be easy!  There is no reliable, noticeable, & verifiable non-surgical method (that i know of) of achieving permanent (or atleast, long term) correction. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "HI, It is well known that oral contraceptives increase the risk of venous thromboembolic disease.  If one does not have any other 'personal risk factors'  or 'disease factors' for venous thromboembolism, generally, oral contraceptives need not be stopped prior to surgery.   However, there is no consensus regarding this.Similar thing can be said about hormone replacement therapy (HRT) & surgery.  It is perhaps very important for one to know  - as to how many risk factors one has (more the risk factors, more is the overall risk), - if there are any risk factors related to the disease one has (for ex, malignancy-esp. pelvic, paraneoplastic syndromes etc), & - risk related to the kind of surgery, its duration etc.  Some anesthetic drugs and other drug interactions may also add to the risk of thrombogenicity.   Sometimes, oral contraceptives may need to be stopped prior to surgery for other reasons. One such reason is \"Porphyria\". Oral contraceptives cause destruction of the heme group in cytochromes, requiring new heme for incorporation into cytochromes.This can precipitate an acute porphyria.  Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "About 3 weeks ago I had a CCK-HIDA scan test.  The results came back with 11% and 16% ef.  My GI doc said I should schedule cholecystectomy, so I set up an appointment for later this month.  In the meantime, my symptoms have worsened considerably.  My nausea is almost constant, as is the pain.  I went to the ER on Wednesday, and they admitted me.  However, since the ultrasound and CT showed no inflammation and I did not have an acute abdomen, they simply kept me to keep fluids in me and manage the pain.  My GI doc failed to send the HIDA scan test results to the hospital surgeon, so he did not seem to think there was any reason for my symptoms besides some fluid (possibly a cyst) in the abdomen.  On Friday, the hospital released me, with some sheepish apology by the surgeon that he wished he had known my ejection fraction earlier, but it was the weekend and he had to go to a funeral.  I'm suffering a lot today.  I was able to schedule an appointment with a surgeon for this coming Friday, but I'm not sure I can hold out til then!  I'm taking pain meds, but they're not very helpful.  Is this \"biliary dyskenesia\" really the cause of my pain, and if so, how can I get it out NOW?  I'm unable to function as I am now.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, You have not mentioned several important points in the history.... - have you been having similar pain in the past? - Have you had any abdominal pain at all in the past? - any previous abdominal surgery? - charecteristics of the pain?  & so on.  One should NEVER treat an investigation report!  Therefore, in the abscence of details regarding your illness (and physical findings), it would be very difficult(if not impossible) to hazard an opinion.  The result of the CCK-HIDA scan does show that the 'ejection fraction' is very low & therefore could be the so-called 'biliary dyskinesia'.  A normal gall bladder contracts and empties about 75% (ejection fraction-EF) of its contents in response to a meal-activated CCK secretion from the proximal small intestine. On a radio-isotope scan, this is expressed as the 'change in activity, divided by the baseline activity'.    The exact cause of this condition is unknown but may be due to decreased Gall bladder CCK- receptor function or a decrease in the number of CCK-receptors (receptor 'down-regulation').  At what level of EF one can consider that 'biliary dyskinesia' exists is controversial. Generally an EF of less than 35% is considered abnormal.  So, how does one go about deciding which patient will be benefited by removal of gall bladder? This may be done as follows... - consideration of the EF, and - to decide whether the appropriate 'symptom - complex' exists.  An EF of <35% is certainly low enough to consider cholecystectomy.But, even higher EF values may be considered for surgery if - the symptoms are compelling and - in those patients who have reproduction of their symptoms on  administration of CCK. Best wishes!\n\n",

I also have had pain from the incision constantly throughout the day since the surgery; it is hard to walk, sit, sleep, etc. I took Vikodin for the first two days but decided to stop do to very hard stools, I have been taking Advil to try to control the pain but it doesn\u2019t really help that much.   The first three bowel movements after surgery were very painful because they were quite hard and I had to strain to get it out (even though I have been taking fiber supplements, drinking a lot of water and taking stool softeners since the surgery). The fourth bowel movement was softer but there was still a lot of pain. There is hardly any blood. I am not sure if the pain is from the fissure or from the incision. My Doctor made me believe that the pain would be gone almost immediately from the fissure so I expected recovery to be a breeze, but so far that has not been the case. I opted for the surgery to get rid of the intense pain during bowel movements, but the pain is still persisting. Is it normal to be in this much pain still? How long will it take for the pain from the incision to go away? Once that pain is gone, will I still have pain from the fissure? Or will I be pain free?   Also, I was prescribed nifedipine ointment before my surgery to attempt to heal the fissure... is it okay to use this after my surgery to help the healing process?  I\u2019m in a lot of pain and I need help.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Recovery after Sphincterotomy/Fissurectomy",
    "content": "Hi, There are a number of surgical procedures done for chronic anal fissures.  - fissurectomy(not preferred by most),but at times done if an associated fairly large skin tag(sentinel pile) needs to be removed. - sphincterotomy(lateral or median)-- lateral sphincterotomy can be by an 'open' or 'closed' technique.  The idea underlying sphincterotomies is that by dividing the fibers of the 'internal sphincter', one is able to get over the spasm of this muscle, which is believed to be the inciting cause for  - the pain & - the chronicity (non-healing nature) of the fissue. You have not indicated what type of sphincterotomy was done in your case.\"closed' sphincterotomies tend to cause less pain post-operatively. Post-operative pain is variable depending on variables such as  - the type of surgery done, - pain threshold, - analgesic drug used and dosage, - the consistency of the stool etc. Your pain should hopefully abate quite soon.Consult your surgeon again if your stools are hard or you have to strain excessively. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I am 23 years old, about 6'1\" and 198 pounds. Six to Seven years ago, I experienced to have puffy nipples.  I went to see a doctor who diagnosed me with gynecomastia. Since I was in puberty period, he advised to wait.  It did not go away; rather it became increased as the time passed.  I was having puffy nipples from the beginning of this problem which generally gets into its normal shape if weather gets cold or if I touch my nipples for some time and then it puffs back again like it would have been filled with air. On palpating, it gives a spongy feeling.  The size of areola also increased meanwhile and it got worse till a year ago.  I consulted my plastic surgeon who offered surgery to remove glands there.  Many tests were done including testerones and other hormonal tests, which all were found to be negative. Surgery was uneventful and sutures were removed seven days postop. I was told that swelling will go by the time.  Areola has also decreased in size, but the puffiness of nipples has never gone. Now, after nine months' postop, I am still having puffy nipples.  I cannot palpate any hard mass or gland inside it.  It is very soft except for some tenderness right over the incision site on the right; but the left side incision site is nontender. It's really embarrassing to have the same problem after having undergone surgery.  It is now affecting my physical appearance and I am very concerned about it.  Please suggest me a possible way out to get rid of this problem.   Thanks.\n\n",

    "title": "Ventral  or Umbilcal Hernia repair??",
    "content": "In Oct 08 I had gone in for a hernia repair. The hernia was located about 3/4 inch above my belly button. the surgery went fine and I went home the same day. He said I might have some pain for the next few weeks while it healed. But it may take a couple of months. For the next few months I was still in the same pain as I was before the surgery. I went back in to see him 4 months after the surgery because it just wasnt feeling any better. He said the mesh looks to be holding really well. Then said because my belly button was now pushed in this was one of the ways he could tell. He then said I need more time to heal.     5 months went by and I went back because the pain was still the same and sometime even worse. I had to wear a large back brace that held my stomach in just to make it through the day nearly everyday after the surgery. Well when I went back he once again said that my belly button was still in an didnt understand why I was still in pain. He had me lay on the table and I showed him the location above my belly buttom where the pain was. He acted a little strange once he started feeling the hernia and then said I would need to have another repair. The way he had acted didnt sit well with me! I couldnt do a surgery right away like he wanted me to and I wasnt feeling comfortable about the way he acted.     I took some time and recently found another doctor and had a consultation. He said it was a little strange where my incision was from my last surgery. The incision is located at the bottom of my belly botton. He said most ventral hernia surgeries based on where my hernia was would have an incision right above the hernia. Not at the bottom of my belly button which indicates to him it would have been a umbilical repair. He did say it was possible to do a ventral from that spot but wouldnt be likely since I'm not a 6 pack stomach model.     So im now wondering what are the chances that he did an umbilcial surgery and not a ventral? Do many surgeons preform the ventral repair by going in at the bottom of the belly button? I am getting another consultation from another surgeon on Monday and a CT scan to find the location of the first mesh but these questions are just eating at me, making it hard to sleep! I do have the medical notes from the surgery that I can type out on my next post if it helps determine what he did. I cant tell since its in medical lingo. Thanks for helping out!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Ventral  or Umbilcal Hernia repair??",
    "content": "Hi, An 'epigastric' hernia occurs anywhere between the umbilicus (belly button) and the xiphoid process (a small bone attached at the lower end of the breast bone).  A 'True' umbilical hernia occur through the umbilicus.  A 'Para-umbilical\" hernia occurs generally just above the umbilicus (but,can also occur occasionally below or to one side of the umbilicus).  You describe the hernia that you had (i note that you have not named it) as \"was located about 3/4 inch above my belly button\".  A hernia that close to the umbilicus could have been a very low epigastric hernia or a para-umbilical hernia.  Umbilical and para-umbilical hernias are generally  repaired  (in 'open' repairs) via a curved infra-umbilical incision.  An epigastric hernia that close to the umbilicus as you describe (how big or how small was it?), could be repaired either by an infra-umbilical approach or an incision placed immediately over the hernia.  Some of the problems in repairing such low epigastric hernias through an incision placed immediatly over the hernia are... -  that it makes it technically difficult to raise the lower flap as the umbilicus will tend to come in the way, - vascularity of the lower flap(which would be thin and devoid of fat (around the umbilicus) may be compromised, - a 'dead space' may result leading to infections and more importantly, - placing an adequate sized mesh and fixing the mesh satisfactorily may be difficult (leading to increased chances of recurrences).  If one is not planning to do a mesh repair and only a anatomical closure is planned, then an incision placed immediately over the hernia may be adequate.   Which incision to employ for a very low epigastric hernia will no doubt depend upon an individual  surgeon's  preferences. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Supralevator abscess",
    "content": "Hi, Supra-levator anorectal abscesses are a challenge to any surgeon, especially if they are horse-shoe shaped (a challenge in diabetics and non-diabetics as well).  The crux of the problem lies in preserving the ano-rectal sling, damage to which has the potential to cause incontinenceof feces.  As it is just over a month ago that a Supra-levator anorectal abscesses had been drained, the priorities in your case are  - fairly tight control of your glycemic status under medical supervision, and - to continue with local wound management as needed until the wound heals, or ends up as a fistula.  Seton placement would not have been feasible in the acute phase (abscess). Seton placement may be considered if by chance, a fistula should form.  Control of glycemic status in this kind of a situation often warrents insulin therapy, rather than oral hypoglcemics.  I hope this information may be of use to you. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Short update; Now approching four months out, had a whitecount drawn (normal) and a repeat CT with contrast, looks like it has resolved. The only real difference this time around was using packing twice per day in the surgical fistula leading to the abscess instead of slowly pulling out the Malecot drain over time. Yes, my Doctors hammered me over my sugars and so I have been eating a diet of really only fish and veggies which I suppose I should eat in any event as I diabetic, but my lastes A1C was 5.4 to which made my Physician pretty happy, and I have lost weight.  Day by day now, I will be taking Colace for a while I guess, and hoping for this not to re-occur, but I feel great and that is a good thing.  Although I trust my Family Doctor and Surgeon it is helpful to have a place to get some additional insight, I appeciate this site.   Thanks again,  Dave\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Removing my breast Implants.",
    "content": "Hi,   From your description, it is not clear which type of breast implant had been used in your case. Perhaps a saline implant or the first generation silicon filled implant.  In terms of the potential to wrinkle, saline implants are the most likely to wrinkle, because they are the most flexible (especially at their edges). In implants inserted in the 'sub mammary' position, any wrinkling becomes palpable or visible earlier.  The skin, breast tissue, and  fat surrounding the implant are known as the soft tissue coverage. That also plays a role in the potential for visible wrinkles. The thinner one's skin skin and the less fat one has, in general the greater chance there is for the implant wrinkles to show through the soft tissue cover.Have you by any chance lost weight recently?.  If your implants are removed, the more recent generations of silicone implants may be inserted by some surgeons at the same sitting. In case you don't consider this option, it s fine but, whether the wrinkles on your breasts may disappear or not is difficult to predict.I guess there should be no problem about breast feeding. To what extent a pregnancy may help to fill up the mammary adipose tissue, one can't predict either.   However, there is another option one may also consider.That is of a  breast lift surgery performed at the time of the implant removal surgery in order to enhance the shape of the breast. Feasibility or otherwise of this option has to be discussed with your surgeon. Best wishes!\n\n",

My abdomen was still very sore. Approximately 2 weeks after surgery it started showing signs of infection. The area below my umbilicus became red and warm to the touch and my abdomen was bloated. I saw my GYN who put me on Levaquin for 1 week. After that week I began having a yellow prurient discharge from the incision site. I called my surgeon back and he put me back on Levaquin at double the dose for another week.   I thought everything was cleared up and had sinus surgery. I was on Cipro for 1-week post op.  Shortly after I finished the Cipro I noticed that the foul smelling drainage was back as well as some bloating. My ENT cultured it (nothing terribly exciting grew other than Staph). This week it seems to have stopped draining, but my abdomen is bloated/distended and still sore. I look like I am six months pregnant! I also get tired and out of breath easily.   I suppose that I am wondering if there is a risk of a deep infection? I also don\u2019t know if the lack of drainage is a good thing or not. I feel like I keep getting the runarround from my Doctor.

    "content": "Hi, Obviously, you had manifestations of what appears to be a superficial surgical site infection (SSI).Antibiotic therapy had been given and it appears to have stopped draining.As you don't mention any local swelling or tenderness, it has probably been controlled.  The abdominal distension could be caused by a number of factors (antibiotic therapy included).  Hopefully, your symptoms would settle down soon with symptomatic management as advised by your doctor.  Deeper surgical site infections(including organ/space SSI's) appear to be less likely at this stage in your case as you don't seem to have any other symptom(apart from abdominal distension).  If the symptoms should continue or worsen, of course one should exclude deep SSI's.  However, your doctor is in the best position to examine you and decide if further investigations are warrented at this stage or not. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "3 weeks ago I had both my right ovary and a dermoid cyst on the ovary removed.  During surgery the cyst ruptured and I subsequently needed to be \"cleaned\" out.  The procedure was laproscopic.    Immediately after I had severe pain in the upper right side along the ribcage and up under the ribcage (almost where the gall bladder would be).  I was told this normal and would subside.  It took 6 days but the pain started to go away and was gone completely by the 9th day.    Suddenly, yesterday at 22 days post surgery and 13 post initial pain, the pain is back.  It started as a dull pain but slowly grew over the last 24hrs to where it is close to severe again.  It hurts to take a deep breathe in and if I touch the spot along the bottom of the ribcage it hurts and I actually make it worse.    Initial reaction of people is that it might be my gall bladder but I had that removed 13 months ago after a severe attack of stones!  And this pain is exactly the same as what I had post surgery.    Not sure what to do or if this is even related to the surgery.  Charlene\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, During laparoscopic surgery, carbon dioxide is insufflated into the peritoneal cavity to distened the abdomen prior to inserting the laparoscopic instruments.The carbon dioxide mixes with water to form carbonic acid, which is an irritant to the peritoneum.This results in local as well as referred pain.  As your surgery is fairly recent, before jumping to any other conclusions, this should be considered as the most likely cause.  At the completion of some of the laparoscopic procedures, it is usual for the surgeons to wash that part of the peritoneal cavity with normal saline(this is sucked out eventually).Some of this saline may remain, and track upwards towards the liver, where eventually it gets absorbed under the liver via lymphatics.This remaining fluid can cause temporary pain in some individuals.  It may be prudent in your case to wait for a while this process eventually settles down.In case the pain does continue, then further investigations may be warrented.  Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "I have had a I would say discomfort that sometimes starts where my hip bone is and follows the crease where my leg and upper body meet and down to my testicles.  It has gotten worse over time. The other day it started to bother me a lot worse than normal. I mentioned it to my supervisor at work and he pulled my out and sent me to a doctor.  Unfortunately the doctor that the company sent me to was an orthopedic doctor.  He basically asked me a few questions and said it is most likely hernia.  Most of the people I have talked to agreed.  It is usually very uncomfortable for me to lay flat on my back or sit up straight.  I have a fairly high tolerance for pain so I am not a good judge of on a scale of 1 to 10 etc.  I would say it\u2019s usually just annoying but as I said it has become worse and at times it\u2019s pretty bad.  My concern is they put me on workman\u2019s comp and are sending me to a surgeon to have surgery.  I have read a bunch of stuff on the internet.. I know that\u2019s a great source but either way I have read it and I am coming up with all kinds of things it could be.   I am afraid that I might have this surgery and that\u2019s not even what is wrong with me.  The company is willing to pay for it and all and that\u2019s all fine and well but I don\u2019t want to have surgery if that is not the problem.  Does this sound like it would be hernia and do you have any suggestions of things I can do to make sure I am diagnosed properly?   Thanks\n\n",

    "title": "Re: possibly misdiagnosed with hernia please help",
    "content": "Hi, Most hernias in adults can be confidently diagnosed only by a physical examination.In newborns and infants it is a bit tricky at times.To diagnose a hernia based on the type of pain alone is not mostly possible. Groin hernias (inguinal and femoral types) may produce dragging pain in the abdomen due to traction on the mesenteries of the large or small intestine or on the greater omentum.Pain at the site of the hernia itself may occur in cases of incarceration or strangulation of the hernia.There is no 'characteristic' or 'typical' pain for any particular hernia.  In most groin hernias, pain tends to be worse in the erect posture and gets relieved on lying down - in your case, the opposite seems to be the case.This is perhaps the only point in your history which is unlike in most groin hernias.  If a groin hernia is not evident on physical examination, but when the suspicion is high,sometimes we request an ultrasonography which may pick up some of these.  Other tests such as herniography,CT scan etc may be useful rarely in the detection of occult hernias.Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Tetracaine 4% is a local anesthetic gel used topically. Emla cream (lidocaine 2.5%, prilocaine 2.5%) is another such topical gel. Advantage of Tetracaine gel is that it's onset of action is earlier(30 min) compared to  Emla cream(60 min). Topical local anaesthetics may be absorbed through mucosal surfaces and the rate of absorption is unpredictable.Therefore serious systemic side-effects can occur. Both drugs are contraindicated in infants less than 1 month of age. They should be ideally used only under medical supervision. Good day!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Mucus membranes are special lining membranes of mouth,respiratory trat, gasto-intestinal tract, genito-urinary tract etc.  The mucus membrane of the oral cavity for example, is like the skin but, lacks the keratin layer which is relatively water impermeable.In the skin, the blood vessels lie deep in the dermis but, in the mucus membranes, they are quite superficial(due to the absence of the keratin layer),thus drugs applied onto them are easily and  quickly absorbed(basis of sub-lingual medications).Glans penis is also lined by a specialized skin(although one may refer to it as mucus membrane).   These are the reasons why tetracaine is not recommended for use on mucous membranes or on areas with a compromised skin barrier. Also, because these uses have not been adequately studied.  Some of the known complications are.. - Allergic reactions(urticaria,anaphylactoid reactions) - acute pulmonary edema - cardio respiratory arrest - hyooxia  - hypotension - shock etc. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi devnpeach, You say that a 'cyst' was removed - what kind if a cyst was it?  I assume that it was a 'sebaceous' cyst, as they frequently arise in that location. Sebaceous cysts in this area are usually technically more difficult to remove than sebaceous cysts over the front of the body as the skin over one's back is usually thicker an the cyst wall is commonly stuck to the skin extensively due to previous inflammatory or infective episodes in the cyst as well as chronic pressure due to body weight and friction. It is also possible for low grade infection to exist within the cyst without external evidence of it. Due to these factors,it is not surprising that some surgical wounds get infected following removal of these cysts. If incision does get infected,your boy friend's surgeon will be in the best position to treat it as 'each wound has to be treated according to it's merits'.I may not be right to offer guidance regarding without routine follow ups of such cases.

Continuing pain led to a colonoscopy that found three pre cancerous polyps (Grandmother on Mother side had colon cancer). Following these severe diarrhea for both of these I developed a chronic anterior anal fissure. I had a sphincterotomy for the fissure in early October 2009 after weeks with stool softeners and nitro creme did not heal it. When I went in for my two week post op exam the doctor performed a digital rectal exam on me. He had performed this exam on every visit except my initial one. This procedure post op resulted in severe pain for 36 hours following the exam. Since that exam I have continued to have pain and this week (two weeks post exam) I am again having pain during, after and inbetween bowel movements and with exercise. It is possible that this DRE post op could have delayed healing or could my initial fissure be opening up again?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi lonestar61, I am not aware of any band which connects intestines to the hip bone. One possibility is certain congenital bands (for example Ladd's bands). This band usually connect the cecum to the parietal peritoneum (outer layer of peritoneum) in the vicinity of the hip bone. They are not post operative adhesions but congenital. I guess that is what your doctor probably meant.Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "It is about a 1/2\" cut, and was deep enough that I saw a tendon(I think, I just saw a silvery stringy thing). Since there is no muscle or fat there, I figure any cut completely through the skin would reveal the tendon. I still have all motor function and feeling in my thumb.  This is the location on my other hand where I cut it:   I cleaned the cut with Provon antimicrobial soap, wiped it with rubbing alcohol, and dribbled hobby-grade super glue over the cut. I then taped my thumb to my index finger. It is now sealed and not bleeding.    As long as it doesn't start to swell or do anything unusual, I should be fine right? I figure that if stitching is required, the doctor would have to chip off the superglue and that it would just open up the wound again.\n\n",

    "title": "Post Fistula Surgery Advice Needed",
    "content": "Dear Doctors,  I developed a perianal abscess back in July which resulted in the formation of a fistula.  I ended up having an anal fistulectomy on September 23 to heal the fistula from the inside out.  My doctor told me that the fistula would heal on its own after the surgery.  I am now concerned because it has been 5 weeks and I am still experiencing leakage and some discomfort.  I went to see my doctor again 2 weeks ago (3 weeks after surgery) and he told me to stop taking sitz baths and to just try to keep the area dry.  He also told me to place a piece of cotton or gauze over the leaking area to keep it from irritating my skin.  Does this sound like good advice?  Is there anything I can do to speed up the healing process?  How long should it take for the fistula to fully heal and for the leaking to stop?  Also, is it OK to start exercising again?  I developed a really bad rash during workouts before I had the fistulectomy because the leakage combined with sweat was extremely irritating to the skin.  I am worried that a similar rash will reappear once I start exercising again.  Please advise.  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Perianal region is unlike most regions of the body in that the fecal matter passes over it on a regular basis (along with its countless bacteria). Thus, you may understand that any surgical wound in that region can't be kept as 'clean' as in some other parts of the body. Wound dressings are difficult to apply, difficult to secure and difficult to change without help of others. I do not know what type of anorectal fistula you had and how far the external opening was from the anal opening. Perianal wounds heal surprisingly well despite the drawbacks i had mentioned. Without looking at the wound, it may be very difficult to predict when it is likely to heal.It may be better to avoid exercising for the time being.  Good luck!\n\n",

Things were ok until yesterday when I noticed a stain on the sterile gauze covering the area, and I found out that I was discharging some fluids (not red and not yellow) from a part of the area along the healing ridge. I am concerned, though I have no fever and no pain in the area. Please could you advise what could have gone wrong.

I've missed work when the swelling becomes so severe that it is unbearable to be in public.  Recently, i was injected with Botox in each parotid.  It helps with the swelling.  I don't swell as much as I did before.  Much, much better...however the occassional itching continues and the sticky mucous that comes out of the parotid duct on occassion still comes out.

This along with the ache increasing rather than decreasing all seem to point to possible infection. Even though you are not scheduled to see your doctor until the third, please call today and tell the staff what you have told us. I feel certain that the doctor will want to see your incision. Please do not wait until you begin to see pus. Seeking medical attention later rather than sooner with an infection may result in increased healing time, unnecessary pain, etc.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Hope you are completely cured by now. Carpal tunnel is a tunnel that connects the forearm and the hand through which the tendons (long flexors) of the fingers and thumb pass (forearm to the hand).The median nerve also accompanies these tendons. It is fibro-osseous in nature (partly lined by bones and partly ligament). You probably had a condition called the 'carpal tunnel syndrome' for which your surgeon had divided the fibrous part of this canal.This canal has rigid walls. What you had developed was probably a post- operative infection in that space which needed to be addressed urgently - lest the infection might have spread either into the palm or up the forearm. The management is by - elevating the limb,  - antibiotics, and - drainage if there is a collection. Thank you for your post.\n\n",

Normal range of height of external ear is approximately 5-6 cm and normal width is approximately 1-1.8 cm. In a 'Scaphoid ear deformity', only the upper third  of the ear is big. 'Reduction' surgery or 'reduction sculpture' surgery is well known.But, this condition is not very frequent and the 'volumes' of cases done by an institution or an individual surgeon is bound to be (logically) not too vast (compared to mastoidectomies for example). I really have no idea as to which institution in india is performing this procedure in high 'volumes', their results, or the costs involved. Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "I underwent a minimally invasive laminotomy in January for right leg pain.  Upon waking up I discovered that my right leg was more numb that ever before.  I was expecting to have a microdiscectomy, but the surgeon stated that he only had to lightly push the disc back in place, but he had to \"move\" my nerve so he wasn't surprised by my symptoms.  However, I could barely walk to the bathroom the first time up because of right leg weakness.  Well, after weeks at home with a funny walk, I finally discovered that I was not able to stand tippie toe anymore or walk tippie toe, which was one test the had me perform pre-op that I did fine.  I have seen the NP and surgeon twice now, have attended therapy, and I am still having life changing weakness.  I am a nurse and to walk with a weak and sore leg in a big hospital is exhausting.  While my surgeon is sympathetic, I am a little concerned that he has never performed a quick exam of my neuro function after the surgery.  I realize that this is slow recovery, but I am concerned that there is a chance of this being permanent.  Is there any advice you can give or websites that explain how long of a process there is with this nerve palsy.  I am not worried about lawsuits, I actually work with this MD and respect him, however I want maybe a fresh look at this and wonder if this is \"normal\" and \"fixable\".   As far as a second MD, should I be asking for a neurosurgeon or neurologist?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I find in my medical practice that treating my colleagues can be most challenging.  I believe it takes a level of detachment (which may be hard to do when you work with someone everyday) to view them objectively and to do a thorough job.  Regarding the nerve, moving the nerve back may have caused some damage or inflammation. Maybe.  It is generally accepted that post op inflammation and scar tissue develop is the normal but should resolve over time.  How much time is the question.  The loss of standing on the toes likely means S1 nerve root is damaged and is concerning.  If this was not the level worked on in surgery then another MRI is needed.  Nevertheless, a neurosurgeon's thorough evaluation is needed at this point.   Nerve conduction study and EMG will add information on extent of nerve damage.  Take care and keep in touch.\n\n",

Suddenly two weeks back she started noticing a drop o two of blood in her under wear and the pain increased for her. the blood drops have also increased. Could you please help on to what can be done. Is it possible for the piles to re occur? Is it that after having operation she has to go on strict diet for good? Is there something you could tell me because i can bear the pain she goes through.

    "content": "Hi kenyan , Normally clean, planned, surgical wounds heal quickly.Hemorrhoid surgery is a bit different - because right from the immediate post operative period, fecal matter has to necessarily pass over the surgical site! This does not happen elsewhere.As you may be aware, fecal matter contains lots and lots of bacteria.Again, everytime during bowel action, the anal muscles contract many times - so there is no rest to the part as well - which will aid in rapid healing! So, it is obvious that the wounds following hemorrhoid surgery take time to fully heal. It is too early to talk of 'recurrence' in your wife's case. So, be patient.Hopefully everything will settle for the good in course of time.Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "I wasn't sure who to ask this question since it involves more than one part of the body. But since it began with a surgery, I'll ask a surgeon. I had a plastic surgery to fix the bridge of my nose, take in my nostrils and 'redo' my eye sockets; and ever since than the left side of my nose has been leaking a clear, water-like, salty fluid. It's not coming from my nostrils but from the crease of the nostril. This has been going on for 2 years now and it's getting very annoying. A few people have mentioned \"CSF rhinorrhea\" which is concerning since I have a VP shunt. I also was thinking that maybe the fluid has a connection to the surgery that was done on my eyes. Maybe the fluid is some form of tears? I have spoken with my doctor about what this fluid could be and if there is a possibility that the nose just didn't heal correctly and there is a 'hole' in the side of the nostril. But alas, he thinks I'm being 'silly'. Any ideas about what this fluid could be? And how to stop this leaking?\n\n",

One other very rare complication is a CSF (cerebro spinal fluid) leak. Identification of 'beta-2 transferrin' in the draining fluid constitutes a definitive diagnosis of this complication.If this complication unfortunately occurs, it needs to be surgically corrected by an experienced neurosurgeon. I trust this information is useful to you.How are you now? Hope you got better.\n\n",

    "content": "I am currently 10 weeks pregnant and was recently told that I have a mass by or on (they don't know which) my right ovary.  They don't know if it is cancerous or not and said it is up to me if I want to have it removed.  I had an ultrasound last week and they said the mass is a little smaller than an orange.  My blood work reveals that my cancer leaves look good, but my Hcg levels are continuing to be higher than the doctors would like (At 8 weeks they were 130,000 and and 9 weeks they were 156,000).  I've been wondering what the risk would be for the baby, but am not getting any straight answers.  Everyone says it's possible that I might lose the baby, but I'm not clear as to how possible that is.  Is it like a 5% chance of hurting the baby or more like 80% chance?  They are wanting to operate when I am 12 weeks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, As i am a recent entrant to Doctors lounge, this reply is too belated for you as you were 10 weeks into pregnancy in april 2009 when you had this query. Each year, over 75,000 pregnant women in the United States of america undergo nonobstetric surgery.The indications are varied - some related to pregnancy in some way and others none. When necessary, surgery may be performed during pregnancy with maternal safety. Potential adverse effects for the fetus include spontaneous abortion (maximal in 1st trimester) preterm delivery (maximal in 3rd trimester) intrauterine growth restriction (anytime in pregnancy) Your obstetrician was right in suggesting surgery at 12 weeks.I assume the cyst was a 'complex' cyst on USG. Neonatal mortality is 90% at 25 weeks' gestation and drops to less than 15% by  week 30. How are you? What is the latest? Please let me know.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Splash and crash - definition",
    "content": "Hi srulikg, Thank you for a very interesting question. In obstetric practice, frequently a very urgent Cesarian section is needed when there is very severe fetal distress.The jargon \"Splash and crash\" comes into the pictue here.  Let me try to explain... Normally when any surgery is performed in the OR without any particular hurry(elective surgery or any not-so-urgent surgeries), the client's skin is prepped with an antiseptic solution which is painted onto the skin at leisure and allowed to remain on the patient's skin for about 3 minutes or so. Then the skin incision is made.This, for the sake of discussion, let us call as \"prep and cut\".  When the situation is very urgent (a dire emergency), ie; if the \"Decision-to-Incision\" time is very short, then the surgery may have to be performed in a rather unconventional fashion -ie:the \"splash-and-cut\"  or 'splash and crash\" prep.  In this situation one may not paint the antiseptic slowly, but rather pour it onto the skin( in the real situation,the painting is done in haste,but not really 'poured' or 'splashed' as implied!) and then incise the skin. This situation is in no way unique to cesarian sections but to other emergencies as well. The deciding factor is the \"direness\" of  the emergency!!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear CRBrooks,  There are many unanswered questions that are presented through your post regarding your mother's post surgical pain, swelling and questionable complications.  While plantar fasciitis is not an uncommon complaint among adults today, surgical intervention is not as common.  I would be interested in knowing several things in order to perhaps steer you toward the answers you are seeking:  How old is your mother?  Why was surgery the elected treatment option?  Does she have other underlying medical problems?  Is she a diabetic?  Does she have peripheral vascular disease? Does she have any cardiac problems?  What was the immediate post op period of time like for her?  Was she compliant with the treatment plan? When the doctor \"used a doppler\", was it a hand held variety in his office or an official ultrasound of her leg done at a facility?  What relieves (if any) her swelling? Is the leg/foot the same color as the other leg? If the doppler was not a formal ultrasound, I would certainly suggest that you consider asking your MD for a referral to the local outpatient clinic or the local Emergency Room to have that done. Your next course of action would be based on those results.  If your doctor is not available to issue a referral, you may consider taking her to the local Emergency room and ask the ER MD to evaluate the leg. Hope that is of some help. Marceline\n\n",

    "content": "All -     I broke my ankle about a month ago. It was a closed fracture but the orthopedic surgeon had to open my leg in two places to set the break. She installed a 12 inch plate with 10 screws on one side and just two screws on the other. A week later we removed the surgical cast, the wounds looked pink and healthy, little bit of bleeding. The orthopedist put on a fiberglass walking cast. About a week later the cast starting smelling really bad. I went to my scheduled appointment two weeks after the walking cast got put on, the X-Rays looked good, I asked the Dr. to replace the cast so it didn't smell so bad, when it was cut off the bigger surgical cut (~12\") was bright read and had several greenish-yellowish ulcers. We replaced the fiberglass cast with a Aircast and I started taking 2000mg of cephalexin/day. Also started careful wound care, replacing the bandages, cleaning with saline, etc. There wasn't a change in a couple of days so I went and had a culture done. 4 days later the culture came back as MRSA. The doc switched me to Septra DS, 1600mg/day.       As far as I can tell a MRSA infection after metal has been left in the body can be very, very dangerous. What can I do at home to increase the likelihood of eliminating the infection as soon as possible?      Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I am two weeks post a full tummy tuck with a small amount of liposuction. They removed about 5lbs of fat.  I live on an island and flew quite a ways to have this procedure done.  I healed beautifully and came home with the only precaution being to keep my wounds sterile, finish out my antibiotics, watch for infection, and have my navel stitches removed.  I was told I would likely develop seroma and that my doctor could drain it.  My drains were removed 48 hours post operation.  I am aware that the body reabsorbs fluid.  My question is this:  my practitioner is not comfortable draining the fluid I have.  This is a military installation.  My only other option is going to the local ER where none of the doctors speak English and paying for it fully out of pocket.  That is quite costly for something so simple.  But this is quite a bit of fluid--2 or more cups even.  Is it necessary?  I have read up on seroma and I don't think there is a woman I could find with so much fluid that was not having it aspirated.  Yet the condition is benign...would it be harmful to do nothing at all?  I can live with the discomfort, but of course I want to heal well!  My surgery was ideal in healing other than this.  I did not even require pain medication and I get around fine--no pain at all.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, A seroma is a collection of serous fluid in surgical wounds in the postoperative period forming a pocket like swelling.  They may be resolve spontaneously as the body absorbs this serous fluid over time, which may be in weeks. However, if it is large, surgeons may prefer to drain the fluids to fasten the recovery and avoid complications although others do not recommend doing so.  The critical point is the fact that it is a good media for bacterial growth and if infection occurs an abscess will be formed. This would mandate a different treatment approach with antibiotics and possibly surgical drainage. And in this case the wound may heal in a non desirable cosmetic result.  I would advise you to seek direct medical consultation. Meanwhile try to carefully follow strict local antiseptic measures and if your doctor has prescribed you an antibiotic course, please follow his instructions taking the full course.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

I wanted it aspirated obviously since I was in a lot of discomfort.  Upon attempting to aspirate it he discovered it was a hematoma.  They removed 490 cm (aproximately 17 fl oz or just above 2 cups) of blood.  This did a lot to improve my mobility though afterwards the empty space is surprisingly painful.  Other than that the scars and swelling look great.  My incision is almost invisible, the healing is remarkable for only 16 days post op.  I hope this helps anyone who may have had a similar problem.  The hematoma is apparently not a problem at all.   Of course it will more than likely return, but the doctor said in not such a great quantity.  I will only have it aspirated again if I experience similar discomfort.  Otherwise I will let it absorb.  Thanks again for your response.\n\n",

    "content": "I got breast implants in 2005 or 2006. After I got home from the surgery and my breasts healed my right breast still was hurting and not healing right. After about five months I started getting red spots on my breast underneath. The red spots got worse. Then the red spots turned into holes. I had to go back in and get the implants removed because of infection. Well when they took the implants out they had to cut out my muscle in my right breast. They had to sew up the big hole I had underneath. After I healed I went back in and got new ones put back in. They never removed the stitches they put in and my skin grew over them. Finally my husband pulled them out. Well now I have a big scar there that is really tender. Well then last year they started leaking so I had to go get new ones put in. Well I was just wondering if there is anyway to regrow the muscle they cut out so that I don't have to wear an implant in my right breast for the rest of my life.\n\n",

I have personally seen a metal freeway post impaled through a patients neck and survived. The post was cut and we delivered him to surgery where the post was removed and the patient survived without incident. It should be said regardless of injuries that a tetanus shot and antibiotics would be part of the treatment plan as well as x-rays. I would not let something like that go untreated as there is a very good chance for infection. If left untreated the person could develop septicemia (blood poisoning) and die.  I hope this answers your question,  Paul\n\n",

    "title": "Worried! Post op complications- ulnar nerve surgery-elbow",
    "content": "Age: 36 Sex: Female Past Surgeries: Dequervains tendonitis (wrist- thumb side), neuroma (left wrist, thumb side), 3 ulnar nerve compression surgeries- left elbow. Medical problems/Disease: None. I don't have diabetes, heart problems etc. Medication:  Ortho Tri Cyclen Birth Control  Here is some background. Sorry this is so long..  I had surgery for ulnar nerve compression, left elbow, on May 1st. This is my third surgery for this problem. First surgery- decompression. Second surgery- medial epicondylectomy ( I think the small bone in this area was removed or shaved down?) and third surgery decompression.  My other surgeon retired so I am going to a plastic surgeon (not a hand surgeon) that is new graduate, 11 months experience. I've gone through two surgeries with this new surgeon.  The surgeon used dissolvable stitches.  The surgeon discovered that the nerve close to the funny bone area was curled or kinked, lot's of scar tissue. I'm not sure exactly what was done but from what I understand decompression.  Since surgery I've experienced many problems with excessive swelling. The swelling wasn't disappearing even though I raised my arm, ice packs on affected areas etc. After 5 days it became bad along with pain and fingers were tingling. I headed to the ER. They figured the surgery dressing was on way too tight, there was some bleeding, and they reapplied another lighter bandage.   I did see the surgeon a few days later for my first follow up and she heard what happened and said similar. The nurse took off the bandages.I noticed around the funny bone area, part of the incision was bumpy or raised and a small gap that was bleeding.  I figured maybe this was normal, nothing to worry about. They reapplied a small gauze pad over the incision.  By the next day my swelling was increasing again. I raised it up on pillows, iced the area. This went on for another four days. My arm, hand, fingers were purple-pink color. Fingers were tingling.  I had an appt with my family doctor for something else and he saw my arm and took off the dressing. It was full of blood. The incision was bleeding in about four spots. They looked like small gaps, sores. The rest of the incision was reddish looking but he didn't think it was an infection, almost bloody thin line along the incision. He cleaned it and applied another dressing. Family doctor said he had no idea but he would contact the surgeons office to get me in sooner.  The swelling is about double the size of my normal hand.  So today I saw the surgeon. She seemed  angry that I was wearing a dressing and asked me why. I explained to her the above and was told she never heard directly from my doctor. She took off the dressing, it was bloody and still oozing. She seemed annoyed and said I don't understand this.You had surgery two weeks ago. I used dissolvable stitches. I've never seen this or had this happen with a patient before.  She asked if I had been bending my arm too high etc. I told her no that I followed your directions and only bend it slightly. I'm careful with it.  Basically I was told \"I don't know and I'm not worried.\" And next I was told to phone her if I have any more bleeding or swelling.  My question...  Is it possible for excessive swelling to disrupt the incision or cause problems that I am experiencing? Or possibly something else? My hand, fingers and elbow are still swollen.   I did have the small gap in the incision near the funny bone area 5 days after surgery that was bleeding at the time. Since then four more areas have opened up along the incision line.  I'm healthy otherwise. I don't have diabetes, heart problems or any other disease.  Thank you for your help!\n\n",

I keep it clean and covered with gauze pads. I've been to the surgeon for a 3-4 follow ups and the response each time is \"I don't know, strange.\"   I'm considering a second opinion since this is not getting better.  The past few days they feel quite irritated, burning type pain although it doesn't look infected as in no pus.  I have no idea what is causing this but it is frustrating.  I've had prior surgeries for ulnar nerve compression, one with dissolvable and another with removable stitches and never experienced this.\n\n",

    "title": "Swelling on top of skull",
    "content": "Something like a month ago I noticed a swelling on my head. It feels kinda hard and doesn't hurt, but I do feel pressure sometimes or itch. I cant say if that's because I noticed it, or because it comes from the thing itself. The position of it is located on top of the head, close to the middle, just before the head starts to get round an go down. The thing is, since it's quite hard I'm somehow not able to say if it's something connected to my skull or is loose from my skull. If I push on it, it does give me more pressure on my head compared to when i push on other parts on my skull though.   I will shortly also describe another problem I had, that might or might not be related. Starting one month ago I started to feel more tired then normal, and this occurred especially in the evening or afternoon. The more time passed, the more intense this became. I also sometimes started not to feel a certain part of my face (close to my right eye at the side of my head). This also slowly increased and sometimes I started to not feel a part of my righteye and even my cheek. Friends told me it might be overexhaustion (is this the right word? I'm not from an english country). 2 Weeks ago after my exam period ended, I travelled to my mothers house the same day, and when I arrived on the station there I collapsed or had a blackout or something. The people from there brought me to the nightcare (hospital service in the weekend) and there they quickly did some tests on me to see how my brain reacted to them (10 different tests). The doctor said she had a feeling that it would be overexhaustion, since i study at a university, swim a lot for sport, play games around 2-3 hours a day and travel often to my parental home. After some rest these symptoms became less (the lack of feeling on my face), but i stayed quite tired and felt this bump on my skull pressuring sometimes (not painfull though). I noticed this bump because I often started to massage parts of my head in this period, and then linked the possibility of this bump having to do something with it.   Am I worrying about this for no reason? If not, what steps should I take?\n\n",

    "content": "I had my gallbladder removed through laproscopy due multiple gallstones. This was done on November 8th 2008. Within two weeks the incision wounds healed but pain around the incision area remained.  After a month I rejoined my official duties, for which I had to travel extensively for two to three days. On this journey incision wound just below my chest (which was only a scar by then) started bulging out and sooner started oozing out blood and pus. On my doctor's advice i out it dressed up and had two different anti-biotic tabs. But even after two months now the wound is still not healed.  I was asked to undergo blood test twice. But the results were normal. Now, i find a two lumps - one just below wound (incision point) below the chest, and another just below the belly button. The lump below the chest is not painful but when i press it a fluid oozes out the wound above it. The lump below the bellybutton has a piercing pain when i touch it or otherwise too. I find it difficult to wear my trousers due to this lump as it just under the buckle of my trousers. What are these lumps?  Infections or something else? Do i have to undergo a surgery again on this?\n\n",

Sciatica, inflammation of the sciatic nerve may cause significant pain in the lower back extending down the back of one or both thighs. I'm not implying that this is the causative factor but if these are the symptoms she is experiencing I would suggest that she have an evaluation by an orthopedic specialist. I hope this has been somewhat helpful. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "title": "Surgery for umbilical hernia gone awry",
    "content": "I am a 41 year old male that recently had surgery to correct an umbilical hernia that I had all my life. My hernia was never life threatening as I was told it could become, but as I got older it became more than just an \"outy\" it had gotten larger to the point where I was getting self conscience about it, so I decided to have it fixed. I had done allot of research about umbilical hernia's and learned that there were two common procedures to repair it, the first was to simply suture the hernia shut and the second procedure was to apply a mesh material over the opening. The mesh procedure is 95% effective while the \"tension\" procedure has a 50% reoccurrence rate. I had discussed this with my surgeon and he said that if the hernia was small then he would just simply suture it closed - and that's what he did.  Six months later the hernia has ripped open and is worse now than it ever was before! I am in constant pain and I can barely move around or bend over. It feels like my stomach muscles have been severed and my guts are just being held in by my skin.   Now what? Do I ask to have the surgery again? This operation cost me several thousand dollars and I have no more money to pay for more surgery. Any advice would be helpful. Thank you.\n\n",

It has been about two and a half months now and I am actually still feeling pain and burning sensations from the inflammed and irritated skin.  I am really worried that perhaps the pain will not go away?  I have seen a dermatologist and he said it looks okay but I keep telling him I still feel pain in that area.  I have also thought about the idea of perhaps surgically removing the inflammed skin?  The bottom line is I am really having a hard time dealing with this issue and sometimes the pain is really excruciating.  Thank you very much for your help.  I really appreciate it.\n\n",

    "content": "Where to begin,  In 2007 I was diagnosed with internal/external hemmeroids.  I had a banding procedure done, to no avail.  Then went to a specialist who performed a PPH operation on them in 2008.  Also to no avail.  Then later in 2008 had an extremely large (at this point) external hemmeroid removed.  Now over a year later, my stool still comes out either soft/liquid form, or if there is shape to it, it seems to be flattened and VERY difficult to pass.  Often causing rectal bleeding (spotting) and a CONSTANT liquid discharge (to the point I am wearing Gauze when I leave the house).  This discharge is also causing a rash of a sort (very dry skin all around rectal area, often flaking and itching horribly).  I have also noticed that where the doctor had closed the hemmeroid, there is now a large bulbous layer of skin which overlaps the rectum (wasn't there before the surgery) and seems to be part of the \"blockage\".    I have tried fiber (up to 40G a day), with no noticeable difference.   The only time I noticed a regular bowel movement was the brief time i used a protein suppliment (whey protein 250g a day).  I've had ultrasounds done, Small Bowel follow throughs, xrays, colonoscopies, and MANY MANY finger probes (not a good time) throughout this process and still have no relief of the originial symptoms (bleeding/itching/urgency to have movement, with little to no result, either no/little substance to a movement, and very difficult time even passing liquid through my anus.  I've been ruled out for chron's and the other major disease, and been stated that it was either hemmeroids or \"spastic rectum\" from the scar tissue of previous surgeries.  ANY advise here would be appreciated on how/what/who to see to get this problem fixed  Thank you in advance  Roger Grogan\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I may have gone too far, but I could not anything else on this.  Procaine (Novocaine) is broken down into para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA, a para B-vitamin), and diethylaminoethanol (DEAE), if entered the body. (even with local anesthesia this could happen). The two substances are naturally present in our body.  In 1980 Prof. Aslan was experimenting the use of procaine on patients with severe arthritis by injecting it into the arteries supplying the affected joints and surprisingly 5 cases with markedly gray hair showed dramatic hair color change.  Studies went after to confirm the effect and find a mechanism for this action, and prof. Zvak (1986) confirmed that large doses of PABA can darken Grey hair; but the effect is reversible in 3-4 weeks of stopping the treatment.  No one could explain the mechanism and for my knowledge no reported skin color change. But the fact that this effect is variable seen in people treated with the drug, make it logic to consider a possible effect on the skin color too in hypersensitive people.   Add a few more facts: -Skin color changes, e.g. blue-green pigmentation may occur as phototoxic reaction to drugs. -PABA  is known to be photosensetizer and allergic reactions have been reported in those who use local SUN screens containing PABA.  But why it affected only your hands is not so clear to me.   Skin color changes, e.g. blue-green pigmentation may occur as phototoxic reaction to drugs. Thus if we assumed that you are allergic to PABA and the drug is known to be photosensetizer , may be because your hands were exposed to light more than other parts of the body, the reaction was evident. In addition the stress and fear and blood loss may result in peripheral vasodilatation that more blood has gone into your extremities thus more possible drug exposure.  In any case, I would advise you to warn your Doctor when anesthesia is being considered that you might be allergic to  PABA.  If anybody else has a better explanation - please feel free to add it to this post.  Best regards,  References: =========== - Aslan, A.

I have hypothyroid, which is being treated with Synthroid.  My first episode was the most dramatic. Last year in May, I was hiking in Arches National Park, Utah. My family and I were rushing up and down the hills, trying to get to a specific arch to watch the sunset. It was chilly outside so I had on a polar fleece jacket. Suddenly, I felt too warm, flushed, light headed and nauseous. I took off my sage colored jacket to a gasp from my husband. My arms, from my fingertips to my forearms were the same color as the jacket. I sat down to catch my breath. When I was feeling a bit stronger, we continued on to the arch. Slowly, the greenish color drained from my arms and was replaced by the natural/healthy normal peachy color of a Caucasian. Since this initial occurrence, I have started to turn green in my fingers and it sometimes reaches my forearms. Each episode lasts no more than an hour and my natural color slowly returns. I feel fatigued and weak for a day or so afterwards. The green is generally accompanied by a flushed feeling and I am warm at the time,\n\n",

    "content": "Sir,   About 11 months ago i had undergone fistulectomy for a fistula near anus opening(More than half  part of fistula was on the outside and rest was just little inside on the soft sensitive skin of anus opening).I had undrgone this surgery in Dubai,UAE. I was discharged next day and was on medications for about a week. The wound has healed completely on the outside area but i feel little soiling/irritating sensation sometimes around a small area just near the anus opening where surgery was performed(the inner soft skin on the anus opening) after i pass my stools and it goes away after some time.  Also some part near that area is still hard after the surgery.Will this hardness disappear or will it remain forever.I feel this is due to surgery.  I drink lot's of water and eat more fibre but sometimes if i eat little spicy food and when i pass my stools the next day that surgical area of anus opening burns more than the other normal side which has not undergone surgery as if that surgical area has not healed completely. This soft skin area is also more reddish when i see it by spreading it by my fingers.I don't have any symptoms of pain as before.When i sit it doesn't feel 100 percent normal as before on that side.  I just want to know if this is normal condition after surgery and if the healing process is still going on around that area. I am just worried about the time it is taking to become normal. Or will it never be as original as before. THANKS.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 44 year old male with hypertension. I currently am taking 10 mg of Lisonopril daily. On Oct.24th I had hernia surgery. (not laproscopic) Everything went well. It looked completely healed after about 3 weeks. Well, about the 5th week, the incision split open and began draining a pinkish clearish substance. I saw the surgeon and he gave me an antibiotic and had me keep a dry gauze on it. About Jan. a suture began protruding from the incision area, i called the doc and he had me come in. He numbed me up and removed the suture. since then i get this lippy thing along with the oozing. Each time I see the doc, he cuts the lippy thing off, and bandages me up and has me come in the following week. So far he has cut on me 3 times to remove the lippy thing( he called it something, but i forget what that is). So it has been about 6 months, i still have the draining, and i still get the lippy thing. Can anyone tell me if this is something to be concerned about? What the heck is up? I just had my gall bladder removed 3 weeks ago, and everything healed up fine. Thanks for any help.\n\n",

Prior to the surgery I weightlifted and ran at least 4 day/week. Four weeks after the surgery, I started exercising again. Mainly running, but I did start weight lifting 3 times/week. Light weights, and only exercises that don't put strain on my stomach. This morning, I may have done a little too much. I am careful to monitor how much weight I am lifting and adjust until I feel okay (generally, I try to lift light weights, high # of repetitions versus lifting heavy weights, moderate # of repetitions as I did before the surgery). However, I think I might have added to much weight. A few hours later, the area of my hernia hurts. It's not excruciating, just dull and constant, like the way the hernia hurt prior to the surgery. I know it's not anything I ate (I had a veggie salad and fruit salad for lunch) so I'm assuming it's the hernia. Is it possible that I've pushed through the stitches? Is there anyway to be sure before I see my doctor? I'm schedule for my 8-week followup on May 21, should I see her sooner?\n\n",

Since I am so \u2018sensitive\u2019, he stops doing that any more.  I had a minor surgery recently. My surgeon gave me an antibiotic during the surgery. After the surgery, she prescribed ciproxin. I had taken ciproxin without problems. However I got itchy skin and felt like there was something in my throat four hours after I had taken one. She gave me a shot and stopped the medication. She also told me that I could die either taking or not taking antibiotics. Is it that serious? She also told me that I would be in deep trouble if I got an infection. Is there a way to solve this dilemma?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: taking or not taking antibiotics after surgery?",
    "content": "Hi doraemo, Firstly few of my personal thoughts regarding drug allergies... Many-a-time i wonder if a client is really allergic to a particular medication or not.Often, a person an consuming a certain medication experiences some 'feeling' which may not be in reality a drug allergy(but it gets so dubbed).It is possible that it was an isolated incident or an adverse drug reaction. Even in hospitals this scenario is frequently seen. For example: a client is administered a 'test dose' of a certain drug, following which a leading question is put to him/her such as \"do you feel any itch at the site of the injection?\".Some clients come to believe that there is some itch (although they may not  have felt it had it not been for the leading question!).Once again that drug gets dubbed as causing 'allergy'. One other way it happens is that the 'test' dose is not administered properly (subcutaneously instead of intradermally), resulting in a swelling which again gets dubbed as 'allergy'!. Once it is dubbed as allergy,it remains so for ever because no clinician would like to take the risk of trying to disprove it!!  I am not aware of any certain way of  finding out which antibiotics one is not allergic to. Usually a 'test' dose is given either by intradermal route or subconjunctival route. Treatment of any allergic reaction should be readily available on hand. Considering your medical history, antibiotics may be unavoidable in certain situations.The only way out is a test dose and then to identify a \"real allergic reaction\" from a \"spurious\" allergic reaction!!  Thank you for this very thought provoking post.\n\n",

    "content": "I have a lump under my left arm which is breast tissue and I was wondering if it's possible for me to get the breast tissue removed from under my arm and then put into my left breast? My left breast is a bit smaller than my right one and I'm thinking this is because a fair bit of the breast tissue is under my arm. If this could be put into my left breast it would make it more symmetrical with the right breast.  Is this procedure possible to do? Would there be any complications with doing this?  I wanted to get the lump removed from under my arm because it is very noticeable but I was thinking instead of discarding the tissue, it could be put into my breast to make the size more similar to my other one.  Do you think I should do this or just get the tissue taken out from under my arm and leave it at that?  Any advice on this would be much appreciated. Thanks! :-)\n\n",

Even if it is grafted (in theory), whether it will be a successful 'take' can't be predicted. Even if the 'take' were to be successful, how it may behave in its new environment also can't be predicted. There is not sufficient evidence(as far as my knowledge goes) at present that it is safe or that it can be routinely recommended.You may consult an expert in this field to get more authentic info.I hope my reply might help you in your discussions with the expert.Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Cowboy6gun,  Your inguinal hernia should be evaluated by your physician.  In some cases, with monitoring, a small hernia can be reduced and managed without surgery.  However, if it enlarges or twists, it can be a medical emergency.  Your symptoms suggest that your hernia is large enough to be putting pressure on your bladder/pelvic area.  Going to the doctor will give you information based on actual evaluation, and you can decide your best course of action after that.  It's normal to have anxiety regarding surgery, so also discuss your concerns with your doctor.  Some of the issues you fear in surgery may not be based on fact.  Good luck to you,\n\n",

It has been explained that while not normal the best assumption is that the deep incisional pain is not healing as typically expected and to give it more time and manage with pain meds. The explanation given led my husband and I to believe that the muscles in the abdomen had been cut as a routine part of the surgery and that was taking longer to heal. However, doing my own research since receiving that explanation seems to indicate that muscle is not cut during a lap chole. We are confused as to what might be causing the pain. Any ideas?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi determined, Lap chole, although is a minimal access surgery, involves varying degrees of manipulation of the ports during the procedure.The degree of manipulation varies from case to case.Also, the technical procedure may vary depending on various factors such as the disease itself, body habitus of the patient, variations in anatomy Etc.As you had undergone the surgery very recently,i feel that you may only need to wait patiently for the pain to go away in a week or two.Please consult your specialist if you feel that the pain is worsening.Cheers!\n\n",

Diagnostic studies could be completed on the area that is weeping to ascertain if an underlying infection is present. Typically if an incision is infected the area will be red, warm to touch and the drainage would be purulent (appearing like pus). If the area you are referring to is still causing concern I would suggest that you return to your specialist. Best wishes! Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

In case that is not feasible, next choice would be to consult another obstetrician.For a wound that is weeping,creams or ointments may not be suitable. Regular wound dressings(absorbent) would be a better choice.Hope the sore will heal soon & i wish you luck!\n\n",

    "title": "Finger Distraction Lengthening",
    "content": "Okay, when I was 4 years old I smashed my pinky finger in a door at daycare. They took me to a hospital and the doctor wanted to amputate it down to the first knuckle but my mother didn't want to amputate. So they found a doctor who pretty much just sewed it up, keeping the distal part of my finger. They said the finger was not broken but it was about half an inch shorter than my other pinky finger. So here I sit eighteen years old with a short disfigured pinky which is indeed broken and missing the end of the bone. I don't know if overtime when the bone developed it just wasn't there or what. It does not hurt or bother me but I am not comfortable with the way it looks. I found a website online that had a procedure that lengthened a finger very very similar to mine by using a palatal expansion clamp and intercalated bone graft. I don't know if this procedure has a certain name or not. The problem is that I cant find a surgeon who does this. The website was eatonhand.com but I just found it by typing \"finger distraction lengthening\" into a search engine. It shows pictures of before during and after the procedure that might give whoever is interested in helping me a better understanding of what I am talking about and how my finger looks. If anyone knows any surgeons that can help me out it would be great help. Like any girl I dream of getting married one day and showing my engagement ring of to everybody without them noticing and asking \"Oh my gosh! What happened to your finger?!?!\".\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Kirstin2009,  I am really sorry about that.I understand your urgency in getting your finger back to its original shape.However, i would advise you to consider carefully the pros and especially the cons.With all the most modern techniques available, a surgeon may not be able to re-create your little finger to look as authentic as the one in your other hand.The little finger contributes only about 10% to the overall hand function.Ray Amputation of the said finger with removal of the head of the related metacarpal bone would result in a cosmetically acceptable hand.you have to choose carefully between a repaired, but less than satisfactory repair(which again may be commented upon during during the marriage ceremony) and an amputation which may be more cosmetic in the long run without significant loss of function.I personally would have advised my daughter (if she were in a similar situation) the latter choice.

They would be in the best position based on his condition to honestly answer questions (please ask). One use of a pacemaker is it essentially can adjust the faulty electrical system in the heart to speed up the heart rate when it is a lower than the normal rate. I hope this information is helpful.

    "content": "Hello --  While this sort of symptom isn't unheard of after a lap chole procedure, it does sound as though there may be an infection going on. Whether or not it involves a leaking bile  duct is quite another matter, and this needs to be clarified and resolved at once if it is the case. A leaking duct versus nerve damage is far too great a spread of possibility. I think it's time for you to seek a second opinion with a surgeon who can best determine what's going on and what's needed to resolve it. It's impossible to know, at this distance and given the possibilities, what might actually be going on, but your MD has thrown more doubt than light on the whole thing.  Please udate us as to the outcome. Hopefully nothing serious is going on. I think it will require consult with a qualified surgeon to clear this up. Good luck to you.\n\n",

I'm relieved you had no further complications from this, and hope the right-sided discomfort soon resolves. It's very possible it could be an irritated nerve, although it shouldn't actually be injured. The pressure due to pumping the abdominal cavity full of gas to inflate the work area can sometimes cause lingering nerve irritation, especially if some gas becomes trapped in the upper right quadrant.  Interesting for sure. Some people just seem to have all the luck. Hope yours has changed for the better!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi all,  First, thanks in advance for your assistance.  I received stitches (3 on the bridge of my nose, 1 on the side of my nose and 2 on my upper cheek, beneath my eye) on Sunday evening of this week. Admittedly, I had just gotten back from a beer fest and in my less than stable walking state managed to trip and fall onto an umbrella stand around a pool deck. I don't recall a whole lot of the information shared with me by the ER doc, not as a result of mental trauma unless alcohol consumption qualifies.  Anyway, I have removed my own sutures before and plan to do it again instead of drive the 100 miles back to the hospital. The question I have is when should the stitches be removed? I remember something about 7 days, but much of the reading I have found has suggested that for the purposes of reducing facial scarring, 3-5 days is more appropriate. The wounds overall are pretty superficial with the nose being the only wound that I felt really needed stitches - the doctor had apparently first agreed since he only applied novacaine to the nose and did the other stitches as an after thought without any numbing (that may have been to get revenge for my obnoxious drunken antics, looking back though...)  So, from a scarring perspective - is there any danger to leaving the sutures in for seven days, or should I remove them sooner?  Many thanks from a normally responsible, but in the rare instance not so much guy.  Andrew\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Andrew,  Sorry to hear of your accident.  certainly sutures that are left too long may contribute to an unsatifactory cosmetic result.  the face has an excellent blood supply and healing is rapid so sutures should not be required for a long period and about 5 days should suffice.  It may be slightly earlier or later that sutures are removed so I think 7 days will not really worsen your scar.  there are other factors contributing to suture scar result such as size of suture, the placement and tension and how good an approximation of skin edges was achieved.  I think anything more than 7-8 days and the risk of scarring from the suture tracks go up. hope this helps  all the best sunil\n\n",

    "content": "Hello trouble81158,  You may have already found the answer to your question about masturbation after total laparoscopic hysterectomy.  While it is not unsafe to masturbate within a few days of surgery, the resulting orgasm may not be what you are accustomed to.  Even though there is not a large incision to heal, there has been some trauma to the pelvic area which may effect orgasm.  Your doctor would be the best judge to discuss your particular case with you.  Good luck,\n\n",

    "content": "Hello there,  Your description does indeed appear to be that of an infected sebaceous cyst. These are sometimes given the other names keratin or epidermal cyst. A cyst is the medical term for a fluid filled closed sac. In a sebaceous cyst the fluid content consists of a white, semi-solid material known as sebum, said to resemble cottage cheese in appearance and consistency. Sebum is secreted from the sebaceous gland to lubricate hair shafts and is responsible for the oily nature of hair. Sebaceous glands arise around the sites of hair follicles and thus will often be found where hair grows, most commonly on the scalp, neck, back, face, and arms. They are not found on the palms of the hand or soles of the feet due to the lack of hair follicles there.    Blocked glands are the most common cause of sebaceous cysts; however it is apparent that some individuals are more susceptible to developing sebaceous cysts than others.  These cysts are not painful on their own, but can become painful if an infection develops as seems to have occurred in your case. The treatment of a symptomatic sebaceous cyst is to either leave it alone or surgically excise it, after which it should not recur. However if has become infected a course of antibiotics is needed to eradicate the microbes causing the infection before considering excision. Most importantly if this turns out to be your diagnosis then you need not worry about it. My advice would be to see a doctor in person to examine it and take samples if pus is being produced from the cyst. Treatment with antibiotics may be started and a plan to excise it could be made then and there.    Kind Regards,  Dr Tino Solomon BSc(Hons) MBBS Senior House Officer in Surgery\n\n",

I think I look pretty good other than the fact I have the real nasty loose skin on my lower abdomen. It's embarrassing! I can't wear certain bathing suits, clothes, etc... I don't feel comfortable naked in front of anyone. I am single and have been for about 2 years now, so that isn't the issue at the moment. But it's a personal issue. I don't like being 29 years old and not liking what I see in the mirror. So that was a little history.   I'm curious to know if I were to get the surgery (abdominoplasty / breast lift (without implants) ), could a tubal ligation be performed during the surgery? Also, I'm pretty sure insurance doesn't cover the plastic surgery, but do you think if I were having the tubal ligation at the same time, they would pay for the anesthesia and/or some other fees as well? Partial payment? Also, would you recommend me waiting till my little one is a little older due to the fact of healing time afterward, or would I be able to care for her at home after the first few days of recovery? I'd just like a little advice if you could. Thanks so much for your time!\n\n",

Also, I would not do that unless I had first done serious exercising, perhaps with a personal trainer who could help you achieve whatever might be possible prior to surgical intervention.  Usually they do not combine procedures such as these due to infection and complication risks, but you could discuss it with your doctor and it might be possible. However, sometimes insurance denies an otherwise covered procedure when it is combined with cosmetic, elective surgery like this.  It is because they realize it may be your motivation for the other procedure.    Of course before such a drastic measure you should also be absolutely certain you do not want more children.  All too often a single woman later enters a relationship where her new husband really wants children and she regrets this decision.  I would consider something reversible first until you are absolutely sure.  Best wishes.\n\n",

(actually it was retrograde seen in the CT done on addmission May 2008 but it was not the leading symptom that time)    then i underwent Biopsy from the lingual tonsils (laryngoscope under GA)  two lab results showed non specific inflammation!  the doctor advised antacid and mouth wash and avidance of many possible irritating foods and drinks (and single course antibiotic) and low dose of steriods suspension.  but again after three weeks no improvement.  my laboratory (chemestry and blood picture results are within normal!)    now the symtoms begin to increse i feel it day and night and i began to feel that it is limiting my respiration I feel like always i need to make effort to open my airway  I do not know what is behind this, and how it should be treated  I am worried that one day it may cause suffocation due to airway obstruction (especially during sleep) i need to know what should be my next step for diagnosis and treatment  thank you\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  Have you been followed for this by an ENT or just your GP? It sounds as though you have some sort of exudative inflammation of the tonsil which may have spread to involve the glottis (which is a real concern). Usually if antibiotic therapy isn't effective and there is continued sensation of irritation and swelling, steroids are used to try and effect a shrinking of any edema in the airway and to demonstrate a difference in the symptoms. While epiglottitis is almost always an acute medical emergency and not something that develops over time, an inflamed tonsil can produce similar symptoms and certainly warrants medical intervention if only to help resolve the highly unpleasant sensations it can cause. I hope you'll see, if you haven't already, an ENT,  who can evaluate this properly.  Best of luck to you. Please follow up with  us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "HI there --  The tendon probably hasn't ruptured (you'd see some swelling and experience pain on manual flexion of the toe at least, if not redness as well). It may well be irritated, though, due to a little overwork. It's not so much that exercise isn't good for it, but since it's been immobilized and weakened by this, the muscles, tendons, etc., are likely to be more prone to strain and soreness. Some concentration on trying to move the toe might help you tell if there is any sort of damage (it would be unusual) to the repair, because with focus you should be able to at least feel the pull, if not actualy move it at this point. Of course physical therapy (PT) would be helpful, but if you're constrained to be seen at a busy teaching hospital you may not get that far. I'd definitely be aggressive in pursuing PT, however, as the longer the foot in general is underused, the more difficult it is to get things working again. A PT specialist will also be able to tell if there's anything not quite right going on. It's a help, for sure.  I  hope this is helpful. Good luck to you.

    "content": "Hello --  Herniation of muscles of the upper extremities is very rare, but common enough to be easily found in the literature. It seems the primary causes for surgery are cosmetic and to relieve discomfort (in that order). While I've found no causes other than trauma/overuse of the muscle group, I would imagine people with some  form of connective tissue disease might be  more prone to this sort of thing than would others, and of course there's always the possibility of a congenital weakness in the spot for no particular reason. If you're without symptoms and the bulge doesn't bother you or others then it  probably requires no further attention until and unless it begins to cause problems.   Hope this is helpful.

This now has me a little worried as I had shingles about two years ago, which is caused by the immune system being under stress and is somewhat rare for younger people. I was also told by an eye specialist that my eyes are stuck in an immune response cycle which causes them to release gunk in order to clean the eyes, although they are clean. Could these two issues be related to the hernia somehow and will a simple blood test show any connective tissue diseases?\n\n",

    "content": "While shingles is a virally-caused problem that is a sequel to chickenpox (which a person may not even know he's had in the distant past if it were mild enough), there is still a possibility, however remote, that connective tissue disease due to some form of autoimmune disorder, might be related to herniation of the muscle. This can happen with certain CTDs, but there are so many different types I wouldn't dare start throwing around possible types. There are tests for this, first ANA blood testing to see if there are any abnormally present antibodies, and then more specialized tests if that comes out abnormal. It wouldn't hurt to have this done, just to be on the safe side. This way, if you do find you are one of those who carry a heritable CTD/autoimmune defect, at least you can know better what to expect in the future and how to avoid certain injuries, etc. Definitely worth a trip to the doctor for that, yes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  Well something is very likely happening due to the head injury, but we'll need some more information in order to even hazard a guess. Meanwhile, did you have medical attention at the time of the injury? Were there x-rays or other imaging done? Can you tell us what came into contact with your head and otherwise describe the mechanism of injury?  It's an unusual presentation, especially two years post trauma, but it seems very likely, due to the chronology and the location that it's related to the blow to your head. I'm wondering if you didn't maybe suffer a fracture in the occiptal region but affecting a sinus, which may have become blocked or developed a cyst, causing intermittent accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid which then drains, relieving the symptoms, only to come back again  and again. It's just a guess, given how little we know about your mechanism of injury and if there was anything found at the time. It is a reason for concern, for sure, and really should be evaluated by a neurologist, but in the meantime maybe we can help point you in the right direction if you can provide the additonal facts. Meanwhile, please consider having a thorough neurological eval. This just isn't even close to right.\n\n",

He gets a tingling sensation in his mouth 1st, then in the next 2 -3 days his lips, tongue and throat swell and have painful sores. This has been an on going cycle every 3-4 months over 10 yrs. As a result he has not been able to eat well and has lost weight dramatically. He is now 32. This has REALLY been frustrating to our family. Different Drs have diagnosed the condition as Aphthous ulcers. Is this really what it is?? because the symptoms seem much worse than what I have read in the other forums.

    "content": "Hello --  Your brother  seems to have classic apthous stomatitis (recurrent, multiple ulcers of the mouth). It's really a very common condition, and your description is absolutely classic in every respect.   Treatment is generally palliative (that is, treat the symptoms, make the patient comfortable). There are some prescription and over-the-counter medications, as well as any number of home remedies,  all of which work to varying degrees to help ease  the discomfort during outbreaks. One product in particular, GlyOxide, (a combination of hydrogen peroxide and glycerine) was very popular, and differs from  straight  peroxide only in that the glycerine helps keep it where it's placed with the dropper, so it can be more effective than peroxide as a mouthwash. It's harmless and sometimes helps a lot. Also gargling with salt water or placing salt directly on the ulcers can help ease the pain. There are, of course, also oral anesthetic gels available at the drugstore that sometimes work to an extent.  It's a real condition, it's awfully uncomfortable, and the list  of remedies, especially home remedies, is extensive. The condition is  essentially benign, but is  terribly uncomfortable.  I hope this is helpful. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "First of all, it is never healthy to take laxatives on a daily basis or your normal bowel function can be interrupted and begin to be laxative dependent.  However, if this constipation is new, please see a physcian.  Now, depending on what medications you take, some can cause constipation.  For example most narcotic pain meds are the worst to constipate.  Of course, decreased mobility/activity, not enough water intake, not enough fiber/fruits/vegetables can be some of the causes.  However, I would be concerned about some type of bleeding from inside the intestinal tract if you are sure it is not coming from the hemmorhoids themselves.  Constipation will cause hemmorhoids to bleed.  But, if the blood is present and especially if it is bright red blood, this could indicate some type of injury or abnormal growth in the bowel which would require some tests to determine.   The nausea can be caused by the chronic constipation or there could be something going on in the bigger picture.  It would not seem that the blood is coming from the stomach because I am assuming you are seeing red blood.  GI bleeds up higher would present with some darker/black tarry like stools.    Another indication of a bleed in the intestines themselves would be a very very foul odor to the stool that is not the normal smell.  Now, just a question.  What makes you think it is not the hemmorhoids that are bleeding?  However, you cannot tell for sure if the blood is actually inside the stool as well as on the outside.  Please do seek medical attention with a doctor in person for further determination.  I would suspect it is just the hemmorhoids.  However, to be on the safe side and coupled with the fact on a recent onset of constipation, please seek attention.  Debra Van Ness RN\n\n",

    "title": "Should one pacer wire be left completely inside of body...?",
    "content": "Hello,  My father had open heart surgery in December 2007. They replaced his aortic valve and did a triple bypass. Nine months later he noticed a sore on his body located mid torso-ish. The sore was oozing and would not go away. He went to see his primary care physician, who probed it and did a culture. Culture came back with e-coli. He was put on antibiotics. The sore still didn't go away. Went back to PCP, who cut it open, put a drain in it, sent in a biopsy, and put my dad back on antibiotics. Sore drained for a week. Benign biopsy. But, wouldn't go away. Six more visits to the PCP, two more rounds of antibiotics. Sore continued to ooze. PCP sent him to a surgeon (not a heart surgeon). The surgeon cut into the sore and probed around. A minute later he pulled out an eight inch wire. Apparently this was a wire that was put in place after the surgery in case my dad needed a pacemaker to regulate his heart. He did not need a pacemaker. The surgeon had an xray done to see where the other wire might be. Xray did not show another wire. My father now had a staph infection that was treated with antibiotics. The surgeon seemed surprised to find this wire. My mom almost fainted as she watched.  I understand that some heart surgeons put pacer wires in after the surgery in case the heart needs to be regulated. However, these wires are supposed to be removed before the patient leaves the hospital. Is there any reason that one wire would be left completely inside of the body? I have done research and cannot find any reason for this. These pacer wires are supposed to be attached to the heart, with the other ends remaining outside of the body. I cannot see any use for leaving one loose and having it work its way out of the body on its own.  Thank you very much.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  To get straight to the point, somehow the lone wire was left in when it should have been removed at the same time its mate was removed. The only reason I can think of that this would have happened (other than gross human error) would be that this wasn't the entire wire and that perhaps the outer part broke off and was withdrawn. I just can't imagine anyone pulling one wire, then walking away, unless there was some sort of local crisis that broke  out right at the moment the  wires were being removed.   In short, there is no good reason for this. It is a medical error. Thank goodness it was found and removed and that it didn't migrate further inward.  I hope this clarifies this issue for you. Good luck to you and your father.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Amy -  After a year it's unlikely the surgical site has been disturbed, but you may well be more sensitive in that area since some muscles may have been cut or other structures disturbed, so that when you fell it may have caused some delayed soreness. This should have resolved by now (almost two weeks after your post was put up), so if it's still causing you discomfort you should get it checked, but I can't imagine that anything related to the surgery was \"knocked loose.\" The pain may be related, as I said, to sensitivity related to the surgery, but it may also just be muscular pain in the same general area. Falls on the ice are really fast and violent,  so sometimes we get up and keep going and later realize we've pulled something. It's more the trying not to fall, more often than not, that causes the muscle pulls.  I hope this is helpful to you.  Good luck to you and please follow up with us.\n\n",

Any reputable surgeon will go over all the risks associated with the surgery  and would not even propose it as an option is he thought the risks far outweighed the benefits.

    "content": "Hello,  Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common type of sleep-disordered breathing. During sleeping our muscles relax including the throat and the airway muscles but if they collapse they can obstruct breathing during sleep. This can affect all of us temporary during respiratory tract infections but in those who suffer from recurrent attacks that deprive them from good sleeping are said to have sleep apnea SA.   These individuals should be very cautious when have to go for surgery or receive medications. Many drugs and agents used for anesthesia remain in our body in a considerable level from hours to days after their use, thus ASO individuals can be exposed to life-threatening irregularities in breathing. And this is what is exactly happened to you. Even analgesics and sedatives should be minimized if cannot be avoided.  Whether your symptoms are now more frequent as a complication from the operation or not, is really a difficult question to answer. Since many OSA individuals have progressive course without being exposed to your experience.   However being exposed to a serious chest infection and postoperative manipulation may add some weakness to this part of the body and make you at risk of recurrent infections which consequently means more OSA attacks.  In any case you better follow up with your doctor for proper evaluation and management. Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

I did not even have to use the CPAP until the trache incision healed. But soon after the trache incision healed I began having difficulty sleeping again. The apnea has continued to worsen and my ENT thinks it could be due to the hardware in my throat; damage to my respiratory system from the infections; the drugs to maintain the induced coma while intubated; my partially paralized left vocal chord and/or the mild dysphagia that continues to linger on, any one, or all these things. I once again have apnea problems almost as bad as before the CPAP and I am still using it every night. In addition, I now have major problems with \"mouth leak\".  I have a new sleep study scheduled in a couple of weeks and I am waiting for the results and reccomendations from that.  Thank You for your reply George,50\n\n",

The most common one is by direct palpation (the doctor can often tell what is protruding and where, just by probing it with his fingertips). Even if that makes it obvious, it then needs to be precisely located by one of several imaging techniques, depending on just what appears to be herniated. A CT scan with contrast, if it is suspected to be a loop of intestine, is a common way to get a good picture of exactly what's happend. Sometimes an MRI can also help, since it will visualize soft tissue more exactly. A simple x-ray is sometimes all that's needed. It all depends on the initial impression.  From the location of what does sound like a possible hernia, the pain could easily radiate to the other affected areas.   Hopefully you can prod your doctor to examine this more thoroughly or, failing at that, get a consult with a gastroenterologist or internist.   Best of luck to you. Hope this is helpful. Please follow up with us here.\n\n",

    "content": "UPDATE:   Doctor examined me again. He said that whatever was protruding from my rib cage was not a hernia but just a bone. I had surgery there over twenty years ago for a collapse lung and the doctor said that although it looked a bit unusual, it wasn't a hernia. And there was no pain to it.  He also examined me more closely again on my lower left side. He touched me where I felt pain but he didn't think it was a hernia. It hurts from my belly button all the way to my side but he didn't think it was any kind of hernia.  At first, he wanted a colonoscopy done but then he opted for an MRI first for this upcoming Monday.   Mr Kenyon, I know that you don't want to needlessly frighten me but what could the other possibilities be?  It just feels like there is a hand gripping me from inside, like from my belly button to my side. I was hoping that it was a hernia becuase that is common but now I am just wondering what it could be. They did a urine test and I came up fine so it is not infection. Any insight would be greatly appreciated and a kind thanks for your previous response.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: How is a hernia diagnosed?",
    "content": "Hi again -  Well at least it's not a hernia, so that's one thing to scratch off the list. Another one of those crazy coincidences that seem to happen all the time.   So what else could it be? There are a number of things, ranging from the very innocent to the relatively serious, but the law of averages says it is probably something on the lower end of the scary scale. That doesn't mean it couldn't be something further up the scale, only that the odds are against it.  My main reason for equivocating about this isn't to avoid scaring you, since if I thought there was a distinct pattern that suggested something really bad I'd want you to know so you'd be motivated to get it fixed. The problem is there are a lot of possibilities, most of which, as I said, fall toward the lower end of seriousness. Even so, simple things can become complicated over time. One of the (admittedly vague) plusses is that most cancers don't announce themselves with pain. Usually there are other, even more disturbing symptoms that come first, which is why so often a malignancy is missed til it's advanced: unlike most things, cancer tends to start out quietly. On the other hand, you could have a gynecological problem, anything from an ovarian cyst (which is usually a fairly benign, though often pretty inconvenient problem) to a spastic colon, to a muscular injury without herniation, to fibroids, endometriosis, a foreign body (very unlikely, but let's try and cover some ground here), to a pinched nerve that's radiating to distal areas, which can be very confusing to the diagnostic process sometimes. While it is possible the  symptoms you're having could signal something serious (meaning, I believe, \"life-threatening\") I honestly don't feel it sounds much like one of those possibilities but more like one of the things I've listed above. There are a good many other things, relatively innocent, which could be causing this also, but these are some of the things you'll need to have ruled out -- or in. Once this is done, the appropriate treatment can be instituted. It may take a good and dogged diagnostician to figure it out, but that's hardly too much to ask.   I'm glad it's not a hernia, because although those are usually not especially dangerous in and of themselves, they can develop serious complications at times, usually if not corrected in a timely way. Any of the other conditions I mentioned could conceivably require surgical treatment (the \"annoying\" part) but are not, in and of themselves, terribly serious. Pain, discomfort and worry, however, are often serious enough to disrupt one's enjoyment of life. That's reason enough to get to the bottom of this.   Keep after the doctors until this mystery is solved and the problem is managed. I don't think it's especially dangerous, based on the overall impression, but that's only one concern. You deserve relief from the problem, whatever it is.  I hope this helps somewhat. Sometimes the presentation is just too vague or there are too many possibilities, to point at something from a distance and say \"Ah ha!\" However, a peristent patient is a good match with a persistent doctor. Please keep us updated. I think it very likely you're in no immediate danger, but the only thing that's going to make this OK is to know exactly what's going on. Push for answers. As more facts come to light please  don't hesitate to let us know.   My best to you. Please stay in touch.\n\n",

    "content": "MY TRIP TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM  Friday was quite a day for me because my employer was moving upstairs just one floor. However, since almost everybody got laid off, there is hardly a staff anymore (my managers are now out of state). And that Friday I was by myself so I put in a big effort to get the last of the stuff done.  By the time I got home I was exhausted but my wife was running out the door with our two boys to spend the night at her parent's place. That left me with the seven month old and she was cranky. It took a huge effort to get her to finally get to sleep. Then my wife comes home and has lots of groceries to unload so I help unload it.  It is already 9:15PM but not only was I exhausted, I felt that I pullled a muscle too many. I just felt so irregular by 9:45 I told my wife that I was going to the emergency room of a nearby hospital. However, their staff doesn't get to examine me until like 3:00AM. I could hardly walk and I felt a burning sensation of where that hernia so I thought that it must be internal bleeding. Anyway, the reason that I wanted to go was that I felt that sore spot on my side was going to explode and I also felt that there things inside of me snapping.  And I just felt I couldn't wait until Monday for the lab that my primary care physcian was sending me to for a CT scan. And then there was a SNAFU with my insurance and they denied the CT scan so I figured that it would take another day before my doctor and the insurance company sort it out. So I felt that I would wait until Tuesday or so to find out what was wrong with especially since I felt so weird.  The hospital runs a urine, blood test, and eventually the CT scan with that solution going through my body. I was bracing for the worst news.  And then by 7:45AM in the morning a nurse comes into the exam room to give me the results of everything.   I am perfectly fine!!!  The blood, urine, and CT scan showed that EVERYTHING was normal or within range of where it should be. In fact, the nurse was almost of the perception that I was wasting his and the hospital's time (although he didn't directly say that).  Now I am a typical male who is terrified to go to the doctor and I am afraid of medicine. In fact, it took so much courage to check myself into the emergency room and I only did it because I have three screaming kids ages four and under and I wanted to around for them when they grow up.  I am not a hypochondriac or into a lot of drama.  In fact, I don't know what happpened.   According the test results, EVERYTHING is normal. And they have absolutely no clue to why I am experiencing pain because all that results show that everything is normal. As for myself, I cannot refute science. If the results show that it is normal, then I have to assume that the pain that I am experiencing is imaginary.  My only clue may be a month ago when all this started, I made a conscious attempt to avoid anything on the left side of my body figuring that I would make this condition worse. Perhaps in thirty days, there was a lot of atrophy on the left side of my body because of how paranoid I was.  I am not some kind of freak that made this up but I have to accept the findings of science. So today I put more effort into my day (but not as much as Friday) and I am going to keep adding more effort so that the left side of my body is as worked out as my right side (but I won't overdo it like I did this past Friday).   The bottom line is that there is nothing wrong with me. The test results show that I am a normal person. At first I have to admit that I was more disappointed than relieved because the pain I have is so real. However, I am obligated to assume that it is in my head instead of being real.  This is a pretty big shock to me because I am so afraid of doctors and hospitals so getting stuck with needles and tested is not something I do for fun.  So anyway, this is the best possible outcome for me even though I am embarassed. I appreciate your time and effort in responding to my questions. Even though it is weird, that is the best possible outcome for me.\n\n",

    "content": "Well that was a frustrating trip! I'm honestly sorry they didn't find something -- even if it were something stupid -- so you'd have something to hang your hat on. The pain you feel is real. You may have had anything worrisome ruled out, and that's good news, needless to say, but that pain is still there. It may be something so odd and essentially wrong that there is no assignable cause, but that doesn't make it unreal. Hopefully it will slowly (or maybe quickly) resolve and then it can be laid to rest. But don't kick yourself for having done the prudent, reasonable thing. It's a shame it took so long and you came away feeling silly You shouldn't feel that way, but I certainly understand.   It is the best possible outcome, and for that we can all be grateful (especially you). Now the pain, serving no purpose, needs to go away. If it won't, then you'll need to have that managed. It may be, for some strange reason,  an inflamed nerve or something equally innocent. Simple analgesics hopefully would help control it til it's run its course.  So I'm really glad to hear you're fine, but share your frustration. Thanks for the follow up. Enjoy your good health, minus the inexplicable pain.\n\n",

    "content": "UPDATE - I HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED  Shortly after my trip to the emergency room, a lot of things happened; some unrelated. My eyeglasses broke and the lenses were put in the wrong place; I have a lazy eye so years of aligning my eye went up in smoke so my eyes looked warped. I also started slurring a bit of my speech. I also had a bit of a limp when I walked. And then like my left side of my body was different. There was a bit of a burning sensation on my left elbow and there felt like something was grabbing me underneath my left rib cage.  And after I went to my in-laws Halloween party (almost 40 people were there), a few people told my mother-in-law and my wife if I had suffered a stroke.  In early November, my wife told me to go to the emergency room and get a CT scan of my head. At first, I didn't want to go because I had to prepare for a presentation at work and the customer was flying in to see it. I needed to work long hours and the weekend so I could be ready to present it but my wife was adament about it so I went and got checked out. What happened next was a month of hell.  I was immediately admitted to the hospital and spent a week there where I was poked and prodded and eventually given a spinal tap. The CT scan showed spots in my head and in my back. I had lots of test run and so much blood was taken of me.  Overall, the prime suspect was MS but the hospital tried to rule out other stuff like Lupus and Lyme disease. About the last test was the spinal tap and it had to be given twice because the first person who administered it was not able to get enough fluid out of me (it hurt like hell). And it took about three weeks to get the results from that but I was released shortly after the spinal tap.  In the meantime, my wife set up an appointment with one of the top neurologists in town who saw the test results (except the spinal tap) and strongly felt that I had MS. She gave me a strong anti-inflammatory (in an IV, about a gram a day for three days). Afterwards, she recommened that I stay in a rehab hospital for physical therapy and occupational medicine. My big concern was if I was ever going to go work again and drive my car again. Needless to say, I was scared. That second hospital, I stayed for just over a week. I was a mess because my balance was warped and my limp worsened. But I was different than the other patients. They wanted me in wheelchair but I refused. Instead, I used a walker. Several days aferwards, another therapists gave me a cane to use and I used it until I was released. I realized that a big part of this was emotional. My first shower there was a mess because I used the walker for it. However, as I got more confident, I didn't use anything. I eventually improved there was released after staying there for just over a week.  I saw the neurologist again and by then, the spinal tap results were ready which my wife picked them up and took them to the specialist. She confirmed that it was indeed MS so next week I will have to begin a regimen of injecting a medication every other day.  It was probably a \"flare-up\" at that time (I had one bowel and bladder accident and other stuff). For work, my employer was generous and understanding but the customer flew in to review my unfinished work. However, the meeting with the neurologist, the second time, I had my hair cut, I shaved, and wore nice slacks and a good shirt. She said that appearance-wise, I had greatly improved so she wrote a note releasing me back to work (next Monday) and to drive. It had been about 30 days of agony and fear but I am greatly improving. I don't use a cane or a walker now and I feel that my walk is greatly improving. I practiced driving this Saturday (my dad was with me).  I am totally ignorant about MS so any recommendations of web sites and literature will be greatly appreciated. I am still in shock. About four years ago, I went to a neurologist about a tingling sensation in my hands but he didn't listen to half of what I said. He thought that it was a vitamin defiency and believed that this would go away on its own. And since I am a technical writer, I thought that this could have been Carpal Tunnel Syndrome so I never took it to the next level of examination. I hope those years of delay didn't cause more harm. I am happy that I can go back to work and drive but I need to learn more about this disease.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: How is a hernia diagnosed?",
    "content": "What an incredible story! What a long, strange trip, too. What an ordeal for you. We started in October wondering about a hernia and here we are some months later with you having (finally) been diagnosed with MS. As I said early on, any sort of solid diagnosis would give you something to hang your hat on. At least now you know. And while I doubt the missed opportunity of four years ago has contributed to the advancement of the disease, it would have been great if that doctor had tried to rule out the more perplexing and serious things then, as you'd now be four years ahead of the program. But that is the past, and MS is often far from obvious.  Your story demonstrates very vividly how infuriatingly difficult it can be to diagnose MS. Managing it is often far less complex than figuring out it's present. MS and lupus are probably two of the most commonly missed or misdiagnosed diseases for this reason.   Your story is also a tremendous testimony to not quitting -- all along the way. You will most likely do exteremely well because of your innate determination to keep going. The other really bothersome thing about MS is the way it can flare up only to virtually disappear later, then show up again with some new and different symptom. The fact that you now know you have it will help you and your doctor together narrow down any future problems to MS or Not MS.   There are a number of helpful and supportive sources for sufferers of MS, but I think a great starting place would be the web site of the National MS Society, which offers a lot of basic information for patients and those close to them. The site can be found here: http://www.nationalmssociety.org/index.aspx   The society also publishes MS Magazine, a good source for keeping up with the latest advances in treatment and management of the disease. as well as lots of supportive stories, often from well-known people who are not well known to have MS.   Thanks so much for this incredible update. Many people will see this post and many of those will be inspired by your determination. This will be just one of the many silver linings to an obviously painful ordeal for you. Please stay in touch with us here at The Doctors Lounge and keep us informed of your progress.   I wish you all the best. You are an inspiration to us all.\n\n",

Everything you've described is consistent with a recognized syndrome often attributed to what is called \"idiosyncratic anesthesia  reaction.\"   The left side/left chest problems are something else again, and it is difficult to know what may have caused that. It should be followed up to make certain there is no injury there. Also, if possible, you might want to request a copy of your intraoperative records from the biopsy. There could be information that could help explain the apparent chest wall injury.   I hope this is helpful to you. Best of luck  to you, and please follow up with us here as necessary.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Common side effects that are expected post-laparoscopic removal of the gall bladder are:  - Shoulder and abdominal pain usually for 72 hours or maximum a week (the abdomen is inflated with gas during surgery). It may last as long as a week. -  Generalized muscle pain. - GIT disturbances like nausea, anorexia and diarrhoea. - Mild inflammation at the surgical wound sites.  Abdominal pain should be improving with time and with medications.  So, if the pain is worsening or he has fever, persistent GIT symptoms, or redness at the incision site, you should follow up with his surgeon to avoid serious complications.  Follow up with his doctor and direct clinical examination is essential. Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

It seems you've been through a harrowing experience and, I would hope, have sought debriefing through a counselor who specializes in Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. A complete physical exam would also be in order, with an eye toward things which may have happened during one of these interludes to which you refer.  I hope you're able to arrange for support and medical care even though you are currently without insurance. It sounds  as though this could well be a police matter and that you may not be held responsible for the expenses incurred.  I hope this is  helpful.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It is common to have throat pain and earache post-tonsillectomy. It sometimes remains more than it is said and some individuals experienced pain for 2 or 3 weeks after surgery. Pain is expected to be more intense when tonsillectomy is done at your age or older.  Post tonsillectomy pain is probably the result of muscle spasm caused by inflammation and irritation of the pharyngeal musculature. Pain in the ear is a referred pain from the throat as stimulation of the nerve supplying the throat could make you feel the pain in the ear.  Having a history of trigeminal neuralgia might suggest your higher susceptibility to feel more intense pain than others, this is my assumption.  Keeping your throat and your body well hydrated is important. Some individuals experience more pain relief with cold applicants to the neck or cold drinks intake as they help relax the muscles of the pharynx.  Fever is of concern and exclusion of infection is essential although you mentioned that it is a low grade one and not persistent.  I would advise you to follow up with your doctor to exclude other causes like infection. Hope you find this information useful. Please keep us updated.\n\n",

Perhaps occupational therapy would be helpful to teach him/her how to function in some areas but the baby will likely learn to be quite resourceful on its own when given opportunity to play as any other child would.    There are various potential causes for such deformity such as infection, chorionic villus sampling, amniotic bands and teratogens such as seizure medications.    Fortunately children are amazingly resilient and can achieve great results when challenged and encouraged.    I hope this helps.  I am not aware of any surgical intervention that could correct the defect.   Best wishes.\n\n",

If left untreated you would develop high fever and eventually septic shock. You are smart for going to the doctor right away and not letting that bump get larger. There are certain people that are predisposed to staphylococcal infections such as diabetics, people with skin disorders, medications like chemotherapy drugs. Treatment for this bacterial infection includes draining and culture of any abscesses. A strong antibiotic is prescribed like a penicillin or erythromycin I am sure you already know how important it is to finish all of the antibiotics as prescribed or you could end up with a resistant staph strain and end up in the hospital for weeks. Believe it or not the single most preventable cause for spreading infection is washing your hands.  Good luck,  Paul\n\n",

Obviously strenuous work will require a longer healing time than a sedentary job.  They are probably allowing for the worst case scenario so you won't plan on him returning sooner than he is ready, only to be disappointed if he is not up to it.    If you plan on six weeks, you may be pleasantly surprised if it doesn't take so long but the doctor will have to release him to return to work and this will depend a lot on his individual rate of healing.  People vary considerably so it is impossible to say in advance exactly when he will be ready.  Good luck with the surgery.\n\n",

During the 24-48 hours after surgery the lungs are getting rid of the gases used during surgery it is possible that the side effect may be sweating, but upon closer examination of your medical history and more importantly the medications you are on. The effexor can have this unwanted side effect but without knowing your full medical history or how long you have been on this medication, for example before or after surgery?  What I can tell you for sure is that opiates will cause excessive sweating known as diaphoresis. Keep in mind that there are a host of medical conditions that cause  night sweats and should be followed up on, but if you are experiencing the night sweats only since surgery and while on opiates this is not uncommon and is more annoying than harmful. If this condition persists follow op with your doctor.  Best of luck,  Paul\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  Normally Baker's cysts can be removed under a local, but if they are well-developed and their  roots entangled in the mechanics of the popliteal area, then work can be \"extensive\" and require  something  more than a local.   What concerns me is that your mother is 75 years old and the cardiologist is basing his concern over the general anesthesia solely on her age. Nowadays not only are there many less risky anesthesias, but 75 isn't as \"aged\" as it once was. If you mother has some chronic health problems or if the cardiologist knows  of some  heart problem she has, that  would be  different.   My best suggestion  would be that your mother get second opinions on both the surgery and the cardiac clearance. It still seems likely there should be a less invasive and complex way to surgically remove or repair the cysts, and if your mother is in otherwise good health I really don't think her age alone is sufficient reason to rule out the procedure.   I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you and to your mother.\n\n",

Hi, If more \"extensive\" surgery is required another option would be to talk with your mothers anesthesiologist about having spinal anesthesia where a needled is placed in the membrane surrounding the spinal cord, and an injection of anesthetic in this space leaves the lower body in an inability to move or feel pain for a period of time based on the length of the surgical procedure. Mild sedation is usually given in combination with the \"spinal\", this procedure is  very common and tolerated well in patients it is something you might want to discuss with  anesthesiology.

    "content": "Hello, I'm a 19 yr boy who has big dreams but currently has been crashing into many obstacles on my life's journey. Will any kind doctor help me out?  Medical history: Survived Meningitis 1st November 2007 Diagnosed with Severe Depression 23rd June 2008 Did Functional endoscopic sinus surgery (Removal of sinus bone, straightening of nose, trimming of flesh in nose and stitching up of flesh) 10th Sempterber 2008  Drugs: Smoker (10 sticks a day) (Not smoking anymore now after Depression) Non-alcoholic  Problem: After my surgery with all the cotton suck and all. The blood never stopped oozing even until now, which is a 6 days later. On the day after surgery i had terrible headaches and my vision was mildly blur, my T-section of my face feels like it's being under heavy pressure. Whenever the blood flows out, and i wipe it off, it will refill itself in my nostrils. Used 11 Full Tissue Boxes already. Right nose near the opening, there seems to be an infection. Feel like floating all the time. Nose can't smell anything. Dizzy daily. Fear of dying to a simple surgery. Numbness of upper lips and tongue. Jerks during sleep (like when you dream of falling down from a building and trying to cushion the impact) Food has no taste at all, only can feel the texture. Blood oozing out is thick and dark red, sometimes it looks like red cheese when u wipe it off as it is sticky. (Like when you pull out a piece of pizza, the cheese extends like glue)  Medication: Strong Antibiotics Paracetamol laced with Codeine  Questions: 1)Is it possible that I might die from this neverending bloodflow? 2)Did my stitch reopen? 3)Is my right nose inflammed? (touching the clot in the right nose hurts alot) 4)Should I stuff tissue up my nostrils? 5)Will I get back the ability to feel my lips? 6)Will I be able to taste food again? 7)How do I make myself feel better? 8)Are there any guides to help me prevent suicide? 9)My main concern : I'm determined to become the first Doctor in my family, but I am often discouraged when I think \"Will i ever survive long enough to graduate from medical school?\" Also the fear of death.  Please help me out here. Your response means alot to my survivability because i'm under alot of stress and pain.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: FESS Post symptoms",
    "content": "Hi there -  There seem to be two separate issues overlapping here, one the aftermath of a rather (by nature) messy surgery, and your underlying depression issues. I'll address them by answering your question list at the bottom of the post (that was a very thorough and well-organized way to do this, by the way).  1) There is virtually no risk of bleeding to death from the seepage you're experiencing, but it is certainly messy and annoying. This typically can go on for as long as two weeks post surgery, so you may have a little way to go before it totally stops.  2) It is pretty unlikely your stitches have opened. This is unusual in the area in question.  3) There can be some inflammation, in this case in the right nostril or further upstream on the right side, and if the tenderness continues or becomes worse, you should notify your doctor as you may need to be placed on an antibiotic, but, again, this is a fairly common sequel to this type of surgery. 4) While stuffing tissues up your nostrils makes mechanical sense, it actually isn't a good idea, and dabbing is preferable in order to avoid irritating the already inflamed area. I can really empathize with the desire to do this, and if  the bleeding doesn't slow and eventually stop by two weeks post surgery, you may need to have packing put back in, but please, not tissues. Trust me on this one. 5) The sensation in your lips should return slowly. It could take a while. 6) The sense of taste also should return but also can take a while. It often returns after the  area has thoroughly healed, and sometimes returns rather abruptly. 7) Assuming a positive attitude about what you've had done to improve a really annoying health problem, and the fact that you've come through this far will help you to feel better. As for actual physical discomfort, stick to pain relievers such as acetaminophen, or opiod meds. Don't use NSAIDs such as ibuprofin til this is all healed and there is no bleeding at all. Consider that you've taken on a rather unpleasant task which should improve your health overall, and that you're dealing with it in a very mature and  positive way. 8) Suicide is a separate (though of course related) issue, and needs to be addressed separately from the physical problem. There are certainly tracts on the prevention of suicide, but if you yourself experience suicidal thoughts, you definitely need to bring this to the attention of a professional trained in helping with this particular issue. Suicide is misunderstood by many laypeople, so seeking professional assistance with this  part is very important, especially since your post indicates you are a very well-organized person who would probably make a very good medical student -- and we need those! We need good doctors, especially those with varied life experience to draw on, which makes them more empathetic. You would seem to fill the bill. I'm excited for you regarding your ambition in this area.  9) It would seem the worst of your health issues is now behind you, although with the sequel to the FESS being so messy, difficult and annoying, it's hard to concentrate on the positives until it starts to heal more thoroughly. So long as you keep your doctor advised of any possible infection, there's no reason to be concerned about surviving this ordeal, and you've already survived a far more serious challenge in having had meningitis -- plus you've dealt with serious depression, two very big accomplishments! Continue the  great work,  please follow up with  us here as needed, and by all means find a trusted professional to work with on  the suicidal ideation. There's no future in suicide. There's a tremendous future in the practice of medicine.   Best of luck to you. Please stay in touch.\n\n",

    "title": "Fluid Overload after surgery",
    "content": "I had an emergency appendectomy (my appendix did not rupture however) after the surgery they put me on oxygen, the day I was released I stood up to leave and said to the nurse \"wow, look how swollen my knees are and look my toes are not even touching the floor!\" and she asked are you dizzy and I thought a little but not much.  Anyhow I was released and went home.  The following day I was short of breath and very uncomfortable from so much swelling.  I was laying on my couch and was noticing that I had a crackling sound coming from the back of my throat/nose area, my family could also hear it.  I fell a sleep and was woken by gasping to take a breath followed by vomiting.  My husband rushed me to the hospital and I was put in ICU and on 70% oxygen.  After a number of test for my heart and lungs the cardio signed off saying no signs of heart issues, the lung Dr said he really felt that it was fluid overload but because of my age was perplexed as to why I would not have handled the fluid and the hospital Dr. felt that it could be pneumonia.  While in the hospital (ICU) I was treated for pneumonia by antibiotics. But my blood pressure which is usually low became high, I was low on potassium, and the swelling was getting worse.  When the lung Dr. had my IV taken out, had me on Lasik, and catheter put in I immediately started to get better and soon was off all oxygen.  The hospital Dr. still was keeping me because she felt it could still be pneumonia...although I never ran a fever or had any signs from blood test showing pneumonia.  Does it sound like this was fluid overload and not pneumonia?  Should I be concerned that I am 38 healthy and yet I came down with fluid overload during surgery?  All the reading material I have seen states that this happens to much older patients or persons with other issues with their health.   I so wish I had some answers as to what happened to me and why?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Fluid Overload after surgery",
    "content": "Hi there -  Almost certainly  fluid overload was the primary issue. The question remains why this happened. Heart issues would seem to have been  ruled out (congestive heart failure is the most common cause of this sort of reaction, but apparently there's no indication that would be the case). You could also have developed a pneumonia, but while there would seem to be no infection, pneumonia is a catch-all term for inflammation of the lung with congestion due to fluid and/or mucus. Again, something  else is usually at the bottom of it.   The treatment seems to have been appropriate and you've responded well, but I can understand your concern as to what may have happened. Fluid overload can, sometimes, be related to an undetected lowered renal capicity (kidney failure = fluid overload). You may simply have smaller than normal kidneys for your size, or there may be some other reason your body didn't eliminate the fluids as expected.   There is also the remote possibilty that you received more fluids than were appropriate, but this is unusual and would  be  difficult to prove. The good news is that the situation has been corrected. By all means, should you ever need to have surgery in the future, let the doctors know this happened once, so they'll be on the lookout for it, whatever the cause. It doesn't appear you have an ongoing problem with  this, and with the high blood pressure you experienced, it really does seem you were just flooded (fluid overload). I'm glad everything turned out well. This can happen to young, otherwise healthy people, but it's rare unless too much fluid is administered or the output isn't followed adequately. I strongly suspect the latter was part of the  problem.   I hope this helps some. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: jaw clicking - wisdom tooth problem?",
    "content": "Hi there -  Your wisdom tooth could  very possibly be causing the misalignment of your jaw. If you have a history of problems of this sort,  you may already have had temporomandibular joint disease (TMJ), and maybe it had gotten better before the wisdom tooth erupted.   The wisdom teeth frequently cause all sorts of problems due to not coming in anywhere near straight, and frequently it is cheaper and simpler to remove them than to correct their alignment. That's a decision only you and your dentist can decide, however.  While saline wash for the biting of your cheek and even the wisdom tooth should be continued to try and help keep the irritation down, it won't do a thing for the misalignment of the jaw, whatever the cause.  It may well be that having the wisdom tooth extracted could resolve the whole problem.  Best of luck to you with this.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I would like to know any advice about the sharp pain I've been having.   I'm a female, 22 years old. I think it was either 2004 or 2005 that I had double open surgery on two inguinal hernias. The pain is located where my theigh connects to my body, in the inside, on one side only, below the scar. Sometimes it is painful when coughing, sneezing, lifting etc... but it has recently been sore when I'm standing/sitting/walking or being perfectly still even. It's extremely sharp pain. I don't have a hernia bulge, so I'm not sure if it's recurring or not. I do have mesh on both sides.   Should I see my surgeon immediately? Should I just ask my family doctor when I go for my appointment in 2 weeks?   I used to smoke alot, quit for a while, now I'm back at it. I do have fat on me, but I wouldn't say I'm over weight. I eat healthy, except for drinking too much. I think I could have strained it/hurt it during sex? Not sure what to do.   Thanks for anything information.   dream.lane\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Double Inguinal Hernias, post surgery pain",
    "content": "Hello -  While there are any number of ways you can reinjure a hernia repair, it usually has to be pretty vigorous activity soon after the surgery. What you're describing, symptom-wise, sounds as though it may be caused by adhesions, which occur sometimes in areas where surgery has been performed, where adjacent tissues become stuck together, causing pain and limitation of movement. And since you would undoubtedly need to see your surgeon about this problem anyway, it probably would make sense to go ahead and make an appointment with him as soon as possible, so that whatever the problem, it can be evaluated and managed promptly, before it has a chance to get worse. (There's no saying it would get worse, but since we don't know what's wrong, it's a possibility, and  having been through surgery already, there's no sense having more work done if it can be avoided).  I hope this is helpful to you. Best of luck.\n\n",

Went back to the ENT who said My turbinates were swollen gave me spray was not concerned about twitch, said give it a week and see a Nureo. Saw the Nureo did a eeg normal, exam normal. ordered a brain Mri waiting for results. Nureo stated it will most likely be normal had one three years ago for headache. My upper teeth have started to bother me now. I am concered that I have some sinus cancer or something. I had  CT scan the day before surgery on sinus which was normal.

    "title": "Re: septum surgery and lip twitch",
    "content": "Hello -  These sorts of fine muscle twitches (fasiculations) are common enough and very annoying, and you've had surgery in an area where nerves pass through en route to the  upper lip,  so it's really hard to say whether the surgery, the TMJ (another possible cause) or just the usual \"no reason at all\" apply here. I feel pretty safe in saying there's unlikely any way you could have undetected sinus cancer,  which is pretty rare to begin with.   An MRI of the brain can, coincidentally,  show up some parts of the sinuses, but a CT of the sinuses specifically can also be done, is much quicker, and can be targeted very specifically at the  area of concern. However, it sounds as though the  imaging has all been done adequately and what remains now is to see whether the twitching will resolve on its own or if you may eventually need to have the nerve ablated (which could be done if the twitching becomes  crazy-making, but would likely result in some unacceptable numbness and even potential paralysis of the lip).   Best bet is this is due to residual irritation of the nerve due to the surgery, possibly also aggravated by TMJ, and will most likely resolve on its own. This sort of thing can be recurrent and can sometimes last for weeks at a time, even without the sort of history you have.  Good luck to you. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  While surgery (and especially abdominal surgeries) can sometimes result in a collection of \"dead\" blood (plethora), which can be expressed as you describe, the greater problem is the fact that this collection of blood can provide a medium for bacteria and lead to infection. I hope you have been to the ER by now and had the site drained and were put on antibiotic therapy. This sort of thing can sometimes drag on for a while, and may, depending on the microbe causing the infection,  actually be stubborn enough to require IV antibiotics or surgery to remove damaged tissue. Hopefully this is not the case, but antibiotics at the very least would seem to be indicated to avoid possible additional surgery and hospitalization.   Best of luck to you.

    "content": "Hello -  This is a tricky question and it will get a tricky answer. The Vicoden will have to be used until the doctor's evaluation of the pain without it, and this is often accomplished by stepping the patient down via tramadol for perhaps a week once it is decided there has been enough healing time to warrant a trial with something less potent. Then you may be able to use NDAIDs (ibuprofin, naprosyn) in prescription doses until the pain has totally subsided.   It is difficult for anyone to predict the exact timetable for natural pain cessation, which is why eventually you'll have to be weaned off the Vicoden. It can be taken for some time (assuming no prior drug dependency problems), but because of the nature of the surgery your pain may only abate slowly, and you may need something for a while. The sooner you can stop the opiods the better, but a week is pretty early to be looking for significant pain abatement.   I know this is (deliberately) vague, but everyone is different with regards to this. Hopefully this is helpful. Good luck to you.\n\n",

Current medications : Bactrim forte 160mg (S\u00fclfametoksazol + Trimetoprim) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Hello,  I've had varicocelectomy 17 days ago.  I searched for information about recovery period of varicocelectomy on the Internet they generally emphasize that recovery period is around 10 days but I still have the following symptoms;   - Pain on my lower abdomen while getting erect and loosing the erection. - Unbearable pain on my lower abdomen right after ejaculation and then swelling occurs after I start having pain. Pain comes really fast but goes really slow. - Swelling occurs during the day. Especially in warm environments or if I sit for a long time. It goes away when I walk.  5 days after surgery I masturbated, because I was getting erect and consequently having pain frequently. Ofcourse I did it after consulting my surgeon.  First time it hurt but it went away in few minutes. Few days after I masturbated again, this time it hurt less. I thought that I was getting better. However last time I masturbated it hurt so much so that I had to stay still on the bed for 15 minutes till the pain goes away and my testicles were swollen for the rest of the day and I still had so much discomfort which led me to take Novalgin.  Lately I've read diverse information on recovery period on many sites it states one can continue normal daily activity nearly in 10 days (except excessive activities like lifting heavy stuff ) and another one states its better to take a break (for sexual activities) for 3 weeks!  I don't know if I damaged anything after surgery by masturbating 5 days after the surgery. I would appreciate if you can shed some light on my case.  Thanks in advance!\n\n",

    "content": "My wife recently (2 weeks ago) had an abdomnioplasty performed.  we've had trouble with the drains inserted in the lower abdominal region right above the pubic/groin area.  Both drain openings at the skin level were getting infected with symptoms of redness, itching, minor swelling, and tenderness. I, with her doctors permission and guidance removed the left drain my self with no complications. that side is doing fine being the pain is gone and the wound is healing normally. However, the right drain is now displaying major problems for concern. the opening where the drain tube is inserted has swollen to \"golf-ball\" size and is very tender and painful. Touching the area causes extreme pain. The right side of the obliques/hip region is painful and tender to the touch.  The drain bulb and tube contains a fluid consistency of thin watery applsauce, is more brownish in color, and has become more thick compared to the watery blood like fluid it was putting out.  We're starting to disagree with the doctor as far as whether or not it needs to come out.  I want to get a second opinion.  I looked up infections that are common with this procedure and read about a possible seroma, but couldn't find anything on more precise symptoms. Would any one be able to help as far as providing a little more insight as to what may be wrong?  Any help will be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, If you are concerned about possible infection you should be seeing your doctor; not just removing the drain.  The surgeon needs to see the swelling you describe.  This would be the place to start.  If the doctor refuses to see you (I doubt he would) you should see another provider because post-op infections can be serious.    If it is a seroma it may need to be drained but this should be done under sterile conditions with possibly the use of antibiotics to prevent infection.  At any rate, she should see her doctor about it.  Best wishes to you both.\n\n",

    "title": "Lingering tiredness after surgery?",
    "content": "Hello  Firstly I would like to say I am very grateful for this forum and all the health professionals who take time out of their crazy busy schedules to answer questions.  I very much appreciate it.  I am a 26 year old female who has PCOS and endometriosis.  I have had 4 major depressive episodes in the past ten years.  Regarding medication I am currently taking Lustral 100mg daily along with Glucophage 1500mg daily for my PCOS.  I had a laparoscopy and an ovarian drilling in 2003.  I have also had a gastroscopy done with local anesthetic and exploratory surgeries done on my bladder when I was younger.  On the 22nd of August 2007 I had 4 impacted wisdom teeth removed.  The pain afterwards was very severe and my face swelled up completely.  The pain has since moved to my teeth itself which my dental surgeon tells me is due to nerve damage/bruising during surgery.  The pain is decreasing; however I am finding myself tiring very easily.   Taking an easy day at home of making lunch, cleaning up afterwards, dressing and putting on makeup, reading and going on the internet feels like running a marathon.  My surgeon says that I cannot go back to the gym for at least another 3 weeks and that it's early days regarding my energy levels.  Can you give me any idea of when this lingering tiredness will dissipate?  Aside from resting and eating well is there anything else I can do?  Also, physiologically what is the explanation for this tiredness as I was only under for about 30-40 minutes?  Is there still some anesthetic left in my system? I don't recall feeling this tired after my laparoscopy.  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, As long as it has taken us to get to your question, I suspect it has probably resolved by now.    Surgery and illnesses can take a serious toll on your body so it isn't any wonder you might have had a difficult time bouncing back to normal.  Your body needs time to heal itself and with some things, time alone heals.  But, you do have to plan on the time.  These days we tend to overwork and overextend ourselves rather than allowing the rest that will do us the most good.  I suspect this is your case and you had an idea when you would be recovered, but that didn't happen according to your schedule.    If by chance you are still feeling lethargic and weak, you should definitely be checked by a doctor in case you have become anemic or have some type of lingering infection.  It sounds like you know what you need to do with rest and diet.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Adult circumcision is usually performed in the outpatient setting by urologists.  Accurate statistics about how many of these are performed is not available.  Approximately 60% of male infants in the U.S.A. are circumcised.  Risks are typical of surgical procedures and include bleeding, hematoma, infection, inadvertent damage to the glans, removal of too much or too little skin, aesthetically unpleasing results and a change of sensation during intercourse.  A urologist, experienced in the procedure, with a good track record is the best assurance for safety in the procedure.  It is done under anesthesia and full recovery takes from four to six weeks, during which time all penile stimulation is avoided.    It is important to weigh the risks and benefits when making your decision.  Benefits may include simpler hygiene and may result in fewer local infections, resolution of the problems you are having, and less risk of frenular tears and bleeding during intercourse.  Good luck with this.\n\n",

Pain is experienced differently by each person.  Because the brain interprets the pain sensation, some people seem to have a very high tolerance while others very low and everything in between. It is impossible to say how long you will need to continue the narcotic in order to get adequate pain control.  But, at this point you should be able to miss doses to challenge yourself and see how you do without going back to the \"out of control\" pain you may have experienced early on and which can be much more difficult to relieve.  If with only the non-narcotic pain relief your pain returns, you can go ahead and take the Vicodan.  At the very start, you need to stay on top of it for maximum relief but by now probably not so much.    You can also just stretch out the time between meds gradually or reduce the dosage.  You can break these tablets in half to achieve the level of pain control you need.  Other non-medicinal pain relief measures may also help when you skip the narcotic.  Listen to relaxing music or use other distractions so your brain shifts the focus.  Music therapy is an excellent and safe addition to other measures.  If your doctor has instructed you to elevate or use heat, do those things as well.  Swelling at this point should have subsided for the most part so you are probably past the point where ice would help.    Good luck in the healing process.  Time is your friend.\n\n",

    "content": "I am an 18 year old male. I broke my humerus 2 years ago, looking at the xrays the break was pretty bad. After seeing them the doctor decided to put a cast on my arm only a little past my elbow, not even coming close to where the actually break was (more towards my shoulder). He gave me a sling and insisted that the weight of the cast would bring my bone into place.  Well 2 weeks went by and i went in to get another xray, my arm was still in horrible condition. My doctor seemed a little anxious and nervous and quickly got me into surgery.  The surgery went fine and my bone healed but i seem to be missing my anterior deltoid now. It wasn't very noticeable at first but now i am beginning to work out and its starting to look funny. My doctor said nothing about it, no warnings or anything afterwards, and I am and 100% sure i do not have an anterior deltoid  Is this normal for surgery's near the shoulder, or is my surgeon/doctor at fault?  Is there anything i can do?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Jordanmm,  This would be a bit unusual.  During a repair of a broken humerus the deltoid muscle is not removed unless there was some sort of damage necessitating the removal of the muscle.  What may have happened is that the nerve may have been damaged, resulting in wasting away of the muscle (either from the surgery or from the initial accident).  If you are missing your deltoid it should be very difficult to raise your arm above your head in an arcing motion (like doing jumping jacks).  There are other muscles that will get the arm up some but it would be very difficult to raise all the way without some deltoid help.  I would recommend that you follow up with your orthopedic surgeon about this to have it evaluated and see if there is anything that needs to be done.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, This is not enough information to make a guess.  There are many organs in the abdomen which can cause you pain.  It would help to know when you experience the pain and is it better or worse after eating?  Would you describe it as a sharp, stabbing pain, a dull ache or something else?  Does it hurt with movement or breathing?  Is is constant or intermittent?  Is it lessening or getting worse?  Is it relieved by antacids, food or anything else?  Is it worse when you eat a particular food or drink?  What is your age?  What is the reason for the coumadin medication?  Even with the answers we may have a hard time guessing the diagnosis but if it is sharp, getting worse, accompanied by fever or you just plain feel like things are going downhill fast, don't wait to see a doctor.  Good luck\n\n",

    "title": "Foreign body in the wall of esophagus between C7 and T1",
    "content": "I was admitted to the hospital on the 26th of this month after going to the emergency room to seek treatment for difficulty swallowing. I can swallow but I tend to choke a lot on things I attempt to eat and drink. This started around July of this year and has progressively got more severe. I have also had issues with waking up multiple times a night due to not being able to take a breath, I think due to positioning of my head/neck. They did blood work, xrays of neck and a CT scan of head and neck. Labs showed dehydration and my nutrition was off but the thyroid panel was normal. The xrays showed nothing. The Ct scan offered information that was unexpected. It showed a foriegn body that was 1.9 CM long positioned in the lining of the wall of the esophagus between C7 and T1 embeeded in the same direction as the esophagus runs. They were not able to indentify it but the report states that it is more dense then bone but not as dense as metal. I was admitted to the hospital and they went down my throat via endoscopy to see if they could find the object. They were unable to locate it via endoscopy so confirmed it is embedded in the wall. After 2 days the ENT dr and GI dr decided that the foriegn body was too low down to be the cause of my swallowing problem and claimed it was due to weak muscles in my esophagus but did not provide me with test results or possible reasons this could be the case. There was brief discussion about the removal of the foriegn body but they ENT Dr said he or the hospital was not suitable to handle it. I was told that the surgery to remove it would be risky and would have to involve at least 2 surgeons and a long recovery period because they would have to cut from the outside of my neck all the way into the esophagus removing a 2 cm part of the wall of the esophagus. Despite not being able to identify the foriegn body I was told it was not the cause of my swallowing problem and would be best left intact. I was discharged and told to seek further medical care if my swallowing problem continued or got worse. I am concerned about this and wondering if you have any information or opinions reguarding the possible consequences of leaving this foriegn body intact given the current issues and lack of information. Sorry if this was too long. Thank you for taking the time to read and respond to my question.  29 yr old male paraplegia- Transverse Myelitis diagnosed 2002 recurrent blood clots- tx with lovenox Hypertension- tx toprol xl, verapamil er, zestril seizures due to closed head injury- unable to control with meds congenital heart defects involving valvles lung disease- alpha-1 antitrypson defficiency\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Leapfrogger,  There is another test called a barium swallow that can better evaluate the ability of the musculature of the esophagus to properly function.  Basically, you would drink some radioopaque dye (barium or a similar contrast) and x-ray pictures would be taken while you were swallowing to assess the function.  This test may help confirm the muscular weakness if this is the cause of your difficulty swallowing.  If the foreign body is, indeed, not causing you any problems it may very well be safer to keep it in place.  Given the location you are describing, I suspect that you may need a cardiothoracic surgeon or an ENT doctor experienced in surgeries at this depth of the esophagus.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Dr Chan Lowe.  I appreciate your responce. I have had the barium swallow done once before to evaulate the Gerd related issues I think.. I have no bowel control/sensation and I don't take any measures to ensure regular bathroom habbits untill close to the 2nd  week mark and I ended up with a partial bowel obstructiion within a week of the barium swallow. That whole experience has made me shy away from the barrium swallow. I know there is another type of liquid that can be drank but I have been told it has the potential to be just as problematic as far as constipation goes and is unpredictable.  I was under the belief they could evalute throat muscle weakness via endoscopy too but I am assuming now that this isnt accurate. They did not do a barrium swallow test so Im not sure why they were so quick to write it off as weakness in the muscles.  The exact wording of the ct repot is as follows..  An abnormal density is projected in the prevertebral tissues just anterior to C7 and T1. Sagittal and coronal reconstructions were produced and confirmed that this density is greater then bone density but appears to be less then metallic density on the previous plain film. It is slender in shape and measures 1.9 cm in length, running parallel to the esophageal lumen. It appears to be associated with the right lateral aspect of the cervical esophagus and is most consistent with a submucosal or intramural foriegn body.   The second ct scan report words it a little differently   CT images show an abnormal radiodense foriegn object just anterior to C7 and T1. This is visable on the AP view as a linear density projected just to the right of the midline through the body of T1. This does not appear to be a metallic density on these plain films but is more dense them bone on the CT scan. This measures approximately 2.1 cm in overall length  I do have a few follow up questions. If you are able to shed some light on them it would be appreciated. If not that is ok too..  Is there a specific reason why nobody is able/willing to point to the location on my body when I ask where exactly it is? I am assuming theres a logical reason why they cant just point to the spot on my neck and say its right around \"here\"! I know our bodies are shaped different but I am assuming the skeletol system is pretty simuliar from person to person.  And should I be concerned about MRI type scans in the future since the non contrast ct scans stated it not a metallic object? Radiodense means safe for MRI scans? I just don't wanna end up having this thing ripped out by a MRI in the future.  Soon as my insurance coverage is sucessfuly transfered to this county I will be able to chose a primary care dr, but can you suggest things I can do in the mean time to cut down the risk of developing pnemonia related to injesting liquid and food stuff into airways? Is it likely Ill maintain some level of pnemonia despite antibitic treatment  because of this? I know I was diagnosed with pnemonia and put on a vent for 6 days in july but they were unable to clear it up fully and I still had pnemonia when I went home. The hosital stay at the end of December showed I still have it but they did not put me on antibiotics. I am not sure if it the a new case or the same one from months ago. I am following the recent hospitals advice to consume pureed solids and add thickeners to liquids but still choke quite a bit.    I appreciate the time you have put into my issue. Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, i have a question for you.   You will have to excuse any typing errors as i am waiting to have reangulation surgery for a bone in my left arm/wrist and it pains me to type.        On that note, ill start with this.   I recently started seeing a doctor X.  I really like him and hes extremely easy to talk to but just busy naturally.   Unfortunatly his office is about an hour and a half drive from my house. (a friend referred him.)   When i went to see him back in 8/07 he exrayed my left arm/wrist and determined i needed to have it rebroken etc as the angle of the bone is 36 degrees off and pains me extremly bad to bend at all.   In 3/05  i broke it  i guess they called it a colles fracture? not sure of the name but it was a fall backwards on an outstretched hand/arm.   A typical break for that type of fall.   It was delayed union from the get go and i was in constant pain and continue to be.   It has healed but has healed abnormally.   Anyway, history aside of the arm here is my problem/ question.      Dr. X has been understanding in my treatment/pain management and was prescribing Vicodin ES for the pain. I took about 3 a day maybe 4.  In the process of his pain management, he found me a really good orth. surgeon that will do the reangulation surgery after the first of the year so im awaiting that date (its not set yet but def. going to happen.)    Hopefully soon i cant wait.    Recently Dr. X informed me that he needed to change my pain meds because some people were caught selling the pain medication on the street and he said it was making him look bad so he wouldnt be writing the prescription for vicodin in the clinic any longer.   I said o dear and expressed my concern for him and agreed that i would def. try whatever he suggested.   He then stated he would try me on Tramadol and darvacet.    In the past few years of trying to get help with my wrist/arm pain different doctors have tried me on bextra, celebrex, darvacet, lyrica, ultram , ultracet (some of these are generics of the same meds but im not sure so i will just list what i know/ remember bear with me) amitriptyleen, advil 800mg and a few others as well.   They work for about a week before i can no longer stand the pain.   the vicodin naturally worked wonders for me and for once it would make it stop hurting completely.  The darvacet is working but it is making me sick ever time i take it even with food etc.    even taking phenergin (spelling sorry ) with it helps a bit but the pain is still unbearable.    I asked my orth. surgeon who is going to do the surgery the other day if he could give me anything different to take. he said vicodin def. would be good to take in my condition until we do the surgery and for 3 to 6 weeks after the surgery (before switching pain meds so they will continue to give me pain releif after surgery) but that it would be unethical for him to give me anything until he does do the surgery.    the orth. surgeons office is only a few minutes away from my house and there fore much easier for me to get to then my family doctors office (1 hour and a half away) anyway.   Im wondering if i talk to Dr. X (the one that dosent want to write vicodin pres. anylonger) would it be possible for him to give permission to the orth. surgeon to write me pain med prescriptions?  would that be ethical (spelling sorry) or what should i do?    Im to the point were i am thinking i need to try a different doctor just to get the pain releif i was getting before.... after all dr X while he said he wasnt going to write the prescription for vicodin in his office anylonger didnt say i shouldnt /cant  take it anymore.. he just said because of the recent events of people selling it on the streets and whatnot that he dosent want to look bad.   Any suggestions as what i could or should do ?   Im so close to having the surgery that it seems silly to suffer a couple more weeks so badly when i could get releif.  Is there a way to delicatly talk to the two doctors and over come the ethics  part of this problem between the two?     any help at all would be very appreciated as i do not want to step on any toes when it comes to my pain releif.   it seems i have a spur of somekind as well on the missaligned bone that constantly with every movement tears the scar tissure around it and causes so much pain... to even type this is excrutiating but i do need help :(     ty so much for your time and speedy resonse!!!!   larinda s.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Larinda,  It is very reasonable to discuss the issue of having your orthopedic surgeon prescribe the pain medication for you with your regular doctor.  I suspect that your primary doctor simply has chosen not to prescribe the vicodin anymore but is not against the medication itself.  Unfortunately, situations do arise with illegal selling of narcotic medications and in these cases sometimes the answer is to quit prescribing them so they are no longer available to those selling them.  It's extreme but sometimes needs to be done.  If your orthopedic surgeon is willing to prescribe them this would not be an ethical conflict between your doctors, simply a difference of decisions.  As a side note, you may also want to try Tylenol #3, which is stronger than tylenol but not quite as strong as vicodin.  It may be enough pain control and the issue with abuse is less.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Congratulations on your decision to breastfeed and to desire to continue.  In doing this you are giving your baby a gift of love nothing else can duplicate.  The health benefits of breastfeeding are tremendous.  The recommendation is breastmilk for at least the first year of life so you are doing great!  As for liposuction - this would mostly depend on what they use for anesthetic.  Local and regional anesthesia are fine so if that is used, should be no problem.  Pain relievers such as those they offer in the hospital after delivery are also considered safe in breastfeeding so if you need pain relief after the procedure, this should not interfere.  You should be able to find out what they use and if they give you a sedative, check with a resource such as otispregnancy.org (you may have a local teratology hotline service available in your area also)about specific medications that might be used to sedate you.  They are very current on these issues - more so than the doctors as a rule.  It is not uncommon for the doctor to advise you to discard your milk to be on the safe side but in many cases the medication has not been found to be harmful so it could be unnecessary.  By checking with this service you can get reliable information.  La Leche League International can also advise you on this.  (llli.org)  There is no reason at all that I can see to discontinue breastfeeding in this case.   If it was not advised, you would be wise to wait until you were finished breastfeeding rather than wean early.  The benefits are so worth it and your baby will be grown way too fast as it is - even though right now it seems like a long time.    Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Beny1924,  I suspect that this issue is not directly related to your surgery although it is possible.  It may be related in that there may be some scar tissue pulling on the skin and irritating it.  This would typically present more with dimpling of the skin, though.  It may be that you have a mild skin infection of the area.  This may be due to a bacteria or a fungal skin infection.  I'd recommend you have your doctor take a look at this to see what is going on.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I was in a lot of pain for about a week after, was treated for epididymidus, etc. That is cleared up, the soreness is only there now if I do things overly physical. However, the varicocele is still there. It might be a bit smaller, it was very large before, and it is much more tender now. I am a 20 years old, and this is my first surgical operation.   Should I be worried that the varicocele has not gone away yet? Do you think the surgeon might have missed a vein? He said it was much worse then he thought when he began and it took him 90 minutes as opposed to the 45 minutes that was intended. Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi In the suburbs,  It is a little bit of a misnomer to say the \"put the bowel to sleep\".  What happens, basically, is that any time the bowel is manipulated (such as during surgery in the abdomen) it slows down and occasionally stops its normal contractions (called peristalsis).  This slowing and stopping is termed an ileus.    The bowel will \"wake up\" and begin moving again in due time.  It may be fast (a few hours after surgery) or it may take a few days for this to happen.  This is why surgeons often do not allow a person to eat right after abdominal surgery.  They wait until the bowel starts moving again first to prevent nausea and vomiting.  Best wishes.\n\n",

About 2 months ago, I was bitten on the left leg by a dog. The bite was a 'crush', not tearing my jeans, but left several teeth marks. the deepest mark failed to heal for several weeks.   This deep mark was initially about one-half inch long. The area below it was numb for about three inches below and two inches wide. It is still today numb about 1.5 inches below and 2 inches wide (so, about half the original affected area now has feeling.)  About 2 weeks after the bite, I thought I noticed a little depression in the muscle on the left side of my lower leg, about 2\" lower than the end of my calf muscle, but on the left outside. Today I noticed it again, but this depression is much larger: it is approx. an oval with avg 2\" diameter and .25\" depressed.   The right leg does not match this.   So, I believe the nerve at the back of the lower leg has been damaged... can this produce muscular atrophy? Do I require surgery to repair?\n\n",

    "content": "HI Im a female age 21 and 2 months ago I had an umbellical hernia repair. It was fixed by stitches only, no patch, the doctor said it would be best this way in case I decided to have another child. Anyway, at about a month and a half post surgery I began to feel pain in the area of the hernia and about a week later, it was popped out and I can now push it back in, so I know it has returned. My appointment has been cancelled by the doctors office the past 2 times and I told them I was having pain and asked to see another doctor in the office and the secretary said I was unable to. It hurts over 50% of the time, I cant vacuum or carry a basket of laundry without a ton of pain, it hurts worse than it did before surgery and I thought that was bad.Now, as of yesterday it is very painful and also hurts in a different spot as well as the original and I believe I may have developed a 2nd hernia.  Anyway, I guess my questions are: should I let this same doctor fix it again and should I request that a patch be put in? If she does fix it again should I request it be done with no fees or lessened fees (I have no insurance)? Should I get a second opinion and have a new doctor fix it? Could the original hernia breaking back open cause a second one to occur or is it just scar tissue causing all the extra pain?  Oh yeah, and I even had to basically beg this doctor to keep me on restrictions so I wouldnt have to lift patients at work, so obviously I didnt break it open from over exerting myself. Please help me I don't know what to do and its stressing my out not being able to do anything without pain. My NEW appointment is in 2 days...that is unless it is cancel for a third time!\n\n",

Larger hernias generally require a patch; however, I cannot say for sure about smaller ones.  It is important you feel comfortable with your doctor.  It is reasonable to follow up with your current surgeon or get a second opinion.  I would recommend you be seen soon.  Pain associated with hernias may be restricting blood flow to the intestines which could cause severe problems.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 33 year old female with no medical problems (past or present).  The only medication I take is birth control pills.  For many years I have had recurring pain in my jaw/under-ear area.  It used to be painful when I would start to eat (but not all of the time -- not sure why it would be inconsistent?) but in the past few years it's not only more painful when these \"episodes\" occur but it seems to subside much more slowly.  When it's acting up it also hurts to press on that area and when I turn my head I can feel it -- like it might be swollen.  I find that I even have started to compensate for it, like not leaning over the sink too far when I brush my teeth because that makes my ear/jaw/lower-cheek hurt.  Sometimes it's one side or the other, rarely both at one time.  I keep looking around on the internet to figure out what it is and the closest thing that matches my symptoms is salivary gland stones.  I am no doctor thought and could be totally off base.  If indeed that's what it is, do I have to get them treated?  Do you think it is something else?  I can handle the painful part of it and unless I am leading up to a big problem I'd rather not have to have some scary medical procedure done to fix it.  But I don't want to end up with something worse down the line!  Any advice will be appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "HI Walter00,  In general, when choosing between a TURP or open prostatectomy most physicians recommend TURP.    However, with stones that need to be removed the situation is a little different.  I am not able to recommend to you which of the two options would be better because there are many factors involved.  2 surgeries means also 2 anesthesia exposures and 2 post operative recovery times.  However, having 2 surgeries at one time generally is a more complicated procedure.  I would recommend you talk with your surgeon to go over both options in detail.  This way you will have all the facts and can make an informed decision.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 23 year old female who went in for a septoplasty/turbinate reduction on Tuesday morning for a severe deviated septum.    Pre-existing conditions include moderate to severe asthma, bronchitis, hyperthroidism, inappropriate sinus tachycardia, anxiety, possible pheochromocytoma.  I take medications for most of these conditions including inhalers, beta-blockers, and anti-histimines.  Anyways the surgery went well, but when I came out of anesth.  my Oxygen level dropped below 90.  They believe that latex on one of the surgical tubes may have made contact within my nose and produced a reaction (I have had mild latex reactions in the past that they were aware of).  After being doped up on Benadryl and Nebulizer treatments for a few hours I was released.  I did fairly well the first day or so, but near the end of the second day I started having significant shortness of breathe.  The ENT removed the packing and loosened the splints but I told him that I had a large amount of blood coming up my throat.  I knew some discharge was normal but this is still occurring as well as the shortness of breath.  I take the neb. treatments and other asthma meds to control it, but I can't help but feel very uncomfortable.  The ENT does not seem all that concerned.  Originally I thought maybe the Vicodin was giving me trouble with the breathing but I stopped using that 2 days ago.  I haven't eaten solid foods since Monday, and am getting by on a couple spoonfuls of jello and a few cups of water a day.  I am exhausted and dizzy and know that is most likely from the lack of food/drink.  I would think by Day 4 the drainage into my mouth and shortness of breath, as well as the lack of hunger would have easied up.  Am I overconcerned with this?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Dacubster,  I am not particularly familiar with this surgery regarding it's typical recovery time.  If your ENT doctor wasn't to concerned about the drainage it is likely normal.  I am somewhat concerned, though, about your lack of fluid intake and feelings of dizziness, fatigue and your shortness of breath.  It may be that you are becoming dehydrated.  Also, sometimes surgeries such as this can induce asthma flare-ups.  You may need some stronger medicine to help relieve the asthma symptoms.  I would strongly advise you to follow up with your ENT or your primary care doctor as soon as possible.  If you feel worse I would recommend you visit the urgent care.  You may need some IV fluid to help rehydrate you until you are able to drink better.  Best wishes.  I hope you feel better soon.\n\n",

The transplant is generally done only when the current lung condition is causing severe limitations to life AND the cause of the original bad lungs is not one that will continue on to damage the new lungs quickly (a surgeon may be willing to transplant someone who has a condition that will damage the lungs very, very slowly but that it very much surgeon dependent).  Following the surgery, antirejection medicines will need to be taken.  My best advise is to try to find a surgeon that does this surgery to meet with.  The evaluation process is extensive, generally, so you may also want to talk with your regular doctor about starting the process.  Best wishes.  I hope this helps a little.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello there,   The symptoms you describe are not uncommonly reported in the short term post-operative period after the procedure. When a surgeon performs a Nissen Fundoplication operation, he or she is often faced with a difficult decision relating to the tightness of the wrap. If the wrap is too loose, then the reflux symptoms will persist after the operation, which will result in an unhappy patient. Conversely, if the wrap is too tight, symptoms of gas, bloating, and inability to belch will be major problems. Knowing what is best for the patient concerned is a combination of the art of surgery as well as the science. Experience also allows the surgeon to base his judgement on past cases as there are numerous variable factors that make exact calculations almost impossible.   Vagal nerve (the nerve controlling the movement of the stomach to propel its contents into the small intestine) damage secondary to the surgery is an unusual complication, but it can occur. Damage to the vagus nerve can impair gastric motility, however symptoms would have presented much earlier than when you describe. Unwrapping is a possibility and in some cases the wrap may need to be tightened or even redone completely. It is important to be sure that you did not have any pre-existing motility syndromes which are usually nerve mediated and thus would still cause discomforting symptoms despite the surgery. I'll assume that this was investigated for prior to the operation by your surgeon. My advice to you, if these symptoms still persist, would be to visit your surgeon and explain to him your symptoms. Alternatively visit a gastroenterologist who may arrange some scans involving ingested contrast dyes to have a better idea about the nature of your symptoms.

    "content": "Dear JFK,  Here's a quick rundown on hiatal hernia. You may already know most of this but just to recall some facts. There are two kinds of Hiatal Hernia: The first (95%) is the sliding hiatal hernia, where the gastro-oesophageal junction moves above the diaphragm together with some of the stomach through the opening where structures from the chest pass into the abdomen. The second kind is when a part of the stomach herniates through the hiatus but without movement of the gastro-oesophageal junction, otherwise known as a 'rolling' or paraoesophageal hernia.   The paraoesophageal type, which I gather you initially had, is usually corrected surgically even if you have no reflux symptoms (heartburn). This is because there is a small but significant risk that the stomach could become strangulated or twisted when it passes through the diaphragm. The involved section of the stomach could then die and cause rupture of the stomach wall with very serious consequences. However, a sliding hiatus hernia is altogether different as there is no great risk of a 'volvulus' or obstruction. Generally, it is first managed medically if you are suffering from chest pain or heartburn. Only if treatment fails and/or symptoms worsen is surgery considered. The difficulty here is that you have already had surgery and the procedure which normally corrects both is a Nissen fundoplication and its variants. The PPI tablets you are on are clearly not helping and this suggest that your stomach contents are being constantly pushed up your oesophagus. Losing weight is another alternative to try but I suspect that your surgical procedure may have become loosened allowing the G-O junction to move freely without being held by the muscles of the stomach, which is what a fundoplication 'wrap' aims to do. As a chronic reflux can cause changes in your oesophagus that can increase your risk of cancer in later years, combined with your intolerable symptoms, I suggest you visit the surgeon who performed the procedure with your CT scans in hand, and hear what he has to say because he is the only competent person to determine what is best in your particular case. Please keep me updated.   Dr Tino Solomon  Senior House Officer in Surgery  BSc(Hons) MB BS\n\n",

After many gastro-docs, therapists, endocrinologist.....all whom are specialist in their own design, yet fail to look out of the box because it was not part of \"their specialty\" after many scans, x-rays, mri's hideascan, hover scan, cat scans ultra sounds so on and so on.....my mother has been CURED!! I had this whole list of gripes typed in here, but realized that doesnt help anyone if I bash all the medical help she received so I will leave only this note.....don't stick with one doc, even one specialist, if you are not being helped in the way you feel you should be.....Keep looking, there are docs that love to investigate things and follow all the way thru, no matter what his specialty.....and he may be the one to say it was something simple and just overlooked for years.....and .....he hands you your cure!

    "content": "I'm a 35 year old male with no current medications.  In November of 06 i had a fistula removed between my anus and genitals.  The surgeon carterized the wound and left a deep trench.  I was told that the reason for this is so it can heal from the inside out and it reduces the chance of infection.  The problem is is july 7, 2007.  Its been over 8 months and although its not as deep, its still an open wound!!!  I was told that it can take a long time to heal, but this doesn't seem right.  I don't know what to do because i don't see any progress, yet it doesn't hurt. And i worry about infection because its still open.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks for your time.

I would not think an incision in this area would be deep enough to still be healing, though.  I would recommend you follow up with your doctor or, if you are able, the surgeon that did the procedure for reevaluation.  I don't think there is ongoing infection since there is no pain.

    "content": "Dear Fistman, You did not mention the underlying suspected cause of the origination of the fistula.  Fistulas are abnormal connections between two areas or organs of the body which do not usually connect, or at a place abnormal to normal anatomy.  These can have a root cause in an illness, inflammation, or chronic underlying ailment such as Crohn's disease and others that may relate to disorders of the intestine.  As I do not know the origin of the fistula, or the surgical findings prior to surgical intervention, I am unable to surmise the etiology of the fistula or derive an expected outcome.   It does strike me however, as it does you, that 8 months seems a bit overly lengthy in healing time. It would be best to relay these concerns to the surgeon who did your procedure for further assessment.  Sometimes a fistula doesn't close because it still has material inside the area, sometimes it takes time, especially if healing by secondary intention (which is when the body is allowed to heal itself without surgical closure).  If you can imagine a pipe line that you are filling in one teaspoon at a time, how long would it take for the entire process to fill/heal?  Still, since you have obvious concerns about the healing process, it would be in your best interest to relay those concerns to the surgeon and or your primary physician.\n\n",

Has the catheter already become one with my body? Or does this sound like a simple procedure?   I'm pregnant now and will have to wait for at least 5 months before i see a surgeon, so that's why i'm asking first.  thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Jean123, If you have not been symptomatic for the past 3 years (meaning you have not experienced any neurologically centered problems - such as pain, numbness, tingling, loss of motor control), I would venture that at this moment the catheter part still left in your body is not at this moment any immediate danger to you.  I would surmise that you have been leading a normal life since your C-section, and have not restricted your movements -since you did not know the catheter was there. However, since you are now pregnant, I would ask your OB/GYN if it would be wise to list you as a high-risk pregnancy, and keep a special eye on your activities. As far as the removal process goes, a neurologist, or a neurosurgeon may be the highest authority you can consult to address the actual process of the removal. A lot will depend on in which caudal space the catheter tip lies, and whether the tip is bent or \"grown\" into the body as you fear. There are diagnostic tests that can determine this.  If your doctors are reassuring you that it is safe to wait the 5 months to delivery, they may know the answers to the questions I mentioned. Please ask them to clearly tell you their input on the risks and the benefits of this whole procedure.\n\n",

I have had surgery on my right ankle to tighten two of the ligaments.  In about a year I will be having the Kidner procedure done also on my right ankle.  I am also having pretty bad heel pain.  Through all this I have tried physical therapy, which only helps control the pain, and cortisone shots, which causes almost crippling pain at the site of the injection.  I will be getting custom orthotics within a week or two but my Dr. has mentioned surgery for my plantar fasciitis.  I have pretty sever pain especially in the morning that runs up my calf as well.  My question is what are the chances that surgery will actually work as opposed to making it worse given the environment in which I work?   Are there any other treatments I can try?  Should I try to combine the surgeries as they are on the same foot?\n\n",

Somehow you need to find a way to be off your feet long enough for the inflammation to subside.  If  your doctor is recommending you to limit weight bearing for a while, I strongly advise you honor that recommendation.  To be able to walk next year and the next and the next - you may have to exercise the principle of delayed gratification, and put off the warehouse type of work until you heal more.  Else you risk developing more and more foot impairments and put yourself at risk for being long term disabled.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Linnea13, Thank you for the additional information.  Specialized orthopedic surgery combining techniques can indeed perhaps relieve your complaints.  The Kidner procedure, from the little I know, is typically done on adolescents, but has a reputation for being effective in relieving intractable plantar fasciitis as well. It sounds like you have done your \"homework\" well, and have surgeons you trust on your case.  If you do indeed trust them, and they are suggesting to combine the Kidner procedure with plantar release, you may do well to follow their suggestions. They after all, have the films of your foot, and the details of your health and lifestyle that has contributed to their recommendations.  Please be aware you will still need some time off your feet for the procedures to heal, so you do not end up with a failed surgery. You are still very young, and I would hate to see you with a lifelong disability.\n\n",

The mother gave no history of fever during her pregnancy but she stated that she took Augmentin 625 mg twice daily for a common cold infection. She was complaining of a certain degree of hypotension but not to the extent of fainting. No other drugs and no exposure to radiation. doctors in egypt said the only teatment is cutting off the hand. i have all the c-scan images of his hand and we need to know is there any other solutions for this case. thank u   [/b]\n\n",

Nerves can regenerate but they take a long time to do so.    7 months seems  a bit long for pain from surgery; however, nerves do grow back quite slowly and your pain may still be related to this.  I would suggest that you talk with your surgeon to get his/her opinion.  You may also want to see a neurologist or pain specialist as there may be specific therapies to help resolve your pain.  If it is severe enough for you to want to take medications a medicine such as gabapentin is often a good choice for nerve type pain.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "hi i was at training for sport (cricket) and i went to bowl but as i was doing so i tensed up my neck and back of my head and released straight after...  there was a sharp pain at the back of my head as if someone had thrown a small stone at my head with a huge force though everyone was just standing as normal, and now there is a small lump about 2 to 3 finger widths above my hairline.   When it happened it felt like a tear at the back of my head and the area became very hot.  I have had the lump for about 14 months now and i have noticed a servre loss of vision and concentration also lightheadedness almost all the time.  I am not sure what to do i think i may have torn ablood vessel and that it has clotted or something but i really have no idea, the lump varies in size from time to time at this moment it is as wide and round as the top of my finger and sticks out a few milimeters i think as i can only tell by feeling it. Also it is hard and moves around and is not always painfull to touch.  I hope you can give me some infortmation and i am sorry it this is abit too long\n\n",

    "content": "Hello there,  From the information you have given us, it does not sound like you have had an intra-cerebral bleed as the lump is clearly palpable on the skin. It may be of interest to note that the area of the brain that is responsible for vision lies in the back of the brain, known as the occipital lobe. What you don\u2019t mention is whether you have any other medical problems or past history of similar episodes both to yourself or your family. What is slightly worrying is your description of loss of vision and light-headedness which may or may not be related to the incident.   The description of the lump at the back of your head can be attributed to a lipoma. A lipoma is a soft, fatty lump. It is a benign (non-cancerous) growth made up from fat cells that clump together. A lipoma can occur in any part of the body where there are fat cells. They are soft to the touch, sometimes moveable, and are generally painless. As it is unusual, but not unheard of to develop a post-traumatic lipoma, other causes such as a muscle tear need to be ruled out. Another possibility could be that this lump is unrelated to the incident you describe and may have been found incidentally.   My advice to you would be to visit your family practitioner or any doctor you can access, to inspect this lump and examine the area where you felt the original pain. Further scans or biopsies may then be required in order to determine the origin of the lump and/or your symptoms.    Kind regards,  Dr Tino Solomon BSc(Hons) MBBS Senior House Officer in Surgery\n\n",

    "title": "Incisional Hernia?/Fatty Tissue?",
    "content": "I am a 45-year-old woman who had a total hysterectomy (cervices, uterus and ovaries removed) in Dec 2006. Due uncontrollable light to semi heavy bleeding, that lasted 6 months. I spent 3 days in the hospital. By my 5th day I developed very excruciating pain and a burning sensation (like someone was burning my insides with a hot poker).  I went to see the surgeon who performed the hysterectomy and he said nothing was wrong. He gave me a prescription for Vicodin. Which did absolutely nothing for the pain.  Around the 11th day the pain became so unbearable that I went to the ER where they ran an MRI and nothing was found. The ER gave me a shot and the pain finally went away. Then about 6 weeks ago I notice a lump protruding right underneath and right above the middle of my incision. Which I gives me no pain what so ever.  I can push it back a little with my finger. But when I lay on my back it disappears. I have also notice that my bladder doesn\u2019t seem to hold as much as it did after the surgery and that when it is full I have this heavy feeling. I am about 30lbs over weight and someone had made mention that it might be a collection of fatty tissue. I\u2019m wondering if it might in fact be an incisional hernia? Any feed back would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "I know we could go on and on talking about all the reasons why a person would be better off changing his lifestyle than having a liposuction, but I have made up my mind about having a liposuction and don't need to delve into this. I will only reconsider having a liposuction if its medical risks outweigh its cosmetic benefits.  If it's a safe procedure, I will have it done and then, once I have spent a few thousand dollars, deal with keeping the fat off. If I fail and gain the fat back, that's a risk I am willing to take.  I am particularly interested in getting rid of the fat in my thighs, particularly in my inner thighs, and the fat in my flanks. I feel I can get rid of the fat in my belly with enough abs so I don't really need a liposuction there.  That being said, is there any major medical risk associated with liposuctions that I should be aware of before I consider this type of surgery?\n\n",

I know my shoulder pain is normal as is some abdominal pain, but I have been having to take ibuprofin with the pain med just to be able to move around. I feel hungry and uncomfortable when I don't eat, and bloated and uncomfortable when I do try to eat. All the muscles in my upper body ache, and I ache when I take deep breaths.

    "content": "I would not expect you to have bleeding beyond a couple of days.  If that continues you should call your doctor.  The other aches and pains can be present to some degree for a couple of weeks, though it should be lessening.  Most procedures require gas to be injected which allows visualization of the tubes and it takes a while for it to be eliminated from the body.  The shoulder and abdominal pain as well as the bloating is likely caused by that.  Do as much walking as possible to help get it out of your system.  These side effects are usually the most uncomfortable part of the recovery from the surgery. Of course worsening pain would not be normal so be in touch with your doctor if this is the case.  The third day can be quite uncomfortable and you are not being a wimp.  But I would expect some easing beyond the third day.  My best to you in your recovery.\n\n",

I thought after that kind of surgery, they would have had better pain management, and done something more?\n\n",

The surgery was for a stent, and it has been in place for about a week.  I went to the urologist today, and he gave me two different options for surgery.  One is an outpatient procedure where they go in through my urethra with a laser and blow up the kidney stone into pieces.  He told me that the downside to this surgery is that because it is such a huge stone, it might leave scarring due to the trauma.  He also told me there is a chance that a piece of the kidney stone might fall back into my kidney, where they won't be able to find it.  The other option he gave me was that he would make 3 small incisions (one by my belly button, one to the right of my belly button, and one towards my upper ribcage).  They would cut open the tube and remove the whole kidney stone, then sew the incisions up.  This would guarantee the complete removal of the stone.  I would have to stay overnight, and both procedures would take about 3 hours.  I asked him which one he would do, and he said the first one where they use the laser.  I'm a little confused to why he would pick that one when in fact there is a chance that I would have to come back for another surgery.  I am scheduled to leave for the Army special forces in May, and am currently enrolled in college for my last semester.  I have NO CLUE as to which one I should do, and which one would be the best for me.  Is there ANYONE out there that could give me some advice A.S.A.P.   PLEASE HELP!  Is sexual activity ok right now, or should I wait until my stent is removed?     Also, a while ago (2004) I had surgery for hernia, and was also told that I have too many veins in my left testicle that could be decreasing my sperm production.  I was supposed to contact a urologist and get my sperm checked, but I never did.  He said that it didn't need to be done right now, but if I wanted to have kids later on in life, that I should get it done.  I was wondering if I should bring this up when I call back my doctor to schedule the surgery, or if I should wait until I got into the military and get it done then?  How long would that surgery set me back? Can you bounce back quickly from that kind of surgery?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi JDubC3, The most probable reason the physician chose the laser procedure is even though there are risks regarding scarring and loss of a piece of the stone, this is the least invasive procedure. There are risks associated with any surgical procedure. A 1.4 cm stone is a considerable size and you have to choose the procedure that you feel most comfortable. When you call to schedule ask for information pamphlets regarding both procedures. Below this post you will also find two links provided by Cornell University Department of Urology regarding various procedures including the two that you mentioned. Hopefully it will assist you in your decision making process. Have you went back to the physician for a follow-up appointment regarding your stent placement? Generally speaking, sexual activity is usually delayed until your return appointment. You should have also received a discharge paper after the procedure regarding activity etc. Inquire about resuming sexual activity and regarding sperm count when you call your physician. I hope find this useful. Click here! Click here! Best wishes. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

To answer your question, I did go back to the doctor to talk about limitations and sexual activity.  I was told that I had no limitations, and to return to activity, or sexual activity whenever I felt I was capable.  I go back into surgery on the 29th, and decided to do the laser procedure.  It seems like the best possible surgery for me, especially if everyone seems to agree. Once again, thank you so much for your response.  Jay\n\n",

    "content": "Hi JDubC3,  As you have probably been well informed by the Cornell website, treatment of kidney stones can be approached from three angles, conservative, surgical and minimally invasive surgical. The laser option that your urologist has offered you is, although technically a \u2018surgical\u2019 procedure, probably your best option as the first line treatment because it is less invasive than other methods. Conservative therapy is not really an option here due to the size of the stone. I will assume that you would have read the website information thoroughly and therefore will not need more explaining about the procedure for the time being.   However I would like to find out more from you about the veins that you claim are affecting your sperm count. Do you know what term your doctor gave them? It sounds from your description that you have a varicocoele, which is a mass of enlarged veins in the spermatic cord. They are found in 1/10 people and most commonly in those of your age group. The reason they form is because the venous drainage of your left spermatic cord, which is attached to your left testicle, can be compressed further up in the body by larger arteries and veins. This can impede the blood flow from the left testicle and thus cause an engorgement of blood. As the blood is not flowing as it should do, it does not cool and can raise the temperature of the testicle and theoretically cause infertility. This can happen to the right testicle as well although it is less common as the route it takes avoids compression by other arteries and veins. If this is the case you will need to be consulted about its management by your urologist, but after the main problem of your kidney stones have been resolved. Please keep me informed.  Kind regards,   Dr Tino Solomon  BSc(Hons) MBBS  Senior House Officer in Surgery\n\n",

    "content": "Dr. Tino Anthony Solomon,  Yes! That's exactly what he called it (varicocoele).  I already had surgery for hernia, and at that time they also took the lining out of my right testicle.  They said they were going to do both (hernia, and the varicocoele) at the same time, but when I was in recovery they told me they decided not to do it, and I could pursue it later.  They told me that I should go get it checked out later on if I wanted to have kids eventually.  I never did, thus why asking if I should do it.  Will also keep everyone informed about how the kidney stone goes.  To be quite honest I'm a little annoyed with the whole process.  My surgery isn't until the 29th, and the doctor won't call in anymore pain medication, and Advil doesn't work.  I try to drink as much water and liquids as possible, but find sometimes that I am almost urinating pure blood?  Is this a problem?  Should I be worried?  Thanks, Jay\n\n",

    "content": "Dear JDubC3,  What you describe is haematuria, or blood in the urine. This is a direct result of the stone irritating the lining of the urinary tract and causing bleeding which is passed out with urine, discolouring it. At first it may appear to be a lot of blood, but in fact it usually is the result of a few millilitres of blood causing discolouration of a larger volume of dilute urine. You are doing the right thing in keeping well hydrated as this can prevent further stone formation in some types. I wouldn\u2019t worry about the blood unless it is accompanied with severe flank pain, fever, malaise and/or a general feeling of unwellness, as this could indicate an infection has set it and will need to be treated to prevent damage to the kidneys.   Regarding your varicocoele; a simple way to determine its effect on your fertility is to analyse a sperm sample. The sperm number and quality can be determined by examination under a microscope and your specialist can use this information to come to a decision with you about surgical intervention sooner rather than later.

He told them that he is pretty sure that he got the whole stone out, but there was some trauma to my ureter tube so they had to keep the stint in for about a week.  I have an appointment on Thursday, February 8th to get x-rays done.  They will then let me know if they can remove the stint or not.  Does anyone know if I am going to be awake for that process?  The removal of it that is.  I am thinking that it would be extremely painful considering what it feels like to urinate right now.\n\n",

    "title": "medical substances that pose intellectual damage risk?",
    "content": "I didn't know where else to put this...so I put this question here..  Upon recent research I've been doing a long time ago. I came across this, on a case in shaken baby syndrome  \"... on the misdiagnosis and effect that misdiagnosis has on the accused. of course, in many cases the abusive parent or w/e is guilty but sometimes the diagnosis can eb confused with soemthing else if the child had taken a vaccination shortly prior to the supposed \"abuse\"\"  \"and the dtp vaccination has been proven to cause brain damage  \"and have in some cases been confused for sbs.\"  Vaccination causes brain damage? : \"some do. specifially the diptheria, pertussis (whooping cough) vaccine\"   Why administer something that causes irreplaceable brain damage?  \"well they finally found out that the pertussis portion of the vaccine is what causes brain damage so they now have a substitute.. \"  ---  Also, other research has shed light that drug use, marijuana, alcohol, opium: which is a element of morphine and other medical applications have risks of brain damage upon administration.  Even some very vital medical applications such as antidepressant medication use has been claimed to pose a risk of brain damage to the brain.  Also, it is hardly debateable that shock therapy doesn't inflcit damage upon the brain and the subject of shock therapy suffers mental relapses and significant mental function afterwards.  There was a famous writer, I forgot his name, that underwent shock therapy, and later claimed he lost his creative ability and his ability to write, compose words and concentrate. His ability to see creative visions clearly was eliminated permanently. He then committed suicide stating \"congratulations, you have cured the disease, but you have killed the patient.\"  You see, I too am a very creative person. I would hate to lose my creative visions.   This is what scares me the most. To find I cannot compose creative thought because of lack of vividity of thought and creative vision. it is what is the most important part of me.  This is the whole reason I'm writing this post.  I know the medical community cannot make 100% guarantees and there's always a risk to everything.  The question is in particular, how does the medical community know and prove for certainty that medical substances and applications don't pose a risk to a patient's brain in the long term - so if that patient has a career in law or some other highly intellectual field - he begins to suffer a year down the road because of mental relapses that can never be repaired because of vital and necessary medical substances he relied on a year prior?  How does the medical industry test for things like that and know without a doubt, for certainty that there is no risk and completely 0% damage to the most vital organ in the body: the brain.  Can they be 100% certain?  So, my question is: if i go through surgery and need to depend on painkillers, a variety of painkillers such as morphine (most especially) and the other more powerful ones on a daily basis.   Is the risk any different if the painkillers are injected or injested? Cause maybe the liver defuses the harmful effects of the drug? Like it does alcohol.   Cause I don't want to haveto go through surgery and depend on steady use of painkillers to ease through the process , only to find out down the road, that heavy dependency on painkillers have caused a significant impairment on function and clarity of memory and concentration, etc..  cause to be honest, i don't trust anything that goes into my body, that isn't food.\n\n",

    "content": "You've asked some very important questions that really everyone should consider before using any medication or undergoing any medical treatment.  \"How do I know this medicine or treatment is safe?\"  Before drugs are allowed to be used they are extensively tested in studies to look first at are they safe and second are they effective.  Based on this testing, decisions are made as to whether or not they should be used.  After a drug is deemed safe for use, occasionally new effects become apparent when they are used on a broad scale that were not seen in the comparatively smaller safety studies.  When these are found to be significant, the drug/treatment may be discontinued.  When diseases are more severe, more severe effects of medicines are sometimes tolerated in order to treat the disease.  In the end it comes down to risks versus benefits.  If the benefits outweigh the risks enough, the treatment/medicine may be used.  When you ask how we decide something is 100% safe, the answer is that we really never do.  Somethings we know are very safe; however, with basically every medical treatment there is some degree of risk.  The question then becomes are we as doctors and patients willing to take those risks in order gain the benefits of the treatment.  Sometimes the answer is no and we must decide on a new plan of action.  Hope this helps answer your question some.\n\n",

The fact that you have developed new lesion is considerable and should be properly investigated. It may add more pressure on the underlying nerves and vessels.   But that fact that your symptoms are also present proximal to it, make it more likely to be due to more than a cause, as you mentioned in another section that you also have lumbar disc prolapse, this is also of consideration.  I advise you to follow up with your Doctor. Keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

The open procedure has been done for many years and although the laparoscopic procedure is a newer form it has been shown to be effective as well. During this procedure, typically four small (1 inch) incisions are made verses on larger incision/open, (depending on the size of the hernia). There appears with the laparoscopic procedure a decreased chance of infection, decreased pain and recovery time as compared to the open procedure. The type of procedure of course would depend on the size, surgeons preference,  preference of the patient, etc. I hope you find this information helpful. Click here! Best wishes.

    "content": "Hello again,  Although, based on the information you have given us, it does not sound like you have developed an infection postoperatively, I would take a cautious approach to your symptoms. As they have appeared for the first time so soon after the procedure, there is a possibility that the two may be linked. You describe a clear discharge from the nose which may well be normal mucous discharge, but on the other hand there is a small but significant risk of cerebrospinal fluid leaking from the roof of the nose. This thin part of the skull, known as the cribiform plate, forms the only barrier between the brain and surrounding structures. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is produced in an area near to the centre of the brain and circulates around the brain and spinal cord providing and serving many physiological functions. One of the risks of any kind of nasal surgery is damage to the cribiform plate and as a result a leakage of CSF and creating an opening for microorganisms to enter the central nervous system which is a sterile region of the body.   Although this is unlikely it must be ruled out by your surgeon. Other causes of feeling unsteady on your feet include middle ear conditions, heart conditions, nervous system conditions and often iatrogenic or drug induced. Have you, for example recently started taking any medication for the first time or changed the dose of a drug you are normally on? The list is exhaustive and also includes psychological causes. If your surgeon or family physician concludes that the surgery is not the cause of your dizziness then a thorough medical examination should be undertaken to ensure nothing sinister or potentially treatable is missed. Please keep us updated.  Kind regards,   Dr Tino Solomon  BSc(Hons) MBBS  Senior House Officer in Surgery\n\n",

    "content": "Hello there,  From your description, it appears that either the wound has broken down or a fistula has formed after repeated operations. A fistula is an abnormal connection or passageway between organs or vessels that normally do not connect. As body tissue is invasively handled as is done in surgery, the immune system reacts to produce proteins which help heal wounds internal and on the skin. This can often be excessive, especially after repeated operations and can cause organs to stick to one another, known as adhesions. If organs adhere to the abdominal wall, then a passage can be created which can lead to wound breakdown and exposure to harmful bacteria which further break down the wound by secreting chemicals. Furthermore, a superimposed infection may have set in. An infection may have acted as a catalyst for the wound break down. You will need to give us more details about your mothers overall health status. What other medical conditions does she suffer from? Is she on antihypertensive drugs and anti-cholesterol drugs or has she ever suffered from heart problems in the past? Is she diabetic? Does she have any autoimmune conditions such as arthritis?   The reason I ask these questions relates to their relevance to wound healing. After any type of wound, in this case surgically inflicted, the body starts a process in which physiological changes occur in the organs and healing factors are released into the bloodstream and directed towards the wound(s). For this process to occur effectively, optimal conditions must be present. To list these individually would be exhaustive, but include factors such as nutrition status, age, current medication (as some alter the immune system which plays a vital role in healing), smoking status (as this limits the oxygen delivery to the wound site), and personal hygiene.   The purpose of the VAC pump is to clean the wound by removing dead tissue and infected cells, whilst drawing blood to the site to try to encourage healing by attracting chemical mediators of healing that the body possesses.. This was the function that placing maggots in wounds served in the past and in fact still do. It is important to be aware that this may be a long process and your mother can make the utmost effort to aid healing by following your surgeon's guidelines on lifestyle factors and hygiene. Please keep me updated with any progress.  Kind regards,  Dr. Tino Solomon BSc(Hons) MBBS Senior House Officer in Surgery\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Mlmcride,  I agree with Dr Lowe. I am currently working in Head and Neck surgery and we see cases like your own very often. Lymph nodes  contain white blood cells which are your body's weapon against infection and other harmful diseases. These lymph nodes number in their thousands in the body. They are located in strategic areas to drain certain organs or structures. If these are infected or inflamed for any reason, then those regional lymph nodes will enlarge. They may persist in this state for a significant period of time. In your case, it sounds like you have had either a middle ear infection or an infection of the ear canal. Therefore, the swelling may be entirely innocent and expected. However, if it has persisted for a concerning period of time, I suggest you first consult your family doctor to examine it and then he may suggest an ultrasound scan to ensure it is nothing sinister. I think this is unlikely and you should not  have anything to worry about, but it is better to be cautious.  Kind regards,  Dr Tino Solomon BSc(Hons) MBBS Senior House Offcier in Surgery\n\n",

Today was his last day of the prescription.  He woke up this morning and thought he had peed on himself in bed or something because the bed was damp when he got up to go to the restroom he noticed blood running down his stomach and went to the bed and there were several spots in the bed.  Of  course the sheets were red so it was hard to see if the draining was discolored or all blood.  He has had to put a dressing on it today and change it four times due to draining but it appears to have a little yellowish color in the blood.  Is this something we should call the doctor for or is this normal??\n\n",

It use to be the size of maybe a gumball, was hard, and could move around fairly easily with no pain. In the last few weeks I have noticed that it has begin to swell and has beginning to hurt as well. I thought that maybe it was  like a pimple and actualy tried to punture it with a needle a couple days ago because it hurts so much from the preasure. There was no fliud and very little blood that came out. This concerns me because I have had small wounds on my head that guss blood. I also have headaches when I try to brush my hair, wear a hat, or even when the wind is blowing my hair. I do have slight blured vision at times in one of my eyes at a time, but this has been going on for almost a year. I do not have insurance or very much money to see a doctor. I am hopeing this is not a brain tumer because I don't know much about them. My family does not have any history of this but do have a history of diabeties and cancer. Please got back to me as soon as posiable. Thank you!\n\n",

    "content": "I had surgery a month and a half ago to remove an ovary since an ovarian cyst was found.  It was laparoscopic surgery but they also had to make a three inch incision lower at my pelvic bone to actually remove that ovary since it was too large.  I had steri-strips on the area as a form of bandaging, which came off after about a month.  NOW, I am afraid that one end of my incision could be infected.  There is an small red lump a little less than a quarter of an inch at the end of the incision near my pelvic bone.  It has mild oozing which drains clear or very light yellow fluid daily and might contain a small amount of puss.  How do I know if I need an antibiotic or an ointment?  What can I do to stop or prevent infection?  Is it too late to prevent infection?  Also, I have 3 maybe 4 stitches that have not dissolved yet.... how long will they take to dissolve?  Do I need to have the doctor remove these stitches?  Thank you for your time and consideration.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello there,  The most important consideration to rule out here is a deep infection.  Your description certainly matches that of an infected tissue. This may take the form of a 'collection' which is a pool of infected inflammatory fluid or an abscess, a walled-off version of a collection. Antibiotics are certainly part of the treatment if it were an infection but would be used as the sole method only if the infection is superficial. If the suspicion is that the infection is deep either from clinical examination or radiological investigation, then the wound may need to be washed out and left open to heal on its on. Furthermore, if the infection is deep in the tissue or an abscess has formed, this will need to be incised and drained. I suggest you visit your surgeon urgently before the infection spreads and more radical treatment becomes necessary.

    "content": "Hello there,  Just to add to Dr Bhandari's comments. The drug you mention is less likely to interact with your wound healing than interact with other medications. Phentermine acts on the neurotransmitters in the brain, also known as a stimulant. It causes neuron bundles to release a particular group of neurotransmitters known as catecholamines; these include dopamine, epinephrine (also known as adrenaline), and norepinephrine (noradrenaline). The natural release of adrenaline in particular cause a decrease in appetite and an increase in metabolism to provide fuel for the brain when your body thinks it is in a danger situation, the 'fright, flight, fight' response. These drugs take advantage of these natural mechanisms. It is most important to not take these drugs with a certain group of anti-depressants called monoamine-oxidase inhibitors as a deadly reaction could occur called 'the cheese reaction'.   In your particular situation the group of drugs you should stay clear of unless absolutely essential is the immunosuppressant. These include drugs such as steroids, anti-arthritis drugs and drugs used for chronic inflammatory conditions. They impair wound healing by limiting the amount of inflammatory cells can be delivered to the site and form new tissue to repair the wound. Many other factors are involved in wound healing including nutritional status, age, suture technique, diabetes etc. However this is an altogether different topic. The take home message is to eat well, keep the wound clean and follow your surgeon\u2019s instructions meticulously.  Regards, Dr Tino Solomon BSc (Hons) MB BS Senior House Officer in Surgery\n\n",

I can live with not being able to breathe so well through my nose but I'd like some relief from the tinnitus and the more frequent sinus pain/headaches I have been experiencing for a few years.

    "content": "Hello there,  Yes nasal polyps can certainly cause your symptoms and are most likely to be doing so. The exact causes of polyps are still open to debate but are thought to be due to chronic allergic rhinitis, chronic sinusitis, and, less commonly, underlying disease such as cystic fibrosis. There may even be a genetic link, but this is unproven. Symptoms often described are nasal obstruction, persistent nasal discharge (rhinorrhea), and a loss of the sense of smell (anosmia). Nasal polyps themselves, by blocking the nasal airways, can also block drainage, creating stagnant secretions that stay in the sinus cavities and may lead to infections which can cause sinusitis. Nasal polyposis has been noted in association with chronic or recurrent acute sinusitis in as many as one out of every 20 patients referred to ENT clinics.  The aim of the intranasal steroid sprays you have been prescribed is to reduce polyp size, increase airway patency and decrease inflammatory chemical release in the nasal tissues, thus reducing inflammation and potential for infection. Tinnitus (ringing in the ears), with or without ear blockage and a sensation of fullness in the head can occur and may be related to involvement of the eustachian tube. If medical treatment is not relieving your symptoms, as is evident, then your ENT surgeon has decided to progress to surgical correction.   Endoscopic sinus surgery is the procedure of choice. With the advent of endoscopic sinus surgery, surgical treatment for sinus diseases has become safer, and the outcome has improved. The procedure can be carried out under local anaesthesia with light sedation or a general anaesthetic. You will need to be made aware by your surgeon of the risks of surgery. Rare examples include post-surgical cerebrospinal fluid leakage and possible bleeding from related sinus arteries. However, detailed pre-operative planning can avoid any unnecessary risks. There is also a real possibility of polyp recurrence despite surgical removal, therefore close follow-up after the procedure combined with adherence to your surgeon\u2019s instructions is a must to reduce this risk. As you may have gathered, this is a very specialised area that is best dealt with by an ENT specialist who will inform you further. I hope this has been of some help nevertheless.

    "content": "Hello there,  Yes your 'tonsils' or at least the lymphoid tissue that constitutes them can grow back, this is a common occurrence as with many types of tissue in the body which retain their ability to regenerate, notable exceptions being the heart and nerve cells. Lymphoid tissue consists of collections of cells in one space that trap and destroy harmful microbes circulating round the body or entering the body from external sources. You will have lymphoid tissue in many areas in your body such as your colon and neck.     When the tissue at the site of your tonsils grows back they rarely grow to the size children have since we develop other immunological mechanisms that are well adapted to the threat of microbes. The lymphoid tissue consists of crypts and these can harbour bacteria and fungi that replicate and express themselves. The white spots you describe may be due to discharging pus from these crypts due to a bacterial infection or may be colonies of a fungus such as the Candida species. Both can cause a sore throat and generalised weakness although bacterial infections tend to be more serious as they advance more rapidly. They can both be treated effectively.  It is difficult to diagnose the exact cause of these spots unless the area is examined visually and even then samples will need to be sent off to be looked at under a microscope in a laboratory. If you are feeling systemically unwell I urge you to go to your family physician who should arrange for you to see an ENT (Ear Nose and Throat) specialist soon.

    "content": "Hello there,  During my orthopaedic rotations both at medical school and in my intern year I never came across a case such as yours. Almost every long bone in the upper and lower limbs as well as the shoulder, elbow, knee, hip and to a certain extent the ankle can be partially or fully replaced by a prosthesis. Do these missing bones make it difficult for you to walk or put any weight on your foot? Is it affecting your day to day lifestyle? If not then you would be hard pressed to find an orthopaedic (bone) surgeon who would be feeling to give your toes a second look. There are various methods of fusing the bones in the toes to offer some stability if required. The only prostheses in that area I am aware of are external, i.e. artificial detachable models for aesthetic purposes. As you retain your toes in form this would not really be indicated. I suggest you visit an orthopaedic surgeon specialising in the foot and ankle for recommendations if you are having difficulties.

    "title": "Steel BB in hand",
    "content": "Hello there,  Generally speaking, a low velocity penetrating injury, which I assume this is, carries with it the risk of an infection. This is because any microbes carried with the vehicle, in this case the ball bearing (BB), have not been sterilised by heat caused by the explosion and friction of the blast. On the contrary, a high velocity injury which does not convey any attached foreign body, is usually sterile because of the intense heat caused by the friction.  Another factor to consider is the composition of the BB. Steel on its own is not toxic, but some BBs may have lead or other metal component as part of their makeup which may be toxic to the body. This is an indication to remove the object. However if the object is steel and has been in your hand for months without any effect it may be safe to just leave it there. I recommend that you visit a hand surgeon  (orthopaedic or plastic surgeon), to discuss your options.  Hope this helps.  Dr Tino Solomon Senior House Officer in Surgery MBBS BSc(Hons)\n\n",

    "content": "My partner went into a hospital in Crewe UK for a hernia operation to be done under local and sedation. She told them before going into the operating room that she wanted to keep her knickers on. The sister agreed that they wouldn\u2019t be in the way and she would respect her wishes.  She was then given 10 mg of Midzolam in one shot and went to sleep. They then removed her knickers with no consent and against her wishes. They claim it was done so they wouldn\u2019t get stained which is a none medical reason. Unfortunately Midzolam is known to give you sexual dreams. She dreamed she was being Gang Raped when they removed her knickers which if you think about it is what happened she was surrounded by people in the operating theatre and they removed her knickers so you can see why she experienced this.  The problem is she has suffered post traumatic shock  and after 7 months still suffering she wakes screaming trying to cover herself from the rape and suffers depression. It has effected me in the same way we just cant get out of our head that she was forcibley stripped in a most disgusting and humiliating way.  She then nearly died as her heart dropped to 30 from 80 as a result of the Midz. She was in horrendous pain and they called for an anaesthetist but there wasn\u2019t one so they carried on for 2 hours. She said the pain was ten time worse than having a baby. She was then given a suppository which again she had told them she didn\u2019t want and this was given without her consent.  The hospital acknowledge that her knickers were removed but refuse to take any action against who ever removed them. They refuse to give their names  and  who is responsible if the surgeon said remove them and then a nurse actually removed them who is guilty?  What can we do it must have taken more than one person to remove them as she is 22 st so the yare all guilty. I wonder why any medical person would remove them for none medical reasons knowing to do anything without consent means they can be struck off. It then raises the question was it done for sexual reasons like did someone like watching women stripped  and having a look at their privates as I cant believe anyone would be so stupid to do it for any other reason.  What can we do about it? How can we force the hospital to take action. What is  your opinion of what happened?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello there,  Your post is of a surgeon's pre-operative and operative notes. These are documented every time a patient is seen as a record of who attended the patient, when, where and the relevant findings. If a decision is made to treat the problem surgically, then an operative note detailing the procedures performed and including post-operative instructions is essential both for those looking after the patient (who may not have been present at all stages of the consultation and treatment) and medico-legally in case a complication arises.  The first paragraph describes the findings on abdominal examination and is self explanatory. The ability to reduce a hernia is important. (Hernia  = the protusion of an organ or tissue through an abnormal opening usually due to a weakness in the tissue through which it protudes). The reducibility of the hernia essentially means that it is not incarcerated, that is, it can be pushed back and thus is less likely to have its blood supply cut off, although I am slightly confused as the operative notes state an irreducible hernia. A soft, non-tender abdomen excludes an infective or inflammatory reaction in the abdomen or peritoneum (a lining covering the abdominal cavity) causing a peritonitis which can be triggered by any surgical problem in that area and would require urgent surgery to prevent the spread of infection and organ shutdown.  The respiratory and cardiovascular systems are routinely examined prior to any surgery as they are major determinants in the overall health status of the patient. They can be used to help decide whether the concerned subject is fit enough to withstand the stresses of surgery and an anaesthetic. The 1+11+0 simply denotes that the first and second heart sounds were heard with no additional unusual sounds. The conclusion is that the heart sounds were normal at the time of examination.  I have  never come across the Glasgow Coma Scale being tested pre-operatively simply because the ability to communicate alone gives one a maximum score. It is only used in the UK as a marker of consciousness in people with head injuries or any condition affecting the conscious state of a patient e.g. infection or  metabolic disturbances.  The operative note details the procedure performed which seems to have occurred without any problems in this case. The only detail I note is missing is the post-operative instructions which can enhance or delay recovery if followed or not adhered to. The most important point to take from this is that the patient's examination was essentially normal and operation at the time of surgery a success. Hope this is of some help to you.

If this pain is associated with cough, breathing problems it could be due to bronchitis.  If it is related to swallowing problems it could be either sore throat or esophagitis and esophageal spasm is the cause.  - Muscle spams due to improper movement or wrong posture could be another cause.  - Joint problems like spinal problems, gastroenteritis, and Temporomandibuilar Joints dysfunction which is associated with headache and clinching teeth.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I'm a 53 yr old female with an embarrassing problem! When I delivered my son 17 yrs ago I sustained a 4th degree tear requiring a lot of stitches etc. I'm having major problems now (the fun of growing older!) with a rectocele and rectal prolapse and am now getting a lot of stool incontinence to the point where I tend to stay home most of the time. I saw a colo-rectal surgeon in Vancouver (Canada)  2 yrs ago who advised I'd need 2 separate surgeries to repair the problem. To complicate things I have IBS-diarrhea.  I'm really hesitant to have 2 major surgeries but have tried pelvic floor physio etc and I guess there's not much else left. My quesion is,  with this type of surgery how long does it take to recover and what to expect in the immediate post-op period and how successful are the surgical repairs? It was suggested that sometimes over time the problem can recur. Thanks much!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear blueribbon,   I understand your fears; at the same time I assume that your physician as well is aware by your medical history.   So, according to the informations taken from your posts, you probably have left supraclavicular and or lower cervical Lymph node (LN) enlargements. You also have mentioned that the supraclavicular node is easily felt and is increasing in size.   The thyroid scan and investigations checking for thyroid recurrence or metastases were negative.  But this does not exclude further investigation for these enlarged LNS. A conventional US study with or without Doppler can help in confirmation of their nature. US guided FNAC can also be done for the pathological diagnosis.   Regarding the breast swelling, is it felt at same side where the LNS are enlarged?   You mentioned that it could not be detected by US or Mammography, a possibility of fibroadenosis is there however, they also have characteristic picture on both US and Mammography. Comparison with previous mammography if any, is of value in this case.   A negative mammogram does not preclude procceding for FNAC or biopsy for a suspicious mass. Some doctors go for MRI for further investigations.   PET scan (radionuclide) is used to detect metastatic disease and is considerable in your condition, although it is not recommended for initial diagnosis of patients with suspected breast lesion less than 1 CM.    My advice is to follow up with your doctor and to discuss with him the above diagnostic approaches.   Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Hi nikki5, The use of Xenical is actually contraindicated in certain conditions. According to documented literature regarding this medication, it is not to be used in people who have gallbladder problems among other disorders. Xenical blocks some of the absorbtion of fat consummed so by stopping this medication and eating a healthy, low fat diet with exercise, should produce the same benefit. Eating 2 pieces of fruit per day and nothing else does not constitute a healthy diet and you are essentially doing yourself more harm than good due to the fact that you are making your body think that it's starving to death, slowing metabolism, so that when you do consume any food, it stores EVERYTHING, as a reserve. As a note, you also should consider your current diet, an additional health detriment, as not providing appropriate fuel sources, you are also at risk for other medical problems, electrolyte imbalances, heart arrythmias, severe starvation states, death. I would strongly encourage you to reveal to your physician that you have been using this medication, have discontinued it's use, and talk with a nutritionist or dietician about some direction on a healthy diet and exercise program.

This in turn slows metablosim, so the body burns less calories, that's what causes the weight gain. The key to maintaining a healthy weight or weight loss in general is burning more calories than consumed. Good luck to you and best wishes with your upcoming procedure.

Previous to surgery I had pins n 'needles sensations in the palm of my hand, little/ring finger which I understand is caused by the nerve being compressed. After surgey there was some relief but I understand it takes time. Anyways around May 11 I was injured, elbow included. At the time  of the injury not many symptoms were appearing. Within that day or two I started experiencing pins n 'needles sensations from the elbow all the way down into the palm. I never had pins n ' needles in the elbow previous to the surgery. This started after the injury. Also the pain is getting bad. I know nothing is broken and I have been taking Advil for almost two weeks, not helping. I realize my arm is still recovering from surgery and the injury does not help but the pins n' needles nor the pain is not improving over the past few weeks. Any idea of what is going on with the sensation? I hope nothing was disrupted. The surgeon said he found a lot of scar tissue in my elbow during surgery. Any advice?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Jill,  Yes, they can reappear that fast. Adhesions occur as a reaction to tissue injury, it is a healing process. Adhesions occur after almost every abdominal surgery; this process begins within hours and by day five all the reactions required are completed; afterwards the adhesions continue to mature, with healing completed within 3 to 4 weeks.  Concerning your second question on visualization of abdominal adherences on contrasted CT scans, they could be seen, but is unusual. The most reliable procedure to confirm the presence of adherences is laparoscopy.  The problem is that is not always possible to conclude with certainty that the new adhesions are causing your pain, because the presence of adhesions is not a reliable predictor of pain. You should talk to your doctor about this.  Best luck,  Dr. Alberto de la Guerra.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I am 34 years old, female and had ulnar nerve compression surgery on my left elbow April 25. The surgeon said I had a lot of scar tissue in my elbow. I had previous injuries to this area such as bruising, strains, sprains and a dislocated shoulder in the past year. So do the above injuries lead to scar tissue if they don't heal properly or one injury on top of another?  Also I am having problems with my dressing. I think I may be allergic to the steri-strip tape he used across the incision or maybe dissolvable stitches?. He also used dissolvable stitches. I feel very itchy and can actually see what appears to be one small blister type thing. My bandage is slightly loose and I took a flashlight without sticking it down the dressing and could see the above. I don't scratch the dressing or touch anything. My bandage will not be removed until May.8. Is there anything I can do or should I contact the surgeon?\n\n",

He said I will need to wear a drainage tube for a few days but I forgot to ask some questions. I imagine he means a drainage tube at the site of the incision? What is it used for?  He said it would be removed after a few days. Is this something I would remove or the doctor?\n\n",

    "title": "pituitary  Benign Brain tumor / f/ 40+",
    "content": "Dear Doctor,  I have a close friend of mine, whose mother is being operated for the 3rd time in the last 10 years for a Pituitary Benign Brain Tumour. She is around 40 years old. She was first operated in 1994 in Mumbai (India), and later the tumour reoccured in the brain and was again under surgery in 2002. Once again it seems the tumour has re-appeared and she will be operated on the 19th of December (or appx near then)...   Some of the doctors within the state have said there is no cure (100% removal of this tumour) and that even if done successfully the tumour will grow out again through some of the cells. However, I am not amused by this answer since  from what I have read on the internet Radiation Therapy has been successful in most cases. I would however prefer a second opinion and was referred here by a family friend (Doctor in the Cardiology dept from California) and was told to post here and possibly get some suggestions - 1) What are the alternatives for treetments , 2) Suggestions of possible doctors who can provide more personal guidance , 3) What do you suggest - Invasive Surgery or some other therapy. Please let me know as we are worried about her and that since it's the third time in the operation theatre, a lot of us (family and friends) are really worried. Some guidance or suggestions would help give us a few options to discover in case 3rd time surgery becomes a risk of its own.  Sincerely, S.P.\n\n",

This should have been a relatively pain free procedure and if she experienced this type of pain then the anesthesia was ineffective and in my opinion,another form should have been used. Congestion of the sac may have meant excessive amounts of fluid/blood, and a drain would be placed to alleviate this problem. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "Hi NASHUA, I am quite sorry to hear that the results aren't as good as hoped for presently. I can certainly understand your nervousness and anxiety over the whole situation. However, ask yourself this question...... is worrying going to actually change the outcome one way or another? The answer, when you stop and think about it is no, it will not change the outcome one way or another. Essentially your wasting energy on something you have absolutely no control over. Worry about things you can change and do something about it. The rest of the things and situations that you have no control over changing will work themselves out one way or another. I wish you the best of luck. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

I really think I made a mistake when he told me and my wife that it wouldn't leak because there was a valve inside my bladder and the only way to open it was with the cath going in and that would open the valve to drain my urine and I fell for it hook line and sinker and look at all the problems I have now .Be honest should I talk with a lawyer or not I'M so depressed my regular Dr. had to put me onlexapro 20 MG .I just don't know what to do ? please try to advise me or stear me in the right direction thank you NASHUA\n\n",

    "content": "Is it colored at all?  Where the jawbone meets the neck is a common place for certain types of acne, if it becomes tender or sore and discolored, a pale pink or purple, it is probably a  pimple, or a sebaceous cyst.  If it's a pimple, it is a small infection - you can get a shot of cortisone to take down the inflammation and take a short course of antibiotics to heal the infection.  A sebaceous cyst  usually requires surgical removal (no big deal, a little novocaine in the cyst and it's done right in the doctor's office).\n\n",

    "content": "I  am  trying  to get some information on Midazolam My partner had a   umblical hernia   operation   under  local  anesthetic  and  was  also  given   Midazolam. She weights 138 KG she was given 10mg of Midazolam at the   start  of  the operation. I understood this was to be given 1mg at a   time  over  2  mins  then  wait  2min  before giving anymore is this   correct?   They gave here 10mg all in one go. After 50 mins her bp was   125/80  pulse  85  it then dropped to 100/30 pulse 39 and she passed   out and had to be given Atropine it took them 6 mins to give her the   Atropine. Later in the operation they gave her 2 mg Midazolam and 50   mins later again her bp and heart rate dropped.    Is the sudden drop of BP and pulse caused by the Midazolam? It seems   to  happen  after  50  mins  each time. Is she in danger of dieing ?    During  the  operation  which should have lasted 30 mins but went on   for  2.5  hours  the pain relief didnt work and she was screaming in   pain  she said the pain was 10 times worse than having a baby but  the was no anesthetist so they carried on. Could the drop   in  BP  etc  be  a  result  of pain? Does it means she is allergic to   Midazolam? They said it was a hard operation but there were no problems she was given a patch for the hernia.  They said if the put her to sleep she wouldnt wake up why?    Could  she  have been overdosed on Midazolam as they gave it her all   in one go?    I  hope you can help us with these answers as the hospital don't want   to give us any answers. She is 34 years old with no other problems she has had 2 children\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Samuria  Midazolam is a very short-acting benzodiazepine. It is used for conscious sedation, anxiolysis, and amnesia during minor surgical or diagnostic procedures, as an anesthesia induction agent, or as an adjunct to regional anesthesia. Midazolam has a slow induction time and  prolonged recovery time . The manufacturers label contains a black-box warning that describes the risk of respiratory arrest, the need for adequate personnel and equipment when administering midazolam, and the appropriate dose titration.  As far as for the dose,   Intravenous dosage:For Sedation and amnesia production: Adults: The key is to titrate slowly to achieve the desired effect. The usual dosage range is between 1-5 mg IV given over a 2-minute period, immediately before the procedure. Initially, do not exceed 2.5 mg (or 1.5 mg for elderly, debilitated, or those receiving other CNS depressants). If an adequate response is not achieved after 2-minutes, titrate upward in small increments. A total dose of 5 mg is generally sufficient for normal healthy adults.  Midazolam  can cause respiratory depression in 11% of patients after IM administration and 23% of patients after IV administration. Respiratory depression is most commonly manifested as decreased respiratory rate and reduced tidal volume. Apnea has been reported in 15% of patients.  Hypotension is frequently reported with parenteral midazolam use. So the drop in blood pressure that your friend had could be a side effect of midazolam, and this happens frequently.  As far as why you noticed the symptoms appeared after about 50 min, this could be related to the pharmaco-kinetics of the drug. The onset of action following IM and IV administration occurs in 5-15 minutes and 1.5-5 minutes, respectively. Maximum effects are seen in 20-60 minutes, and this is where this period that you have mentioned.  in fact pain usually triggers additional stress, and this usually causes increase in blood pressure due to increase in adrenaline. So , i do not think her pain could have caused this decrease in blood pressure. Remember that the two blood pressure readings you have mentioned are totally normal, and not considered \"hypotension readings\" per see.  Again, i do not think what your friend experienced is an allergic reaction to the drug, the drop is seen frequently in patients given this medicine. The fact that she wqas given more than 5 mg, could be due the fact that some patients require higher doses to induce sedation.  Thank you very much, and i hope she always feels better.\n\n",

She says she screamed her head of with pain but the hospital deny this could the drug have made her unable to speak and show she was in pain? They do admit she was crying.

    "content": "Dear markorn, There is nor real cause for concern from what you describe. As you probably now, varicocele means variceal dilatation of the veins draining blood from the testicle.  While the operation deals with these, taking  them all down would possibly result in testicular atrophy or at least compromised fertility which is the very disorder the operation  usually tries to correct in the first place.  As for the pain, there are two likely causes, first the nerves that provide sensory innervation to the anterior aspect of the thigh which course along  the region where surgery was performed and second, if an transperitoneal approach was chosen ,the closure of the peritoneum which usually result in dull pain. It should subside and require only light analgesia.\n\n",

Sorry if im being fussy but im only 16 and really worried about the pain.. i don't really understand the scientific words you use to describe the two possible things that could be the cause of the pain.  Are the two possible causes of the pain you have mentioned a cause of concern? or can both be fixed without another surgery? im really scared i don't want another surgery anymore :( .. or will it go away on its own?? please reply back soon.  Thanx again!\n\n",

    "content": "ok.. the aching has cooled down a lil for the past few days which is relieving.  But this morning at around 5am i had the worst stomach ache ever which lead me to ask my dad to take me to the hospital.  Literally i was on the floor in pain.  But this is not my problem.  My problem is that i went to the hospital and they told me to do a urine sample.  I did what they said only to find out that they found 'four drops of blood and four drops of protein' in my urine.  This is what got me worried as since the operation, peeing wasnt a major problem at all apart from the fact that i have been having minor pain when peeing the last seconds of pee.  Then after the peeing finishes, theres a bit more pain and i think that thats the end of my peeing.  whereas i take a break and actually there is always a small amount of pee left after the break of peeing.  It is extremely hard to explain but it happens everytime.  The pain is minor and so i thought it is normal in the recovery period.  But having found out that my urine sample turned out to be unusual.  I am thinking that this could be a cause for concern =( .. please help..! thanx!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi hannahgrace, Here is a general link about neck dissections. This link is not to imply that this is the exact surgery you are about to have nor is it meant to imply that you have a definite malignancy. It is general patient information that will give you an outlook on what questions, etc., would be valuable. Click here! For instance, when you go in for your consult ask things like the following: What kind of anesthesia (most likely it will be general) will be used, side effects, etc. How long the surgery will last including the stay in the recovery room (so you can let your family or whomever is going to accompany you know the expected amount of time) You will probably go to an ICU (Intensive care unit) after surgery. How large your incision is expected to be. What method will be used to close the incision (sutures, staples, etc) Level of discomfort during swallowing When will you resume eating (most likely it will start out liquids  and soft foods) Will a drain be inserted in the neck (most likely) How long will your hospital stay be (Often 3-5 days, depending on recovery) Will prophylactic antibiotics be used (most likely as well as IV Fluids) during your hospital stay. What type of inhospital pain medication will be used. Upon discharge will antibiotics and pain medication be prescribed (both should be). Length of time it will be before a pathology report will be received and when will you be notified of the results. Signs and symptoms of infection to watch for (fever, chills, excessive drainage, redness, warmth, increased pain, etc.) I hope this information has been somewhat helpful and good luck and our best wishes to you. I hope that when you time permits you will consider posting a follow-up to let us know how you are doing. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

I had a fever-not sure what actual temp was, by the time I had a thermometer available it had been an hour or so after taking fever reducer-but my temp at that time was still 99.9 by mouth. It lasted for about 4 hours. I felt very tired-I could barely keep my eyes open but I didn't actually fall asleep. Almost felt like I was in an altered state of consciousness. Very bad headache on the left side of my head. Neck pain on left side going around to the back (but not the right side). Terrible pain in my left hand. General achiness and weakness in whole body. Thankfully, I was with my boyfriend at the time. I couldn't stand up without him holding me. Just very weak and dizzy. Then I got really nauseated. Had to sit with a bucket between my knees for an hour or so. I was out of town, but my bf thought he should take me to an urgent care center. I knew it would be kinda pointless since they don't know my medical history especially w/ the tumor and all. Doc said I prolly had something viral and sent me off. A few hours later I felt practically fine. It was just so weird! It felt like a workout signing my name a few times. Never felt anything like it. Just thought I'd see if you had any advice... maybe the doc's right, just a viral thing; but, I figured it wouldn't hurt to ask. Thanks.\n\n",

The surgeon's top two guesses for the mass are a branchial cleft cyst or an enlarged lymph node. He removed the mass along with a lymph node. The mass was \"a little larger than a hard-boiled egg\" and was pushing on the carotid artery and a spinal nerve going to my left shoulder blade. I hope I'm getting all this right...I've been so drugged up! I had a drain, but hardly anything was coming out of it, so it came out midmorning today. The surgeons closed the incision with dissolving stitches beneath the skin and tape on top of the skin.   I'm feeling pretty well, considering. My left ear is totally numb; it feels so strange! I'm in moderate amount of pain with pain killers. I'm trying to sit up and stand as much as possible to help the swelling go down. That seems to help more than the drugs. I think that's about everything for now, until the pathology report comes back to let us know for sure what the mass was. I'll prolly read this in a few days and realize how little sense this makes... haha. I'll be continuing to rest and recover. Thanks for all your help.\n\n",

    "content": "It's been a really rough week...   :cry:  My surgery was Friday, December 30th.  Actually, I have a kinda funny story. For dinner the night of my surgery, I had a liquid diet. I was still so sleepy from the anesthesia and the drugs for pain that somehow, from the time I picked up my mug of broth, till the time I got it to my mouth, I fell asleep and spilled the broth all over the front of me. Uhhh, not my finest hour!   But, anyway,  I came home the next day. That night, when I came home, I started having a lot of throat pain, and I was coughing up yellow/greenish mucus. When I would lie down in my bed, my head and neck would hurt very badly. I started having really bad chest pain. I yelled for my mom (I still live at home; I'm only 19) and she came in and gave me some ibuprofen (I still had another 2 1/2 hours before I could take any more pain pills)and some mucinex. Then she took my temperature. It wasn't high, but my mom figured that was because I had just had cold water to take my pills, and she could tell by feeling me that I was feverish. She brought me a cool towel for my head and told me she thought it would be better for me to sleep with my head elevated. So, I spent the night in the recliner in the living room. This helped the swelling and the chest pain. And, again, I fell asleep mid-sip and spilled all over myself, but this time it was ice water!   Okay, so the next day is Sunday. One of the papers I had been sent home with said to call the hospital and talk with an anesthesiologist if my throat hurt for more than 24 hours after surgery. My throat was hurting so bad, I could hardly talk. So, my mom called and talked to the anesthesiologist who was on call. He said, if the tumor was a cleft branchial cyst, it was possible the surgeons had to manipulate the throat in order to get it out, which could be causing the more severe, prolonged pain. He told us if it wasn't better by the next day, or if it got worse at any point, come in to the emergency room.   Now, it's Monday morning. My throat is still hurting really bad and now my left ear has started hurting really bad. I know that the clinic in town is closed, and if I can just wait one more day, it'll save me a 30 minute drive to the hospital. But, at about 4:30 in the evening, I just could not take it any longer, and I had my mom take me in to the emergency room. The doctor there diagnosed me with a sinus infection and bronchitis and put me on a 5 day treatment of zithromax and he gave me more powerful pain pills.   So, I suffer with the pain for a couple days and by Thursday, my ear is hurting severely. My mom called the surgeon and he said he wanted to see me as soon as possible. So, he looks at the incision, my ear, my nose, my throat and he's pretty okay with how everything looks. So, we ask him why I'm in so much pain. He tells us that he's really not surprised that I'm in a lot of pain because my body had been through a beating. And he talked of how difficult it had been to get the tumor out, and how much pulling and tugging he had to do. So, he reassured me that I was on the mend. While we were there, the surgeon told us that they couldn't figure out what my tumor was, so it had to be sent to Madison, Wi. and probably woudn't know the results for 4 or 5 days.   I got a call from the hospital the hospital the next day  telling me that the pathology had come back from Madison, and my tumor was a very large BENIGN lymph node! It was such a relief!  So, now it's Tuesday, 11 days since my surgery. I feel that my sinus infection and bronchitis are all cleared up, my throat is feeling much better as is my ear, but there's still a little bit of pain. My neck is still very tender, but the swelling has gone down a lot. My biggest pain is my left shoulder, the nerve that the tumor was pressing on. I have difficulty raising my hand above my head, lifting, pretty much anything with my left arm. And, although it's not painful, I still have numbness in my ear and along my jawline and other areas in my neck that's just kind of an annoyance.  But, I'm getting better! and, it's not cancer!\n\n",

No for sure answers yet but ct scan shows hyperexpanded lungs......I do have some chest pain but not like the constant dragging and annoying pain on lower right rip cage front to back area.  Tried celebrex for anti inflamatory, Albuterol inhalers for asthma......still have the right side pain.  shouldn't be a stitch if constantly there right?  what about Pleurisy?  What about collapsed lower lung........or maybe the hyperexpanded lung is pushing on the lower abdominal wall and also putting pressure on liver.  Now, I have my beer too, but I'm only 28.....don't drink hard alcohol.  cirrhosis out?, liver size came up normal on ct scan.  I think its pleurisy, but damn doctor just prescribed the inhaler again.  I have been a smoker......and no haven't officially stopped so then the pain must be blamed on smoking right?  other smokers don't have this pain......not at 28.  I've stopped smoking before for 3 months.....pain still there but actually was lessened.  eating food actually does make it better.  Gastritis?(sp)  I think expanded lung, causing pleurisy......lupus?  I'm so sick of it by now, over 2 years of feeling the pain, hasn't really gotten awhole lot worse and not better.

    "title": "Symptoms of Umbilical Hernia",
    "content": "Hello. I have seen my primary care dr and a surgeon. There seems to be a differing opinion on my condition, so I'm looking for additional info to better understand the possible concerns re. a small umbilical hernia. According to my pc I should get it taken care of because the fat on the liver which is currently blocking the opening could move causing another severe abdominal attack, which I've had two (one lasting about 15 min. and the 2nd One hr) and if the attack doesn't subside, I could be endangering my intestines if they get caught within the opening. According to the surgeon, who seemed to be more concerned about my usage of 4-6 percocets per day to control chronic pain from spinal arthritis (prescribed by a well recognized rheumatologist in Tucson-as needed) the hernia is small, which was represented before hand on the CT scan; is a medium level concern and will probably get larger. I didn't feel like I was getting a solid answer from the surgeon as far as whether this was something that could be managed for awhile as per my symptoms or if it needed to be handled more expeditiously. I was uncomfortable on the exam table (back) and a little nervous expecting that his poking into the navel would initiate another abdominal attack, which is the worst pain I've ever felt in my life. He proclaimed no less than four times that he didn't think he could control  the pain since I couldn't withstand his poking at the navel and that I was about to jump off the exam table- I felt that was an exaggerated reflection, but didn't indicate such to him. I explained that it was a fear of possible pending abdominal attack and I was nervous and indicated that he could try it again, but he didn't. He also said that he thought I had a low threshold for pain since all his other patients seem to do well on a max of 4 perc during the entire recovery (this was my initial mtg with him). I replied that I always thought that I had a rather high pain threshold. I advised him that I reside in an area 1hr away from med help and that during these attacks (I use this term to reflect the severity of the experience) I can not move. During these two experiences I was nausiated, felt over-heated, like I could pass out and severe abdominal pain (ex. being kicked in the belly and smacked on the back as the pain wraps around. Over the last two wks, I can feel a pulling in two areas (1-slightly left of the navel and 2- upper right feels between where ribs meet in chest cavity). One day I spent most of the day doubled over to try to manage the pain. I sought the services of the surgeon to get facts re. the procedure and what to expect afterwards, but somewhere the mtg went poorly. He said that I wouldn't be able to handle the pain. Being that I've handled quite a bit of pain at all degrees over the last 10 yrs or so, I don't doubt that I can handle this, but I would like to know more about what to expect. If by some chance, since I'm no stranger to the perc's, they didn't help for the 3-4 days recovery are there alternative methods of managing the pain (ie. warm shower, heating pad) and is it really any worse than what I've already endured with the abdominal attacks themselves and AS flares when they are at their peak. Also, sometimes when I eat I can feel some pressure like maybe the food entering the stomach....lasts for a bit and then deminishes. Do these symptoms sound like that of an umbilical hernia or more like something not yet discovered? I'm going to seek out another surgeon, but I'd like some helpful hints in the interim to minimize pain should another attack occur. I have been watching what I eat as well as activities since the AS diagnosis and am trying to learn as much as possible to be a well educated patient so that I can better understand the physicians for the term for which I will be waiting for a cure for the AS. Thank you for any suggestions you'd like to share. Your generosity in sharing your knowledge with those like myself is appreciated beyond words. Thanks. Michelle\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Michelle: Pain control is always a concern when one undergoes surgery. It seems from your explanation that the surgeon does not want to prescribe stronger drugs to control your pain.  In that case, you may find seeking another surgeon who is more familiar with current views on pain control.  There are stronger drugs than percocent that can be given.  Your primary physician is right to be concerned about your hernia.  There is always a danger that a portion of the bowel could get caught  in the herniated area and blood supply to it be cut off.  If this occurs gangrene could develop. Whether your hernia is at that point only your physician could tell you.  It is important however, that you feel comfortable with the one who is doing your surgery and if you feel you can relay your needs to one then you of course have the right to go elsewhere. Let me know how things go. Carolyn\n\n",

    "title": "Is the a symptom of an umbilical hernia?",
    "content": "Hi again. Thanks for all your help. I'm waiting to hear back from a surgeon in re. to sched. an appt to fix the umbilical hernia. I have a question re. something that happened this morning and whether it is a symptom of the hernia. This AM I was awakened to a tearing sensation about an 1\" or 2\" upwards from the naval (between the ribs in the soft area), but it felt like a horizontal tear; I wasn't moving at the time. It hurt, but just for a few seconds and then subsided. I'm told that the hernia has blocked by a piece of fat on the liver or kidney (I've forgotten, but the primary care indicated that it is something that everyone has at birth on this organ). As time progresses the pulling sensation (1-just left of naval, 2-the area where the horizontal tear feeling was this AM) is more frequent and some days I must be careful when bending at the waist as it is uncomfortable. I don't feel any different today, but I was just curious if this is part of the progression of the hernia, or if it's just a strange fluke. I've never had it happen before. I have been sleeping sitting upright for the last couple of night as it seems to help my intestines (working diagnosis of IBS) which haven't been very happy with me, regardless of the measure I take to keep them from unpleasantness. If I sleep flat or on my side my abdominal area has slight pain. I still am hopeful that maybe after the hernia is repaired that the intestinal discomfort and pain will subside seeing as they both started within a few months of one another. Any info that you can provide is greatly appreciated. Thanks again and have a nice evening. God Bless You for All Your Efforts. Michelle\n\n",

    "title": "Hard lump behind/below left ear!",
    "content": "I have had the said lump for about two years and visited my GP when I first noticed it; I was told that it was a fatty lump and to revisit him if it grew or became painful.  After a recent BUPA health check, the consultant insisted I get it checked out further.   After visiting an ear/nose/throat specialist at my local hospital, I have been told (in laymans terms) that it is an 'innocent swelling', but that if left, in a small number of cases, can turn into something more sinister so have to have it removed.  The consultant explained the after effects of having this lump removed; I will have no feeling in my left ear-lobe; I will have a wonderful 'face-lift' type scar which 'should blend in quite nicely and shouldn't be too noticeable'; I will have an indentation on that side of my neck once this lump is removed; one in four patients end up with their saliva glands not working correctly - i.e. instead of generating saliva, the side of the face will sweat (and sometimes quite badly); I could experience a 'slight' face droop!  Is the surgery worth it?  I have enough problems with my looks without them being worsened!!!  Has anyone had or knows of anyone who has had this type of operation?  I'm in two minds as to whether to go through with it at all.  Many thanks to anyone who takes the time to read this and reply.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear All,  I am lucky to have found this website. I am suffering from Anal Fissure from 8 years . It started in 1997 and its on again and off agian thing . It started with Diahorrea and there was bleeding and burning and pain. I was given stool softner and sitz bath and steriod suppositor . There was no big relief and I was suggested to go for surgery. But I wanted to give it a try . I tried Homeopathic medicine and was sucessfull . But there over the years it recuured and I took both Homeopathic and suppositors , stool softners and drinking plenty of water . and managed to pull along. This falraed up one or two time in year . I was also totally cure dfor one year.  . But when I am relaxed about food habit and my stool becomes hard all this start again . Recently I was abroad for 10 days and my food intake was differnt from my home country and I lifted some weights. Which resulted in a painfull thrombossed hammeroid . I had my proctoscopy and sigmodoscopy done and was told that I have the anal fissure and Thrombossed hammeroid and need surgery. I am now taking the homeopathicmedicine and also following the stool softner , taking food with fibre fruits with fibre and lot of water and my pain and other symtoms are almost gone. This time I think I should get this over with and have surgery . One problem started this time its there is soiling of my underwear. I have found that yelllowish substance in my underwear this is not incontinece of stool  and I don't have fistula the doctor confirmed  . But I feel terrible about it I was told this can happen for the hemeroid or for fissure. I have three option of surgery i can have it done in my cointry in Bangladesh or I can have it done in Singapore where the doctors are of high standard or I can have it done in Canada. If i opt to do iot in canada I have to wait for another 10 months . I need suggestion form the valuable members of the board about thier opinion . Is ther any problem with the dealay ?Is it possible to get cured with Nitroglycerine ointment treatment ?Any suggestions will be highly appriciated.Thanks.\n\n",

My situarion is I am immigrating to Canada and make landing in April this year and shall have to wait three months for Health card to be eligible for free treatment .After that if I require surgery I will have to wait in que. Do you think its risky to wait or to get the thing done as soon as possible. The Doctor told me I could wait while the Thrombossed hammerroid will shink . As a matter of fact the aggressive nature is already tamed and the pain and teh burn is gone. I take care to keep my stool softened.Do you think I should give the Nitro Glycerine a try ? Since I have endured over years with this Fissure . But I think sentinal piles or thromosed remain forever even if shrinked. What is the rate of recurrence of Anal fissure after surgery ? About siling the unnderware I am quite concerned and shocked its in small amount but never occured to me basically I am very hygenic and clean man so you can understand . Is it due to fissure or thrombossed hammeroid or inciontinennce?Shall look forward to your reply. Wish you all the best.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi jazzartist, If your physician advised that it would not be harmful waiting the expected period of time for the procedure since he/she was the one that did the actual evaluation on you then that would be acceptable. In my opinion, since you have to wait for the procedure, inquiring about the use of the Nitroglycerin ointment certainly would be worth trying at least to attempt to alleviate the remaining symptoms. According to an article written by Lisa S Poritz, MD, Assistant Professor, Department of Surgery, Section of Colon and Rectal Surgery, Milton S Hershey Medical Center, Pennsylvania State University, \"Approximately 1-6% of patients have a recurrence of their anal fissure after sphincterotomy. The recurrence rate is higher after a sphincter stretch.\" So according to documentation the success rate is quite high. There is hope that through continued efforts that there will be a successful medical management identified that's as effective as surgical management. As for the embarrassing episodes of incontinence, (most likely related to the anal fissure)you may want to use a liner ( or pad) in your underwear (like a woman would wear while on her menses). Even though this sounds a little embarrassing this would protect your underwear from soiling, provides a descrete barrier, and they are easily changed so that you may remain feeling hygenic. I hope this information has been somewhat helpful. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

I first noticed it when I was 15 years old (about 7 years ago) and at the time a nurse told me not to worry about it and that it was probably a calcium deposit.    Lately that little lump has been causing me pain.  It seems like it has gotten a little bigger -- protruding rather than in diameter -- and it seems to be sore very often.  Lately it has been difficult to hold my head up with out it causing me some discomfort toward the end of the day.    Also, within the past few months I have noticed that my vision is begining to get blurry.  I am not sure if this is related to this issue or not.

    "title": "Thoracotomy Complication?",
    "content": "Hello. My 65-yo mother underwent a thoracotomy about 5 months ago. About 1 mo after the procedure, she noticed a \"swelling\" which runs from below her left breast (same side as surgery) around to almost her back. The surgeon, her GP and a Gastroenterologist all said it's just tissue and muscle. A CT scan and ultrasound showed nothing abnormal. However, it seems to continue to gain in size slowly. She has no feeling in the area (known result from the thoracotomy). and lately she's having a bit more pain in her upper left size when she moves her shoulder (in the area of the surgery). The surgeon says it's not a result of the surgery but it seems too coincidental. Any idea on what could be causing this? Could some muscle/tissue that had to be cut for the surgery been injured in such a way that it needs to be repaired again? Is it something to be concerned with? The doctors don't think so but none have provided a good answer for what is going on. Thank you\n\n",

Development of scar tissue/adhesions may also cause an area of thickness as well as pain. Scar tissue tends to decrease after time. My question for you is what medical condition existed that warranted the thoracotomy?  Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "2 months ago I went to the ER with a kidney stone. Come to find out I had several calcium stones one of which was 7mm. I was sent home with meds and told to consult a surgeon. The surgeon said I needed lithrotripsy and since I don't have insurance it would cost over $2000.00. I don't have that kind of money so I went to the local Univeristy for help. They too agreed that I needed surgery and then asked if I had insurance. They sent me home with anitbiotics and said they would call me when they had a surgery date for me. I am still waiting. I have passed the smaller stones and missed a month and half of work but still having pain and misery on my right side. With a CT and IVP my 7mm stone still only partialy blocked and my kidney is swollen. I have been to two ER's 3 times since and with the test done found that the 7mm stone hasn't moved much. My question is, how much more do I have to endure? I have gone to every avenue I can think of to get this stone removed. I don't know what else I can do or where else I can go. Can you help me?\n\n",

Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN  thank you so much Theresa!  but mine doesnt itch, and isnt painful at all. it's been 3 days and hasnt gone away. i do have very bad constipation, and i am changing my diet to get better. mine doesnt bother me at all. i can hardly feel it, no itch and no pain, it's very small, and i can only feel it after going to the bathroom. is it definitely hemorrhoid?  would it go away itself? or do i have to go to a doctor? if it doesnt go away itself, how long should i wait if it doesn't go away to seek advice from a doctor? and if it does, how long does it normally take?  thank you again!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi raja, The only way to determine that you have a hemorrhoid is by an examination. Hemorrhoids are relatively common and may not be symptomatic (causing itching, burning, pain, or bleeding). They may not completely disappear, goal is to keep them from becoming irritated and enlarging by adding fiber to the diet and drinking plenty of water to minimize episodes of constipation. Have an evaluation by your physician to assure this is the problem. I hope this has been somewhat helpful. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 26 year old female. About 10 days ago i was eating a hotdog and when i swallowed it, it burned my right tonsil area, which began to swell up. Then I noticed that a lump had also appeared under my tongue. Everytime I eat, the lump under my tongue swells up, and my right tonsil area burns and swells as well.  It almost feels like the food is getting stuck. A few minutes after I eat... the swelling goes down a little, but the lump is still there, and there is this feeling that I have something stuck in my throat. I have been rinsing with Listerine and salt water for the entirety of this irritating problem. It has not helped. I am a smoker so, of course, the whole worry of oral cancer is on my mind. Is there anything else this can be? And should I go to an ENT or just to the ER? I'd really like to get rid of this thing.\n\n",

The bump is just a dark blue/purple color, and it's just there and annoying.  I searched around the internet and am pretty sure it is a hemorrhoid.  I looked for causes, and one said sever coughing, which is what I think caused it because I had a really bad case of bronchitis when it appeared.  What should I do about it.  It's not hurting or bothering me,  it just gets in the way while wiping.

    "content": "Hi Zero, You could be describing an enlarged lymph node. Here is a site that shows a picture of where the cervical nodes are and perhaps you can tell if this is where your swelling is.   Link  All of us have hundreds of lymph nodes scattered throughout our bodies as a critical part of our immune systems. This network of nodes functions as a powerful, intelligent filtration system to keep the insides of our bodies clean and healthy.  Tiny vessels called lymph vessels carry germs, foreign particles, and unhealthy or malignant cells to the lymph nodes, where they are trapped. Active lymph nodes enlarge as they attempt to destroy the unwelcome material.  The lymph nodes also function as schools. Lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, study the foreign material so that they can produce antibodies, killer cells, and other substances to protect the body from the threat.  Sometimes the lymph nodes are overwhelmed in the process. Our defenders can be taken over by a cancer or an infection. These enlarged nodes can become a refuge where the invaders can hide and proliferate.  When evaluating enlarged lymph nodes the first consideration is whether these nodes are localized (in one or two adjacent regions of the body) or generalized (spread throughout the body, often including the spleen -- the largest lymph node -- which is found just under the rib cage in the left upper part of the abdomen). Generalized enlarged lymph nodes suggest that the body is responding to a whole-body problem, such as an infection (bacterial, viral, or fungal), an autoimmune disease (arthritis or lupus), a drug reaction, or a malignancy such as leukemia. The infection might be very mild, or might be as serious as HIV.  Localized enlarged lymph nodes are responding to events in the part of the body filtered by those nodes. A scratch on the finger can produce swollen nodes at the elbow and /or the armpit. Minor trauma to the foot is filtered by nodes behind the knee and in the groin.  The localized nodes most often noticed are those around the head and neck. They frequently grow in response either to the mouth organisms that enter the body during teething, or to the tiny particles that get into the scalp from a baby's lying down most of the day, or to respiratory infections of all kinds (ear infections, colds, sinus infections, etc.) -- or, to some combination of these.  Much less commonly, head and neck nodes can grow from cat-scratch-fever, tuberculosis, drinking unpasteurized milk (mycobacterial infections), or eating undercooked meat (toxoplasmosis). They can also grow from an isolated malignancy, such as a lymphoma.  Many people have a sunny attitude toward \"swollen glands,\" not believing they will really be serious. Others believe these lumps to be harbingers of doom. The truth is somewhere in between. Most of these situations turn out to be fine, but enlarged lymph nodes should be respected.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "In July of 2003 I tore my triquetral lunate ligament via weight lifting.  In Jannuary of 2004 I went in for arthroscopy and was told that I needed to have a triquetral lunate fusion, I did.  That fusion failed, and in Sept of 2004 I had that screw removed and a revision of that fusion done with four pins.  That fusion worked.  The pins were later removed, and I have dealt with some degree of ulnar sided pain and a sore wrist in general.  I decided to get some opinions as I had moved across the country and needed a new doctor.  He took one look at the Flouroscope pictures (spelling) and said that I was suffering from ulnar impact syndrome as a result from the fusion.  Best treatment possible is an ulnar shortening osteotomy.    Bottom line is that I spent the better part of 2004 in a long arm cast and do not want to deal with this again.  He assures me that there is no casting after the sugery and that recovery is relatively quick.  Could someone please inform me on how have my ulnar bone cut in half and screwed together with 7 screws and a compression plate is not going to need a cast and just what type of pain am I up against.  I have been through some serious pain with my surgeries, how does this one rate?\n\n",

    "content": "Ok-I am going to try really hard to answer this as best as I can. I have assisted with orthopedic surgeries, but I am not entirely familiar with your exact condition or procedure. Anyway, I am assuming the doc wants to do something similar to a O.R.I.F. (Open Reduction internal fixation)   If this is what is being done, an incision will be made, and the hardware will be placed appropriately. The plate will act as a reinforcement for the ulna. If he is stating no cast is needed, he will probably suture the arm closed, and give you some sort of sling for support as it heals. Ask him if there will be any external fixators used. (These are devices connected to the hardware inside. They keep things in place)  As far as pain, I can not speak about it since I have never experienced it. I would imagine your doc will prescribe some sort of pain reliever post operatively.   I hoped this helped some!!\n\n",

I heard that they may be due to disease.   what diseases are these? i have slight athsma might it be from that? Any suggestions?  Frequent swelling & bags are normally signs of allergies. Bags under the eyes are claimed to be mainly hereditary. They also can occur because fluids tend to accumulate where the skin is thinner. Thyroid, kidney,& heart disease & some medications make baggy eyes appear worse.   Some things you can do are:Avoid alchohol, salty foods, smoking. Take antihistamines if you have allergies, don't rub your eyes, remove your makeup carefully. watch your salt intake.   Some things that you can try to avoid the bags (or decrease them) are: use a moisturizer, .cool wet compresses, wet tea bags soaked in milk, chamomile or green tea bags to each eye fora few minutes, cucumbers the sameway, vitamin E oil or castor oil, (rub the oil gently over each eye before bed), potatoes, egg whites beaten with a drop or 2 of witch hazel will make the skin feel tighter& look less puffy. The which hazel reduces swelling & will keep the egg whites from drying to rapidly. Be careful not to put that directly in the eye!!! And of corse, cold water - anytime of the day to constrict blood vessels & reduce swelling. Sleep on your back w/your head elevated.  Best of luck\n\n",

What all are the blood tests and other tests, that are advisable in this case?  Can I be treated with medicines or is surgery the only option available?.  What are the complications if it goes untreated?  There are many available tests to determine cholelithiasis. The most common a patient would be sent for are: ultrasound (abdominal), abdominal Ct scan, abdominal x-ray,  ERCP, HIDA scan. Lab work would most likely include (but at times can all come back within normal limits which is the reason for all the other tests above): a chemistry panel, including electrolytes, liver enzymes, & bilirubin, complete blood count (CBC), lipase& amylase levels, PT & PTT. These are all ok to be drawn either way because if surgical intervention is needed, almost all hospitals require these tests to be done prior to any surgery either way.   REgarding treatment: Most of the time doctors will refer you to a gastro doctor for medications such as Prevacid & the like, suggest the avoidance of fatty foods, & exercise. When these methods do not stop the pain & reoccurance of stones, an operation called \"laparoscopic cholecystectomy\" usually follows. This is the prefered way to remove the gallbladder. If it can not be done laparoscopically, it is done \"open\".   I hope this answers your questions, please write back if there is more information you still need.  Best of luck\n\n",

    "content": "To answer your question, yes it can be done.   With the surgery to remove the ovary, the incision will be small. It typically is about 1inch (or less) in length.   An abdominalplasty (tummy tuck) is much more invasive. A long incision is made across the belly.   It is up to your surgeon. Also, the plastic surgeon and OBGYN must agree to operate together.   Keep in mind, recovery time could be longer. You may experience more pain as well.   Good Luck with what you decide\n\n",

My advice is to make sure you are drinknig plenty of fluids and follow up with your dr if the swelling persists for more than another week or so or if it is causing you undue discomfort.

    "content": "Dear Shelley,  Infectious mononucleosis is characterized by the presence of a combination of symptoms and signs (but any disease process can have an atypical presentation) including fever, inflammation of the pharynx, swollen lymph nodes all over the body, an enlarged spleen, pneumonia, skin rash, muscle pains, hepatitis and nervous sytem affection.   The most common presentation though is that of three things, fever, sore throat and generalized lymph node enlargement.  If you really have infectious mononucleosis, the chance of spreading it to your kids is moderate. The virus is excreted with the saliva and even after cure, the carrier state can last up to 18 months.  Personally, i think a confirmation blood test is warranted in all cases that are suspicious for infectious mononucleosis.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Low blood sugar",
    "content": "Dear Shelley,  Thank you very much for the update.  A blood glucose of 55 is a little bit low. The normal range is 70-100 mg/dl. Only if the blood glucose level is less than 50 that a cause for this hypoglycemia should be checked.   Low blood glucose can be caused by: - Wrong processing on part of the lab. - Medications that lower blood sugar. - Alcohol. - Tumours that secrete insulin and cause low blood sugar and these are mainly located in the pancreas. - Adrenal gland insufficiency. - Pituitary gland insufficiency. - Liver failure. - Renal failure.  Low blood glucose causes many symptoms including sweating, sensation of warmth, anxiety, tremors, nausea and palpitations.   If the blood glucose becomes even lower, the brain starts to suffer (as its only source of energy is gluocse) and the person may start to suffer from other symptoms like fatigue, dizziness, headache, visual disturbances, inability to concentrate, abnormal behavior, confusion, and ultimately loss of consciousness or seizures.  So, if you were not suffering from any of these symptoms at the time you had this low blood glucose level, most probably i would just repeat the blood glucose level once more when you are fasting to make sure it is normal and then let it go without having to worry about you having any illnesses whatsoever.  On the other hand, if you were symptomatic, then my suggestion is to go the whole nine yards.  At any rate, it looks like your doctor decided to check more blood work at this time, which should not hurt.  Please, keep me posted.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Shelley,  Thank you very much for the update.   You definitely are living a very hectic life style.  The best way to know what is the nature of this enlarged lymph node is to remove it as a biopsy and see it under the microscope.  One of the commonest unidentified causes of sore throat is chronic sinusitis and dripping of the purulent discharge unto the throat giving you this problem. Sometimes it is necessary to tap all the pus in the sinuses. You might have chronic tonsillitis (inflammation of the tonsils) and require their removal even though you are not that young.   i think that you should abstain from smoking. As this might be contributing to the inflammation of your throat. One more thing, you have to try to get as much sleep as possible as some of the studies suggested that people who have enough sleep have better immune system.  Please, keep me posted as to the results of your blood work.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

Are you having any new bleeding or easy bruising?  If no, there is no need to worry and just watch it, but make sure to mention it to your primary care provider so that it is checked each time you are seen and examined.  If the question to any of these questions is yes, then you have to see your doctor and see what can be done about it like taking it out and have it analysed under the microscope.

The result came back with IgG positive and IgM negative, which means I wasn\u2019t (am not) actively infected mono 2 months ago.   Then he ordered a CT-scan test for neck lymph area a month ago. Before the CT-scan test, my lymph-swollen problem got a little better, but the problem suddenly became much worse after the CT scan. Since the CT-test, I have had a couple of more (peanut size) bumps on my left side of neck and felt tension in my neck area and pain in upper back. I also feel swollen bumps behind both ears and feel facial muscle pain when I eat.   What cause these?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,    13 months ago, the dr. found a lung nodule during an xray for some bruised ribs.  Since then, I have had follow-up ct scans done every 3 months.  There has not been any growth or change in the nodule until now: March '05 scan showed the nodule to be 9.9 x 6.7mm in density, 12.9mm in length, 9.4mm in width, and 11.9mm in depth.  The volume then was 352mm3.   My current scans shows density to be 12.2 x 8.3mm, 16.6mm in length, 11.0mm width, and 13.1mm in depth. The volume is now 482.3mm. My questions are:  Are these changes enough to be more than normal concerned?  With these changes, should I have  the nodule removed and biopsied or could this wait another 3 months.  I also have a small enlarged lymph node in the upper mediastinum that measures 6.7mm in diameter.  My dr. has explained that he can't say if the nodule is cancer or not, yet I had a pet scan that was negative 3 months ago.  He has suggested I make the decision whether to wait and see or have surgery.  I don't want to have surgery if these changes don't warrant it.  It's hard to get him to say what I should do but he did say that if I waited and the next ct scan shows ANY, slight or not, changes from this one I will need the surgery.   I am 50 years old and smoked about 2 packs a day for 35 years.   Thank you so much for any adivce you can give me.\n\n",

To be (almost) sure that a SPN is benign you should have no evidence of growth after 2 years of follow-up. Other options are PET scan or percutaneous needle biopsy (for small nodules the accuracy depends on the skill of the radiologist).\n\n",

And it seems to be going pretty good. The tissue is nice and red but I have a real concern.   I have been doing this for about 4 weeks now (the surgery was 7 weeks ago) and it is closing across my stomach but not in it's depth, and about 1 1/2 weeks ago we started getting this \"green snot\" (as described by my sister) on the guaze in my stomach and it keeps getting worse but the nurse that is doing the irrigating 3 times a week (my sister is doing it the other 11 times a week) says that it isn't a concern because my tissue looks good, she did show it do the dr. and he doesn't seemed concerned either. I don't have a temperature but I have absolutly no energy and I feel \"icky\" all the time. ANd I noticed when they take my temperature it is usually 94.something or 95.something - doesn't that seem really low? My pulse and my blood pressure are both good. Should I be concerned and push to find out what the \"green snot\"  is or am I making a big deal about nothing?  Your help is greatly appreciated!\n\n",

Green drainage accompanied by foul odor is commonly the sign of infection.  Also the wound should be decreasing in depth AND width.  The whole purpose of leaving the wound open is to have it heal from the inside out.  In an infected wound you may not always have outward symptoms except the change in the quality of the drainage.  I suggest for you to have the wound cultured to see if there is an actual infection.  Hope this info helps.  wvnurse\n\n",

    "content": "I had a sentinel lymph node biopsy on my left groin area June 16th.  5 nodes were removed.  The incision site develpoed a seroma over the next week and was drained June 29th, and then a Jackson-Pratt drain placed the next day.  The site continued to output from 200 to 450cc per day for the next week.  The site was reopened July 6th and has been packed with gause two times daily since.   When the packing is removed the fluid quickly accumulates and needs to be removed before the new packing is applied.  The surgeon I have been seeing says that the point of all of this is for it to scar over.  SInce this has been a continuing issue I am looking for some alternatives.  Any ideas or experience dealing with this? Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for your reply RNTDJ, The fluid is lymph, clear and somewhat yellow.  It is coming from a lymph vessel of some sort. I am sure the amount is now less, but can't really monitor the output now that there is no JP drain.  The wound was checked the other day by the wound care nurse in my surgeon's office.  She said it was doing well and she could see new tissue formation.  I am mostly frustrated and looking for a quicker fix to stop this leaker.  I have to wear a maxi-pad on top of the bandage and in the crease between my scrotum and leg to catch the fluids once the dressing has been saturated.  The wound is 5.5cm by 1.5cm and about 3cm deep at the deepest point. Thanks\n\n",

My doctor told me that they were just glands. Is this true? I never noticed lumps like this on other people but why on me if it's just glands? Why can i feel mine but not others? After the doctor felt my last lump he noticed that one of them may be a hernia? I am going to see a radiology today to get that checked out. Also the doctor said not to anything at from midnight until my appointment on that day for the testing in the radiology. Accidently I did I woke up at 2:30 in the morning and ate some food and drank 2 sodas forgetting about my appointment. an I still go to this appointment too? And what will hapen because I ate and drank after midnight? My appointment is at 10:15 am.  thank you for answerin all these questions\n\n",

    "content": "I'm just wondering about the possible connection between having an appendectomy and not having those annoying side stitches (side aches) that people get when they run or when they exercise too soon after eating.  A friend of mine doesn't get side stitches after eating even though he often exercises immediately after, and we were wondering if there might be a connection to the fact that he has had his appendix removed.  He still gets side stitches when just running and I thought it might just be that since the side ache is caused by a cramp in the muscles, an appendix- or lack thereof- wouldn't be related.  However, he pointed out that by that same logic, the eating thing wouldn't  be related either.  Thus, we're still wondering.  Any insights?  Does having your appedix removed either get rid of them or at least reduce the risk of getting them?  Or is it completely unrelated?\n\n",

A few days later I noticed some itching around the anal area. A few days after that I noticed, after defecation, a small freshy bump protruding from the anus. It seems pretty much the symptoms of an internal hemorrhoid.  However, theres no bleeding, or excruciating pain. A mild itching and the presence of itself upon going to the toilet are the only issues.  It was quite suprising, it seemed to just appear out of nowhere. I didnt have any obvious problems with constipation, or dihorrea. I'm obviously quite young, to boot, so its not as if it had time to build up.  I know the fundementals of hemorrhoids and home treatment, although im not totally sure. Im not that keen on seeing a doctor about it until I try some remedies for a week or two at least.   Does anyone have any advice for me? Why could this have started in the first place? Is it likely to go away easily?  Thanks.\n\n",

Get more veggies, switch to whole wheat, re-discover how good strawberries are, and drink more water.  That may help to not even notice them again.\n\n",

    "content": "Last Year out of nowhere I started getting a wierd feeling right underneath my last rib bone on the left side. It felt like something was there but more so on the rib bone itself. It felt like a bump and was tender and sore when I touched it. It didn't cause me enough pain to think it was serious because it would come and go. I finally went to the doctor and the P.A told me it was a pulled muscle and gave me Skelaxtin. It didn't do anything for that weird feeling so I went back and a different P.A told me I had IBS and gave me Zelnorm. Since I have for many years had problems with constipation I took that diagnosis as what the problem is. But what was not explained to me was why did I have a painful bump on my lower left rib. I also have a history of back and neck problems. I am at a wits end about what is going on with my body and this bump on my rib. If anyone knows what this could be please respond\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I have had the exact same symptoms recently. About a week ago I noticed a lump on the back, right, upper side of my neck; it's a relatively small, but substantial feeling lump around or right below my back hairline. It is sore to touch; although, like you, I can rub it, and sometimes it feels better.   I also have had severe to mild pain on this side of my neck for quite some time. I am young, in my early twenties, but played a collegic sport and got bumpted around a lot, so my spine was always getting out of whack. I go to my chriporactor, who relieves the pain, but it always comes back if I don't visit him at least twice a month. the pain is sort of a shooting pain, or spasm when I turn my head to the left. If I lean my head back and slightly to the left the spasm shoots down the left sidde of my spine. Rubbing my upper neck has become a habit, as it relieves the pain, but this recent lump has me concerned. You said that you've been experiencing headaches; is this a recent occurance, or have you had a history of them? i have always had bad headaches, a migrain once a month around my mentstral cycle, and constant tension headaches around finals and other stressful situations. I am about to graduate and have an enormous amount of stress at this point in my life, but a lump seems a little extreme to be a symptom of stress...I'm fine with a lump, but its slightly more serious conditions, such as cancer that worry me. I should have it checked but i feel like such a hypochonriac...i'm sure i spelled that wrong as well as many other words...this is the first time i've ever posted anything and probably the last....but forgive the spelling....i'm tired and my lump hearts....  Cheers lump friend!\n\n",

I say if he needs morphine daily something is not right. he can walk, sit, get up etc. no problem but as soon as he has a movement the day is done for him. has anyone experienced this should we be demanding further action from the dr. and if so what for. thank you\n\n",

Anyways, I've been having trouble urinating, only comes out a little bit and only when I am totally relaxed and sitting down, cannot urinate that good standing up. The surgeon told me to discontinue the vicodin and to only use the ibuprofen which seems very minimum for easing pain. Im having a hard time moving around. Please tell me this is normal!!!

    "content": "Hi BillCMichigan, Generally speaking, the day of a surgical procedure, pain is not at it's most significant because of the drowsiness from the anesthesia. It's usually the first day or two after a procedure that you feel your worst. The ibuprofen will reduce the swelling and muscular pain. Although it may seem not much of a pain reliever sometimes narcotic pain relievers not only make it more difficult to urinate but they also may make you constipated. The sore throat is likey from the \"air tube\" and not only gives you  throat irritation but it also may make your chest tender. Make sure that you deep breathe and cough, taking a pillow or blanket and holding it firmly against your stomach(decreases pain while doing this) This helps prevent complications such as pneumonia.  You should see an improvement after about the third day postoperatively. Be sure to watch for any signs or symptoms of infection, redness or drainage at the surgical site, fever, chills etc. I hope this helped, and get well soon. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

They will most likely recommend a jock strap, (scrotal support) or wearing briefs instead of boxers, and applying an ice pack (covered with a pillowcase or towel)  for 15-20 minutes every hour or so to reduce the swelling. It also may help to elevate the scrotum with a folded towel when laying down. Call the office to make sure they don't feel that it's related to something else.  Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

I figured it was probably a swollen lymph node. My doctor didn't seem concerned about it.   Recently, however, I noticed a small hard imoveable pea-sized bump under the skin about an inch up from where my neck joins the shoulder. It doesn't hurt to touch, although that side of my neck does ache a bit. Beyond the bronchitis the only other symptoms I've had are basic stuffy cold related issues. nothing serious at all. I'm curious, is it a lymph node?, a knot, something normal that I never noticed before? a lingering  swelling from the bronchitis?\n\n",

    "title": "Question about hemorrhoids",
    "content": "Hi,  I've been searching around on the internet, but can't seem to find a site to answer my question.  Do external piles swell during a bowel movement, and then go back down shortly afterwards? My dad has internal hemorrhoids, and he said that's why they tell you not to strain, because it will make it bigger. Is this correct? If so, are piles the only thing that swells during a bowel movement, and then shrinks back down again?   Any help would be great. Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hi spiritedeye, Hemorrhoids do tend to swell and then decrease in size especially in people that have hard bowel movements or are constipated. General measures to decrease flare ups and aggravation are increase dietary fiber found in fruits, vegetables, grains and cereals. A fiber supplement may also be used. Increase water intake. These measure may soften the bowel movements and prevent straining and trauma. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "title": "Old neck lump, now a new one.  A question.",
    "content": "I've had a firm, but not rock hard, neck lump on the right side of my face, under the jaw, for the past six years.  It hasn't changed in size, remaining about the diameter of a dime.  When I first noticed it, my doctor didn't think it was anything to be concerned about and so I just watched it for any changes. Just last night I noticed a swelling on the left side of my neck, below the hairline -- not hard, but it feels like it's in the muscle and it's clearly swollen.  Now I'm concerned that these two areas might be connected, and that what I may have is an undiagnosed cancer. On the bright side, I've read the lymphoma symptoms and I don't have any of them, save for the now two spots of painless swelling.  I'm a 33 year old male, in good general health and I exercise regularly.  Given the length of time between the first noticed lump and the second, should I be worried?  Thank you, all.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi DiDi How did you assess blood in your stool?  When you wipe or looking in the toilet? Usually bleeding from an ulcer will show up as black tarry stool not red blood in your stool or rectum.  Are you on Nexium?? The most frequently reported adverse events with NEXIUM are headache, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.   What is a stomach ulcer?  A stomach ulcer, also called a gastric ulcer, is a raw area or open sore in the lining of the stomach.   How does it occur?  The stomach's lining has a protective layer of cells that produce mucus. The mucus prevents the stomach from being injured by stomach acids and digestive juices. When this protective layer is damaged, an ulcer may occur.   Stomach ulcers may develop from:   the presence of bacteria called Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), the most common cause of stomach ulcers  decreased resistance of the lining of the stomach to stomach acid  increased production of stomach acid.  Stomach ulcers are more likely to occur in people who:   regularly take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen  drink alcohol  smoke tobacco  have too much caffeine, for example, by drinking a lot of coffee, nonherbal tea, or colas  often feel stressed.   What are the symptoms?  Symptoms include:   gnawing or burning abdominal pain, especially in the middle of the upper abdomen  heartburn  nausea  pain that may get better with eating or taking antacids  pain that may get worse a couple hours after meals or sometimes may be worse before meals  pain that awakens you during the night.  If an ulcer is bleeding, you may have:   vomit containing bright red blood or digested blood that looks like brown coffee grounds  black, tarry bowel movements.  It is possible, though unusual, to have an ulcer without any symptoms  How is it treated?  The goals of treatment are pain relief, healing of the ulcer, and prevention of complications. Treatment can also help prevent recurrence of the ulcer.   You may stay in the hospital for the first stage of treatment if your symptoms are severe or if you are having complications, such as bleeding.   Your health care provider may prescribe:   antacids (the liquid form is more effective than the tablet form)  medicine to reduce the amount of acid your stomach makes  antibiotics to treat H. pylori  sucralfate, a medicine that forms a protective barrier over the site of the ulcer to help it heal.  Antacids can have side effects after you have used them for a while. Follow your health care provider's instructions carefully, and report any problems promptly.   Because stress can contribute to the development of gastric ulcers, you may need to make changes in your lifestyle (see \"How can I take care of myself?\").   How long will the effects last?  Stomach ulcers respond well to treatment but they can recur. You can help reduce the chance that an ulcer will recur by taking your medicine.   Possible complications of untreated ulcers are:   hemorrhage (a lot of bleeding)  perforation (a hole through the stomach wall produced by an ulcer)  obstruction (ulcer scarring that prevents passage of food).  These complications may require surgery.   Two to three percent of stomach ulcers become stomach cancer. Make sure you report all continuing or recurrent symptoms to your health care provider.   How can I take care of myself?  Follow the full treatment prescribed by your health care provider. Keep your follow-up appointments.  Do not smoke or use other tobacco products.  Do not drink alcoholic beverages.  Do not drink strong nonherbal tea, caffeinated or decaffeinated coffee, or colas.  Ask your provider if you should avoid drugs that irritate the stomach, such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen. If your provider says it is OK to take these drugs, try taking them with food to prevent stomach irritation. (Ask your provider if you can use acetaminophen instead.)  You may want to make other lifestyle changes, such as:  Eat healthy meals. Several small meals may be better than 2 or 3 large ones.  Learn how to manage stress. Seek professional help for dealing with events that cause anxiety and stress.  Get plenty of rest.  Exercise as recommended by your health care provider.  If you keep having symptoms or your symptoms get worse, tell your health care provider.  How can I help prevent stomach ulcers?  Follow your health care provider's treatment plan and keep your follow-up appointments.  Change your lifestyle in ways that will help prevent ulcers.  I would suggest seeing your physician again.  Good luck\n\n",

    "title": "? EPIDERMOID CYST",
    "content": "Assuming that your description is correct and the lesion is a lump, not a growth above the skin, it is most likely to be an epidermoid cyst  or a lipoma.   An epidermoid cyst (EC) is the most common skin cyst and occurs in young to middle-aged adults. It is also known as a sebaceous cyst and  can sometimes be mistaken for a lipoma. EC occurs commonly on the face, neck, upper trunk and scrotum, while lipomas occur mostly on the neck, trunk and limbs.   Lipomas are soft, rounded and movable against the overlying skin; epidermoid cysts are firmer and not mobile against the overlying skin. Both conditions are benign, but epidermoid cysts are prone to rupture, which is then associated with some pain.  A doctor's examination is necessary to confirm diagnosis.

It feels a bit bigger when I've been constipated, but goes back down within a few minutes and when I get my bowel movements back to normal. It also tends to disappear for a few minutes after a bowel movement. Could this be minor piles? I read that small external piles don't have any symptoms, which is what I think it could be. If so, would it disappear if constipation is kept away? Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Doctor,  I am a 23 year old piles patient and was suffering from anal fissures and  bleeding piles problems from the last 6 Months or so...  The fissures healed in the due course with a conservative diet and plenty of  water but not the piles and I have been recently operated for piles in India  (Mumbai) , in which Sclerotherepy (Injection Treatment) and Cauterization of  3 piles (anal papillae) was done along with Sphincter Stretching as per the  Surgeon.  Now after the operation for the next few days i had some 8-10 droplets of  blood in stools daily, which improved to just some blood stains in the  stools and minor blood clots at the time of cleaning sometimes still occur.  I am around 15  days down the operation and recently had the doctor visit who  checked via a proctoscope and said there is nothing to worry BUT the  bleeding (even minor) should stop in the next 10 days when i am due to visit  him again.  I take laxatives at night as per the doctor advice, have a high fibre diet  (fresh fruits, vegetables, soups and juices) and drink plenty of water  throughout the day. Earlier due to some high dosage of laxatives i had to go  as much as 4-5 times a day for bowel movements, now with lessening the dose  it has come down to 2-3 times a day.  Is there some way i can stop this minor bleeding? Doctor tells me to relax  and all will be fine but what if the blood staining does not stop in the  next 10 days? how long can a pile which has been treated as above bleed?  Do you suggest anything more for me to do, to reduce this bleeding or  occurrence of the same?? some alternative life style?? less sitting,  standing or something of that sort?? can tension / stress aggregavate the  situation?? can exercise / yoga help?? I used to go Gym quite occasionally  but after this operation am not doing the same, shall i resume basic  exercises??  Your quick advise will be appreciated...  Kind Regards, Akshay Shah. India (Mumbai).\n\n",

    "content": "Well, I have had crohn's disease and \"rectal prolapse\", I believe for a while.  I had a surgery for the prolapse last year, but it came undone the next day.  I have been having horrible problems with our current doctors... They do not think it is anything, but now, the prolapse or whatever it is, is blocking the entire \"exit\". There is hardly any way that anything can get out.  I am not quite sure which this is, prolapse, hemerroids, or a combination of both. One fourth of the flesh that comes out is black and blue, obviously quite bruised from straining, or whatnot.  I could attach a link to a photo, but I don't think it'd be appropriate for this forum (not sure).  I just need a doctors opinion, for I can show it to the supposed \"Doctor\" that I am going to now, for he might take us seriously, before my stomach explodes.  We have tried going to the emergency room as well, but all they do is send us straight home, after the blood test comes out okay.   Perhaps one of you doctors could contact me privately(PM/EMAIL), so we can discuss this matter further?  Or you can just reply to this thread, either way.   Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Dear UKLady,  Thanks for the info...lets see now..it is difficult to say without having you directly infront of me, but here are the most likely diagnoses  You say it is not attached to skin, but deep to it, but is immobile.  This means when your move the skin over this area, the lump does not move with it.  If this is the case this may represent an occipital lymph node, or a lipoma, fibroma or some such lump.  It is worth investigating this further.  A lymph node in this are could be enlarged for a variety of reasons, your doctor would be able to help, and I would recommend a further visit if you are particularly worried.  Much more common, particularly as you say that there is a skin eruption around this lump however are problems related to the scalp itself.  Two that come to mind are the sebaceous cyst, or local abscesses of the hair follicles sometimes called carbuncles.  The latter responds to antibiotics, the former may be left alone orr be dealt with surgically.  I hope this is helpful, but if you have more questions pease let me know  Saif\n\n",

    "content": "Dear UK Lady,  I guess there are a lot of reasons why there may be enlarged lymph nodes, some serious and some not so...which is why I didn't expand on it further...  Lymph nodes, drain lymph from areas in your body, and are part of the bodies defence mechanism.   Infection is the most common cause...these are usually short lived, and once the infection settles, the node usually settles down as well.  Nodes in that area that you describe could be affected by infections in the scalp, the back of neck, the back of the ear.  Sometimes nodes get enlarged if you recently had a tattoo in this region.  On occassion lymph node enlargement persists long after the infection has gone...and exist merely to cause anxiety    Lymphoma is as you say a cause of lymphadenopathy as you say.  Other causes are secondaries from tumours in the sanme areas described above.  These are fortunately rare, and as you have had his lump for several months without change, I would suggest these are also less likely than the infection possibility, if this lump really is a lymph node.  Reactive lymphadenopathy can be caused by skin conditions in the vicinity, and can be triggered by dermatitis, or even sunburn.  I hope this is helpful, and not too anxiety provoking...as I say, it is difficult to give advice on something i can not see or feel...  Regards  Saif\n\n",

    "title": "Hard lump at the back of my neck",
    "content": "Hello,  I am a 17-year old female and for the past two years I've noticed a hard, painless lump on the back of my neck. It is about an inch from my right ear, and a centimeter below my head, and it is about 2 centimeters big (shaped much like almond). I asked my father about it (my father was in pre-med for four years and then transfered to dentistry) and he told me it was nothing.  So for the next two years, I disregarded the annoying mass. This year, after reading a novel about a dying patient with lymphoma, the unwanted lump re-entered my train of thoughts...to an intesifed degree I might add. So I went to my doctor and asked her about it. She too, told me not to worry. I was fine for a while after, but then I began to search my  neck and I found another hard lump less than a centimeter big.  I also noticed smaller lumps all about the size of this: O, except they are movoable and not so hard.  Now I'm thinking back to what my physician told me, and am worried as to whether or not I understood her correctly. During the same visit, I told my physician about an ear infection that I had had for the past 3 months (more like a year on an off), and I'm afraid she thought the lumps were associated with that infection (I know it can't be since I've had the lumps for at least two years prior to that date).   Last minute facts:  I've had some neck pain on and off, though not in that specific area.  Neither of the two hard mass have not grown since I first noticed them, and everyone keeps telling me they can't see them  (I notice the masses when I look at a double mirror at certain angles).  I've no other symptoms, other than the fact that my ear still hurts when I go out in the cold or when it fills with water, which I think is associated with my previous ear infection. Oh, and my worry intesifies as I read more about the symptoms of lymphoma. Should I be worried?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello: I am concerned that you say the lumps in your neck have lasted two years.  What you are describing sounds like swollen lymph nodes.  The most common locations of lymph node swelling are in the neck, groin and underarm, though many other locations are possible.  The cause of swollen lymph nodes in the neck are ear infection, tonsillitis, abscessed or impacted tooth, gingivitis (swelling of the gums), mouth sores, virus, and other infections among other things.  The lymph nodes are part of the lymphatic system that is part of the immune system. Lymph nodes often swell in response to infection or disease. Sometimes this is somewhat inaccurately called \"swollen glands\" (lymph nodes are not glands; they do not secrete anything).  Viral throat infections, ear infections and colds can cause lymph nodes in the neck to double in size. Slight enlargement and mild tenderness means the lymph node is fighting the infection and doing a good job.   However when the lymph node is swollen over such a long period of time it needs to be evaluated to determine if the cause is because the infection that originally caused it to swell has not completely ended or there is another reason for the swelling.  Whichever is the reason your doctor needs to take a closer and more serious look at the situation.  Perhaps if you were to express the fact that you have had it for two years you might get a more concerned response. I hope this helps. Regards, Carolyn\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you very much for your reply.  I will take your advice and make an appointment with my doctor within the next month (I hope one month isn't too long a wait?)  Until that time, I was hoping I can bother you with some more information and extra questions.  My father told me he had a similar lump when he was younger (19-20 yrs. of age) and he got it removed only for cosmetic reasons.  Upon asking him about my own enlarged lymphs, he showed me that he, too, had one on his neck.  Is it possible that my problem is hereditary?  I said I had the lumps on my neck for a while, but I had only NOTICED them for two years.  They might've been there longer. My mother's friend said she had a visible lump on her neck for ten years before she got it removed and found it to be benign. Mine are pretty small and haven't grown, wouldn't that rule out lymphoma?    I'm sorry, I know my questions are likely as not better left to my physician to answer (and I'm sure she will).  I'll understand if you can't answer some of them.  Thanks again for everything...you have been a GREAT help\n\n",

    "content": "Hello: How long ago did this happen.  If this has happened within the last day or so then it is normal to have a slight headache and soreness where the phone hit you.  You would need to have a pretty hard hit for severe damage to be done.  Did you pass out?  What you described does not sound like it would cause too much damage. You do not automatically die if you get hit on the temple area.  You would need to get hit pretty hard for it to cause you to die.  However I was not there to see how hard you got hit so all I can suggest is that if the headache gets worse or you start feeling faint you should be seen by a doctor immediately. Regards, Carolyn\n\n",

    "content": "This Sunday I tried to give myself a breast reduction.  I think I cut 2 or 3  veins.  I applied pressure until the spurts stopped.  It was not a pulsing spurt. I removed about a cup of fat or more from one of my breasts, but was afraid of blood loss to do the other. I\u2019m too embarassed to go have it check by my doctor.  I don't even take my clothes off for my husband of 8 years.  I didn't want to sit in the hosp. with no shirt on while they criticize what I did.  I took a needle and heated it with a lighter for awhile. I drenched it and some thread with alcohol and sewed myself up.   I recleaned it with alcohol and then applied neosporing and bandaging.  It looked quite good considering I did it myself.   I have been taking Levaquin since.  It seemed fine until this morning when I got up and around the cut is small puffy areas that are yellow. I have no fever, red streaks, chest pain, shooting pain down my arm although I am concerned of possible infection. Is this something I should be concerned about or just normal bruising?\n\n",

However doing surgery on yourself is extremely dangerous.  I urgently suggest you go immediately to your doctor or the emergency room.  Please do not wait a few more days.  The risk of infection is great and is very serious, even life-threatening.  Believe, both doctors and nurses will understand and will not judge you.  However, they may be able to direct you to get the help you need so you will not find it necessary to do surgery on yourself again.  Please let me know how things are going and what happens.  I care.  I will be worrying about you till I hear from you again. Regards, Carolyn\n\n",

She wanted me to have a psychiatric evaluation.  It was a good thing I brought my sister as she vouched for my sanity.  The  doctor checked my incision and said it looked good and there were no signs of infection.   She then removed the thread to apply steri-strips.  When she got to the last loop of thread it opened like a zipper and started spurting blood all over her, the tech and me.  It took 10-15 mins for them both to stop the flow with pressure. She irrigated the opening, and then had to sutur up the incision and apply the steri-strips.  She said everything looked great.  There were no blood clots or any signs of infection.  She said I took great care of it and prescribed me Augmentin.  I\u2019m suppose to see my PCP in 2 days though and now am embarassed he will think less of me.\n\n",

He needs to know why you felt so desperate to take such an action.  Believe me, that seeing a psychiatrist does not mean you are insane.  Mental Health specialists can help one to understand what is bothering them and how to deal with it.  All of us, at one time or another, could use the help of a good psychiatrist to deal with issues we face.  These issues could be mental, financial, emotional or even physical.  It seems to me that you were feeling pretty desperate to the point of self-surgery.  That really is an extreme action to take which shows how desperate you were feeling.  Until you get those feelings resolved, you will not feel comfortable with your situation.  Please do not quickly toss away any suggestion to seek the help of a psychiatrist.  It might actually help you. Please ask you doctor about the possibility of a breast reduction surgery.  Until you can get it done professionally, please don't attempt any more surgerys on yourself, ok? Regards, Carolyn\n\n",

    "content": "I did ask my doctor and he referred me to a PS.  My insurance denied the claim as the only breast reduction/augmentation they authorize is an implant for a mastectomy after cancer.  This doesn't seem fair at all!  You can always wear falsies to appear to have them, but there is nothing you can do to get rid of them.  I don't think any kind of mental help will help me deal with the pain and deformity that my large chest is causing me.  I have a hunchback that is getting worse.  I can't even force it straight anymore.  Bras cut into my shoulders and cause pain.  They don't even make bras in my size anymore.  I used to be a 36F and they have grown again and won't even fit in that anymore.  Underwires barely last a week for me because they can't take the stress and break.   They keep getting bigger and bigger.  I have lost weight and it never comes from my chest.  There was only one store that had a 36F that I could wear that the cup was big enough and now I can't fit it anymore.  The few places that carry cup sizes higher than F only offer them in the larger sizes around.  If I get anything larger than a 36, they just fall out of the bottom.  They weigh several pounds apiece.  I would even be willing to get an ugly BR with no nipples.  I really don't care.  I would even take a mastectomy.  I just feel hopeless.   There seems to be nothing I can do except to take action myself.  I don't have any other options.\n\n",

    "content": "2 months ago I had surgery because I had a hernia on location L1-L2 on the right. When the surgery was over I had a lot of pain in my right upper leg and hip and the scin feels death on that locations. The doctor thought that the reason of that pain was damage or irritation of the nerve from the operated location. For 3 weeks I had to stay in the hospital because of that pain. When I was at home the fysiotherapy has started. Unfortunately I still have that pain and I don't feel it when I have to use the musscle of that right upper leg. When I stand up I can only stand on my left leg, because I don't feel the musscle of my right upper leg. The strange thing is that I think that I use that musscle but I don't. So I hit the floor a couple of times because of this... Now I walk with sticks (or how do you call it...?) But that is not the solution! I use very much pain-medication.(morfine, neurontin etc.) And the fysiotherapist don't know what to do anymore.  This week I received a cd-rom with my MRI-scans on it and the conslussions that where made by the neurosurgon and radiologic doctor.(I don't know the englisch terms) In that rapport was written that there where 2 new little hernia's on location C5-C6 and C6-C7 and there where discopathic dissorders found on a couple of places in my back. I didn't know this untill this week I found out myself....  I really don't know what to do with the pain in my right upper-leg and the musscle problem wich I don't feel. It feels like I use that musscles on my right upper leg, but I don't!!!  Can you tell me what to do and what the problem possibly can be?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Conimus: I am so sorry to hear of your painful situation after surgery.  You did not state what your symptoms were before surgery.  You also did not state whether you are being treated by an orthopedic surgeon or a neurosurgeon. Do you have any other symptoms such as loss of bowel or bladder control? I would be especially concerned about the fact that you are unable to stand on the affected leg due to loss of feeling as that is an ominous sign. The symptom of numbness is one that should be taken seriously for if it continues to worsen you could develop permanent paralysis of the leg.  Unfortunately, it would be impossible for anyone to diagnose your condition online much less recommend treatment for it.  I seriously suggest you seek  a second opinion from a Neurosurgeon or Orthopedic spinal surgeon (one who specializes in spinal surgery).  There could be numerous causes for your problem.  Some of the disorders that the doctors might check for would be \"Discitis\" which is an infection that at times develops after spinal surgery and for which antibiotics are prescribed.  Also, they might treat you for \"Cauda Equinal Syndrome\"  which is irritation of the nerves that innervate the buttock, and leg.  Whatever the cause, it is vitally important that you seek treatment from a physician who takes seriously the symptom of numbness.  For the ongoing pain, you may want to see a Chronic Pain specialist who will regulate the medicine you take for optimal relief of pain.  The herniations of the C5-C7 would be the least of my concerns as it is possible to have herniations for many many years that cause no pain or problem.  Intervention surgically is usually not done unless the patient complains of pain or numbess in his arms.  Please let us know what you find out about your situation as it may be of help to others here on this forum. Thanks for using The Doctor's Lounge Regards, Carolyn\n\n",

Only about once a day. What concerns me though is that it has been a few weeks and it is still not all gone. As I said I think it just healed funny. Is there a cream or something I can apply to help it clear up or a way I can find out if it is not just irritation that healed funny? I have tried neosporin and lubriderm. I think it is getting a little better but it may be my imagination. I would prefer to explore options besides the doctor if I can as it is a little embarrising. Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "I am 21, in rather good health, with no damaging habits such as smoking or drinking.  But I have a small lump about the size of a pencil eraser on the outside of my anus.  My wife who is 20 and also in the same physical and healthy condition as myself also has one.  Her's showed up first, it was there for 3-7 days and then went away.  About a week later I had this lump show up.  I have currently had it for 1 day.  My wife also just noticed this lump coming back.  The lump after 2-3 days is a little larger than a pencil eraser and is a dark purple or almost black in color.  Normally there is no pain or irritation except during a bowel movement.  There is no noticable blood release or pus release.  It doesn't seam to be coming out of the anus as a hemmoroid.  What is this lump?  How do I get rid of it?  Do I need to have it look at by a physician?  Could the lumps be due to moving to a new city only weeks before the appearance of the lump?  HELP!  I don't like things on my butt.\n\n",

    "content": "Twice in the past five months or so I've notice very small \"pinpricks\" of blood on toilet paper after defecating; in both instances I had been straining hard. In both occurences I could feel a bump that was sore to the touch. The first time it happened I looked up the symptoms on Google and it seemed as though it was hemorrhoids. I increased my fiber intake and didn't have any problems for a while (the bump went away). Recently though, I was lax in monitoring my fiber intake and the same thing happened last night.  Is this hemorrhoids? If so, why is it happening now? I've never particularly watched my fiber intake so why would that start to have an effect now? I can't imagine all people my age having to make worry about how much fiber they're taking in. Are some people just more susceptible to this? The only change in my diet is that because I've started working out, I've begun a high-protein diet. I take a protein shake (46g) 3 times a week and the rest of  the time try to consume whole food sources of protein (chicken breast, tuna, egg whites, etc.) Is such a diet particularly harder on the digestive tract thus requiring me to up fiber intake? Another thing is  that on Monday I did squats . . . could that have had an effect?\n\n",

Some people are more prone to developing hemorrhoids due to inherent problems with their bodies' collagen and elastic fibers. These people may have other related defects such as 'flat feet', herniae. Others develop hemorrhoids due to problems in their intestinal tract. I would suggest you get it checked out as soon as possible.   Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "I just had surgery 3 months ago for a herniated cervical disc with bone fusion and appliances. They went through the front on my neck.  Everything went well and I felt better after surgery except my throat hurt and it was hard to swallow. Doctor said that was expected because they had to move my esaphagus (spelling   ) over to get to spine. I had to wear a soft collar brace for 4 weeks. About a week after no brace my 10 yr old mildly retarded child (long story for another time) was laying on my stomach on the couch and pushed himself up using his hand on the front of my neck. Oh my was this scary. Felt like I couldn't breath and a rope was tied around my neck. I called my Doctor about a week later becauses it hadn't got any better. The nurse said that it probably just caused some swelling and would get better. My X-rays of neck at 7 weeks after surgery were normal and I was sent back to work. I still felt like I had something tied around my neck and felt like I wasn't getting air.  The tightness and trouble breathing seems to come and go. If I turn my head alot or move it up and down or bend over to pick something up it gets worse.  The Doctor at work noticed that my oxygen level goes down when I talk and move around. I am sleeping fine and wake up fine. Before I get through my first cup of coffee it starts tightning and I feel like I'm not getting enough air. This is weird but I was out of coffee for 2 days and did much better. I have also been having muscle spasms in my neck when I yawn or stretch which doesn't surpise me I have always had muscle spasms when I stretch in my legs and back.  I went to a Pulmanary Doctor last week and she said that she thought that the tightness and breathing trouble was from muscle spasms in my neck and she scheduled me for  a scope  tomorrow of my throat. The past 2 days have been really uncomfortable and I am scared. Also when I try to raise my voice it gets worse.  Can muscle spasms really do all of this and am I ever going to feel better. I don' t understand why I have so much trouble with muscle spasms. The Doctor at work did a soft tissue X-ray and thought that he seen something blocking my air way but the pulmanary Doctor said that my X-ray looked fine.  Should I see another Doctor for muscle spasms? What kind of Doctor? Sorry for such a long post!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Kat8198,  May be you have some kind of injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve, the nerve that is supplying the vocal cords, although this does not sound like the typical symptoms that one would get.  Another possibility is pressure on the airway by something from outside.  A regular x-ray is not the best thing to go with in this instance. i would recommend a ct scan of the neck.  Go ahaead and have the scope with the pulmonary doctor as this will show from inside how the vocal cords are doing, how the airways look and may be a deformity will show at one area and this could indicate external pressure. A lung function test sometimes shows pressure on airway, so if your pulmonologist asks you to have one, don't be surprised.

I called my surgeon and his nurse said that she had suggested a ct scan to the Dr. before but he said that he didn't think that it would show anything. She said that she would talk to him again about it. She also said that we could try a muscle relaxer (Diazepam 5mg) to see if it helps. I hope that it works. I haven't taken one yet.

    "content": "I had hernia operations in 1978 and 1980.  In 1988 I had an operation to remove scar tissue and sutures that did not dissolve. The area is from my right belt line to the lower abdomen.  I have had intermittent irritation along the incision scar over the past few years.  Last year the area was checked for hernias and was viewed with ultrasound.  It was explained to me that particles were probably worked loose and that my body was attacking this to rid itself of the material.  Since the swelling went down and the irritation was minimal, I opted to not have an operation.  Recently I have started to bike after 4 years of no biking.  I have lifted weights and used eliptical trainers without problems over the past 5 years.  The irritated area has been purple and occasionally bleeds.  I have been concerned because it has not healed in a month.  Today, I removed what appears to be a suture form this area.  It is about 1/4'' in length and half of it is a loop.  There is a knot in it as well.  This does not appear to be normal.  I am not experiencing any pain and do not have a fever.  There is no puss when the site was bleeding.  There was dark red blood around this \"suture\".  I have an appointment to see my PCP.  Any and all information you can pass along to me will be greatly appreciated.  Thank You.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Chucke,  Sutures are used to approximate tissues together for better healing.  Once the tissues heal, sutures can be removed. Sometimes wound healing is delaye and sutures need to remain till they do.  i am not a surgeon but i think that the muscles are usually sutured with non-absorbable sutures and the tissues under the skin are sutured with absorbable suture material (body has ability to absorb it) and the skin one or the other but usually with non-absorbable material.  Sometimes, non-absorbable sutures in the muscle can find their way to the subcutaneous tissue and can irritate the skin and the subcutaneous tissues. Sometimes, the irritation continues till either the sutures are removed by the doctor or the body succeeds in expulsion of the suture material.   You were right, the thing that you removed was indeed a suture and if in fact you still have some of those sutures left, your body might try to get rid of them with resultant inflammation till they are removed one way or the other.

    "content": "I have a fried whose appendix ruptured in Nov., no one caught it for a month. So his appendix was inside of him and eating away at all his other organs. By the time he finally had surgery it was dried and stuck to his other organs. Well now it is Aug. and he still is not better. He has been in the hospital 13 times and had 5 or 6 surgeries since he first went in. His wound has been infected and he is in a lot of pain. My question is; is there a doctor that has dealt with this before, and how would I go about finding this Doctor?If anyone can help it would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi. I'm only 18, so it seems unlikely that i would get hemorrhoids. However, I do have mild IBS so multiple bowels movements and straining may have been a cause.   I have a single lump, or a bubble rather, that is very small (maybe 5 mm in diameter) which has been on my anus (right at the opening) for approximately 2 years. It is only sometime apparent because th erest of the time I believe it is inside my anus. It does not itch or give me any pain. I do experience pain in my anus after a few bowel movements in a row or diarrhea, however I am not certain whether this is the bubble that is paining me or something else.  I also have pain wiping my anus occasionally, once again after multiple bowel movements.  Is this a hemorrhoid? If yes, is there anything I can do to get rid of it completely short of surgery? If I have anal sex, can I expect pain because of this hemorrhoid? I have begun to drink more water and eat more fiber (because of my IBS) and I have heard this will help ease my bowel movements, correct?  I'm worried and confused, so any opinions and suggestions would be GREATLY appreciated.[/b]\n\n",

    "title": "is surgery a option?",
    "content": "My husband has had back problems for many years. It started as a disc heriation and his Dr. advised (in 99) he reduce work hours and physical therapy for stenosis. This did not help. He has been on several differant drug therapys also with little or no relief. In 2002 he saw 2 specalist. Both thought surgery was not indicated. In May of this year he had sudden \"foot drop\" and was admitted to the hospital. The lumbar myelogram is as follows  L2-L3 There is the slightest degree of bulging of the annulus without a disc herniation. Thiscould be a very early change of disc degeneration. L3-L4 There is moderate diffuse bulging of the annulus. I suspect there is a small central disc herniation best appreciated on the sagittal reconstruction views. L4-L5 There is minimal disc space narrowing with a moderate size central, left paracentral and posterolateral disc herniation. This is best seen on the axial reconstructed views. In  regards to the patient's foot drop, this is most likely the area of greatest concern. There is also bulging into the right neural foramina but to a lesser degree. No facet changes are seen.  L5-S1 There is complete loss of the disc space, marked end plate sclerosis and osteophytes consistent with rather severe chronic degenerative disc disease with a moderate size central osteophyte as well. The annulus shows diffuse bulging, and there is some calcification of the annulus and a small central disc herniation. Even though there is advanced degeneration, the nerve roots appear to be reasonably well filled. There has been a partial laminectomy on the left side. The surgon at the hospital said he was not a cadate for surgey, but his GP basicly said if he does not get surgey soon he could face more paralysis. What are his options? If he has surgery will it improve his condtion or only halt further degeneration? Also what is a laminectomy?He has not had surgey on his back bofore but the did try some injections at one point.\n\n",

The surgical options infront of him include a laminectomy +/- discectomy. Did his surgeon say why he is not a candidate for surgery? Neurological compression that is not releaved within a week or two from the start of paralysis is usually very difficult to treat afterwards as the nerves have most likely died of ischemia by then.   Have a look at our disc herniation page for more info.  Maybe you should get a third opinion from another neurosurgeon.\n\n",

Here is some information:  Diagnostic: Arnold-Chiary Malformation II, with hydrosyringo-myelia. Sympthomps: Numbness of all left side of the body, hiccups, neck stiffness. Age: 34  Surgery on April 1st 2004.  Post operatory conditions:  While in hospital, he had neck stiffness, strong headaches, very little remedy of numbness, temperature 38.3C. April 9th: Externated. April 11th: Seemed well (walked, ate), then temprorary left side paralysis. The next day, all of left side was paralized, involutary right hand movements, hiccups. April 13th: Developed coma I. April 15th: Developed coma IV with cardiac arrest. He was resuscitated. April 18th: Brain death.  Here is a link to some of the MRI scans given to us by the doctors. The scans are from after the surgery.  http://www.medicalinfo.ro/info-mri/index.html  I am posting this hoping to get a cleared ideea to why this happened, any opinion is highly appreciated.

Postoperative infection is a surgical complication, which could underlie the worsening of the patient's condition.

When is a good time to have thyroid surgery and just remove it? I mean if the perscription goes up every time I see her, doesn't that say it isn't working? How much of a shrinkage in the goiter is significant? can it shrink out the outwards appearance and yet grow inside and not be noticeable??? Any advice.

Hypothyroidism (decrease in thyroxine levels in the blood as a result of the gland being destroyed by the lymphocytes).   Your goitre problem is gradually subsiding which although a good sign, is not happening fast enough. Your main problem is your thyroxin levels, which should have normalized by now. As the dose becomes more accurate the levels of another hormone in the blood called TSH will start adjusting and this will be followed by further decrease in the size of the goitre. What are your latest TSH results?  Thyroid surgery is not without risks and complications, I would'nt rush to it if I were you.  Check the following links:  Thyroidectomy Hashimoto's thyroiditis  I think the main problem is adjusting your synthyroid dose. If you were to undergo thyroidectomy you would still be left with the problem of adjusting your synthyroid dose. If after dose adjustment according to serum TSH levels you still have problems from your goitre, then surgery is unavoidable.\n\n",

    "content": "This is a neurological question...I think.  I have been having a feeling of pressure in my head lately that, when it comes, is accompanied by nausea and a blood-like taste in the back of my mouth. Also, I have been having nosebleeds in the morning once or twice per week.  This has been going on for the past 2-3 weeks...I quit smoking a month ago and I wonder if this could be related.  I did see my physician who somehow determined these were migraine symptoms even though I would not (and did not) characterize the feelings as painful or even as headaches.  What could this be? Aren't migraines supposed to hurt? Why do I taste blood? Are my sinuses draining since I quit smoking? Lots of questions...can you help?  Male - 26 years old   Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi!  Did you check with the ENT doctor/Head & Neck surgeon? Do you have history of recurrent sinusitis? Do you have sputum from your nose? If so, what color? Is it blood-stained? Does this pressure that you feel in your head increase upon bowing your head down? Do you have hypertension? Does anyone in your family have history of abnormal bleeding?  Have you begun taking medications for migraine?  As a house remedy, you might want to begin with steam inhalation thrice daily and nasal decongestant drops applied to the nose in the lying down position with the head hanging out from the edge of the bed. A night-time dose of benadryl might help any congestion.  Hope this helps.  Warm regards,  bill\n\n",

I did not see a Head&Neck Surgeon, no history of sinusitis (that I am aware of), not sure what sputum is...but no abnormal discharges from the nose, bowing my head has no effect on the pressure, I may have hypertension/high anxiety. My maternal uncle had an aneurysm in his 20's and a clot of blood vessels in his brain in his 50's. Those are the only related family history items I can think of...if they're related at all.  I have not taken any recurring migraine meds...just Excedrin Migraine occasionally.  I will give the home remedies a try...So it sounds like something sinus related to you? Also, the pressure mostly increases as the day goes on...sometimes not really appearing until the afternoon.  Thanks for the help Bill.\n\n",

Said it was to close to the nerve.  Said it was a  Lipoma.  They also pointed a smaller one on my other arm.  Well my question is I noticed the other day i have knots on boths sides of my jaws, one is alout the size of a walnut and the other is about the size of a little gumball.  There is no pain when i touch them, they are hard.  But i have been having bad headaches where the pain goes to my shoulders.  Could this just be another Lipoma.  If you develop a lipoma how likely is it to get more, and how many more.  I don't want these lumps all over my body.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Kabeebabee,  Lipomas are usually soft and not hard so i think the two knots on your jaw are not lipomas most probably.  Lipomas usually occur in a single fashion but you can have more than one. There is a disease called lipomatosis where the whole body is covered by lipomas. There are 2 types of this last one. A type that appears early in life and a type that appears by the third decade and these are usually widespread and very obvious.  i can not tell what do you exactly have or what are those knots. You have to be examined by your doctor.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

If infections happen after every surgery done by a surgeon or after every surgery done from a particular place, one can rightly question the standards of care provided. But no surgeon or care facility is infallible, and complications are accepted risks to any surgery.  Having said that, I suppose the right antibiotic should help most infections. The antibiotic should be selected depending on the most prevalent pathogens found in the area of surgery. But if the source of infection is not identified, more investigations would become necessary.  Hope this helps.  Warm regards,  Bill\n\n",

Its not dangerous as long as it doesnt grow or increase in number. It should go away soon or at most your brain will learn to eliminate it. It can be seen more evidently when you are looking at a plain surface e.g. sky, water in the swimming pool or even a sheet of white paper.   You are also complaining of what is known as palpitations (the sense of feeling your heart beating). Normally the heart beats steadily in the background and we don't notice it. We begin to notice when its speed varies (abnormalities of rate) or when it changes rhythm (abnormalities of rhythm). This is a situation where your pulse should be examined by a doctor or RN.

He's been able to use a wheel chair for a short time each day, but lately been bedridden for several weeks. My sister told me yesterday that he's developed a \"bed sore\" on his tail bone (Sacroiliac?)  that has grown to approximately 4 inches in diameter. His \"tail bone\" is now exposed in the wound, according to my sister. He's been to the emergency room several times and had the wound \"cleaned\", but they just cover it and send him home. It continues to grow. Recently they brought in a machine that applies a small vacuum to the wound via a transparent plastic [quote]cover. [/quote]This \"vacuum's\" the plasma, and sloughed tissue on a continuous basis, by a portable battery operated unit that goes with him when on the wheelchair or in bed. My question is [b]why don't they have him on an antibiotic[/b]? I asked pointedly, and they assert that no medication has been prescribed. I believe there is a strong possibility that the wound could become contaminated  with Staph or worse, knowing that Staph is able to kill in 24 hours or less either by necrotizing fasciitis, or by menningitus via the spinal cord or through the blood system.. Please advise if my brother in-law is in danger, and if we should say something. PS: Note that he has a doctor assigned, but has never actually seen him. He diagnoses by phone. This appears to be a circumstance of the insurance or rather the [quote]poor insurance [/quote] my bother-in-law has. Please advise ASAP[/b]\n\n",

(9/21/03)   two cuts in the forearm penetrating skin and muscle. we went to the emergency room and had them closed up.  internal dissolvable stitches (for the muscle) and standard on the skin.  the doctor said some seepage would be normal,  and if it bled through the dressing just put more over the top.   6 hours later it is still coming through the dressing.   is this something that needs to be looked at??   like maybe today??   the er said not to change the dressing til the follow-up(removal of outerstitching).      really it just seems to be constantly bleeding through the dressing.  i would greatly appreciate any advice you can give                                                   concerned brother\n\n",

    "content": "EFOLKEN, Sorry for the delayed response. But I guess now we are in a better situation to tell whether this is seepage or bleeding. If it were a bleeder the amount of blood coming from the wound would quickly drench the dressing leaving no doubt whatsoever as to the seriousness of the situation. Thats all I can tell you really from here, given the limitations of the internet.\n\n",

    "title": "MALPRACTICE....OR NORMAL PROBLEMS???",
    "content": "About 3 years ago I was struck in the eye by my abusive ex-boyfriend...I had a broken eye socket(blown orbit) and could not see correctly because of it.  I was refered to an ear,nose and throat specialist and he preformed my surgery to correct it.  Just recently I was refered back to him because of constant sinus infections in the same side of my face the surgery was preformed on.  He reviewed my ct scan and stuck a medal rod up my nose and told me the problem was that he had to cut a hole on the inside of my nose straight into my sinus cavity so that he could pack it with gauze after the surgery and apparently it never grew shut after surgery.  Also he noticed on my scan that their were still bone fragmentsfrom my nose that he was to have removed when he did the surgery.  Also I have a diffused septum....my question is did he do something wrong, for me to be haveing all of these problems??  He gave me a prescription for flonase and wanted to see me back to discuss haveing rhinoplasty done!!  I haven't been back to see him, and truthfully am wondering if there was some sort of malpractice.  I am currently looking for another specialist to go to, but I am scared.  Also I have been in constant pain bacause of these infections and have slight nerve damage to my teeth and cheek and lip..is there anything I can do about this...should I just go to another doctor and forget about the previous mistakes or should I contact someone about this MAYBE malpractice, and if so WHO should I contact!!  PLEASE SOMEONE HELP ME!!  I am totally confused here...THANK YOU  .....Kim[/b]\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Kimberly!  I read your message, and shame on all abusive ex-boyfriends who treat women like their shoes!   Firstly, regarding the surgery you had for your blown orbit, did you sign a consent form and did the form contain sinus infection as an acceptable complication of the surgery? Antral puncture is the name of the procedure of cutting a hole on the inside of the sinus, and the hole is never meant to get shut after the surgery, to the best of my knowledge. Bone fragments remaining behind could happen with any surgeon, and a deviated nasal septum does not need a blown orbit to make happen.  If anyone did anything wrong, for you to be having all these problems, I wouldn't mind putting the blame squarely on your ex-boyfriend rather than the doctor who tried to help you.  My advice to you are three: 1. Openness 2. Honesty 3. Hope  Be open and honest with your own doctor as to how you feel about everything, and hope for the best. These are cardinal virtues I would suggest to every doctor towards their patients, but once in a while these virtues can be taken up by the patients themselves towards their doctors. But even after all your candor, if you feel justice has not been done, you can consult the legal profession to help you out, i.e., if you have not already been in touch with them regarding your ex-boyfriend.     I hope this helps,  bye  Bill\n\n",
