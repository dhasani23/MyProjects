    "title": "Re: MDMA affecting heart?",
    "content": "Hi, MDMA (methylenedioxymethamphetamine) better known as ecstasy is chemically related to amphetamines (a ring-substituted amphetamine).  Amphetamine use is of serious concern because it causes a variety of devastating health consequences. As your question pertains to the cardiac complications, i will provide information only on this aspect.  Ecstasy produces indirect sympathetic activation by releasing dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin from central and autonomic nervous system terminals. These result in increased cardiac work. Myocardial ischemia and infarction have been known to occcur in patients with or without coronary artery disease. The mechanism is uncertain, but could be related to the elevated catecholamine concentrations, which increase myocardial oxygen demand, coronary artery spasm, platelet aggregation, and thrombus formation. A direct toxic effect of the drug on the heart also has been postulated.  Mechanical complications, such as acute aortic rupture, pneumopericardium and valvular damage (especially left sided) can occur due to paroxysmal increases in blood pressure. Left sided valvular damage may lead to endocarditis, often associated with unusual organisms such as Pseudomonas, candida, or Klebsiella and frequently has an aggressive clinical course resulting in marked valvular destruction, abscess formation, and even, a need for surgical intervention.  As you had undergone a cardiac surgery during early childhood (details of which are unavailable), your personal risk is very much higher for many of the complications, especially, endocarditis. You must abort this proposed venture,seek help and get counseled. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Milli-Volts Generated by Sinoatrial Node in Heart",
    "content": "Hi, The voltages of the action potentials recorded from for example, the SA node are a lot different than those voltages seen on surface electrocardiograms. In a surface EKG, the various waves that you see are a sum of the electrical waves of depolarization and repolarization and not from the individual cells.  The voltages recorded at the surface are modified by many factors including, - the thickness of the myocardium, - the pericardium, - overlying lung tissue and pleurae,and - the thicknesss of the chest wall.  Pacemaker action potentials: In contrast to the other excitable tissues such as the skeletal muscle and the neurons whose action potential lasts for only a few milliseconds, the cardiac action potential in general exhibits a duration exceeding 150 milliseconds and generally displays a prominent plateau. The time spent by the action potential above 0 mV is called the overshoot.The SA nodal (pace maker) action potential is different from that of the cardiac myocytes in that there are no \"fast\" sodium (Na+) channels in the SA nodal cell membranes. Rather, there are \"slow\" calcium (Ca++) channels which are of 4 types(A,B,C and D). The calcium channels open one after the other allowing a slow influx of calcium ions into the cell. Because of this, the pacemaker action potential begins slowly. SA nodal cells do not have a stable resting membrane potential and that is the reason why they automatically generate action potentials.The \"resting potential\" of -60mV, the voltage slowly increases to -30 to -40 mV(\"pacemaker potential\") at which point (\"threshold potential\"), the depolarization speeds up with an upstroke in the tracing which can rise upto +10 to +20 mV.  In contrast, the surface ECG records a P wave of approximately + 2.5 mV.  It is well known that low voltage complexes can occur in several conditions including, - obese individuals, - in myxedema, - in COPD, - pleural effusion, - pleural effusions etc.  It has been seen in cases of congestive cardiac failure, that the voltages on surface EKG become attenuated.One study which studied this phenomenon objectively, concludes thus:  \"Drawing on the experience from patients with a diversity of edematous states it now appears that the underlying common mechanism of this phenomenon is extracardiac, mediated by the decrease in the electrical impedance of the body volume conductor enveloping the heart and resulting from the fluid engorged interstitium (interstitial fluid has the lowest possible special resistance in the body).[1] The lowering of electrical impedance of the body volume conductor is translated in turn into attenuated body surface ECG potentials. As expected, amelioration of the PERED results in augmentation of the QRS complexes,[2] P waves,[3] and T waves\"[4].  [1]. Geddes LA, Baker LE.

    "content": "Hello,  I am a 27 year old active and fit female. I swim 4 days a week and am 5'6\" and 125 lbs. In the last year and a half, I have noticed several veins on each of my lower legs have begun to buldge out when I stand or am up on my feet. I have had one varicose vein on the back of my thigh since I was about 13, and that one has gotten slightly worse, but all the new ones along my shins and near my ankles have just appeared recently. My parents have passed away, but I do remember that my mom had moderate varicose veins.  I went to a cosmetic vein doctor last summer, who did an ultrasound and didn't see anything abnormal with my veins. I have been putting off getting any cosmetic surgery done to them because I fear they will just get worse once I do it and my money will have been wasted.  Is this normal for someone my age? Should I be concerned about how quickly they are appearing? Should I go through with surgery to fix them now, or would it make more sense to wait until they are worse? Unfortunately, I do not have medical insurance so I am just left to search the web for advice and worry myself sick over it. Any advice anyone can give me would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Sudden onset of varicose veins.",
    "content": "Hi, Development of lower limb varicose veins at the age of 13 is uncommon but not unknown. Varicose veins do occur in otherwise normal children and adolescents as some studies indicate.  There are may known predisposing factors for the development of varicose veins, some of which are, - genetics, increasing age, female sex, pregnancy, multiparity, obesity, positive family history, Prolonged standing, lifestyle, Past history of DVT, trauma,alcohol,smoking etc.  There is a striking geographic variation in the occurrence of varicose veins.The prevalence of incompetence of the sapheno-femoral junction(according to some studies) is higher in subjects with positive family history of varicose veins compared to those with negative one. Others dispute this.  Oral contraceptives, Hormone replacement therapy show only a weak association.  I will provide you with a few causes of varicose veins in children and adolescents and few unusual causes of varicose veins.  Although there is much evidence supporting a relationship between primary varicocoele and venous incompetence of the saphenofemoral junction in adults, there is no evidence for such a relationship during adolescence.  Between 10 and 12 years of Bochum study I, isolated refluxes were found at the saphenofemoral junction (internal saphenous vein 2.9%, external saphenous vein 0.2%), but no varicose vein was yet visible at the trunk level. In the adolescents aged between 14 and 16 years, of Bochum study II, the number of refluxes of the internal and external saphenous vein had greatly increased, and isolated varicose veins were found at the trunk level. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2093907  One study demonstrated high concurrence of varicocoele and valvular incompetence of the saphenofemoral junction in adolescent males affected by primary varicocoele in order to detect the early diagnosis of venous insufficiency of the lower limbs among these patients. (Mirace Yasemin Karadeniz-Bilgili et al, Pediatric Radiology; Volume 33, Number 9 / September, 2003)  Varicose veins are known to occur in young people afflicted with Joint hypermobility syndrome [vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (Type IV)]. Arteriovenous fistulae may also occur.     Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome consists of three symptoms often seen together: port wine stains, varicose veins and limb hypertrophy.Varicose veins in this condition are much larger and are distributed over a wider area than normal varicose veins. They may involve the whole lower limb,sometimes even the buttocks and abdomen and may become more visible as the child grows.  A persistent sciatic vein is frequently associated with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome. A persistent sciatic vein has also been reported to occur as an isolated primary entity.  In all probability, you most likely have simple varicose veins of earlier onset. The usual indications for surgery in simple varicose veins are, recurrent episodes of thrombophlebitis, failure to respond to conservative measures(such as the graduated compression stockings) after 6 months and bleeding. Of course, even in the abscence of these indications, one may opt for surgery for purely cosmetic reasons.Your doctor will be able to guide you regarding the management. Good luck!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: continuos stitching pain across heart",
    "content": "Hi, Any type of pain in/around the sternal area naturally evokes suspicion of being cardiac in origin.  'Typical' symptoms of angina pectoris or myocardial infarction (Heart attack) are not easy to miss.  Basically a heart attack may present in two ways: - with pain, or - as a painless(silent) episode(common in diabetics, due to autonomic neuropathy).  Symptoms of Heart attacks have been noted to  - vary from person to person, and  - from heart attack to heart attack even in the same individual.   Thus, one may also classify heart attacks as those  - presenting with typical pain & - those presenting with atypical pain.  These atypical presentations are more common in people >65 years of age, diabetics, and women.  Women tend to experience \"atypical' symptoms (such as pain in between the shoulder blades) more often.The danger is that this may result in delays in seeking medical attention.  Of course, there are many conditions to be considered in the differential diagnosis, such as - Gastrointestinal Disorders(reflux,peptic ulcers etc), - Pericarditis, - Benign chest wall pain, - respiratory pathology(pleurisy,bronchitis,asthma,pneumonia), - psychiatric conditions (panic disorder). Around 40% of patients with panic disorders experience chest pain.  In your instance, although your EKG was normal an year ago, ideally, you should consult your cardiologist once again as a cardiac cause for your symptoms must be excluded once again - especially as you have some of the risk factors, a family history & being a female,the risk of atypical episodes is unfortunately higher.

    "content": "I have yet to discover an explanation on the link between botox cosmetic and heart attack. The information I come across is vague and simply points out that botox can cause heart attacks but, never explains why an injection in the face can cause a heart attack.  My concern and interest stems from my own experience with botox. I am a 27 y/o active male and I lead a healthy lifestyle. In August of 2006 I had botox injected to treat superficial facial lines. Botox worked great, however nearly 2 weeks following my injections I experienced body aches, coughing, phlegm, facial pressure, chills, and a sore throat that lasted a couple of weeks. I was told \"flu like symptoms\" could occur following botox injections so, I assumed it was normal.  Two months following my botox injections I woke from a nap with a racing heart and an overwhelming feeling of doom took over me. I wasn't exactly sure what was happening but, I thought I was having a heart attack. I was under a lot of stress at the time and earlier that day I took .25mg xanax tablet during lunch and drank a glass of wine. I managed to calm down and assumed that the glass of wine combined with xanax was responsible for the panic episode.  In the spring of 2008 I had my second round of botox injections administered by the same Dr. to treat the same superficial facial lines as in 2006. I brought up the \"flu like symptoms\" to my Dr. before the procedure and he quickly dismissed my inquiry saying botox was totally safe and the amount he injected me with could not cause any symptoms besides swelling or eye drooping. I did not want to have a debate with my Dr. so, I went along with his response. About 5 hours after the injections I decided to nap only to wake up feeling my heart race, I managed to calm down rather quickly however, 2 weeks following the injections I experienced \"flu like symptoms\" again that lasted 2 weeks.  A year after the second set of injections I woke up one morning with a racing heart I felt dizzy and afraid. I was rushed to the ER, tests were done and I was told I had a panic attack. These panic attacks did not stop and I made a few more trips to the ER. I have had many tests done with the exception of an echocardiogram. I appear to be fine but, Dr.'s at the ER said I am suffering from anxeity disorder. Mentally, I feel fine but, if it is only anxiety then why does it all revolve around my heart? Could botox be responsible for this a year after the injections? How could botox injections in the face effect the heart of a healthy young adult?\n\n",

Although you once visited an ER with subsequent negative stress test/nuc scan, I'd want a more detailed cardiac workup to rule out some form of occult coronary artery disease or structural abnormality (which could be uncovered by echocardiography) before accepting the \"mystery gas problem,\" which is rarely all that mysterious: Chronic gas such as you may be suffering is often caused by habitual, unwitting swallowing of air. However and once again, the provocation of symptoms by exertion does make them more suspicious, and the fact the first cardio exam was a while ago and not complete would suggest there still may be some heart-related cause that should first be ruled out. This would include the possibility of an odd, but less mysterious coronary artery spasm problem. An angiogram may well be in order.  I hope this helps.

    "content": "Hi there -- It's difficult to know exactly what's going on but your symptoms -- palpitations, pain, lightheadedness and grey-outs (blackouts where one doesn't fully lose consciousness but usually vision is affected) -- certainly warrant a cardiological workup to see what's going on. It could be something relatively benign such as electrolyte depletion due to inapparent dehydration, or it could be some sort of arrhythmia you've recently developed. Again, this could be trivial or it could require some sort of therapy or following. A 12-lead EKG, echocardiogram, possibly even a stress test, all would be indicated along with some blood work to check on electrolytes.   This should be done promptly, primarily for the reason you mentioned: You don't want to fall down and get hurt. Besides, there's always the possibility the problem actually requries some medical management. At any rate you'll know what's going on and how it may be managed if it even needs anything done.   Hope this is helpful. Good luck to you. Please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "fluctuating tachycardia",
    "content": "Hello, Background: I'm 31 year old female who suffers from neuropathic pain (vulvar vestibulitis) and had been taking nortriptyine (10 mg 3x daily or 30 mg once daily) for this pain.  I stopped abruptly on my doctors advice, having taken my last dose on monday morning (Oct. 27).  I recently went to Urgent Care for an unrelated issue while my doctor was on holiday a couple of weeks ago.  The triage nurse raised concern about my high heart rate, which was quite high on arrival, but slowed to 127 by the time they did an ECG.  I was told it was still high-ish and to see about getting my thyroid tested. My blood pressure was 137/? which is VERY high for me (I am always low normal at about 102, 106ish.  My highest known was 116) so it was also thought I could be nervous being at the hospital.   When my doctor got back from holiday Monday, I went in to ask about the test and he found my heart rate was 200 BPM, variable.  He was very concerned. I told him I had been having bursts of palpitations and sleeplessness for months...since I started the tricyclic.  He sent me across the street to an internal medicine doctor who did an ECG, which was then 137 BPM.  He said my blood pressure was 50/75.  I thought I mis-heard him (he has an accent) so I asked again and he repeated it again.  I commented with shock on how extremely low that seems and he said it was because my heart was racing so fast.  I still think I must have heard something wrong because that seems like coma state to me???  I did nearly faint on standing at the other doctors but I didn't feel particularly unwell.  This doctor told me to stop taking the medicine immediately and ordered blood tests, a chest x ray and thyroid ultrasound.  I have not heard any results after one work week and I assume this means all was normal.  My family doctor said no news was good news.  Since stopping the medication on monday, I have been feeling very unwell...headache, body aches, nausea.  I assume it is some sort of withdrawal even though my dose was so low. I'm starting to feel a bit better today. I assumed that my heart issues would stop but so far they have not.  I definitely don't feel as though I'm on as much of a \"high speed\" as I was before and, in fact, I'm so exhausted that I can hardly function.  My dishes have piled up and even running out to the store requires a long rest afterwards.  I do not feel anxious or depressed, just utterly exhausted.  I have noticed, also, that my heart rate changes for no particular reason.  I can be watching TV and feel fine and then suddenly my heart will speed up while I'm just sitting there and then slow back down.  It is not as extreme as before I stopped the medication, though.  Last night I was sitting down and tested my heart rate.  It was 76 bpm.  Then I tried standing up just beside my chair with no extra movement and it was 110 bpm.  I'm not sure if that is normal or not but it fits with the changes I feel when I bend to scratch my leg or something.  Is this something I should be concerned about?  It was assumed by both doctors that, if it was not thyroid, then it would be medication related.  the heart speed definitely did improve after stopping the Nortriptyline but I just feel as though something is still wrong.  Is it possible that having such a fast heart rate for months could have stressed my adrenal glands or something and this is causing the exhaustion and fluctuations?  Is that something that would just go away on it's own?  Is it something that could/should be tested in some way?  Thanks for your time!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  First of all, you probably did misunderstand the accented doctor, since it is impossible to have a blood pressure of 50/75, since the systolic (top number) is, by definition, greater than the lower one. More likely he was saying \"150/75,\" which would be more consistent with what you'd gotten earlier.  Now then, as to what's going on. You would seem to have had some inapproriate tachycardia (I don't believe it was supraventricular tachycardia or any other more exotic rapid tachycardia, because the EKG would have shown this), which could have been caused by the nortriptyline, which can have a variety of cardiac side-effects. Also, since  you stopped the medication you've experienced a slowing to normal (and 75 at rest followed by 110 after standing is not abnormal).   Pain blocking drugs such as nortriptyline and others even of other classes can have this side effect (inappropriate tachycardia), and since it seems to have improved, maybe even normalized, since you stopped, this seems the likely culprit. You may have to try some other medications for this same purpose til you find one which doesn't disagree with you. Just because this happens with one doesn't mean it will happen  with them all.  Your feeling unwell after having stopped the nortrityline is not unheard of either, especially when one's been on it for some time. It's usually best to taper off these things, but there's no harm in stopping cold (when used as a pain blocker) other than the syndrome you've described, which isn't so much dangerous as just plain annoying. You should begin to start feeling more like yourself shortly, but the original complaint will no doubt return and require some other sort of drug to manage it.  This occasional inappropriate tachycardia can also, of course, be caused by thyroid disease and/or the medications used to treat that. This also should be checked to be certain everything is in line in that respect. It is also possible, though  less likely, that you're suffering a certain degree of adrenal exhaustion, which would be related to one of the other two problems (thyroid or the discontinued med), and so that, too, should soon begin to resolve.   While you should begin to feel more and more normal, please follow up with us and keep us updated. I think there is adquate reason to suspect the medication -- and its discontinuance --as the primary causes of both the inappropriate heart rate and the feelings of general unwellness.   Best of luck to you. Please stay in touch.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for the response.  You were right, after surviving the annoying effects of withdrawal I began to feel much better.  I went back to the specialist today and my blood pressure was good (I checked about the 50/75 thing from before and he told me it had been 50/40 which was exceptionally low and he was surprised I was standing at the time).  I'm at a healthy 110/67 now with a slightly fast pulse but I was nervous.  He told me my lingering tired feelings are from an iron deficiency and that if I take a one a day tablet I should begin to feel completely myself again.  The vestibulitis is unfortunately more of a problem than I expected.  I didn't realize the Nortriptyline had actually been working but clearly it was.  I won't be seeing my gyn until December 19th so I plan on doing a little research on alternatives up until that time.  I have heard that topical Gabapentin has given some women relief without the side effects of the oral medication.  I hope that if I go in to my appointment with some informed options to present I won't be told that I'm just going to have to live with the vestibulitis which was the thought if the tricyclics didn't work.  Anyway, thank you again for your time.  It was very reassuring, when I felt so unwell, to read that the way I was feeling were not unheard of and would pass.  This service is appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  I'm glad to learn the effects of withdrawal of the offending medication are starting to abate and you're feeling better already. That's very good news. I believe the (corrected) 50/40 BP was either a momentary finding or perhaps an erroneous reading. It sometimes happens. The bottom line with low blood pressure is that if it works for the subject, then it's OK, and when it's as off-base as that reading was, it's either been transient or erroneous. At any rate you're doing well in that department and that's excellent.  The potential for topical gabapentin (and quite possibly even the same or a related medication taken by mouth) is great. If topical works, all to the good. There's not necessarily ever a uniform set of side effects with these meds, and some people tolerate them internally very well, while others do experience side-effects such as you did with the nortriptyline. I'll be interested to hear how the topical application works for you.   Please do stay in touch. Wishing you the very best.\n\n",

    "content": "I just wanted to follow up and let you know that I have had some great success with 4% topical Gabapentin in a lipoderm base for treatment of the V. vestibulitis.  It doesn't eliminate the problem but it does greatly reduce it without side effects.  I would like as many doctors to know of this as possible because it really is worth a try for those female patients suffering with Vulvodynia.  My only problem that could be related to the med (but I doubt it) is that I have felt like I have a chronic UTI for the last few months but tests come out negative.  I actually had a \"leak\" of sorts where I went to the washroom and discovered that I was completely wet with a putrid smelling urine-ish fluid.  I did not feel it happen and I don't know if it came from my bladder or vagina.  I don't know if this would have happened to me anyway or if it is a result of the medication getting on my urethra and irritating it somehow.  I'm inclined to believe it is not related to the medication.  I see my gyn in 4 months and will mention it then it if continues. Anyway, thanks again for all your help!\n\n",

The apparent UTI or whatever it is could well be due to the medication, but that's just speculation on my part, considering the fact the medication does block certain nerve transmissions, mainly those of pain. It will be very interesting to find out what, if anything, that turns out to be.   Thanks for touching base with us and for sharing a potentially very valuable bit of information!\n\n",

    "content": "Sorry to carry this topic on again but it seems the inappropriate tachycardia is back or didn't actually leave.  I began to feel much better after stopping the Tricyclics and so when my heart rate was deemed acceptable at a followup appointment, we assumed everything was fine.  Recently I went to Urgent Care again for an unrelated issue while my doctor was on holiday and AGAIN I was told at triage (and I was tested a second time after a couple of hours of sitting in the waiting room) that I had a high heart rate at 131 and that I should follow up with my doctor. My BP was 116/?.  I hadn't noticed the speeding heart rate as I had when it was 200 bpm last time, and I didn't feel particularly ill.   If they hadn't told me I would have had no idea, although it was obvious once pointed out to me.  I did follow up with my doctor a couple of weeks later and on that day my heart rate was 144 bpm and my blood pressure was 110/? (I can never remember diastolic numbers!).  I was sent for an ecg the next day and, although I don't know the results yet, I honestly don't feel that my heart rate was racing at all for the test.  So this appears to be fluctuating.  I have been on summer holidays for a month and a half and have had absolutely no stress or anxiety, so I think it is safe to rule that out.    One thing that did come back on my blood tests is low iron, although I am told that I am not anemic.  I wasn't told the test result number but when I asked if I could correct it through diet she said no, they wanted me to take a multivitiman with Iron in it.\\  I wonder if it is possible that low iron is causing the tachycardia even though I am not anemic?  I must admit that I am losing large quantities of hair (which I've been complaining about for ages) and I get dizzy when I stand up and occasionally need to sit down again because I can't see for a few seconds.  These seem to fit with anemia but I am not anemic.  These symptoms are not new to me, either.  All but the hair loss happen on occasion.   I was wondering what you think?  Is low iron without anemia enough to cause fluctuating tachycardia?  If it is not iron causing it, what else may be causing the high heart rate and can it be dangerous if it is often high (up to 200bpm resting) but is sinus tachy only?  Once again, thanks for your time!  (ps. I spent a couple of days off of Gabapentin and still had the fast heart rate so I'm hoping it isn't that).\n\n",

    "title": "Re: fluctuating tachycardia",
    "content": "I have an update for you and a lot of history and questions.  I hope I can make it make sense.  First of all, I was put on a 48 hour holter monitor a few weeks ago and had a stress test done yesterday.  I didn't get much detail about the holter readings originally but yesterday he said that my heart rate was normal during sleep (50-70) and that I had a number of episodes of tachycardia during the daytime with a maximum heart rate of 183.  Most of the episodes were on the first day with the monitor.  This was interesting to me but made sense because the first day was my day off.  Although I had very little stress to deal with that day, I did do a lot of moving around- getting groceries, cleaning and I took a walk in the conservation area that night.  The next day I was at work and was sitting down literally ALL day for a conference. Yesterday for the stress test they did my baseline EKG and my heart rate was 120bpm at base line.  I thought this was quite high for a base line considering I had not had any caffeine or even anything but water that day.  The test was on a stationary bike and my heart rate got up to the target of 180-something relatively quickly.  I asked him if that meant I was out of shape and he said normally it would but I wasn't even slightly short of breath or tired and my blood pressure didn't increase.  That, combined with the fact that I am not a sedentary person leads him to think that maybe my size is the culprit (I am 5 feet tall and very slender).  After the test he did two more EKG's.  My blood pressure didn't ever go up very high to begin with but it returned to the pre-test level of 97/? very quickly.  My heart rate never did go back down to 120bpm.  The lowest it went was 140 before he decided to detach me from the leads.  He said that most people would have returned to normal by then.  I'm not sure what that is supposed to mean for me but he didn't seem overly concerned.  He left it that I am going to do a 24 hour urine test to check a hormone and if it is alright than we will assume it is just because of my size. He says it fits a pattern but that the pattern is simply much higher than normal.  I was fine with this thought until I realized later that any time I had my pulse taken in the past (prior to about 2 years ago) it was always in the high 70's or 80's.  I had a couple of procedures in the hospital and my heart rate was taken a number of times and it was never documented above 90 (in the records I have, anyway).  If it were due to my size, would it not be the case that I always had a high heart rate?  Can this fast rate just develop as a new normal in my 30's?   My mom is more concerned than I am that something isn't quite right and there are two reasons for this.   1. Her father died of a sudden heart attack in his 40's while curling and it was a shock to the family because he was always so fit and active.  No one in the family knows what caused the heart attack because it was in the 70's and no one asked for details on his death. He was known to have a cigarette though. 2. She says that she has seen a distinct change in me over the last year and a half to 2 years that she recognizes from when she was diagnosed with Graves Disease (she also has two siblings with thyroid disorders).  She says I have only two speeds these days, high speed and off and she would swear up and down that I had a hyperactive thyroid if my test hadn't come back fine.  She also had tachycardia when her thyroid was overactive and says that I have an edge of irritability that has never been in my personality before.  I have always been very laid back and easy going and now I seem to be more tense and hyper, even when I was off work for summer holidays and had no stress at all.  I don't notice this so much, although I can see that she may be right.  When I HoHummed her about it she made it quite clear that I live with it every day and don't see the change over time but that it is there and she feels very strongly that something has slowly changed over the last two years.  In terms of life changes, nothing too dramatic has happened.  Two years ago is approximately when I started trying the medications for my long time enemy vestibulitis (Amitryptiline/Nortryptiline) that we thought was causing this but when I went off them and thought I returned to normal, mom says I actually didn't.    It's interesting to get another person's perspective on me.  I'm not usually one for anxiety and have always been pretty easy going until now.  I wouldn't rule out stress as a factor because I know it can do some crazy things but it does seem strange that the heart rate was so high when I was on holidays for two months with my biggest worry being whether or not I would go shopping that day.  Any thoughts?  Should I just leave it alone if the urine test comes back fine and assume it is my size and move on?  Also, if my heart rate gets up to 180 after a bit of exercise, would it still be safe for me to do more vigorous exercise? I like to hike, ride horses and snowboard.  Is there an upper limit to a safe heart rate if there is no real problem?  THANK YOU for all your time!  PS.  I have been taking Ferritin and b12 since the blood tests so hopefully my Iron is now back up.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello again. Your newest information and results all are interesting, although they don't seem to directly answer any questions concretely, although your doctor's suspicion this could be due to your size is one of the more reasonable possible contributors.   Your mother's observations are interesting and it is useful to get an objective view of how we appear, since subjective perceptions are often extremely skewed or blunted, or as your mother points out, can sneak up on us. This includes chronic anxiety, which could not only cause your symptoms but could be caused by your symptoms. This is an infuriating feature of this sort of complaint, as anxiety affects heart rate and rhythm and vice versa, and anxiety is also frequently (and innocently) denied by the sufferer because of that subjectivity and the fact that sometimes generalized anxiety doesn't have an external cause but is more or less spontaneous -- idiopathic. So that's something to consider, even though I suspect there has been some physical, perhaps metabolic change as well. Your mother is right, again, about the appearance of Graves' disease, except for the fact there is no clinical substantiation. Nevertheless when there is a family history of thyroid disease,sometimes symptoms will show up in advance of diagnosable thyroid problems,so this is something else to file away for future reference.  As for the Holter and EKG findings, these are interesting but again don't tell us too much. The Holter tracing interpreted some episodes of SVT, but given that your resting rate has become rather accelerated anyway, it's difficult to be certain this is SVT and at least probably isn't paroxysmal, but would seem to just creep into a range rapid enough to qualify. True SVT usually comes on suddenly and goes away abruptly, and may last for very brief spells or for hours or days. You would seem to have simply shifted into a lower gear (higher, numerically -- your \"engine\" is running faster to achieve the same rate of work). This would definitely be suggestive of hyperthyroid, and that should be rechecked periodically.   The EKG findings that are slightly suspect are mostly centered around those errant Q waves, which many think of only in terms of old myocardial infarction (heart attack) but actually may occur as a \"normal abnormality\" in some people. Since yours seem to be small and not associated with other telltale changes, they probably are normal for you, and may have little or nothing to do with the tachycardia. This is why the EKG computerized notes were scratched through. A human eye reading these things is far more accurate than what possibilities the maching has programmed into it. Makes for a useful guide, but often is incorrect as in this case.   You did very well on your stress test, just took less time than some to reach your peak. Again, petite size often goes with this, as the smaller the person the more rapid the heart rate as a rule. However, since you used to have a more average rate, it would seem something changed or is changing, and since it's not reflected in heart disease findings, it is probably either emotional or metabolic, perhaps both.   Please do keep us updated regarding all this, even though you appear to have nothing serious going on. It's got to be bothersome at least, and could eventually be explained by something unrelated to the heart, something that hasn't yet fully formed, such as thyroid disease.\n\n",

    "content": "Just thought I'd post to say that he's decided that it is due to my size.  Just to be confident I asked why my heart rate was always normal rate when taken prior to two years ago and it has been elevated every time it has been taken since then.  He said that it just coincidence of timing and that I had never had a 24 hour holter done to prove I was normal before so I was probably just caught at \"normal moments before\".  I'm not confident about that...a lot of coincidence there to always be in the 70's and 80's and then suddenly always be in the 120's to 150's.  He was in a big rush and was grumpy with grumpy people waiting in the waiting room so I didn't ask about this further.  Although I don't buy that it has always been that way I do trust him that it isn't a problem.  There are just two things that I wondered and wasn't able to ask due to his mood/busy office.  I wonder if you could answer them for me.  1.  My heart rate takes a long time to return to normal after exercise.  My stress test base line was 120 bpm and after the test I had only returned to somewhere in the 140's when he disconnected me at 5 minutes of rest.  Is this common?  I know I must return to \"normal\" eventually so I'm not particularly worried, I just wonder if it is common and why it happens.    2.  Is there such thing as an unsafe upper limit?  If my heart rate starts high and gets higher easily but it isn't a heart defect causing this, it is always still safe?  Is 200 bpm and higher safe if you have no symptoms?  When my heart was caught at 200 bpm resting by my family doctor about a year ago I had no idea it was happening.  I felt fine apart from being light headed when I stood up which happens to me all the time anyway.  I didn't feel ill.  Does this mean that 200 bpm isn't dangerous for me because I start high anyway?  Thanks again for all your help.  It's a great service you provide and we all appreciate your time on here.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -- Well, it sounds as though you've gotten about as much of an answer from the current doctor as you're likely to get, and he may be right (about your size being to blame). At least partly right. It probably contributes. Also, some people are naturally sympathomimetic (the sympathetic side of the autonomic nervous system is dominant, so they run a little faster at idle) and some are naturally vagatonic (the parasympathetic system -- the vagus nerve -- rules and keeps things slower) and most of the former group are more slight of build. So this may be a big part of it. I can't help but think there may be some endocrine thing contributing as well, but that's been pretty well searched out for now.   To answer your two questions: 1) For someone who is sympathomimetic the slower cooldown/slowdown is more typical, yes. Your numbers run a bit above the norm for that, which is why I still wonder about some perhaps evolving endocrine problem (hyperthyroid, adrenal tumor, etc.) but for now we're stuck with \"you just run kind of fast.\"  2) The higher rates, in and of themselves, are not, in an otherwise healthy person, unsafe. They don't as many people reasonably assume, cause early or additional wear and tear. Much of this is actually relative to size as well as \"wiring\", and many people live very long lives with oddly fast heart rates. When the rate is consistently or even frequently up in the SVT range, though, one has to wonder if there isn't something adding a little boost and, again, so far that's been a blind alley. I have known one or two people who've run rates about as fast as yours and were perfectly healthy and remain so.   The speculation about the Holter monitor results is just that, and since it can't be proven one way or the other, we have to accept the doctor's view as, well, his evidence-based view, but also your skepticism is warranted because you just don't know what you don't know. This is one of the flaws in the monitoring technique, and why I often prefer an event monitor to a Holter. However, since you don't seem to experience well defined \"events\" but rather just tend to run fast then faster without any significant symptoms, the event monitor probably wouldn't reveal anything new.  The two possibilties I see are either this just stays this way or resolves mysteriously as it appeared, or eventually some problem in another (probably endocrine) system finally makes itself seen and is corrected. You'd still likely run faster that a bigger, taller person, but maybe more within the range we're used to seeing. Meanwhile, whchever way it goes, it seems you're doing fine, and again, the higher rate, in itself, poses no real threat to well-being. It's just kind of odd.   Thanks for staying in touch and please continue to let us know how you're doing, especially if anything new surfaces.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi again,  I hope you don't mind that I'm popping by yet again.  I appreciate everything you've done to help me and others on this board.  I planned on just leaving things unless another symptom came up in the future that shed some light on things but having received a copy of my records after being discharged from the internal medicine doctor I wonder about an off the wall possibility.  I thought I'd get your opinion.  Every EKG I've had when my pulse was fast always says QT interval long for rate but the doctor has never commented on it, so I've been assuming it is one of those abnormal-normal instances.  It is on multiple EKG's but only on the ones when my heart rate is high.  On the day of my stress test my baseline heart rate was 122 bpm and my QTc was 591 with the reference range of <470.  The comment says QT long for rate.  The QTc immediately after the stress test, though, was only 478 which is barely over normal.  It still says long for rate and my heart rate was 183 bpm.  The QTc rates vary depending on my tachycardia.  One time they caught my heart rate at a normal 88bpm and my QTc was 403, which shows as well within normal.  I noticed that LQTS causes and increase in heart rate and one of the listed triggors is antidepressants.  All of my issues started when I began taking the Amitriptyline and then Nortriptyline for my vestibulitis.  Things improved but did not go away when the medication was stopped.  Is this something you consider a possibility and if so, is it worth looking into when I've already been discharged and told that it is because I am small?  Thanks again for your time,  Greenwood  PS  I have seen the summary from my holter and my tachycardia was for less time then I anticipated.  Of the 48 hours I only had 12 hours of tachycardia with the highest rate being 179 for 21 minutes and 30 seconds  The longest run of svt was 257 beats at 158bpm.  Not sure if this means anything?  I also had 6 hours of Bradycardia but it was only as low as 46 and was during sleep.\n\n",

    "content": "I apologize for jumping in on a thread that is not mine, and I'm no MD.  I just wanted to comment your QTc, because I have a similar experience. My QTc is at normal HR 400 +/- 5, but one time I was put on ECG with sinus tachycardia (due to anxiety), my QTc was almost 440. And that with a HR of 110-120.  I believe QTc is highly unreliable on high heart rates. In my opinion, you should't worry about this, as long as your QT time is normal at normal heart rates. And, LQTS will only cause problems if the QT time is actually long (due to the combination of long QT-time and bradycardia). If your QT time is normal at low heart rates, this is (again, in my opinion) completely fine.  In LQTS the T-waves will also have an abnormal size, fairly easy for a MD to recognize. If he didn't mention this, don't think about it :)  It seems most of your episodes with tachycardia is sinus tachy and not SVT. The longest SVT run was approx. 2 minutes. Your bradycardia at night is also completely normal. Mine was as low as 38 at night and my cardiologist didn't even mention it. (Of course, it caused me a great deal of anxiety, and I have a question about that pending here).  It is actually a good sign that your HR tends to drop during sleep. Your heart is strong and is actually able to keep you up and going on a low heart rate.  PS: When I have times with strong anxiety, I notice my HR increases to 120-130 by just going out of my chair, or climbing some stairs. This is not the case when I'm relaxed. I believe many of your problems are caused by high adrenaline levels (from my own experience)  Good luck, I hope you will be OK :)\n\n",

    "content": "Hi. Don't mind at all, and especially when there is something important needs addressing. This does. And yes, any of the tricyclic antidepressants (you mentioned two you've been taking) can prolong the QT interval, and especially in people already predisposed to this. Since yours seems to be variable instead of always prolonged I suspect it to be acquired, and so probably a result of the use of the drugs for vestibulitis. I would strongly suggest use of a different class of pain blocking drug to manage this and to then have the EKG checked again, as this is not something you want going on (prolonged Q-T) whether it is genetic or acquired.   Hope this helps. Please keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -- This is a very difficult problem to sort out long distance. While you may have had a reaction to the bowel cleansing (what did you use for this? Did you take pills, swallow a great deal of liquid, or have enema done?) the reaction shouldn't have caused a long-lasting syndrome such as this, and the parts of it seem to fit no particular known pattern. There may be more than one thing going on at the same time and confusing the picture. I'd recommend you have complete blood work, metabolic panel, complete blood count, all the blood work, to see if there is some systemic disease or disturbance that may have been triggered by that initial reaction. It's difficult to say from here, but this certainly warrants aggressive medical detective work.   Please keep in touch with us and let us know how things turn out. Hope this is helpful.

    "content": "Hi -- Most likely there's no problem here. However, one thing which often explains a slower-than-normal heart rate is a high level of fitness. If you're a runner, jogger, regular brisk walker even, and a little bit vagatonic anyway (dominated by the vagus nerve or parasympathetic nervous system, the break that slows the heart) then this is perfectly normal. If you're not especially fit and still have a slow rate this could still be normal (some people are just plain vagatonic), but it would probably be reasonable to have, as part of a regular physical, a 12-lead EKG to make certain there are no electrical abnormalities. There very likely aren't (or if there are they are likely inconsequential) but it would be good to know for future comparison purposes.   If, however, you maintain a regular fitness regimen, this would likely explain it. Also, with no other symptoms, there's no reason to make a special appointment, just maybe mention it at the next regular physical or office visit.  Good luck to you.

Elevated blood pressure can, over time, cause damage to the eyes, mainly the retinas, but this irritation you're describing seems both early and not at all typical of what one would expect. It's not impossible this could be secondary to retinal vessel strain, but it seems awfully unlikely. It sounds a lot more like an allergic reaction to something. That said, I do hope your doctor will help you get the BP controlled quickly to avoid a whole host of potential long-term problems, of which one is eye damage (takes quite a while, normally, for this to take place, but why wait?).

    "content": "Hi there! Not sure if I should have put this question in this section instead:  I'm a 28 male, I don't smoke and I work out often. Since May 2009, I've been feeling a dull, aching feeling at the corners of my pectorals. It's not painful, just very annoying. Since then, I've been feeling these symptoms more often, and they come and go throughout the day (I notice caffeine makes them worse). There are places on my pecs that sting when I press on it, as well as the upper part of my ribcage, before it hits the armpits. Some parts are tender to the touch.  I've gone to three doctors. The first doctor said it was GERD, but the over-the-counter heart burn medicine didn't do anything. The aching feel occurs whether I'm eating/drinking or not. I took blood tests for diabetes, heart disease, hepatitis, et al and everything came back normal, except my liver enzymes and cholesterol were up a little. A liver sonogram showed no irregularities, so the doctor said to improve my lifestyle. Since May, I've lost 14 pounds. The dull pains continued, though.  I went to an Urgent Care to get a second opinion, and the doctor said it was definitely acid reflux, but to make sure, I should get some work done. I took a urine test (came back normal) and another EKG, which showed I had a incomplete right bundle branch block. The doctor said tons of people have this, but we should make sure it's not an indicator of something bigger. I took a Holter Monitor Test and a Nuclear Stress Test, and everything was normal. Still, the aches were there.  Finally, I recently came back from my family doctor, and he said that my tests were pretty exhaustive, and that since I'm young, pretty healthy and the test results came back OK, there's nothing to worry about. I told him where it hurt, how I have a bad posture and he pressed on several areas of my chest, which didn't produce pain. He said it's musculoskeletal and that if I stand up straight and ease my back, I should be OK.   I believe it's musculoskeletal, but I don't see how standing up straight can fix this dull aching problem I've been having for months. Also, I've noticed that my stomach's been upset a lot more lately (often after I eat, and especially when I wake up in the morning), and I sometimes feel some pressure near my \"love handles.\" It doesn't hurt when I breathe, I don't have sputum with discoloration and there's no tingling or sharp, shooting pains. Do you think it's musculoskeletal, and what can I take to make it better? I starting taking Allieve every day, and it's cutting the pain/soreness down by 50 percent.  I appreciate what you guys do for people like me! Thanks very much for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -- While in some patients pain in this area might send up a red flag, you've already had pretty exhaustive workups ruling out heart disease. I don't believe this sounds much like GERD, either, and the really suggestive part (in a good way) is that tenderness can be elicited by manual pressure, which strongly suggests an orthopedic problem. Your doctor suggests this might be due to faulty posture, and it may well be, since this is one possible cause of thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS), which may also cause the sort of symptom you describe and can often be aggravated by weight training, especially if the patient is already prone to TOS (due to the presence of an extra, cervical, rib). This is worth a look. It is, of course, also possible to have more than one thing going on at the same time, so whatever innocent cause underlies the primary symptom, you still could have GERD, and if treating it helps reduce symptoms then this is an effect-cause proof of at least part of the possible diagnosis, and won't likely hurt anything to try it. That and posture correction may well eliminate all the complaints.  Hope this is helpful to you. Good luck with this and please follow up with us here as needed\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Is Abrasion effective in reversing permanent AF",
    "content": "Hi Johnny -- Radio frequency (AF) ablation is sometimes effective in permanently correcting atrial fibrilation (A-fib), although not as good a cure rate as with many other arrhythmias. It is the ideal when it is workable, however. Quite often there are too many irritable foci causing the A-fib and then medication, electrical cardioversion (a very minor and easy procedure) or sometimes even ablation of the atrioventricular (AV) node may be employed (this last requires a permanent pacemaker placement as well. The others do not). A-fib is often a chronic, constant or recurrent problem, and the primary risk is that it may lead to secondary stroke owing to clot formation in the quivering atria going to the brain,which is why Coumadin is often employed. Coumadin is an anticoagulant which slows the tendency of the blood to clot, so clot formation in the more slowly moving blood from the atria doesn't have time to form those clots.   It is very difficult to calculate the chances of a successful ablation at a distance, since many factors are involved, but it is definitely worth looking into, and an electrophysiological (EP) study with attempted ablation can usually be tried without much additional risk. If it is successful it may be a permanent cure. Sometimes the A-fib will eventually return anyway, unlike most other arrhythmias, which is one reason many doctors don't go to the trouble and expense of trying the EP study, but I do believe it's worth a try if the patient has decent health insurance.   I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you. Please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: stenting in LAD",
    "content": "Hello -- The stenting of stenosed coronary arteries is often the difference between a heart attack or damaged heart muscle and extended and improved health. Since your father consented to an angiogram he placed himself in the position of tacit agreement to stenting (or other measures to prevent harm), and with the degree of narrowing he had, especially in his LAD, this would seem to be the only alternative to open bypass surgery. The LAD was nearly closed. The plaque could have ruptured at any moment or a clot could have closed off the artery at any moment. The narrowing was clearly longer than the practical length of a single stent, so very often it becomes necessary to insert a second through the first to extend the benefit of the recanalization of the artery. Since the LAD serves a great part of the front of the left ventrical it is often referred to as the \"widowmaker\" because when blocked the damage is often fatal. Your father may well have had his life saved or at least extended, and bypass surgery avoided, by this stenting procedure. To insert one stent when it doesn't span the length of the narrowing leaves no viable choice but to \"overlap\" (actually to slip a second through the first, which may overlap a tiny bit) in order to keep the artery patent and functioning. Your father's doctor did the only reasonable thing he could, given the circumstances. With a 90% blockage of the LAD only extensive stenting or open bypass could assure his survival. It is not only safe and effective, it was, as it turns out, probably lifesaving. This procedure is extremely common has a very high rate of success, assuming the patient applies the needed lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management and anti-cholesterol medication).   I hope this is reassuring to you. Please follow up with us here as needed. Good luck to you and to your father.\n\n",

During stretching I could feel a lot of pain through the inside of my arm, running from armpit to the ulna.  My doctor said that during this stretching I have torn part of the brachial vein. There was some red tracking visible aswell, following the same line.  I have rested to allow repair and now 8 days later the bruising is nearly all gone and the tracking completely gone.  The vein feels very tight and if I put my arm above my head I can feel it tighten to the extent that I could easily cause it to tear.  My right arm is as normal.  Why would this vein now be unusually tight?  Could it be a thrombosis?  Should I encourage vaso-dilation to try to regain elasticity or vaso-constriction to allow it to properly heal?  Any thoughts welcome Thanks\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Alcohol causing fast heart rate and rash",
    "content": "Hi there -- While alcohol does have depressant properties, the fact that it also causes visodilation (the blood vessels become larger while it's in your system), this causes a mild-to-moderate drop in blood pressure and a consequent increase in heart rate. Most people do have their heart rates increase during and after drinking. For the same reason (vasodilation) it also causes some people to have capillaries remain engorged after, especially after sleep. Both effects can last a while beyond the buzz period. A few people, those who binge drink or only drink a substantial amount once in a while, can develop an irregular heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation. While it's often called \"holiday heart\" it can be pretty annoying or unpleasnt feeling, but usually resolves, especially in young people, before it ever requires any sort of treatment.   All in all your responses to alcohol sound pretty normal. The fact you have a history of anxiety and panic disorder probably explains why you've even noticed this, since anxious people tend to be far more somatically aware (acutely tuned in to what their bodies are doing). This is a mixed blessing at best, since while you may notice something important you might otherwise have missed, most of the time you're going to wind up noticing things you don't really need to notice. This makes somatasization a losing proposition on balance, and something worth working to lose. Easier said than done, I realize.   Hope this is helpful.

However, the cardiologist is more concerned that the Left Internal Mammary Artery has a 95% blockage. The cardiologist is concerned that this might lead to a stroke and is consulting a neurologist because it is not his area of expertise.  We have to wait till sometime next week for the result of this consultation.   What is the Left Internal Mammary Artery and why is the cardiologist concerned that it could lead to a stroke and not a heart attack?  What is the implication if the LIMA is blocked or has insufficient flow?   We searched the internet and there is not much information about the implication of blockage in the LIMA.  The impression I get from the internet is that the LIMA supplies blood to the chest and is harvested for use to bypass blocked coronary arteries as an alternative to the vein from the leg. Does this mean that it is not something critical?  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -- The LiMA does supply the left upper chest/breast, has a decent bore to it considering how non-critical its purpose, and is often simply pulled over to help resupply an area of the heart instead of harvesting a vein. Its being blocked is fairly unremarkable, and since it's in the same plane as some of the coronary arteries it's unsurprising if some of them are narrowed that it would be as well. If it were to become totally occluded it might cause some chest pain due to claudication (crampting due to starving out of chest muscle tissue) but wouldn't be dangerous. How any any artery outside the brain being blocked could cause a stroke is a mystery to me. If it were a vein -- almost any vein -- it wouldn't be narrowed but could contain a clot, which could eventually lead to a stroke or pulmonary embolism, but the LiMA is an artery, and blocked arteries that don't service the brain itself (The one exception would be either carotid artery, as they are essentially the blood supply freeway to the brain, but are upstream from the LiMA). While its significant narrowing disqualifies it as a bypass option I can't see how it might contribute to a stroke unless an attempt were made to use it to bypass a narrowed LAD, which would be pointless anyway. It can't hurt to have someone else --most logically a vascular surgeon -- evaluate the potential harm of having the artery blocked, but it would seem there must be some sort of misunderstanding somewhere in the chain of this exam to need a neurologist involved simply because of the condition of the LiMA.   If you find out more, please share with us here. This is a puzzle for sure. We'd love to hear the outcome.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: How long does a CABG last in female age 20?",
    "content": "Hello -- While bypassing the artery where you descibe it (possibly the iliac artery or maybe one branch of the aorta just below where it divided into the two femoral arteries) is extremely unusual in a female aged 20 years, these arteries are generally quite large in bore, so the bypass might well last a very long time. If, in fact, this was not a true bypass but a repair of an aneurysm (an easy misunderstanding and something much more likely in a person of your fiancee's age) then the graft should last a lifetime and not produce any further problems. If,in fact, this was a bypass graft for sure, and the artery had become occluded by age 20, it is odd to find the blockage in that area first, but if this is the case then there may well be further blockages developing in the future. The risk for subsequent bypass in the great arteries (which is what this must have been) is fairly low, although the ultimate success of the procedure would be less likely with each repetition of the surgery.   I can't help but wonder if this wasn't in fact the removal of a diseased segment of a greater artery (probably due to aneurysm) than an actual bypass, since by age 20 it is almost unheard of to have developed that degree of intimal disease in such a large artery, let alone the smaller ones supplying the heart. This is why I am wondering if perhaps this was the actual reason for the surgery. Also, a graft only 1/2 inch long is difficult to imagine, while one 1/2 inch in diamter could reasonably be one of the greater arteries, iliac or perhaps even renal.  Perhaps you could find out and let us know? Again, if this was the case (as opposed to bypass) the artificial graft should remain patent a good long time and pose no particular future problems.   I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you.\n\n",

I am afraid to run and see what it gets to then...   I sit down most of the day, and over the past years most of the night too. I consider myself \"out of shape\" but I'm only 10 lbs overweight and have never been diagnosed with any kind of heart problem. I do cough several times a day, I assume from my stuffed up sinuses dripping into my lungs (bad allergies), but would not consider my lungs \"congested\". During my \"fitness test\" after i joined a gym, when my heart rate hit 170 within a minute or two, the fitness guy thought something was broken on his machine... but it was just me.  Should I be alarmed by this kind of heart rate with such little effort? Could it just be because my lungs have some mucus and therefor not as much oxegen is getting through? Should I see a specialist about this? Stop going to the gym?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -- Using the standard formula for exercising target heart rates (220 minus your age multiplied to 75-90%) you are reaching your maximum desireable rate of exercise with relatively low effort, which, assuming no heart disease is present, is unsrurprising for someone who has been extremely sedentary and is now starting to work on getting in shape. You are hitting right in that 75-90 per cent range (your maximum would be 191, and your range would be between 143 and 171 beats per minute). Again assuming no \"drag\" other than a formerly sedentary lifestyle, this is perfect for now, and over time you should find it takes longer and longer for you to reach this range. You don't want to push yourself above 171, even though in a medically supervised stress test we do shoot for the maximum. In the gym 90 % of that is quite adequate.   It sounds like you are right on target! Good luck with your program, and please stay in touch with us here.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi -- The maxiumum desireable heart rate during exercise can depend upon a lot of things, but the rule of thumb (which is overly simplistic) is to take the number 220, subtract one's age, which yields one's theoretic \"maximum\" rate, and then shoot for 75-90 per cent of that number. In your case,then, the rule-of-thumb \"maximum would be 157, and 90% of that would be 141 beats per minute, the upper end of your ideal training range. The goal is to stay within this range, but there is never anything that tells us how much effort you're using before you reach that level. Ideally, without symptoms, this is the top end of your goal, and the question is: Do you reach this goal with minimal or moderate exercise or do you hit this at close to peak effort? The dilemma is that if this occurs at low levels, once you are feeling quite fit, do you push beyond the theoretical limits? In fact, some people are able to do this and others are not, but it's generally not a good idea to ever push yourself beyond your maximum rate, and ideally you should be peaking at the rate you have achieved, so it sounds as though you are doing your workouts to absolute best effect. Congratulations! So long as there are no symptoms (shortness of breath, chest pain, etc.) at ths level, you should be able to continue to perform at this level. Good job!\n\n",

    "title": "racng heart while relaxing followed by headache, exhaustion",
    "content": "Hi,  I have a 16 year old daughter that since about 4 years old has \"episodes\" where her heart will just start to race.  This will last sometimes less than 2-3 minutes and sometimes up to 15 plus minutes.  And it is never while physcially active but always in a relaxed state.  She has learned to control most of them through relaxation methods.  After these episodes though, she has a headache, is light headed and nauseous, extremely tired and her left rib cage feels \"bruised\" after.  Even to push on it will make her wince. We have gone to cardiologist who have taken EKG's, echocardiograms, stress test, used various monitors, etc and say all is normal with the heart.  But these episodes, which range in severity, are enough will stop her in her tracks, double her over and bring tears at times.    The last episode of this nature was January of 2009.  Prior to this, she would have small episodes 3-4 times a month.  Since January though, she has found that the heart isn't racing now but there will be a tearing feeling on the left side of chest.  The frequency is about the same, the severity ranges about the same and the after effects are the same.  Such an episode but her into emergency a few days ago but again the fact that these episodes are not prolonged, no medical equipment could get a read out.  The pain was enough though for her to leave her friends and agree to go to the hospital.    Are there any suggestions as to what this is or where maybe to seek more medical help.  The Cariologist are now saying that is more muscular but my question to them is how would muscles spasms/etc, cause such after effects.  My daughter is hypermobile and they feel that this may have something to do with the ligaments not stretching/relaxing possibly but I don't agree. She has also been tested for Marfan Syndrome and this has been ruled out.  If anyone can help I would sure appreciate it.  I would like to see my child have a normal life.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: racng heart while relaxing followed by headache, exhaustion",
    "content": "Hi there -- First, I believe this is likely a relatively benign condition, probably supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) caused by an atroventricular nodal re-entry tract (AVNRT), a trivial abnormality of the AV node that is the most common cause of SVT in the healthy population. The episodes of SVT can be very abrupt and they also end abruptly. This is the age when it usually become more of a problem and it has become disruptive, so needs to be managed. Some people -- admittedly it's fairly rare -- do complain of fatigue, muscle soreness and other odd symptoms after an episode of SVT. The reasons for this are numerous and often blurry. The problem itself,while not life-threatening, is often quite disruptive and makes things uncertain as the events can take place randomly.   This is if I'm right in my belief. I haven't seen an EKG picture of the arrhythmia, but apparently neither has anyone else. It's been disruptive enough to warrant an electrophysiological (EP) study and there are cardiologists who specialize solely in arrhythmias like this. The study is a one-day in-and-out procedure and if the focus of the arrhythmia can be found during the study and ablation can be peformed right then, via radio frequencies (RF ablation) and the patient usually still goes home the same day.   The hypermobility is seen often in a certain subset of people who do not have Marfan syndrome, and I am very happy to hear this has been ruled out. There is also the potential for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, which is a different connective tissue disease with one subtype marked by hypermobility, and is not as easy to diagnose as Marfan's, but also isn't marked by arrythmias such as your daughter is having. However, in both syndromes, a \"tearing\" sensation is classic for certain serious issues. I am assuming your daughter has had a comprehensive echocardiographic study of the structures of her heart and any problems of that nature have been ruled out. If not, this should also be done.  It really does sound like a hypermobile female with AVNRT and equivocal MVP, all of which is very common and not life-threatening, but one needs to be certain. Since SVT from AVNRT occurs at random it is often difficult to diagnose in the clinical setting. From personal experience I would recommend two things, then: first, if this occurs again any times soon, have your daughter sit quietly and do nothing to try and abort the episode. Dial 9-1-1 and try to get a paramedic unit to her location simply for the purpose of trying to capture the arrhythmia in the field, since it will often convert before arrival at the ED. If it can be caught in this way (I've had personal success with this method after experiences similar to your own), it's easier to relax and it provides something to work with. The other thing -- and maybe more practical -- would be to have your daughter referred to an EP specialist who may well order the EP study done without any evidence on paper. This has gone on long enough and I know how disruptive and upsetting it can be. While it's likely totally benign it is lifestyle threatening and no one should be told \"it's nothing\" when it's as disruptive as this is. The other, more unusual symptoms also should be explored for the record.   At bottom I still strongly suspect this is simple AVNRT, but that makes it no less a medical issue needing management. If this is what it is there's a very good chance it can be eliminated for good. There's no reason your daughter should be denied this opportunity.   I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you and to your daughter. Please follow up with us here as needed and keep us updated as well.\n\n",

    "content": "I lost my stepfather a little over a year ago. My mother, as well as the rest of my family are still very confused as to the treatment he received while in intensive care for 4 weeks. I can give you details if needed but did not want to begin with more info than necessary. The autopsy performed ruled his death from hypertension. He was 66 years old,took care of his body,took his blood pressure every day, and usually put the neighborhood teens to shame playing basketball. He looked 50. About a month before collapsing and being rushed to hospital he had fallen of the roof,knocked the wind out of himself, but was \"fine\", although did complain of a headache off and on. After many days of testing and several exploratory procedures, the neurologist found a pseudo-aneurysm the size of a golfball by that time. He underwent a treatment called Triple H prior to finding the source of bleeding. This treatment lasted about a week. He developed hydrocephalus and was retaining all these fluids and swelled up like a balloon. We thought we pulled the ventilator because he had a final stroke that did unrepairable  damage to his brain stem...a complication of the aneurysm caused by trauma like the surgeon said. We expected to see this on the coroners report but instead see that he died from hypertension. Could the Triple H have made it appear that he had died of hypertension? He did not have high blood pressure prior to this incident. The coroner did not mention any other causes of death. We are very hurt and confused that maybe he would have pulled through this if it was hypertension.                                     Thank you for your time, inneedofanswers\n\n",

    "title": "Re: negative effects of Triple H treatment on cardiovascular sys",
    "content": "Hello -- It seems once again someone has been the victim of a cavalierly-written coroner's report. Unfortunately these are frequently written,where no foul play is suspected, in overly simplified ways that do not in the least explain the terminal event. For instance, no one dies directly of hypertension, but of something secondary to it, such as a cerebral (or other vascular) hemorhage or congestive heart failure. In this instance the mechanism seems fairly plain from the ongoing medical record, but the coroner made it as short and simple as possible. Often the cause of death in a non suspicious event is written off as due to \"heart failure\" or \"cardiac arrest.\" Well in fact about 99 per cent of all deaths are ultimately due to \"cardiac arrest.\" How it came to happen is the question. In the chain of events leading to shutdown of any organism, there are preceding events. However,in the case of your stepfather there doesn't even seem to be any substantial reason to cite \"hypertension\" as cause, except to vary the routine. This is a cold assessment, but it's also what happens on a daily basis. Your stepfather may or may not have suffered some degree of hypertension during the course of the development of the aneurysm, but even where it is a factor it is rarely the lone culprit,since many people have hypertension but relatively few develop an aneurysm because of it, and fewer subsequently suffer a subarachnoid hemorrhage, although the majorit of people who do have such an event are around age 70, not counting those who may have had a pre-existing aneurysm which may, as with your stepfather, have had it made worse by trauma (and the fall has to be at least suspect). Also, of those who develop subarachnoid hemorrhage due to an aneurysm, very few have what is considered a \"giant\" one --and golfball-size qualifies as \"giant.\" This is a very serious, very difficult situation to stabilize, and any upward variation in blood pressure could trigger a fatal bleed or rupture. This doesn't mean the subject would have died \"from\" hypertension, but coroners often are not interested in what they consider relatively \"natural\" causes, and are prone to put down almost anything that will simplify the conclusion, giving them more time to devote to foul play cases where they actually have to do some serious medical detective work.   In short, I would take the doctors' reports and the ongoing medical record up to the time your stepfather actually expired as the reasonable and logical cause, and the coroner's report to be somewhat cavalierly written and not especially useful. I think it is safe to assume there was no foul play involved, but this is often the way these cases end up. The fall is highly suspect and so is the likelihood of a pre-existing subarachnoid aneurysm which may or may not have become a giant aneurysm due to the fall. Whether the coroner's report is correct insofar as it goes is pretty much moot. Chances are even the aneurysm would have begun to leak anyway, with or without the presence of hypertension. It seems the patient in this instance was one of the unfortunate few who develop this defect, which is very rare prior to the average age of 70, at which point it becomes five times more likely regardless of other contributing issues such as head trauma or chronic hypertension.  I hope this helps clarify the issue for you somewhat, and I am extremely sorry for your loss. It may be helpful to look at this as a small statistical probability and accept the doctors' finding as the logical sequence of events. The triple-H procedure is very commonly employed and has a fair record of success with very little known contribution to morbidity or mortality, although there have been no formal studies done to prove or disprove this. The reason for lack of studies of the relative saftety is that it is often a last-resort procedure which saves some lives and not others, in a cohort of patients all of which would otherwise have likely died due to the hemorrhage.  Again, I hope this is helpful in coming to terms with this tragic event. In this case the coroner's report is just not very informative.   My best to you and the rest of the family. Please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -- There are several options right off the bat, and it really doesn't sound cardiac related at all. Since it is present when you wake up it may well be musculoskeletal, and may even be costochondritis, since when we lie flat and relatively still our ribcage will sometimes stiffen up where the connective tissue (cartilege) is, between the ribs. This can sometimes feel like a weight in the morning (called morning stiffness) and is often due to inflamation that can be managed with over the counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) like ibuprofin (Advil) or naproxyn (Aleve). One of these would be worth a trial to see if it helps.   The symptom is also often seen in anxious people for some reason, perhaps because of muscle tensing in the area and the belief the heart is located there (which it's not, it's located mostly beneath the breast bone). You've had heart problems ruled out by a really good-looking EKG and you tolerate aerobic exercise well, so my suspicion is either costochondritis (also known sometimes as Tietz's syndrome), anxiety, or a muscle that's being chronically overused. First try taking a single dose of one of the NSAIDs before bedtime (with nonfat milk or a light snack, to prevent stomach irritation) and see if that doesn't help keep this from happening. Also test yourself to see if by twisting your upper body in various directions you can reproduce the discomfort. If so it is definitely musculoskeletal and sometimes stretching exercises will help this as well.  Good luck to you and pleas follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

That is a very big accomplishment and I wish the very best for you!  Please keep it up.    Now, the best things you can do are the very things anyone else does for their heart.  (please ask your doctor though because I am not aware of your full medical history).  Assuming you are in good shape in general.... I would suggest some aerobic type exercise on a daily basis.  Such as walking even if you are unable to jog or run.  Just walking and increasing the distance over time as you get use to it.  Also the diet.  The diet is a big thing.  Cut out as much of the fatty foods as you can and eat a more lean diet.  Grilled and baked meats, no fried vegetables, and just in general cut back on the fat intake.  (don't really have to give up all the fun food, but cut back on it alot if you are use to eating lots of fried and high fat foods). Also be sure to drink plenty of water daily.  Just as recommended for everyone unless of course there is a medical reason why you must restrict fluids.  Ask the doc if you have any other known health problems.  Kidneys?  Liver?  All that ok? You could consider taking some vitamins and supplements.  The Omega 3 fatty acides are suppose to be good for the heart.  You can find those supplements even in walmart.   Just good Luck to you!

    "title": "Is the use of creatine safe for the heart?",
    "content": "I have recently started following a strict diet, and am currently working to reduce my % body fat. When I get to a certain point, I would like to start \"bulking\", adding lean mass while minimizing fat gains. Creatine is widely used and is recommended by virtually everyone I have spoken with.   I have heard that as long as one gets adequate hydration, that supplementation with 5 grams of creatine per day is safe and effective. But I also have heard that creatine increases both voluntary and involuntary muscle size, and can increase the size of the heart. I have researched this online, and have found a few references to reports of heart/aorta enlargement, but have not heard complaints from people I have spoken to directly or indirectly.   Do you believe that creatine is safe to use, and do you believe that it is likely to increase the size of the heart over time? Thank you.\n\n",

    "title": "Numbness, chest pain, dizziness",
    "content": "I am a 22 year old female. I just gave birth vaginally to a healthy baby girl in May (with epidural). I had a healty pregnancy, except that I went from 130 to 187lbs. I never exercised, but I did work up until 34 weeks which required me to walk. After my daughter was born, I relaxed a lot, pretty much sedentary lifestyle except for taking care of baby. I barely ate 1 meal a day, and drank very little for about 3 months (I became constipated and urinated maybe a little once a day). I am currently 148 lbs. About a month after giving birth, I had a cold burning sensation at the site of the epidural injection that lasted a couple of weeks. I went to my doctor and he told me not to worry about it. One month ago, I had a friend over with whom I smoked a cigarette with (not good in so many ways; I have asthma and I breastfeed). I felt a little congested the next day.  After falling asleep while breastfeeding my daughter, I awoke feeling not myself, and a bit off. I decided to take a bath, and when I got into the water, I noticed that my legs and arms felt weak, and slightly numb. I also felt numbness on the right side of my face. I called an ambulance, for fear that I might be having a stroke. They tested my blood sugar (92), and ran numerous tests at the ER. Everything came back normal, because the doctor told me I was having anxiety, and to go to my Physician for follow up. Well, we we're a day away from moving from FL to Co, and that was impossible at the time. Well, the symptoms persisted, and we didn't get much further than Georgia before my next visit to the ER. I went in because after waking up, I felt the weakness in my arms and legs, but this time I felt like my skin was really hot, and I was having body spasms every 15 seconds or so. I felt dizzy, and sick to my stomach. They checked my blood pressure while standing, sitting up, and then lying down. The nurse said that my blood pressure went up 30 points, and that I was hypostatic (if I remember correctly). They took several vials of blood, not sure what they tested for, except for the fact that they said my electrolytes were normal, and everything was normal. They gave me 3 liters of fluids, made me eat a meal, and sent me on my way with a diagnosis of dehydration. Thank goodness we made it to Co. and when we got there, I still felt like junk, and continued with the dizziness, infrequent numbness, except it was on the left side of face, and general fatigue.  I was at my sisters house, when I had a wave of heat pass through my body, and I suddenly felt like I was going to pass out (this lasted about 1 1/2 hours). That morning, I recall feeling some numbness in my mouth along my gums on the top. I had to sit down because I felt awful, and shaky. The ground actually felt like it moved under my feet. I made an appointment to see a doctor the next day, and that doctor did a C-reactive protein test, CBC, and other tests to rule out more serious problems. All came back normal. He diagnosed me with anxiety/panic disorder and gave me a script for zoloft (still haven't taken it yet). I was okay with that diagnosis, and for a week I felt pretty good, until the following saturday I was side swiped by another event where I felt dizzy, and like I was going to pass out after waking up from sleep. This time my left hand felt numb. This episode lasted 30 minutes, and I had to lay down. When I went to follow up, I ended up seeing a new doctor and after telling him my symptoms, he decided to do some further testing. He wrote me a script for a Holter test (scheduled tomorrow), glucose test. He wants to check for Mitral Valve Prolapse. I had a EKG, which was normal. And a MRI of my head, to check for MS because I also had an event where my forehead felt numb, and also my tongue and diffucutly swallowing. MRI: normal. I have been having chest pain in the center where my sternum is, and into my back sometimes into my shoulder on my right side, with dizziness, shortness of breath, weakness, slight confusion. This lasts anywhere from 1 to 24 hours. It hits me when I am not nervous, and pretty much requires me to lay down. I don't feel depressed, and I have been through a lot, but I don't feel anxious other than when I am feeling these symptoms. I have been eating better, drinking more fluids. We also took a 3 hour walk in the mountains. I had to pace myself, but I felt okay until the next day.  My question is, could this in any way be related to my epidural that I had? I worry that the numbness and breathing problems are from the injection. Does this sound like heart/lung disease? Could I have brought this on myself because of my extremely poor diet, and 20 lbs weight loss in such a short amount of time? I had an auto accident that left me with some pretty bad whiplash, and I had chiro treatments for; could something in my neck be causing these symptoms?  Does this sound like anxiety disorder/postpartum with the constant chest pain, dizziness? Should I just stop thinking that this chest pain is something worse, and just take the Zoloft? I just don't know what to think if these tests keep coming back normal. I feel terrible most of the time. I've had a panic attack before, and this feels different.  Is it safe to take zoloft even though I am breastfeeding my daughter? Any advise will be much appreciated.  Thank you so much for your time, A scared first time mom, LadyMars\n\n",

Formula is a great substitute for breast milk it is only missing your active immunity which was passed via placenta and colostrum in the first 48 hours of feeding, it just means you wont carry on passing on your immunity. Giving up breast feeding was very hard for me but im glad i did as im fit and well and have just had my second child. But discuss it further with your health visitor or midwife. Hope this helps\n\n",

I was prescribed 80mg of Propranolol and my BP tends to be around 124/83 in the mornings and about 136/90 in the evening.    Over the last couple months I noticed that if I engage in a deep conversation (no stressful talk), I tend to feel tension behind my neck and what seems like an elevated pulse.  This is only while talking and not being active.  I asked my Dr what he thought and he seemed to think it was related to adrenaline and wasn't necesarily concerned.  I do tend to deal with anxiety at times over what my actual blood pressure is, but during these conversations, seems like my mind is only on what I'm talking about.  Seems kind of odd that my pulse would shoot up just from having a deep converstation. Do you see any concerns regarding this and any ideas to curb this would be very helpful.  Thanks\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Heart Rate and Adrenaline",
    "content": "Hi there --  What you're describing is actually a very common and fairly normal phenomenon. Most people, during a concentrated activity, will experience some physical stress which can translate into a mild elevation in vital signs (heart rate, respirations and blood pressure). Since you already tend a little toward the higher end of the BP scale, it is unsurprising this would take it up a notch. There is also the \"hot reactor\" phenomenon, wherein certain people, during stressful activities (and again, a \"deep\" conversation can be stressful even though it doesn't seem distressing), experience marked elevation of BP. There is a rather uncomfortable test to identify these people, and it isn't normally done, except in clincal studies, where it's been found that doing something non-stressful with one arm submerged in painfully cold ice water will cause the blood pressure of certain select individuals to really spike. You are probably one of these. Best approach therapeutically is to attempt to manage the stress factors in your life, first by recognizing them. You've taken a step toward that in noting the BP elevation during spirited converstations. This is not a negative, and your BP probably normalizes very quickly, but there is a need to keep it within healthy bounds at all times,  so if this problem becomes significant in terms of BP (but not heart rate as a rule, that is perfectly normal) you might eventually slip into a range that warrants medical treatment. The fact that you are aware of tension in the posterior neck and the increased heartrate is interesting, and probably suggests a slight anxiety problem as well. Next time you hav this happen,  try to create an opportunity to just take your pulse for 15 seconds, multiply by four, and see what number you get. If the rate is less than 100 per minute (25 in 15 seconds x4) you're perfectly normal rate-wise for the activity. You may become tense during deep conversation for various reasons, but it's not necessarily a cause for concern. It's got your attention, so you can take  the opportunity to look at it clinically. Your doctor is correct, this is a function of adrenaline, which is one of the major stress hormones. Without it you wouldn't be able to remain competitive in deep conversation, believe it or not! Too much is not helpful, but that is often the result of either deep engagement or mild anxiety.   I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck and please feel free to follow  up with us here with any additonal questions or concerns.\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for your earlier reply.  Since then, my pulse has been normal after my doctor pointed out that it was probably related to constant anxiety.  I learned how to deal with this issue and afterward found my pulse consistently between 65 and 75.    About 3 weeks ago my doctor recommended I switch from Propranolol (80mg) to 25mg of Hydrochlorot because of improving blood pressure.  I weened off the propranolol for about a week and felt fine except the fact that my pulse was somewhat elevated.  He did inform me that Propranolol generally lowered pulse rates and that Hydrochlorot did not.  My pulse is now consistently between 80 and 95, even when I am feeling calm.  This seems a little high to have that kind of  pulse when I am calm.  Is this normal?   Reading from other posts, some mentioned that the your pulse can shoot up after discontinuing beta-blockers because your body is adjusting but should bring your pulse back down within time.  Is that accurate or should I ask to go back on Propranolol?  Thanks for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "During beta blocker use the body will develop new beta receptors (attempting to compensate for beta blockade), so that when the drug is discontinued the heart rate does usually do a \"rebound,\" which can take some time to fully nornalize from. This is normal, and the rate range you mention is within normal limits anyway, although a little higher than what you've become used to. No harm in it, though. The hydrochlorot or HCTZ should help control the BP well without the annoyance of future rebound effect if the drug is exchanged for another. It sounds like you're adapting well. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Shortness of breath right after falling asleep.",
    "content": "Hello --  Your problem sounds like it could be one of two or three things: sleep apnea, although this does recur frequently throughout the night so is less likely; sleep paralysis, an odd sleep disturbance which involves waking and being unable to move momentarily, often associated with a sensation of being unable to breathe briefly, which then goes away once the sufferer wakes up, and usually doesn't recur again during the same night; or nocturnal panic attacks, which can take place randomly, and usually are associated with transient stressful life situations.   There are other possibilities, but given the peculiar timing of your episodes I suspect it to be one of the above and probably not sleep apnea. If it persists you should have a general phsyical with special attention to possible causes of this, and perhaps even a sleep study. You also could have nocturnal asthma associated with reflux of stomach contents, which also should be ruled out during an exam for this problem.   If the problem were happening throughout the night there might be more concern regarding cardiac causes, but since it seems to resolve after the first waking each time, I really suspect a psychogenic cause. Best to have this checked anyway, though, as this could affect your ability to get restful sleep.   Hope this is helpful. Good luck to you and please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

It is a shooting or piercing pain that only lasts about one second, but sometimes there are multiple pierces in a row and sometimes they are accompanied by a spasm feeling just under my left breastbone.  They are not extremely painful, but they are very unsettling.  I have had them in the past, but they had not been as frequent or as painful.  Sometimes there is a dull aching pain after the pierces as well.

    "title": "Re: Piercing Pain and Spasms in Chest",
    "content": "Hi there --  This is a common cause of concern, but I think I can set your mind at ease about it: First, classic heart pain is almost never sharp, \"piercing\" or spasmodic. It is rarely fleeting, and is almost never felt on the left side of the chest (where the heart is assumed to be located) but rather is generally described as a deep, burning ache or squeezing sensation under the breastbone that lasts more than five minutes, is usually accompanied by other symptoms such as nausea, weakness, shortness of breath, etc., and almost always radiates to one or both shoulders and arms, as well as sometimes the throat or jaw, upper abdomen and sometimes through to the center of the upper back. What you describe is not remotely classic cardiac pain, although it is often reported in patients with a benign condition called mitral valve prolapse (MVP). However, it is most commonly associated with chest wall spasm or inflammation of cartilege between the ribs where they connect to the breastbone. This is a very benign but sometimes annoying problem and usually can be reproduced by twisting of the upper body, deep breathing, or pressing on the location manually. It responds well to over-the-counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofin (Advil) and naproxyn (Aleve). What you  describe is almost certainly not heart related. It may have been caused by any sort of upper body strain such as heavy lifting. Usually it resolves on its own, but may require NSAID treatment as mentioned above.   Hope this is helpful. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a little worried I'm hoping it's all for nothing, about a year ago I got this weird muscle spasm coming from my heart area. I'm only 19, I was 17 at the time so i honestly did not pay too much attention to it for it only happened about once every 2 or 3 months. It hasn't happened for about a year now and 2 weeks ago it happened again. Only this time instead of once every 2 or 3 months it happened once every 20 seconds. There's no pain involved no discomfort its just a weird feeling. when it happens it only lasts about a second and I'm not out of breathe or anything but if i look down at my chest i can see it moving as these spasms occur, I know this isn't normal. Ive gone to the doctor and they've taken tests, x rays, and EKG.. I just want others opinions what might this be? Ive had asthma until I was 12 other than that no other serious illness. I currently have high blood pressure for unknown reasons. I was born at 10 pounds my mother was diagnosed with gestational diabetes, yet they never told her until after I was born. When I was born my heart was racing and i was placed in an incubator. Til this day my heart still races at times, random times when I'm not doing anything, even faster when I'm involved in any sort of physical activity I hope this helps and hopefully someone has an answer for me or at least an idea..\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Coronary artery spasm?",
    "content": "First, coronary artery spasm is excruciatingly painful as a rule, moreso even than usual pain due to heart disease. It also lasts, as a rule, for 15-20 minutes and can make you stop whatever you're doing.  Second,  it's not visible. What you describe sounds very much like what's called fasiculation, a spasmodic twitching of a voluntary muscle. These often occur in the muscles of the chest and abdomen, the eyelid, and the thigh. I have no idea why these areas seem more prone to this, but it's a relatively normal, very common complaint and usually means nothing.   If you're ever concerned this might be happening due to a rapid or irregular heartbeat (most people would feel that from the inside, but some do not), simply place your hand gently over the area that's twitching while simultaneously feeling your pulse in your neck or temple. If the heartbeat is regular and reasonable of rate (between 60-100) and the twitching isn't in synch with the heartbeat, then that's not what's causing it. I''m quite sure it's not anyway, but this is one thing you can do to separate the sensation from your heart, as it is most likely fasiculation of a small area of chest muscle.  I hope this helps address your concern. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "For babbs1st: While you and the earlier poster may both be having voluntary muscle fasiculation, what you describe (you specifically mention your heart and the \"jolt\" sensation) sounds a little more like premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), which are really common and relatively normal, but can be extremely unpleasant sensations, and which often are related to caffeine intake, stress, fatigue, digestion, etc. They are normal and harmless but can really feel scary at times til they become frequent enough that one becomes used to them.   Hope this is helpful. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Low Blood Pressure when changing positions",
    "content": "I am a 23 year old women.  On my 21st birthday I had the flu and possible strep throat.  The months that followed included me constantly feeling sick (very fatigue) and having anywhere from about 4 to 25 blackouts a day, lasting up to 10 seconds, but not causing me to completely faint.    Since then, I have gone to numerous doctors, each giving lots of different tests and they still have not found a true cause for this problem.  Two different tilt table tests have determined that my blood pressure drops dramaticly (103/64 to about 60/40) when I change positions and my heartrate speeds up and then drops very low (from 94 up to 150 and down to 60).  My life is no longer like that of normal girls in thier tweenties.  I have to be careful standing up, I have little energy and sometimes have days where I can hardly get out of bed, and I have other strange side effects.  I do want to mention that I am not depressed, and my fatigue is not related to my mood.    But, to fill you in on some of my other symptoms, my heart will race (pound) for no apparent reason (I could be laying down), I don't sleep well, I sometimes have uncontrolable shaky hands, commonly have a low grade fever, occasional problems swallowing and sore throat, occasional hot flashes, usually at night, extreme sweating, and problems with noise, light, and touch (could be related to migraines, but happens more often, with out the pain of the headache.)  The doctors have put me on Beta blockers, but I had breathing problems, steriods which made no difference, and proamatine (midodrine) which caused TOO many side effects.  I have tried support stockings, drinking lots of water, and increasing my salt intake, with no luck.  They have checked me for seizures, different diseases, inner ear problems, etc.  They don't know what the cause is.    If it were just the blackouts, I could live, but all of the other problems make it very hard for me to live a normal life.  Please, if you have any suggestions as to what the cause of this may be, I would greatly appreciate a response.  I personally wonder if all of this is caused by chronic fatigue syndrome, but I understand that this is still not considered a disease by many doctors, and I have heard from some that low blood presure is not a side effect of chronic fatigue( others say differently.)  Thank you for your help,  Casey\n\n",

    "content": "Since the association between PFO and neurological problems is poorly understood, it would be difficult to know with any certainty whether the increase in symptoms in both areas is directly related or not. There is a certain logic in that notion however, assuming the statistical relationship is sound. If things are intensifying in both areas you probably need to be re-evaluated for the PFO and also to see a neurologist, since one is not generally treated by treating the other. The chest symptoms are a concern as are the neurological ones. If your PFO were to warrant surgical closure and this were to be followed by an improvement in seizures and headaches, this would not only be a great deal for you but would add to the meager evidence of a direct connection. If not, at least one part of the problem would be resolved.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  What you describe could be something as innocent as gastroesophageal refulx disease (GERD), but because of the classic description and the length of time it lasted, plus the rather sudden onset and the subsequent residual pain, I think it would be very wise for you to have any heart problem ruled out. While your cholesterol is in the good range, that's no guarantee that you cannot have heart disease anyway. It's unlikely, but I'd much rather eliminate the serious stuff first, then work down to the more likely innocuous things. FIrst things first.   With that in mind, I hope you will either make an appointent with your doctor right away, or if that's not practical, then, if the symptoms  continue, to visit a local ER and explain what happened and what's going on now. Also bear in mind that young, otherwise healthy women quite  often have serious heart  problems overlooked by doctors because women tend to develop heart disease later in life (statistically). In fact, anyone with symptoms -- or without them  -- is a possible candidate for hidden heart disease.   I hope this is helpful to you. Please keep us updated and if this turns out to be a big nothing, that'll be just great. If not, though,  you really need to know early on in order to manage it properly.\n\n",

    "content": "For Staycee --  First, congratulations on the new addition!   The accelerated heart rate is very common post partum. Metaprolol is a very good med for this and should be effective til this resolves. The sensation in your throat you describe sounds like regurgitation without high acid content, something very similar to GERD, really exactly the same but without heartburn (be glad!). This is often due to an over-relaxed lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and is commonly seen during pregnancy, so might have been developing and now you're noticing it more. There are some meds for GERD that help strengthen that LES so if this keeps up or becomes more annoying or painful you might ask for one of the many good meds for that as well. For now, though, it seems likely it's pregnancy-related and may correct on its own.   Hope this helps. Good luck to you and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Racing and thudding heart after alcohol",
    "content": "Hello --  This is not a really unusual complain, strong palpitations after a bout of serious drinking. While it is sometimes just what it seems, simple pounding due to the body's reaction and especially lots of dilated blood vessels, which makes everything feel a little strange (alcohol does do this while in the blood, makes vessels dilate), it also sometimes is a rather unpleasant variation called atrial fibrillation, which is even more unpleasant feeling and can, potentially, cause indirect problems that can be rather serious. We see a huge increase in complaints about this around the holidays in the US, because a lot of people drink more than they have all year with this result.   If this only happens after a bout of drinking you're probably okay, and should consider just cutting down on the volume of alcohol and  the duration, perhaps by learning to nurse a drink, make it last longer. If it's beer this is more difficult than mixed drinks or hard liquor, and so with beer one simply has to put a fixed limit on it and stick to it as a rule. At any rate, this is almost certainly directly related to the drinking and, while it won't cause a heart attack, but it can certainly cause palpitations, arrhythmias and, over time, weaken the heart muscle if the drinking is really heavy-duty, so this is all stuff to consider. Also, drinking isn't necessary to life, and while I'm not suggesting you just stop altogether (unless you discover you have a problem), you could if you had to and it wouldn't kill you. So metering it a little in order to respect this little shout out from your heart definitely is doable. Try it and see what happens. And of course, if this starts to happen when you've not been drinking, come back and we'll talk further, as there would then be something more going on. I don't see that, though. I think this is classic. Just cut your heart a little slack and things should be okay.  Good luck to you. Please follow up with  us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "I have growing concern my 3yr old son may have kawasaki disease. He has high temperatures for 6 days straight ranging from 38.5-40degrees. in the past 6 days he has vomitted twice (but not since Saturday) Nurofen and panadol take his temp down somewhat and as it starts to wear off it spikes back up again. We have been to a medical centre on day 2 and told it was viral. We end up taking him to hospital on day 3 and again told it was viral (only spent 3hrs there and he perked up again) we have taken him to our local gp twice on day 4 & 5. I was told he now has a throat infection and given anti B's. When his temp is up his eyes are red are glassy, he is extremly lethargic. when he comes down from his temp he gets the shivers and his hands and feet go blue. He has had a urine sample which was clear and no protein etc.  He has rarely eaten anything in the past week. Tonight i noticed some peeling on his big toe, not much but knowing this is one of the symptoms my concerns grew. He hasnt got a rash but tonight noticed a couple of small spots on his trunk. Tonight his lips also looked a little reder. he will not let me look into his mouth or poke out his tounge but he has had bad breath and doing a funny thing with his tounge and liking his bottom lip a lot.He is keeping up his fluids but not urinating very much at all (gone 9hrs between toilets a few times now)  Tomorrow morning we are getting a blood test but then have to wait a further day for results. I appreciate any extra advise you can give to me, my other conern was if he could have phuemonia, its just doesnt seem like a simple 48hr bug or viral infection  something tells me things aren't right, he has had this consistant temperature for too long and panadol only subsides it for a few hours then he goes downhill again. How many times do i need to take him to the gp or hospital and keep being sent home and see him going down hill again. (he was born prematurily at 33wks so i do not know if this has any added risks)\n\n",

    "title": "Re: possible Kawasaki disease?",
    "content": "Hello --  While there is no definitive test for diagnosis of Kawasaki disease, there are certain tests which, in relation with very careful evaluation of symptoms and signs, the disease is diagnosed by default. Meanwhile, if four or more of the classic symptoms  are present and treatment can begin within at least 10 days of the onset, the disease has a very good outcome and cure rate. If it goes untreated for much longer, the potential for serious complications starts to mount,  so very often the child will be treated pre-emptively, which is the best approach. This is what you may expect, then, since you will still be within the window of opportunity for a total cure.   The symptoms  your child  exhibits are very suspicious of Kawasaki, and if I were you I would be very aggressive in seeking pre-emptive treatment just to be safe. I can't really suggest anything  else, since you already have all the facts and the diagnosis-by-default is likely unless another viral disease can be positively identified. I doubt this will be the case.  Good luck to you and please keep us updated as to the progress with this.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there --  I see from your history you'd developed complete (3rd degree) heart block, so the pacer is to overcome this and  keep you beating at a good normal rate. While  alcohol in moderation is probably okay, alcohol can have several negative effects on hearts with pre-existing problems. Can sometimes cause atrial fibrillation and can weaken the muscle as well. However, this would usually apply to a structurally diseased heart, and you would appear only to have an electrical problem. It would be most wise to ask your doctor about this, since he knows the specific history that led to the pacer implantation. My guess is occasional, moderate alcohol would be okay, but please check for specifics. As to the roller coaster question, like a lot of electromechanical things, this may or may not be a problem. Most of these carry some sort of warning on site, but depends upon the state where you're located. Again, you might run this past the cardiologist just to have some idea as this applies to you in  particular. Many people are able to do pretty much whatever they want, just need to avoid certain devices or keep them on the side of the body opposite the pacer (things such as iPods, cell  phones,  etc. fall into this area). I wish I could give you a better answer, but your doctor really has an obligation to give you a little background into what you should and should  not avoid, depending upon your specific history. I'd be aggressive in getting these answers.   Hope  this is helfpul. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "For the past year I have been suffering constent bouts of palpatations and tachycardia, along with high blood pressure and tiredness.  After alerting my doctor I was referred to  a cardiologist who put me forward for an echo and holter monitor. Since then the results of my echo have come back as being fine however while wearing the holter monitor my heart rate was was reaching speeds of 175bpm while resting, which isn't normal for a young, relatively healthy 19 year old. At the time the cardiologist asked me to monitor these bouts myself and informed me he would be in touch. Since then my doctor has also asked me to regularly check my bp which usually sits around 170/110, which I believe is also quite high.  This week I recieved a letter from the cardiologist asking me to undertake a 72 hour urine collection as he believes my body may be producing too much adrenaline.. this is where I require your help.  I believe this condition is usually stress/anxiety related, however I am neither. Do u know of any other cause for the body to do this and is there any treatment/surgery to correct it.  Many thanks.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Producing too much Adrenaline?",
    "content": "Hi there--  Your doctor is definitely on the right track, since you don't appear to be an anxious person, even in the midst of a lot of symptoms that would cause anxiety in many people. And the way to determine this is via a 24 hour urine test, which will hopefully show if you are producing excess adrenaline, usually due to a condition called pheochromocytoma. This is most often caused by one or more adrenal tumors, which can be on the adrenal glands or can exist independently in other parts of the body internally and are often difficult to visualize via the usual ways. These tumors can be malignant but are usually benign, and what they cause is what you're describing, not only rapid heart rate but spiking blood pressures, both even present at rest. The treatment for pheochromcytoma is usually removal or destruction of the tumors, which produce adrenaline just as the native adrenal glands do,  which is how the levels get high enough to cause this sort of response by the body. and interrupting the functoning of the tumors, if they are present, is the way to get things back to normal. In the meantime this is sometimes treated medically with drugs, especially beta blockers, which work by blocking the body's uptake of adrenaline. If your 24 hour urine test is positive, you'll have your answer.   There are other possible disorders that can cause this, but they are more rare and would come further down the chain of exploration if this doesn't pan out. I really don't believe this sounds like classic anxiety to me at all, so it would actually be a very good thing if the test shows you to have pheochromocytoma, which can usually be managed, controlled or eliminated.   I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck, and please update us as to the outcome of your test.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  While looking through your daughter's history I note bicuspid aortic valve and patent foramen ovale. POTS is a likely culprit in this case,  or perhaps the very similar neurocardiogenic syncope syndrome, both of which are often  seen in patients with this combination of relatively trivial defects. In general these patients tend to do very well, although they do have to be evaluated periodically (annually in adulthood, sometimes semi-annually, but sometimes more often in childhood, just to track the evolution, if any,  of the defects.  Usually nothing new shows up). Children your daughter's age tend to \"run hot\" anyway,  and will have faster heart rates at most any level of activity, but of course your daughter's is a level above normal, which can cause fatigue. If she's been  worked up for cardiac arrhythmias (not more common in these patients than in the general population), and  found free of these, then she probably can do as much as she's able to do and feels good doing, and should let her body be her guide. If she's tired she should rest. Some people with this combination of defects wind up being quite accomplished athletes, while others wind up slightly aesthenic and tire easily. There's no particular rhyme or reason to this. I've seen one of each in a pair of siblings, even. Both are otherwise quite healthy adults now.   I hope this is  helpful to you, and I hope you can find some middle ground for your concern,  which is really difficult -- I understand this. I don't think  extreme concern is warranted, but of course you should keep an eye out for any changes is the regular  pattern.  This makes it difficult to feel calm while watchful, but both  you and your daughter will benefit because she will pick up on your anxiety, and that will just creat a cycle where both  of you become unduly anxious. Best to just be watchful like the good parent you are, but there's no special reason to expect anything crucial to happen so long as she allows her energy level to dictate what she does.   I hope this helps. It's really difficult to be the parent in these situations and I admire your having educated yourself so well to what's going on. Hopefully you will know more soon and when you do, please follow up with us here. In the meantime, if there are any changes, or if you have any additonal  questions, please let us know.  Good luck to you both.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  Your history and prescription record in your profile suggest you suffer from obesity and concomitant type II diabetes. Since these are both risk factors for heart disease, which you clearly also have, the goal would be to effectively manage the diabetes through diet and exercise in a very structured program supervised by medical personnel, and the best way to accomplish this would be via a cardiac rehabilitation program, if one is available in your location. You are indeed on a lot of medications now, some of which will probably be reduced or eliminated over time, while others will have to remain a part of your daily regimen, at least for a good while, if not permanently. You could get down to three or four meds eventually.   I'm not crazy about the Topamax idea for several reasons. One, it's not a use recommended by the manufacturer, and is an off-label use. When it is used to control weight it is intended to reduce binge-eating. You would do better to work with a cardiac rehab specialist in conjunction with a dietitician. The Topamax has enough potential noxious side effects to make it not worth the risk, and you really need to adopt habits that will last you a lifetime. Done right, this could resolve your diabetes, weight problems, and possibly your heart disease as well. I would look into finding a center where this sort of work is done and proceed in that direction.  I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you  with this and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there --  The relationship between potassium and Lasix is theoretically linear, but in practice it doesn't necessarily work that way. There are too many metabolic variables. However, for a given individual the relationship should remain relatively stable,  and it is especially important to keep your K level in the low-to-mid 4s range as you've mentioned. If 180 meq does this without any evidence of hyperkalemia (which is every bit as dangerous as hypo-K), then if it works for you, you've found the right combination. You cannot, however, boost it or fine tune it on a day-to-day basis, and it must be treated as though it is a linear relationship in order to avoid hyper-K situations. You'll need to confirm this with your doctor, and not add K on your own, because you have no ready method to monitor it. If you've found a working correlation between it and  Lasix then you should stay with this until and unless you've discussed this with your doctor, who's interest is also in keeping things fairly level.  It's not realistic to expect it to stay linear at all times,even though the theory works that way. In practice it rarely works out that way.  Hope this is helpful.

    "content": "Hello --  I am unfamiliar with (and  unable to find in any searches) Prthodyn and Lexatonil, so am unable to determine if either might be responsible for your elevated heart rate. It may be normal for you or it may be due to some sort of metabolic or heart problem. It also could be due to anxiety.  As for the echocardiogram, everything seems well within normal limits except for the E/A reversal, which may be  simply artifact. This sometimes is associated with a left ventricle not functioning at peak ability, but with everything else being normal or very close to it (multiple trivial valve regurgitation is quite common in healthy populations) it's difficult to assess the significance of this, but I would think your doctor would be the first to tell you if there were anything signficantly wrong, especially since you've been given a copy of the report (a practice I feel is generally unwise,  since patients aren't trained to interpret them). Given no alarm from your doctor and everything else being normal, I'd have to assume you're in good shape. If you have any further information to provide, such as why the study was done to begin with, this might help us draw  a more useful conclusion.  It sounds, based on what we have, that you are doing fine.   I hope this is helpful.  Good luck to you and  please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there --  It sounds like you have either neurocardiogenic syncope or, more likely, a rather severe disautonomia (autonomic nervous system doesn't act appropriately) with peculiar affectation of the barostats, sensors located in the carotid sinuses as well as the sinus of Valsalva and some other locales as well. While this is not, in itself, dangerous, it can be  indirectly dangerous because of the  potential for falling, fainting, striking the head, and also is just very disruptive and makes it diffcult to function. This would be my first, best guess as to what is going on, and although you've had a pretty comprehensive cardiological workup, the definitive test has not been done: Tilt Table Test. This is usually diagnostic for both neurocardiogenic syndrome, baroreceptor dysfuntion,  etc., and can be very helpful in situations where the patient has symptoms such as you describe. If the outcome is positive this usually can be managed with medication and some lifestlyle changes.  I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck to you and please follow up here as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Possibility of LQTS",
    "content": "Hello --  I certainly don't want to in any way minimize your concerns, but I also don't want you to worry needlessly. Your QT interval is normal by any standard, and your QTC is absolutely within normal limits. T wave humps would require more clarification, but it sounds like maybe they were peaked, which is not abnormal. It's great that friends want to be helpful, but unless you have a family history of sudden cardiac death there's really nothing here to suggest anything remotely wrong in this regard. You do seem to be experiencing some sort of possible tachyarrhythmia, but it is likely benign. It's worth noting that the more innocent atrial tachycardias often do terminate abruptly, per your description. Still, you might reasonably want to know what it is. A Holter monitor or preferably an event recorder would be appropriate to determine what, if anything, is going on (and it may not be anything, even though you percieve something happening). There's only one way to be certain. However, you've had an EKG which sounds as though it was perfectly normal, which means the only way to capture anything unusual would be via recording device. I'd strongly suggest you have this done, if only for your own peace of mind. Meanwhile, you can let go any concerns about torsade de pointes and/or long QT. You may possibly have a benign intermittent arrhythmia which could be managed medically or possibly ablated. You may not have anything at all. You deserve to know. It's not unreasonable to request an answer to this. I hope this will be helpful to you. Please follow up with us here as needed. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "tachycardia originally diagnosed as POTS",
    "content": "I was a 23 year old healthy female a year ago when I started having chest pain and shortness of breath. I had an EKG which showed prolonged qt intervals and a resting heartrate of 120 bpm. I had a positive tilt test and was diagnosed as having postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. I wore a monitor for a week which recorded almost constant tachycardia and a few arythmias. While laying down asleep I was getting recordings of heart rates over 200 bpm. It fluctuates greatly from 55 bpm upward. The cardiologist wasn't concerned with the slightly prolonged qt intervals and attributed them to the tachycardia. I tried various medicines to bring the heart rate under control with no success. At the same time I started getting very bad lower back and upper leg pain. About a month after this started I got out of bed one morning and fell to the floor. I was able to get back up but I had very weak legs which progressed over a day or two to almost a spastic looking walk. I continued to fall several times a day with no warning. Within 4 days I was unable to walk at all and spent 3 days in the hospital getting scans and blood work. Nothing really stood out except a CPK level of 560. I graduaaly began to improve and left the hospital using a walker. I had no reflex action in my lower extremities, numb areas on both legs, blurry vision for the next month which gradually improved. About this time I developed multiple abscesses on my sides and hips which put me back in the hospital for 8 days with fever up to 103 every day despite antibiotics. No arythmias were noted during this time but very fast heart rates. I had surgery to remove the worst abscesses and visited the wound care clinic for the next month. All symptoms but the taqchycardia almost went away over the winter. This past 2 weeks the abscesses and fever are back along with the unsteady walk, blurry vision, worsening leg pain and falling. I am again having my abscesses drained and packed daily. I've had tentitive diagnosis from MS to periodic paralysis but nothing to explain the cardiac involvement or abscesses. Echo was normal. MRI's show no lesions in brain or spine. Cardiologist theorizes that perhaps a virus damaged my central and peripheral nervous system but he can't explain the abscesses. I'm worried that all of this might be some autoimmune thing that is damaging my heart. I don't think the POTS diagnosis makes much sense either. Any ideas?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: tachycardia originally diagnosed as POTS",
    "content": "Hi there --  You may have POTS secondary to idiotpathic perhipheral neuropathy (IPN), which basically means a disorder of the peripheral nerves of unknown cause (often a virus can be at the bottom of it, but it's difficult to know in all cases). Since IPN can eventually affect the autonomic nervous system as well, POTS becomes a secondary symptom rather than a diagnosis. It's also a very bothersome symptoms.  The one thing I'd really like to know, if possible, is what your QT interval was and the rate that went along with it (it is relative, long-QT, and must be calculated using both heart rate and QT interval, so this  may be why your doctor ruled it out as a concern).   The abcesses are something of a mystery. I'm going to try and do some  reasearch to see if there's any condition in which IPN and random abcesses coexist.  I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you and please follow up with  us here.\n\n",

The cardiologist said they were mildly prolonged but didn't give an exact number. I'm looking for the EKG report. The POTS as secondary makes more sense. I know the tilt table test didn't show much of an increase in heart rate but blood pressure went down to 40/29 and I passed out. When this all started in March 2008 I also noticed an greatly increased thirst. I have to have water with me at all times. I've mentioned this to every doctor I see and they all dismiss it as unimportant. Maybe because glucose tests are normal. Thanks for your response.\n\n",

My mother has high cholesterol, but hers is high LDL levels.  My doctor gave me a script for Whelcor, but it's expensive, and I don't like the gastric side effects.

    "content": "Hi there --  You're having too much of a good thing, which some people would pay to have. Your HDL level is quite high, about double what we'd consider really good. This is what's driving up your total cholesterol, and while  it's great to the point of being ridiculous, it probably would make your doctor more comfortable if the collective number were lower. To do this you might start by discontinuing the flaxseed oil and omega3 supplements. That may bring this number down into the 80s, which would bring your total into the 180s. I don't think there are enough cases of what used to be referred to as \"morbid longevity\" (families with very long lifespans due in  large part to abnormally high HDL) to pull up any useful statistical information, but there's probably at least a limit to how much HDL  one can use, and 80 would be considered super. There are likely no serious implications for having it this high,  but just using the rule of moderation, since you don't need the supplements to keep this number high, try for a while leaving them out and see what happens. Otherwise, I think you're just fantastically lucky to have the genes you have.   Please follow up with us if you have any further information or questions. Good luck to you.\n\n",

She carried a fever for about four days and the fever stopped.  The Doctors were not sure but started to lean towards Kawasaki Disease because because the second week her fingers started to peal. Her mouth and genital areas were affected as well. After the fever broke the rash cleared but started to itch really bad.  That soon stopped but she still is pealing and still a red tongue so the Doctors are still thinking Kawasaki disease.  She acts fine and doesn't act sick but next week they are sending her for an echocardiogram to she if her heart is constricted.  My question is should a child with this disease be active or even feel like playing or should she still be extremely sick?

    "content": "Hello --  Kawasaki disease is dificult to diagnose concretely, and is generally suspected and treated if 3-4 of the five cardinal signs or symptoms are present. For this reason, it seems your niece is a likely candidate, and the sooner Kawasaki is treated, the batter the outcome. Since she seems to feel fairly well and wants to play, it's going to be difficult to keep her still, and may not be all that helpful, so long as treatment is begun promptly and/or the disease is definitely ruled out in favor of one of the other possible problems which could mimic it (in which case that disease would also need to be treated promptly).   I think probably so long as she seems to feel well it's best to not restrict her activity too much, but getting her into the hospital and treated would make this a moot point,  so the  doctors need to come to a diagnosis or make the decision to treat proactively in case this is Kawasaki, in which case the issue of her being active would be renedered moot.   I hope this is helpful to you. Please keep us updated as to what is determined.  Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there --  While there is little risk associated with a single instance of double-dosing, one must be very careful to avoid doing this on a regular basis, and if you can avoid use of the drug altogether, all the better, since the medicine does have a history of being relatively unstable and with potential to do harm. Anything you can't safely take twice by accident (or which would cause you to ask such a question) is clearly not an especially safe thing to use at all.   To answer your basic question, you should be fine regarding the one-time oversight. However, the fact that you needed to ask illustrates the reputation  of the drug has preceded it and that it's not all that safe in general. I'd encourage anyone to try and find alternative means of losing weight (such as diet and exercise).  I hope this is helpful to you and please follow up with us here if you have any further questions.  Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a male 53 years old I had CABG surgery in 2002. A month ago I had a problem of gas burbing during walking or doing any physical activity, considering that I had lifelong   problems in colon I considered it normal.                                                                                                                                                                                 Six weeks ago after getting over the stairs several times I felt a terrible pressure & pain in the middle of my chest with gas burbing,pain in jaw &  left shoulder , I went to ER they made an  EKG they  diagnosed the problem as  esophageal  contractions due to GRED and the pain relieved  by taking ZINTAC  as injection .  Since then every night I wake up in the middle of my sleeping with the same chest pressure, I went to ER again this time they told me that my EKG this time showed some disturbance and I took again ZINTAC the pain decreased a little after rest. After that I had a MSCT coronary angiography the report showed the following: For the three bypasses: -Patent LIMA graft to mid LAD. -No other patent grafts seen. For the native arteries: -Significant stenotic at the proximal & mid LAD segments and at the ostium of the 3rd diagonal branch. -Total occlusion at the mid LCX and distal RCA segments.  It was strange that the other two bypasses didn\u2019t appear. Any way I went to my heart surgeon he told me that I have GERD and the heart is in a good condition as the main artery pass of LAD with LIMA is ok and it feeds 75% of the heart and the problems in my EKG are due to esophageal contractions is related to the heart so it is normal have pulse and heart disturbances he told me to continue my work and live my normal life. At work I got tired felt like exhausted and with high heartbeats and the same rate chest pain I went to hospital I stayed there for a week with plenty of tests & EKG they told me that I have some problems in both heart & GERD but they can\u2019t do me a catheter for my arteries and also the can\u2019t make esophageal scope tests because that would harm my heart medical condition they asked me to have a 15 day vacation. Since I got out of the hospital I have three cases:  I can\u2019t do any outside home activity driving a car just going to the street  I feel ascending middle chest pain, high heart beat rate, gas burbing, dry through & like I have swallowed a piece of metal   . Pressure in the chest and the back during bending or having a shower. A severe chest pain that wakes me every night nearly at 3:00Am.  Knowing that: -I don\u2019t have any heartburn.  -I don\u2019t feel sweating or short breath during these attacks. - These pain attacks don\u2019t mainly come with physical effort. And also I follow the instructions well: - I sleep nearly at sitting position - I only eat vegetable soup & bread - I am not a smoker & I don't drink -I don\u2019t eat spicy food.  I have been at home for a week till now my situation didn\u2019t get any better,  should i try to with stand the pain and try to do more physical effort knowing my case is GERD and stop worrying about my heart situation until I get better or that i am having angina and i have to stop doing any effort in my daily life .  Doctors have different opinions every where I go some say GERD & some say angina i don't know which one to believe. What I am asking about now is: According to the MSCT Is my heart situation fine? Are my symptoms related to anginas or it is just GERD? If it is GERD how long would it take to start showing enhancing with medication?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  You present a very interesting and complex question. While you probably do have GERD, based on findings, you also do have progressive coronary artery disease, which has obliterated some CABG grafts as well as significantly narrowed some native vessels. It is likely you have unusual cardiovascular anatomy and have also developed some collateral blood flow, but it is difficult enough to differentiate between esophageal spasm, pain of angina, and heartburn. Since esophageal spasm will respond to nitroglycerine, this wouldn't provide enough evidence of either/or.   It seems some of the doctors who've seen you detect evidence of GERD and read your coronary anatomy to be functioning well, while others recognize the difficulty of truly knowing which may be causing your symptoms. GERD will not cause fatigue, but all the other qualifying symptoms or lack of them do point toward GERD as a likely cause of most of your complaints. However, I strongly suspect a combination, since there is no rule against having more than one medical problem at the same time, and these two do often co-exist. I would try to assert the need to manage the GERD at the maxium effective level, perhaps with a more strong medication, and also be followed regularly for changes in cardiac status. You're doing everything right, and it is a very difficult problem you face in having both things going on at once. Your angina, if there actually is any present, is probably stable, which is good. A comprehensive cardic rehabiliation program might be the best route for you right now, if you can get the doctor to prescribe one. Meanwhile, please continue doing what you are doing and follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "While I don't think you have any disease process involving the vagus nerve, this nerve does play an important role in a lot of cardiac symptoms, especially heart rate and sometimes rhythm, and it also controls the peristaltic action of your GI tract, so when your stomach or intestines are acting up in some way (which would likely include GERD if due to excess acid production) then yes, this could cause vagal stimulation which might well lead to premature heartbeats, palpitations and slowing of the heart rate. It wouldn't cause chest pain, but it can cause other symptoms simply by its having two basic jobs: to slow the heart rate and to help the GI tract digest food. Hope this clarifies that part for you.\n\n",

    "content": "On 9-11-08, after my second heart attack and a kidney stone attack that week, I underwent a triple bypass.  I actually needed a fourth bypass, but the artery was too small (genetic defect?). After the surgery, I developed an atrial fibrillation with a heart beat of 200. This was eventually controlled by Sotolol (no longer taking as of November 2008).  I also developed a plueral effusion around left lung, where 600 ccs of fluid was removed in November. After removing this fluid, the chest x-ray showed that a mininal amount of fluid remained.  I was subsequently diagnosed with inflammation of the lungs and put on prednisone. As of Jan. 2009, the fluid is gone according to the chest x-ray. Nonetheless, I am still experiencing what feels like congestion (I thought this was the inflammation). I have no mucus, but my breathing is labored and I whistle/wheeze. I eventually get really hoarse. My chest also has the sensation that I am being crushed.  Often, I lift my shirt of my chest, which sometimes allievates the sensation. I also experience a sharp pain in the left shoulder blade.  These symptoms come and go, which makes me say I have good days and bad days.  In the last three weeks, I've had five bad days.  The heart surgeon and the pulmonary specialist have released me. The cardiologist suggested that it might be the onset of allergies. I have been told to buy some over the counter allergy medicine or Mucenix. A nurse's practictioner tells me that I may need up to one year to heal from my bypass surgery. What's up?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  Most, if not all, of your symptoms are fairly common ones post coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). Atrial arrhythmias, especially A-fib and flutter, are very common and usually go away, as yours did, in a fairly short time. The pleural effusion, sometimes called Dressler's syndrome, is also extremely common and responds well to the measures used in your situation. Sometimes a little bit of fluid will remain in the pleural space indefinitely.   The wheezing and whistling could be asthma due to allergies that have been awakened by the trauma to your body, or could be due to some other sort of irritation. There are several innocuous prescription antihistamines on the market which won't make you drowsy and may help the wheezing. You may also wind up being prescribed an inhaler if this can be proven to be asthma. Mucinex may be helpful and won't do any harm. It's  apparently not cardiac asthma, as you've been seen and released by your cardiologist and surgeon.  There are also musculoskeletal complaints which can continue for some time after CABG, especially if you had the conventional open surgery where the sternum is divided then put back together with steel rings afterward. This isn't the primary cause, but is part of it, along with the  ribs having been spread during surgery, which can cause some lingering pains and also some very odd sensations (often described as feeling as though there is \"bent sheet metal\" in the front of the chest at times). The sensation of your chest being \"crushed\" can be relieved, at times, by removing your shirt. Therefore the sensation is actually rather superficial. This is one of those really odd things that happens because nerves in the thoracic cavity have been irritated, touched, moved, etc. It takes a while for them to reorient themselves, and in the meantime these odd and troubling sensations  may occur off and on. The tend to fade away.  A good rule of thumb for recovery expectations is one year for all the odd things to resolve and to feel completely normal. Getting into a cardiac rehab program is essential to a smooth recovery and is invaluable in terms of social support as well as a structured program of flexibility and aerobic fitness. Some people leave these programs in better condition than they've ever been in their lives. During that year some people seem to recover almost over night while others take a more deliberate course. Your body has been subjected to a major trauma because of this surgery, but your heart is also functioning much more efficiently than before, so the trade off is a very good one, but there are some potentially really strange symptoms to get past before you'll feel like yourself (or better) again. The good news is that most people do feel better than before.   That one anomalous artery is not unusual either. Probably one  in 20 patients wind up having this problem with one artery in a group considered for bypass.   All in all your recovery sounds fairly typical. Some are faster and smoother, some are slower and more bumpy. In all cases I would highly recommend cardiac rehab for at least the Phase II (closely monitored) stage, and if possible, enroll in Phase III  (loosely monitored and self-paced). There's probably nothing quite as useful in getting back to feeling \"right\" again.  I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck with this, and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

We had a night out with friends and a few glasses of wine and about 3 x rum and cokes were consumed over a period of about 5 hours.  This morning my husband (Aged 51) woke up to go to the bathroom, all seemed fine.  He then climbed back into bed and went back to sleep.  A half an hour later I tried to wake him, whereas normally you just have to touch him and he responds, he's quite used to \"power napping and can wake at the slightest movement. this time it was almost as if he had died in his sleep.  I shook him, I panicked and tried to feel his heart beating, tried to feel his pulse, but all at the same time not wanting to feel nothing.  I then climbed onto the bed and shook him and still nothing, I rolled him over and only after a while did he then open his eyes.  He does not recall me trying to wake him.  Other than having a headache which was clearly that morning after feeling he has felt fine the whole day. Should he be worried and go for a check up?  He's actually quite healthy.  He has been drinking CRESTOR for the past 2 months.  I look forward to your reply.  Leoni\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Leoni -  While the difficulty waking your husband might seem unsurprising to some, given the drinks the night previous, I'm sure this has been done before without this reaction. There are so many possibilities that come to mind, most of them quite innocent, but when a person lives with someone and knows that person's habits,  rhythms, etc., it is troubling when  something new and different happens -- even if it is, ultimately, quite innocent.  Of course my first thought is that if I'd consumed the same amount and mix of alcoholic drinks I'd probably be very difficult to wake the next day. Still, this is odd, and it's important to watch him now; the only new thing may be the Crestor, which can, of course, have some implications for the liver when alcohol is put into the equation, but it doesn't seem like an unusual amount for him, so this may have been the one thing that's changed.   One question: when he got up the first time (to go to the bathroom) did he communicate with you at all? Or did he just sort of mechanically do this -- as many people do when intending to return to bed? If he was awake enough to talk to you (and make sense) and then after a half-hour of sleep was so difficult to rouse, well, it's odd. It doesn't really suggest anything of cardiac origin, more likely something related to alcohol consumed and possibly Crestor being thrown into the mix. Even this isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it's new, so you'll need to observe his behavior for a little while. It  sounds as though he's fine since the strange interlude, so I'm guessing this was innocent, but again (and I'm sure I don't need to remind you) keep an eye out for changes in behavior, etc.   Please stay in touch with us and of course update us if anything else happens. I'm inclined to suspect this was just a shift in bodily reaction to drinking, quite possibly related to Crestor, which isn't necessarily problematic.   My best to you both.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 44 year old man that is in o.k. shape.  Usually at this time of the year, I pull my bicycle out and start training for some long distance rides that I do with friends in the spring.  For Christmas my wife purchased a heart monitor for me.  I was very surprised at the high heart rates that I reached during my initial 10 mile training rides.  As best I can tell, my maximum heart rate is right around 176.  For much of my ride, I was approaching 90% of maximum.  I was rarely under 80%.  On some of the hills I hit maximum heart rate (176)for at least a few minutes.   I'm pretty sure that was my maximum, because it definitely wasn't going to beat any faster.   I was pushing hard, but I didn't think I was pushing myself THAT hard.  Is it dangerous to hit my maximum heart rate during these training rides?   Am I at risk of doing damage, or should I just keep training hard?   I need to train farely aggressively to be able to do the rides and keep up with my friends.   I assume this will happen less often as I get more training rides under my belt.  Thank you!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  While there is nothing inherently dangerous in or wrong with reaching one's maximum heart rate during workouts (and this certainly is a workout), and some people actually routinely reach or exceed their maximum (the formula is flawed in that it is designed as a \"one-size-fits-all\" measurement), it's never a bad idea to have at least a cursory cardiac workup and clearance from your doctor before embarking on a serious fitness or athletic regimen. We try to promote this for high school and college athletes, so it shouldn't seem unreasonable for an apparently healthy 44 year old.   Again, everything else being equal, there's nothing harmful or wrong in being able to hit these high rates, although generally they tend to come down with time and persistence. Not always, however, as we are all different,  some  more different than others. Still, it might be prudent for anyone, prior to starting out on such a program (or at the beginning of any given \"season\" of sport or fitness) to have a doctor clear one before going in head-first.   On the up-side, you seem to be tolerating this very well, which is a slightly less scientific way of determining if there's a weak link anywhere in the  system.  I'd be remiss to just tell you to go ahead and do this without the medical clearance, even though it may seem moot at this point. It sounds as though you're in pretty decent condition and will likely only get better. Still, humor me with this, if you would.   I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you. Oh, and I hope you thanked your wife for the heart monitor. It's a really useful piece of equipment all throughout your training and competition phases.\n\n",

While I don't see any great problem with shooting for 90 per cent of maximum heart rate, and while hittin 100 per cent for short bursts is unlikely to, in itself, cause any harm, you can reach a point of diminishing returns, and when you operate at 100 per cent the problem is that you have no aerobic \"headroom\" left; you begin to build an oxygen debt which can actually detract from the improvement you might otherwise be gaining. I'd feel more comfortable knowing you keep your workouts limited to 90 per cent of maximum even if you feel find pushing farther. At some point you have to hit a limit, and at that point everything feels relatively the same -- good.   I hope this answers your question. Good luck to you and keep up the great work!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, my name is Joe. About six months ago I went to the doctor about sweating at night an frequent trips to the restroom to urinate. He done CBC and found nothing alarming, so I ignored it. The frequent urination never happened during the night and has since stopped. So I think it might not have anything to do with my condition. I still experience night sweats about 3 to 5 time a week. Now on to the passing out episode I recently had. I was getting out of bed first thing in the morning when I suddenly fainted in the hallway. I must have woke right up because by the time my girlfriend heard me fall I was awake and alert. I remember everything that happened. Then just a few minutes later I passed out in the kitchen for a minute or two. Once I woke from this episode I felt normal. I went to the hospital and they ran all kinds of tests, such as a CT scan, MRI, EKG, Echo cardiogram, Tilt Table Test, and Stress Test. They diagnosed me with vasovagal syncope, due to postural hypotension. Which is sudden low blood pressure when standing up. They never said if the night sweats are a symptom of this diagnosis or not. I have tried to research some causes of night sweats and passing out together. The one thing I found is POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome). POTS is a autonomic disorder that has to do with rapid heart rate while standing up and low blood pressure while standing up. The doctor never told me about this I found it on my own. I have had many CBC over the past few weeks and nothing alarming has showed up. If anyone can think of what is causing my night sweats and passing out, or if you have experienced the same thing I would greatly appreciate your help.  Thanks\n\n",

POTS and vasovagal syncompe (now often referred to as neurocardiogenic syncope, although I feel \"vasovagal\" is easier to pronounce).

The only remaining question regards the night sweats, and I may have a workable theory for that, even though it is usually seen in systemic infectious illnesses such as mono and tuberculosis. However, in your case I think what may have been  happening was that you were having vasovagal episodes in bed, where you couldn't actually pass out because you were horizontal; very often these episodes, which usually take place while vertical, are accompanied by breaking  a sweat suddenly. You may have had the \"herald\" symptom during your sleep and so didn't realize what was happening. Now you've had a couple of more normal episodes and know what you need to look out for in order to keep from being injured because of an unexpected fall. You aren't likely to hurt yourself if this happens in bed, because you're already horizontal. Since you're sleeping you probably wouldn't know it happened anyway. It  is unusual, but there are things that can stimulate this, and one is nocturnal micturition (urination -- often with the patient passing out while  standing at the toilet). So I suspect this  is why you were having the night sweats.   I don't know  that you have POTS, but it is usually related to orthostatic hypotension and vasovagal syncope when it occurs.   I hope this is helpful to you. You seem to already have all the really important issues in hand. Good work. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  This actually sounds a lot less silly than it is, and I'm surprised no one's ever asked me this before. However, it's not an issue, because alcohol is metabolized rather quickly and isn't generally in areas where a spark, if there were one loose in there somewhere, could find any oxygen to help cause a burp, much less an explosion. While there used to be a big fascination with the topic of human spontaneous combustion, I suspect the widespread use of implantable defibrillators has knocked that one out of circulation. In short, no. This won't happen.   What the CPR instructor may have meant may have been one of the very few OR explosions which have been caused by a combination of use of alcohol topically (along with Betadyne) to clean the surface of a patient's skin, then having had defibrillator paddles applied emergently, which is an entirely different (and astoundingly rare) thing altogether. This has happened once or twice.   Hope this is helpful. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "tachycardia with so far unknown cause",
    "content": "Hi, I am an 18 year-old female. About a month and a half ago I was hospitalized for a rapid heart rate (just 115), raised blood pressure and some minor chest pain. This had been going on for almost a day before I came in but had never happened to me before. Once in the hospital I briefly lost consciousness and awoke hyperventilating and with a heart rate above 170. I had purple, \"claw\" hands and feet and I couldn't move them, after a few minutes I began to shake uncontrollably (not like a seizure or anything just like extreme shivering, they said that all that might be due to the hyperventilation). Okay so basically the doctors ran all of the obligatory tests and found nothing so they chalked it up to some sort of panic attack although I didn't appear to be panicking. My heart rate had already begun to stabilize (it had been a couple more hours) but they put ativan in my iv anyway and sent me home to see a cardiologist. I was taking adderall xr at the time (20 mg) and had been for about 7 months but after that I stopped just to be safe. About 10 days later (w/o the adderall) my heart began to race again for about an hour at about 128 bpm. I have a heart monitor now and am again taking the adderall bc it really helps me with schoolwork/organization and the cardio said it was ok but I am continuing to experience symptoms. For a couple days last week I felt like my heart was palpitating even though my heart rate was only around 100-110 and then yesterday my heart raced between 130-145 for about 5 hours. I recorded it on the heart monitor and the cardiol. said it should go away on its own and that I shouldn't be too concerned unless my toes did not regain color (they were dark purple). Okay I am sorry this is so ridiculously long! My questions are 1) assuming this is not just some sort of psychological thing is it more likely that the adderall would only begin giving me side effects 8 months into taking it (I have never experienced heart issues before on/off of it) or that I have developed an underlying condition that is now aggravated by the adderall? 2) Is it possible to feel legitimate heart palpitations similar to those of a very high heart rate if heart rate is relatively normal or is this psychological? 3) Lately I can't see for 5-10 seconds when I stand after sitting/laying down for a while (like being blind), could this be some sort of related symptom ? (I don't mean to sound paranoid, mentioning every little thing, I'm just not a dr. so I don't know what's important and what's not. I figured better to say too much than too little?) Yeah, so that's basically it. I really appreciate your input! Oh and also I'm at a healthy weight but exercise rarely and my echo is normal besides a little mild leakage in my mitral and tricuspid valves. I also have a history of thyroid issues and have a benign nodule but my TSH is only a little out of the normal range right now/has been stable for some time and there is an extensive history of cardiac problems on both sides of my family. Thanks again!\n\n",

The EP doc. that did the ablation could not recreate the arrythmia, but did 13 burns in areas that are charictaristic for AVNRT. Since the ablation i have had rus of tachycardia that are have a quick onset and offset, that run anywhere from 168-196 bpm, lasting usually only a few minutes 5-10. With increased BP of anywhere from 140/92 to 161/115.and only while in the event otherwise blood pressure runs in the normal range. I have these tachy. runs at least once a month and up to 5 times a month. Every run has looked to be Sinus tach, on the strips, but cardiologist says that he cannot rule out an Atrial tachycardia. I am currently on atenolol 12.5 mg 2xdaily to try to control the fast heart rate runs.Cannot take more than that because I have been known to be bradycardic 1x  @ 46bpm,while on no heart med's at all. Have tried Diltilizam also but could not continue due to it causing an irregular heart rythm. I have tried to eliminate all stimulants that can cause this to happen,but still smoke about 4 cigarettes a day 1/2 a cigarette at a time. I also have alot of pvc's, and have hypothyroidism, and my endocrinologist has mentioned hashimotos. Have been tested for ,adrenal tumors,innapropriate sinus tach,blood clots,bleeds,POTS,  all negative. And cardio pretty much ruled out anxiey. I would like to know what you think could be causing this if it is not from outside stimuli?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  This is a serious question and I'll treat it that way. First, it is a very reasonable  concern and well put. Second, it's serious because profound sadness and/or anger can cause this sensation with or without heart disease. While it would be extremely unusual in someone your age, the answer to your question about the potential for negative emotions to cause or aggravate heart disease is that yes, over a long period of time it is believed to play a role in the development of or aggravation of heart disease. Usually this is seen in people in their 40s, 50s and 60s. It is almost never a factor in people younger than 30, but again, over a long, long period  of time it is associated with an increase in  risk of heart disease, so the question is certainly well taken. However, these emotions can also cause a \"heart ache\" in otherwise healthy young people (and older ones, too),  which is where the term \"heartache\" came from. What actually causes these sensations is difficult to pin down, but they are certainly real, even when they pose no threat to health,  and  they are also very telling as far as feelings go.   The best way for you to deal with this set of symptoms would be to bring them to the attention of your doctor. Now it's entirely possible (sad, but true) that your doctor could decide you're being and \"over dramatic  teenager\" and that would be very unfortunate, because a really good and sensitive doctor wouldn't do that. Still, it does happen  sometimes.  A truly sharp and insightful doctor would do a cardiac workup, if only to ease your  mind about the symptoms being related to your heart, and, if that were ruled out (as I feel certain it would be) might  be  able  to help you find someone with whom you could talk about the emotions you describe which are bringing on  these symptoms. This is not an \"over dramatic\" response, but a responsible one, since we are usually the last to know  when  our emotions are affecting our health or even our perceptions via our bodies. It's a complicated process and that's why there are people whose life work is helping us figure these things out.   I hope this is helpful to you. Please follow up with us as needed and keep us updated as well. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  There are two equally likely causes for the numbness you describe, along with the numbness in the radial  aspect of your right  hand: this could be  due to unwitting hyperventilation (very likely and very common); this  happens usually due to anxiety and/or faulty breathing patterns, and can cause these very symptoms along  with lightheadedness, dizziness,  etc. Sometimes dizziness (vertigo, often caused by an  inner ear problem) can trigger the faulty breathing and perpetuate itself this way.  The second possibility would be something involving the central nervous system (CNS), and this should be ruled out by a healthcare provider. It should be fairly easy, on a face-to-face basis, to differentiate between an anxiety or vertigo-based problem (easily treated or managed) and a CNS problem, which could be more complicated and require additional testing.

    "title": "Re: Decreased LV Dimensions of the Heart",
    "content": "Hello -  If the size of the left ventricle has become progressively smaller over the course of six years, which appears to be the case, it has progressed fairly significantly over that period. What this means is not  totally clear, but in general what it probably means is that the walls of the LV have been getting thicker, which means the volume of the interior space of the LV is getting smaller, and so has less room for blood which is to be pumped out to the body. This can be due to an inherited disorder, it can be caused by excessive athletic conditioning, and, in some  cases, it can even be secondary to mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD), although the latter is fairly rare. When it does happen it usually is due to obstruction of the aortic outflow tract, which increases the pressure inside the LV and the workload, which causes the muscles to thicken. High blood pressure can also cause this  development. Since there's no mention of outflow tract obstruction in your echocardiogram findings, it would seem to be due to some other factor, perhaps high blood pressure, although you don't mention this in your history.   The normal  variations in interior LV dimensions are considerable,  and the only oddity in your case is that the variation has been consistently toward a smaller volume. So long as your doctor is not concerned and you have no disabling or disturbing symptoms, this is probably considered normal for you, given your personal height, weight and build.   I hope this is helpful. Please follow up with  us as necessary, especially if you have any further insights to offer. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "To John Kenyon, Thank you for your most informative reply.I did not go into much detail before because it is a long & complicated story & so far the response from other specialists has not been worth the effort.I will try to make it as short as possible.I have been to many Rhumatologists & other than make a general diagnosis of possibly Sjogrens,Raynauds & Lupus ,not one had any idea what was causing my extreme pain & multitude of organ problems or took the problem as a whole to be serious. I had high BP & pulse,pain in my chest like a tight band,intense pain in my head,extreme nausea,frequent urination of dark urine (containing protein)& pain all over my body.All of this got worse after even eating or talking. After having 2 Transient Ischemic attacks (dismissed as nothing) after doing a little bit of walking I quickly realised that walking made the situation even more serious so I became practically bedridden.I felt as if my body was being starved of Oxygen but got ridiculed when I tried to explain this. I went to a Cardiologist in 2003 because I had an echocardiogram showing AF (also showed minor focal calcification).He said there was nothing structurally wrong  the problem was caused by croglobulenemia or something similar. He sent me to Hematologist who was no help,so I gave up looking for a diagnosis.In 2004 I had a blood transfusion for severe anemia all my symtoms reduced to a tolerable level,BP & pulse normal.Took no medication for 12mths .Before transfusion my heart seemed to pump really hard after exertion.Now after only minimal effort I feel as if my heart cannot cope ,my BP drops 90/60,P56/min,I get pain in the left side of chest & feel dizzy.Checked last Echo (told fine)says Aortic stenosis.What could cause this? Is there any treatment?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  I'd begun to wonder if there might not be some history of autoimmune/connective tissue disease, and that does seem to be the case, which would help explain a lot of this. Sjogren's, in particular, might help explain the heart involvement, including the AF, which of course is almost certainly the cause of the TIAs. While this family of diseases, which often overlap each other and can cause an infuriating spectrum of problems, can be managed medically,  it is sometimes quite a challenge.   cryoglobulenemia is an immune disorder which sometimes follows hepatitis-C infection, and blends in all too well with the other suspected culprits. I still think  Sjogren's would seem to be the biggest contributor, however, and this should probably be the focus, for now, of study and management.   Aortic stenosis (the technical term for what's been happpening) is probably due to stiffening of parts of the myocardium if Sjogren's,  secondary to lupus, is confirmed. While Sjogren's usually involves the tear ducts and lymph nodes primarily, lupus as an underlying cause can, of course, attack almost any organ system (or cause any system to attack itself). This is all useful information, but it  requires a certain amount of clinical skill on the part of the attending physician and, of course, a great deal of patience on the part of the patient.  Please keep us updated,  and thanks for adding this information,  which does make everything make a little more sense. Best of luck to you and please stay in touch.\n\n",

My son has the same medical condition as me and has had no luck finding a knowledgeable specialist either. He has had uncontrollable BP & Pulse for the past two years ,it gets worse after activity & he gets AF and chest pain (both him & my daughter were diagnosed with  heart murmur 15yrs ago).Do you think our heart problems are most likely caused by the disorder or some inherited problem?  What inherited condition if any could cause these problems?. Can a stiffened myocardium be detected by any tests?             Is there any treatment for aortic stenosis ? Thank you Napoleon\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Napoleon -  The disorder is definitely genetic (except in very rare instances of mutation), and since your son's symptoms match up with yours (as far as they go) it is entirely likely he's inherited this set of problems. He should at least be evaluated for the same set of problems that you have, and sarcoidosis shouldn't be taken off the table quite yet either, since these two disorders can sometimes look a lot alike.   A stiffened myocardium (which is why I mention sarcoidosis) can usually be detected by motion studies; an echocardiogram will usually pick this up cleanly, and sometimes an MUGA or gated exercise nuclear scan can help determine just how much of a problem it presents, so that exercise can be limited, adjusted, etc., to the limitations of a heart with stiffening of the muscle tissue.  Aortic stenosis, if it requires correction, is usually done in one of two ways, depending on multiple factors: either through conventional surgery (sometimes minimally invasive) to either correct the outflow tract or replace the valve; or sometimes the valve can be stretched open via percutaneous angioplasty (much like the baloon procedure done to clear a clogged artery, but using a larger balloon). Much depends upon the anatomy of the individual aortic valve and the extent of stenosis.   Hope this is helpful to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  While you seem to have tolerated a series of medical and surgical procedures without incident (at least as far as LQTS is concerned), this new set of symptoms, which seems, on the face of it to make no sense, may actually have some relationship with LQTS. After looking at a lot of arcane information on migraine recently, it seems there are some overlapping themes here that may suggest an unusual neurological derangement.  One type of migraine is associated with an atrial septal defect in the heart. I wonder if you've ever had an echocardiogram (one would think so, given the workup you probably had to be diagnosed with LQTS2), and if so, was there any mention of such a defect (ASD or patent foramen ovale -- PFO)? If so, there could be some sort of obscure relationship between the LQTS and the migraine. Since migraine and hot flashes/flushing are also often seen prior to the onset of the regular menstrual period (as well as in premenopausal women), these two symptoms, which are new for you, might overlap some subtle atrial septal defect, which in turn could be related to the development of LQTS2, since both are heritable abnormalities.  This is all pretty wild speculation, but it would seem something is affecting a broad swath of neurological function in your body, and since migraine often involves one or more of the cranial nerves (V, VI and/or VII), two of which can also, if abnormally stimulated cause lengthening of the QT interval, a suggestive pattern starts to emerge here, even though there is no well-recognized syndrome which alone would account for all your new symptoms and LQTS; they do have some things in common, and I think it might be  worthwhile to have a neurologist explore these connections.   This is a pretty unusual syndrome you're experiencing, and I'm sure you've been seen by  a neurologist as well as cardiologists, but needless to say, the addition of these symptoms is not something anyone would want to have to deal with, and since you've tolerated invasive procedures and surgeries so well, I'm led to believe the LQTS2 may just be secondary to something else (and so perhaps not actually type 2).   I'm guessing, but the overlap of symptoms is far  too \"interesting\" to ignore. Hopefully you can be seen at a major medical center where neurology is an especially strong  suit. I just suspect there is some central cause for all this, and it may just require the right pair of eyes to discover what it is.  I hope this is helpful. It's certainly vague, but we want you to find an answer and hopefully a solution. I hope you'll follow up with  us here as needed and keep us updated as well. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Cystic adventitial disease",
    "content": "Hello -  These surgeries most often recover without complication, fairly quickly. The fact that you continue to have swelling and pain suggests one of two things: either this is a result of the first, misdirected surgery, or it  could be due to scar tissue having accumulated during the healing process (a fairly rare but not unheard-of complication). If the problems are  due to the first surgery it could be simply that it delayed proper correction of the  problem or that it started a new problem which is interfering with proper  recovery of the second surgery. At any rate it should be investigated thoroughly, as it may require some \"fine tuning\" surgically to make it right. One wouldn't normally be having these symptoms this far along, but since the correct surgery was not only delayed but a wrong surgery was  performed first, there may be additional  corrections that need to be made. If the same surgeon did both surgeries you may want to arrange a second opinion consult to avoid attempts to justify problems that only you are suffering with now.   I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck with this.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I apologize if my post seems quite long.  My mother, age 61, with diabetes type 1, and CAD had chest pain and visited the cardiologist.  After her visit, it was determined that she needed a stent placed.   She then proceeded to go into the hospital for a stent placement two days later.  I was told that the physician that placed the stent said that the blockage was so severe that the artery rerouted itself?  That when he went to place the stent the artery \"blew out\".  She then was to have emergent bypass surgery done.  During her preparation for the bypass surgery she suffered a myocardial infarction.  The bypass was successful as far as I know.   She then was transferred up to the CCU for recovery.  What followed was horrible.  Of course she was placed on many forms of life support, ie. ventilator, dialysis, heart pump, and her prognosis was unknown.  My family was then notified by the surgeon that my mothers mitral valve was not functioning correctly.  It was leaking but they thought it may be from the fluid overload because her kidneys were not functioning.   The doctors decided to let a few days go by and see if the valve would recover.  It did recover but the problem just came back.  We were then told she would have to have the second surgery to replace her mitral valve and have a ring placed around her tricuspid valve.  They did not know if she would make it through the surgery due to her poor health.   Well, the surgery was a success and as of now she had the ventilator removed yesterday but she still has kidney failure.   My question is, could this have been prevented?  When you do a stent placement can you tell if it just won't work and decide to go ahead with bypass?  Will her kidney's come back?  Thanks so much for any help!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  First, I'm very sorry to hear your mother has had to endure such a complex and problematic course and hope things are improving even as I write this.  What I believe the doctor meant by the artery having \"rerouted\" itself is that the blockage was severe enough that the  heart  built its own bypass, called a collateral blood supply. While this is usually a positive thing, if the collateral is too small (or there is  only one and it's not large enough to perform the  function of the original artery), then the original artery still  needs to be stented or bypassed. In attempting to place another stent it would seem the artery dissected, which is a rare but far from unheard-of complication of angioplasty and stent  placement. It often can cause a long enough interruption of blood  supply to cause an  MI, which is another recognized potential complication of percutaneous angioplasty and/or stent placement. Both dissection and subsequent MI are relatively rare, but happen often enough to be noted ahead of time as a possible complication  of the procedure. They do happen occasionally.  It seems as though almost everything that could go wrong did this time, as some myocardial infarctions (MI) can affect the way the ventricular wall moves, that it disturbs one of the  valves, and  the mitral valve is complex enough to be affected more often than not when this is the case.   To answer your bottom line question, it is very difficult, as a rule, to forsee the kind of catastrophic complications that your mother suffered. When these are predictable, the procedure isn't performed, at least not without discussing the additonal risks in advance. Usually it is a surprise to everyone. The cascading effect of injuries is  not surprising in itself, just unusual enough to be a surprise when most such procedures go without a hitch. Not all, however, and your mother  happens to be one of the exceptions that proves the rule.   I am very grateful she's doing so much better now. As for her kidneys, much depends upon the reason for the failure,  and again, this is not unusual in the cascade effect, where one organ failure leads to that of another. Since her heart seems  to be functioning far better now, there is a very good statistical likelihood her kidneys will recover their function, assuming there was no pre-existing kidney disease before the procedure and surgery.  Your mother sounds like someone with a substantial constitution to have survived the other mishaps, so I would  bet on  her recovering her kidney function as well. It's impossible to know any of these things with any certainty, and especially at a distance, but given the facts as you've presented them here, I think she may do well over time. I  certainly hope she  does.  I hope this helps answer your question. Please stay in touch with us here.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  Well, great news and some not-so-good news. While I'd like to emphasize the good news (your mom's home, she's off dialysis, she's over the hump and doing much better) I also understand the concern over the tremors and difficulty concentrating, and this probably would have been better addressed in a rehab facility (and is one of the main reasons that would have been offered). Of course this can be addressed on an outpatient basis as well, or should be. In fact, I would think the insurance company would be happier to have it worked on via outpatient basis.   But what is going on? Simply this: during the traumatic (to her body) events that resulted from what might otherwise have been a routine surgery, your mom's central nervous system has taken a hit. This is pretty common, and there are a lot of ways of mitigating the problems, most of which would involve some sort of physical therapy as well as, possibly, medication to help with mental clarity as well as controlling the tremors. This would depend upon how \"deep\" the CNS trauma is found to be. Often these things will resolve on their own over time, but because of the demoralizing effect, many times the things (routine activities) don't take place and so the problems linger. Physical therapy, outpatient rehab, is probably the best route toward resolving these lingering problems. Also, balancing the good news against the bad (she's out, she's home, she's on the mend, etc., vs. her hands shake and she's limited in what she can do right now) is important, because keeping the balance on the positive side in remarkably effective in the overall outlook. It's not just a mental \"trick\", either. It really makes a difference in the future improvement of the patient. People who feel positive about their situation, on balance, tend to do better overall. Now the bad thing already happened. It's been survived and that's a huge positive. There are often CNS aftereffects, but the prognosis for those (the tremors, etc.) should be pretty good.   I'm awfully happy to know your mom made it over the big bump, is home (a much better place than the hospital in general), and has recovered her kidney function. The remaining problems should be relatively easy to manage, and if they are kept in the proper perspective it can be a very literal help. But I would look into rehab/PT on an outpatient basis for sure, as this would speed the improvement of the remaining CNS issues.   Thanks so much for the update and again, I'm extremely happy to hear about the positive outcome. The rest can be managed. Best of luck to both of you, and please do stay in touch with us here.\n\n",

ESince I was 20 I had some fluttering feeling in my chest had an echo said it was mitral vavle prolapse.  really didn't start having horrible chest pain till March 2007 at age 26 a month after I had 2nd c section.  After about 3 days of chest pain one night I felt like I couldn't breath and my doctor believed I had a panic attack.  Never expirence that before.  So therefore I went for futher testing in July of 2007 had an echo and stress test done said it was normal and I don't have mitral vavle prolaspe.  Still having symptoms had thyroid checked because had a bit of hyperthyrodism in pregnancy but never medicated and levels were normal after pregnancy.  Even had radio iodine uptake test done and was normal.  Sometimes I did get symptoms of heart burn so in April of 2008 went to a GI doc.  she put me on priolsec 20 and pepacid 20mg @ bed.  Wanted to due a EDG but never was able to because I was dealing with going for acl surgery and rehab with that.  Then I got pregnant in july 2008.  the GI doctor thought maybe a hiatal hernia because I feel so short of breath all the time and was expirencing it quite a bit while driving.  Also in May of 2008 seen the cardiologist again did another stress test and was normal.  Wore a holter monitor in past never picked anything up.  My pregnacy is dealing with hyperthyroid again but the endoc. doc says the levels are acceptable and checks them once a month.  I am 20 weeks pregnant and been having horrible left sided chest pain.  Sometimes its on the side by my armpit sometimes at top of left breast.  Its so scary.  I do get back pain at times when it happens.  Is it anxiety or is there something wrong with me.  I'm so short of breath.  I still take the pepacid and tums but it never relieves it.  I did have my cholesterol tested in Nov 07 It was normal but the good cholesterol was low is what they told me.  My blood pressures been good just this past saturday it was 100/68.  I feel horrible so short of breath and have chest pain.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  What you describe does not sound  like it's heart related, which is, of course,  consistent with the findings of your cardio workups, so I think we can safely set that aside. That doesn't make the discomfort go away, however, so the trick now is to find out what the underlying cause of the pain is and treat that. It certainly could be anxiety, as this sort of pain (in this location) is quite often associated with chronic anxiety, as is the sensation of shortness of breath.   I do have a few questions which may help narrow down the field of possible causes: could you describe character of the pain in a little more detail, as well as how long it lasts? Also, does the pain occur when you attempt to draw a full, deep breath? Does it happen when you move your upper body in certain ways? These are very important considerations.   Anxiety, hiatal hernia (especially during pregnancy), and other upper GI problems, all are possibilities, as well as several inflammatory issues involving the ribcage and chest wall. None are life-threatening, but they all hurt, and  that's nothing anyone wants or needs. If we can narrow down the scope of this, we may be able to point you toward what's causing this and hopefully you can get someone to treat it appropriately. We pretty much know what it's not, but we need to figure out what it is. Please follow up with  us here. Thanks, and good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "The pain is quite consistent.  It doesn't change based on postion.  It doesn't get worse when I take a breath.  The pain is more of a stabbing to aching pain mostly left sided either side of left breast and sometimes it is felt under left arem area.  Also at times I feel the pain above the left brest and it feels like a deep muscle pain.  The pain will be present for a couple days to a week then disaapear for awhile.  The first time I ever noticed the deep muscle pain I described was the day I had the c section I told the nurse they did a cardiac  with CPK all normal and of course check for PE with the surgery.  After that and the Panic attack related episode in March 2007 it has never truly went away.  One more thing that may be of intreset is that my heart rate at times get tachycardic.  For example in MAy of this year I had acl surgery and in recovery my heart rate was in the 120s,  Also in July 2008 had to get a knee manipulation under anesthia and I m on the table and the nurse is saying my hr is 153.  Even after my surgeries when the give me pain meds. it still gets elvated.  Thats when the cardiologist was suspecting the thyroid but there always normal levels when I'm not pregnant.  I do have a huge goiter but it has remained unchaged for 3 years in size now.  My family history has thyroid both hyper and hypo.  They had already checked me for SVT and nothing came up.  Sorry if I have rambled on I'm just so frustrated with this situation\n\n",

    "content": "Hi -  I certainly understand your frustration with this. There are at least two underlying conditions which could, separately or jointly, contribute to the symptoms you've described. One is the anxiety problem, which is a constantly shifting galaxy of symptoms which often gets \"stuck\" in the area of possible cardiac symptoms, probably because this is generally considered one of the \"worst\" things that could happen. Also, the adrenaline released during periods of intense anxiety or a panic attack can cause many otherwise benign symptoms which indirectly affect the heart and nearby structures. Some people experience marked sinus tachycardia (as seems to be the case with you) without actual SVT taking place. Others, again like you, report recurrent, usually left sided, chest pains that are non-specific relative to cardiac symptoms, or are totally unlike cardiac pain, but do draw one's attention to the heart because of the nominal location. This is a very common complaint, and it is, of course, very real pain, but the cause of it is obscure, metabolic/musculoskeletal, and so will not set off any red flags in a cardio workup.   Then there is that family history of thyroid problems, which could be affecting this as well. Family thyroid history is often mixed, with some affected members being hyperthyroid and others being hypo. This will need to be followed periodically to be certain aren't developing new problems in that area as well.   It is all very frustrating, but the good news is that it is benign stuff. That doesn't necessarily make it go away, but knowing that can, at least, make it easier to adapt to it, and when we adapt to anxiety-based symptoms, given their tendency to shift and change anyway, they often will go away, almost as though they have a consciousness of their own (it is actually our own subconscious at work) and realize what they've been doing has lost its ability to alarm. Unfortunately they often move to some other area of concern, and this pattern can repeat indefinitely. It's a challenge, for sure, but one that can be managed and overcome, with patience and sympathetic healthcare providers.  Please stay in touch with us, follow up as needed, and keep us updated.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: heart burn and feeling faint when working out",
    "content": "Hi Adam -  While heartburn due to gastroesphogeal reflux (GERD) often occurs during workouts, the feeling-like-fainting sensation (presyncope) isn't normal. You may be simply and accidentally performing what's known as a valsalva maneuver during your super set; this is anything which involves straining, breath-holding or stretching in combinations which place pressure on the sinus of valsalva (a nerve bundle located near the heart) which will slow down the heart rate and can cause momentary slowing of the heart with subsequent lightheadness.   The sum total of symptoms are just enough to make me wonder whether or not there is some structural abnormality of your heart, however. While this is fairly unlikely, it is seen more in athletes, probably because they happen to perform more maneuvers which could be  considered valsalva maneuvers, and also they tend to build thicker heart muscle, which sometimes can be excessive and cause internal flow problems. While again this is fairly unlikely, there's just enough odd stuff going on to warrant perhaps a very basic workup by a cardiologist just to rule out any potentially serious problems, and then you can continue your workouts without undue concern. I hope you'll consider this.   Otherwise you sound pretty healthy. I'd just hate to think you might possibly have some structural abnormality that could be made more pronounced by extreme athleticism.   I hope this helps answer your concerns. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Heart Healthy Diet and Nutrition",
    "content": "I am confused about what diet regimen to follow for optimum heart health. I had a mild heart attack last October, followed by an angioplasty. The left coronary was 40% blocked, and one stent was implaced; the right coronary artery was 90% to 100% blocked and because 5 or 6 stents would have been required to open it up, no stenting was attempted. A bypass was postponed because, I was told, I had established a collateral artery, sort of a \"natural bypass,\" and I could focus on exercise and diet to strengthen and enlarge that collateral artery, and if successful after a period of time, I could forego further heart surgery. I have been enrolled in the hospital's cardio rehab clinic exercise program ever since and have generally felt much better, even trying to do a little jogging from time to time, and walking 2 or 3 miles every day at a pretty good clip. But diet continues to be a puzzle to me after reading so many conflicting things in the general literature available. I am genuinely confused. I have been about 60% vegetarian for the past 10 years, and since the heart problem errupted I have migrated to an even more severe vegetarian focused diet. I eat no dairy, no refined starch, and no red meat, only chicken breast and ocean fish for dinner. For breakfast I eat only fresh fruit, for lunch only vegetables and nuts. Sometimes a little dark chocolate. Drink nothing but green tea, herbal tea, and purified water. I use olive oil for cooking and salads; no other oils except flax seed oil occasionally.  Dean Ornish tells me to cut out all meat and fish, and all oils, even olive oil. Other medical writers recommend that I eat lots of fish and use plenty of olive oil, flax oil, hemp oil, krill oil, for the benefit of the Omega 3. I am confused about whether I can use any oil or not! Some say the Omega 3 is essential. Ornish just says don't eat any oils. I am considering moving to a raw food diet to cut out the meat. More of a vegan diet I suppose. But still the question of Omega 3 oil remains. Am I left merely with the supplements for Omega 3? Ornish bans even that. Who should I believe? Ornish and MacDougal claim scientific proof of the efficacy of their regimen. But I am of the opinion that the oil is essential (\"essential oils?\") and am reluctant to stop using them. Am I doing my arteries harm when I use olive oil on a salad, or stir fry vegetables with it? Please advise me of your take on this issue.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  There's certainly no shortage of conflicting \"authorities\" on what works and what doesn't, and some of these approaches, while they may \"work\" for many people, often \"work\" no better than what the American Heart Association promotes, which is a prudent, heart-healthy diet. You've already surpassed that in terms of what you're doing, and omega-3 fatty acids do have proven benefits that go even beyond heart health. Your current diet should be more than adequate to prevent the addition of any baneful substances, and may well help reduce your serum cholesterol. What you haven't mentioned, and I would love to find out, is what your most recent lipid profile (total cholesteral and breakdown of LDL, HDL and VLDL) looked like. Also, has your cardiologist prescribed you any statin drug to lower cholesterol? These are now believed to be beneficial in ways other than just the lowering of blood fats, and appear to reduce inflammation, which is also true of omega-3 fatty acids, but can  be administered as a known quantity (in addition to the healthy diet). Further, some statins would appear to have the potential to actually help reduce or remove plaque from arteries over time.   Since you're working on buiding colateral blood supply (a great do-it-yourself project for those able to do it), you want to keep the homemade bypass clean, and your diet will go a long way toward accomplishing that. A statin drug, unless there is a specific contraindication, would also add a good deal to the effort and is well worth the trouble (some are starting to regard statins as something like a vitamin or supplement, but that's still something of an avant-guard concept. Nonetheless, it's a great weapon in the arsenal against heart disease.   My personal opinion is that avoiding fad diets of all sorts, as well as complex guru-designed diets is wise. The diets which arise from consensus among the medical establishment are the most reliable,  and you're more than in the ballpark as far as that goes. Your diet would fit very well within the \"prudent\" guidelines of the AHA,  so I think you're definitely doing it right now, and wouldn't make life more complicated. Keep up the cardiac rehab program and listen to the nurses and techs who run that show. They'll provide you with AHA education that will be most useful and will avoid unecessary confusion.   Best of luck to you, and thanks for bringing this issue to the site, so that others with the same concern will see this discussion and hopefully benefit from it. Best of luck to you, and by all means follow up with us as necessary.\n\n",

    "title": "post-exercise spike in heart rate",
    "content": "Recently I started using a heart rate monitor during hill-climbing exercise. I noticed that when I stop to rest my heart rate goes up significantly before going back down. For example, if my heart rate is 138 when I begin to rest, 5-10 seconds later it will typically average above 145 for 10-15 seconds during which it will often spike as high as 158. After this it will begin to decrease and 30-40 seconds after the beginning of the rest period it will generally be below 120 and I will feel able to resume activity.  The research on heart rate recovery within 1 minute of exercise prompts this question.   Measured 1 minute after exercise, there does not appear to be a problem. It is the intervening spike in heart rate that is mystifying.  I am a 58 year old male with general good health. I typically climb 400-800 vertical feet in each exercise session and have been doing this 3-5 times a week for 8-10 weeks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  What you describe is actually not at all unusual, and so long as it doesn't persist for more than a few minutes, is normal. What happens is that during recovery after exercise there frequently is a metabolic shift momentarily, as the residual adrenaline in the bloodstream \"hits\" while  the body is trying to slow down. The brief and relatively mild  \"spike\" you describe is normal for selected individuals so long as it does not persist beyond a minute or so. This is why recovery rate is checked beginning one to five minutes after a five-minute cooldown (which is a factor you didn't mention, and which can help eliminate this rebound effect). A cooldown is always recommended, but either way you seem to be managing the level of exercise intensity very well. Good work!  I hope this answers your concern.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  The difference in  heart size is not really that big an abnormality as a rule. Many people, especially those who are relatively tall and slim (as it sounds like your boyfriend is) have smaller-than-average hearts, and there's nothing really wrong with this. Sometimes  people with this sort of body type (or morphology) also have a problem with occasional lightheadedness or \"seeing stars\", although that may also be something else entirely (does he feel faint when this happens, or does he see little lights with no other symptoms?). There could be an eye problem, or he could even be experiencing optical migraine, which is also often seen in people with this sort of body morphology.    Assuming a squatting position, in certain  people, also can cause changes in the way the heart \"sees\" the load being imposed on it, and it may even make somewhat different sounds in that position. Still,  as a rule, it means nothing. Positional tachycardia is not unusual, especially in people of this sort of build.   The \"tangled\"  vein going to his testacles is something else again, and would be unrelated to any heart issues. Is this vein visibly tangled or is  this  something that can only be felt? I guess what I'm wondering is if it is a  veing that's tangled (this would be unusual, although it can happen) or if it is merely the way one epididymis feels to the touch. The latter is a fairly normal finding. A \"tangled\" vein could suggest  a minor problem, although without symptoms it  probably isn't anything to be concerned about.  I hope this is helpful to you -- and to your boyfriend. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: High HDL Cholesterol",
    "content": "Hello -  HDL cholesterol usually runs  in the 35-50 mg/dl range, whereas your reading would be 156, which is remarkably high. While  HDL is considered \"good\" cholesterol, if the readings were all correct you'd need something to bring down the LDL anyway (yours would be  140, and we prefer to see it below 130 in otherwise healthy people and  the closer to 100, the better). Your triglycerides are also a little high, and arbitrarily 20% of triglycerides is counted as very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), which along with LDL is considered \"bad.\" Even if your HDL were a believable number (and the higher the better, in general), you'd probably be a candidate for treatment of the overall level, and Caduet makes sense since your blood pressure readings have been unacceptably high.   All that being said, and believing the medication seems appropriate, any time a reading comes through as profoundly \"wrong\" as your HDL did, one has to suspect a lab  error and there should be a retest just to be certain. Now even if a repeat bears out the oddly high HDL reading, this is still usually seen as an offset to other elevated components. This is usually a familial trait and in some studies has been believed to have contributed to certain families having a trait called \"morbid longevity\", where people live remarkably long times due to the presence of such high levels of \"good\" cholesterol. Again, even so, the  medication (or some other combination) would be appropriate.   If you're having unacceptable side effects from the Caduet, there are plenty of other combinations of lipid-reducing statin drugs and blood pressure medications.  I don't think your wine consumption is excessive, nor should it contribute to your quite high blood pressure. In fact, alcohol consumption, if very moderate (such as your two glasses -- per day, one assumes), should  help increase the  HDL level, help maintain general  cardiac health, and even lower your blood pressure. While there may be other factors your doctor has taken into consideration, really this moderate amount of wine is generally thought to be beneficial (though not usually specifically recommended).   Your cholesterol levels really should be retested, though, because of the extremely unusual high HDL finding. If that were to repeat, as I've said above, then it probably would work in your favor, although your LDL and VLDL, as well as triglycerides, would need to be treated anyway, along with the blood pressure problem. The wine intake should be beneficial unless there's some other reason to eliminate it altogether.  I hope this is helpful to you. Please let us know if you learn anything further regarding the very odd HDL finding, as you may actually be the benefiary of a positive genetic \"disorder\" -- or you may have experienced a gross  lab error.   Best of luck to you.  Please stay in touch here.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -   Actually it sounds pretty normal, especially the numbness in the back of your left thigh after having been sitting for a while. This is known as \"wallet sciatica\" and is peculiar to males, who, as a rule, carry their wallets in the left hip pocket, putting pressure on the sciatic nerve.   As for the arms falling asleep while sleeping, that sounds like a quite possibly normal response to faulty posture or position while asleep, something we have very little control over. It can be due to a \"wrong\" pillow or just a wrong positioning of the head/neck during sleep. While all of this could be some arcane neurological problem, the two things are so common  that I truly suspect they are totally normal.   Loss of energy is the one thing that truly warrants some investigation, and that can only be figured out by means  of a routine physical and some accompanying  lab work to see if there's anything out of kilter in the bloodwork, enzymes, etc. However, being unhappy and being a smoker both could contribute tremendously to the loss of energy. Still, given those two qualifiers, you're probably due for a thorough physical.  Overall you sound pretty healthy for your age. Hope this helpful. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: continuous hard heart beats",
    "content": "Hi there -  What you're describing is actually a classic set of symptoms for acute anticipatory anxiety. Given that you're anticipating something which, in the short term, would seem to be pretty upsetting and unpleasant, this makes eminently good sense.   The problem is that anxiety doesn't serve any useful purpose most of the time.    The hard heartbeats are usually referred to as palpitations. This simply means an unpleasant awareness of the heartbeat. It can be due to extra adrenaline turned loose in the bloodstream due to anxiety or frank fear (or other types of excitement, even positive sorts), or it can be due to occasional  premature heartbeats, which also can be caused by excess adrenaline or just increased levels of anxiety. In either case it's a lot less cause for concern than it might seem. Oh,  and the heart rate you note, 81, is absolutely normal (anything between 60 and 100 falls into the \"normal\" range). Absolutely all the other symptoms you list also fit into the classic picture of acute anxiety, and they will probably resolve on their own once the issue has been faced, regardless of the outcome. Even so, I do hope things work out favorably for you. Life is full of worrisome things like this, and as we grow we learn that there's always something worse that could happen, and our tolerance for adversity tends to increase, so our threshold for anxiety and these symptoms increases with time.  In  short, it is a completely normal and understandable physical reaction to worrying about your academic situation, and once it's all come out you should feel better, at least in terms of the current symptoms. You may find something new to worry about, as life does \"keep coming at us.\" Hopefully you'll begin to recognize your body's response to these challenges and they won't worry you as much next time it happens.   If the report card was already delivered and the  consequences have already happened, it is possible you are experiencing self-perpetuating anxiety over the symptoms themselves, which is a secondary problem that  happens in certain people. Knowing that the symptoms are normal is important.   Best of luck to you either way. Please feel free to follow up with  us and keep us updated.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: continuous hard heart beats",
    "content": "Hi again -  Sweating of the fingers is often part of the broader picture of classic anticipatory anxiety. The problem with anxiety is that once the initial trigger has passed, as in your case (and not terrible news after all, so good for you!), the anxiety can become self-perpetuating.   If this becomes so distracting and disturbing to you that it's actually disabling (and this is entirely possible in extreme instances), there are sometimes medications that can be prescribed to mute the symptoms and take the edge off the anxiety. Some are psychoactive meds, such as clonazepam or one of the SSRI antidepressants, or sometimes it is treated symptomatically with a low-dose of a beta blocking drug, which reduces the force of the heartbeat (and slows the rate, also). Your doctor would have to make the determination as to whether any of these would be  appropriate for you, but they are things you could at least discuss with him.   I hope this helps. We frequently do see people have latent anxiety symptoms set off and  become cyclical (self-perpetuating) and sometimes this cycle has to be broken via medication, or, in some instances, by cognitive behavioral therapy, which can be very effective without the use of drugs. All this would  need to be run by your doctor, of course.   Best of luck to you. Please let us know how things go.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Okay I'm gonna start from the beginning so you can understand a bit. I was born with a Heart Murmur as a baby, the dr's told her I would out grow it when I got older. Though...I never did, But my Heart Murmur was nothing serious. They even have done Ultrasound Test's on my heart, just too make sure. At the age of 10, I started having...problems..sleeping. One night I woke up gasping for air as my airhole felt as if it was closed. Of course I was Scared, It took I dunno 10-19 seconds too get my air back. This would happen alot, and I always thouht it was due to my Heart Murmur. I also couldn't sleep on my back, if I laid or tried sleeping on my back. I would of course wake up and wouldn't be able to breath like the air got tooken from me for awhile.  I would bring it up but I never got any real Answers. So I never took it so seriously I just figured well....maybe its part of having a heart murmur. This would go on alot, Each year as I got older the lesser it started too happen. As long as I didnt accidently fall on my back asleep or lay too low I was okay. When I was about 14 It kinda faded off so I kinda felt good.  When I got Pregnant with my first child..I noticed it came back but alot worser. It would happen alot. Sometimes twice a week sometimes more. I could never rest when I was Pregnant. After I had my First child, the problem's slipped away. And When I had my Second Child The Problem Came back, And Now I'm carrying my Third Child [ Actually my last that Im allowed too have ]. I'm not far along..but Dismorning when I was drifting back too sleep. I got woken up and I felt no air..I was scared...and I thought I was dieing.. and I couldnt get my breath back and I ran too the bathroom and I finally got it back. My Boyfriend ran upstairs said he heard me and asked me if I was alright. I started too cry and I told him ''it's back''. I looked on line dismorning...trying too find answers, Solution's. I could not find anything linking too a heart murmur that sounds Similar too the problem Im having. Instead I found it odd how alot of people were having same Similar problems too what I am having. And It was Called ''Sleep Apnea''. I ain''t for sure if this what I have or may be it sounds like something different. I want to know what is going on so I can speak with my Baby's Dr when I call her up Sometime Next week. I am tired of being scared, Im tired of feelin like one day I wont be able to get my breath back. I'm not even sure if that could be a Possibilty?. I'm afraid it may get worser, Im afraid it may lead into something bad. I just want a normal life. And Im only looking for answer's Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Of course this is a very scary feeling.  It is very likely you are experiencing sleep apnea and this can be serious so it is important you talk to your doctor about it.  Sleep studies can be done and some people benefit from having CPAP prescribed for sleep.  You wear a mask (like and oxygen mask) that delivers air in little bits of pressure so you don't have these episodes.  If you are a candidate, this can make all the difference to you.  Most people report they feel much better during the day as well once they are getting good, restful sleep at night.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I am a 22 year old man otherwise healthy. for the past two weeks i have been experiencing pain in my left pinky and ring finger when my hand is open, random mild pains around my left arm near biceps, triceps, wrist that comes and goes (the arm pain, the ring finger/pinky pain is constant). I have also been experiencing mild pain on the left side of my neck when i move it around, and mild heartburn that comes and goes. Can this be heart related? I think its worth it to mention i have a heart murmur, and that on october 17th 08 i was in the emergency room for taking a high dosage of crystal methamphetamine which caused mild dehydration and shortness of breath and lack of sleep for three nights which prompted me to go to emergency. There they took blood, urine test, and checked my heart with a machine. Is that sufficient testing to make sure my heart is completely ok? This was my third time smoking meth, the first two were 5 years ago. needless to say it was my last time, although I am worried it may have cause some permanent damage which is causing the ring finger/pinky pain and etc.  Also if t matters, i have two bottom wisdom teeth that grew sideways under my gums, ive had them for about 1 year without removing them yet.  Thank you\n\n",

    "title": "Re: left ring finger/pinky pain and more, heart related?",
    "content": "Hello -  While the pain pathway you describe is often cited as part of the route of radiated or atypical cardiac pain (an you may know this, as you have described it so expertly), it doesn't sound like that's what's happening in your case. Also, since the neck pain can be duplicated by movement that not only disqualifies it as heart-related pain, but leaves open the possibility of ulnar nerve pain due to something going on with the cervical spine, which you may want to look into at your leisure.   You've had a reasonably thorough rule out of heart-related problems also, because of your ER visit and EKG, which took  place during a time of more than ordinary stress on your heart (you state you'd been smoking meth at the time, so if you had any heart problems they would have been very likely to show up during that time). Needless to say, meth can damage the heart over time, and it would seem you've come to the good conclusion that it's not a good idea. If not, I'll help you with that. It's a really bad idea. I only reiterate this for you because it can cause serious health  problems, with heart being at the top of the list. I don't moralize to people or judge them, but I do try to keep them healthy, and as I'm sure you realize, meth abuse is extremely unhealthy. 'Nuf said.  I think your heart is fine, and hope you will do your part to keep it that way. I also think the pain you describe is probably related to the neck pain/stiffness, and may be due to pressure on the ulnar nerve at the cervical outlet, which is at C7 - T1, just for future reference. It so happens that heart pain travels the ulnar pathway, so many people become concerned when they experience pain along this route. However, any irritation of the ulnar nerve can cause similar pain, as well as tingling and frank numbness in that part of the hand.   I hope this is helpful to you. Best of luck to you, and please follow up with us as necessary.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  While the findings cited by the doctors following your son's ER visits are quite possibly \"normal\" (both the valvular regurgitation, if mild, and the conduction defect, are common  enough), he should be followed non-urgently by a family doctor to make certain  his symptoms are not cardiac related. They are, in fact, probably anxiety related, and the less-than-perfect findings in the ER are basically within normal limits, or at least that's what the doctors feel (and these are quite ordinary findings). The conduction delay is probably a right bundle branch block, which generally has no significance, but should be noted on regular physical exams, especially if it is  intermittent -- only for the record, not because it means anything.  I hope this is helpful to you. Your son sounds as though he may have some incipient anxiety problems, and these commonly start to show up during adolescence. It's also important to have a physician evaluate the whole picture in a calm, non-urgent setting. This will  serve as a good baseline for any  future problems, and can be used as a reference point for what is \"normal\" for your son.   Best of luck to you.

There is no hard and fast rule on this, but once it's present in a genealogical line, it can certainly turn up again.

    "content": "Over the last month I have noticed that my heart rate while doing my 30 minutes on the treadmill has increased.  My regular routine is to go 3.8 mph at a 4.0 incline.  I've done this for years.  My heart rate is usually in the 130-135 bpm range.  Last week I decided I was going to start running for 2 minutes and increase it 15 seconds each time half way through my walking, eventually building up to 10 minutes.  On the first day of running at a speed of 6 mph (a 10 minute mile pace), one minute into my run I grabbed the handles of the treadmill and my heart rate was at 170 bpm.  That freaked me out.  I wasn't getting too winded or anything but seeing such a high number was a bit unnerving.  It took a couple hours for my heart rate to get back down under 100.  A couple days later I ran for 3 minutes and the same thing, 1 hour after leaving the gym my heart rate was still 110.  It took several hours to have my heart rate return to the 75-80 range.  Today while only walking on the treadmill at the usual speed and incline, my heart rate was 145-150 bpm.    I'm 42 years old, a bit anxious about things - especially when it comes to changes in my health.  I do not get any pain in my chest while exercising, just a really fast heart rate and a super long recovery time to get back to normal.  Is my heart pumping extra fast trying to get blood out to the periphery? Is it a symptom of clogged arteries?  I once had an ultrasound 14 years ago which showed trivial mitral regurge.  They said it was a normal thing in many males.  Could this be something that has gotten worse and the heart has to pump faster when exercising?  Thanks for the response.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  Given the sudden increase in intensity of your workout from 3.8 to 6.0, you may have simply surprised your heart and changed your threshold for heart rate. While  we generally observe the theoretical maximum rate as 220 minus one's age (which would give you a \"maximum\" heart rate of 178), and try to reach a person's maximum rate during routine stress testing (barring any untoward symptoms which would cause us to slow or stop the test), you actually \"jumped\" into a peak stress test situation on that first big step up in speed. It's been my observation  that many people react to this by a sort of reflex tachycardia that doesn't slow down as quickly as one would expect ideally, but without significant changes in EKG waveform nor any untoward symptoms.   The fact that your rate hits 145 - 150 while walking on the treadmill is a little bit odd, and for this reason, primarily, you might want to have a physical exam to determine if you might have something else going on, such as a viral infection, an unrecognized anemia, or some other indirect cause of this change. The  other numbers aren't too surprising, but the  last number you mentioned is rather unusual and may represent some undue fatigueability.  After 14 years you're also entitled to a follow-up echocardiogram,  although trivial mitral regurge is extremely common and usually \"normal\" among the general, healthy adult population. It could ease your mind to know there's nothing going on with the mitral valve, or, if by the  extremely off-chance there is, that would also be useful information. However, I'd almost be willing to bet that hasn't changed enough to account for your numbers (and I say \"numbers\" because other than the sign of increased peak heart rate and slower recovery time, you appear to have zero symptoms). It's just prudent to have an occasional complete physical and it wouldn't be wrong to have that echo as well, again, if only to ease your mind.  Sounds as though you're in good shape. Only one way to be certain, of course. Make an appointment and get a complete checkup.   I hope this is helpful to you. Best of luck, and please do follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

I am planning on a new tattoo (on the inside of my left forearm) and I have read only one bried thing on-line that says, basically:you might want to stop Plavix for a few days prior to the tattoo because of higher-than-usual underskin bleeding, which could cause the ink to run and, thus, blur/ruin the tattoo design  I have a call into my cardiologist, but I'm still waiting to hear back from him. I will NOT do anything until I do hear from him, but I thought I'd seek additional feedback on this site.  Thanks in advance. LogicAl2008\n\n",

While it probably wouldn't cause any other problems, it really could screw up the tattoo, which of course is not the goal of getting one. If your cardiologist gives the OK to a brief cessation of the Plavix, that may work, but I'm not sure, if it were me, that the tattoo would be that urgent. I think I'd probably just let it wait a while.   Glad you put in the call to your cardiologist. If he OKs it then I sure hope it turns out well. Best of luck to you.

    "content": "Thanks for your reply, Mr Kenyon.  My cardiologist got back to me and said that after review of my records, he is unwilling to submit that I temporarily stop taking Plavix & Aspirin due to the risks associated with my health and past history.  He said that if I ever need major surgery - gall bladder, etc. - that would require I stop Plavix a few days prior to surgery, then that is a must and the risk has to be taken. But, for a tattoo, he is not willing to sign off on me putting my life on the line.  So, what I've decided to do is visit the tattooist to have a small, obscurely-placed tattoo test done to see if I have excessive under-skin bleeding. If this test blurs because of that, then I'll have to go w/o the new tattoo. But, if it seems to take properly, then we'll probably proceed forward.    The only step I would take - w/o my doctor's blessings, is to not take my Plavix the morning of the new tattoo until after the process is completed - taking my daily dose soon after.  Thanks again for your reply and any feedback you have based on this update.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello again -  I would concur with your doctor completely. There's usually a good reason for putting a patient on a blood thinning medication, and only a clear and presently urgent situation requiring surgery would make a reasonable case for going off that medication. However, I do think your idea of a test tatoo is pretty clever and should give you what you'll need to know whether or not to go forward with the real one. While I won't advocate skipping a dose of Plavix, if you choose to do it this way you'll be making an informed decision and will be reducing the risk to its lowest level.   Good luck with this project. I'll be anxious to hear how things turn out.\n\n",

I have a sort of mild anomaly in the ribcage, I'm almost certain that it's not pectus excavatum, even though I don't know its name. When I was little there was a more noticeable depression under (not at) my sternum, which became less evident with time (I'm now 26), perhaps because it's reduced in proportion with the rest of the chest or something else.  I'm also somewhat suspicious of having some sort of heart or circulatory issue, but not quite sure. I'm going to see a doctor in order to check that, and I was wondering if that was something that I should mention, since it may not be easily noticed. In the other hand, I'm also somewhat afraid of sounding like a hypochondriac, as if I was \"wanting\" to have something wrong, since, to begin with, I think I don't fit very well with the profile of high-risk for heart conditions (not old aged, some belly fat but very far from being obese, I think I have a \"somewhat-low-but-yet-good-or-even-better\" blood pressure, never smoke, drunk or used any other drug, except for coffee).  I've read once that pectus excavatum has \"something to do with the heart\", but I've not researched deeply about it. I recall something about the heart being in a different place than it usually is, since the sternum is almost touching the spine. It's very far from my case, but anyway, perhaps it could be slightly misplaced in a manner that had to be taken in consideration for exams, or whatever.  Here are two pictures of 2 x rays I took when I was 5 years old:  (click to enlarge)       So, is it meaningful information, or something that does not really worth mentioning?

    "content": "Hi there -  While pectus excavatum is sometimes associated with certain anatomical heart abnormalities (odd position being the main one) and occasionally with mitral valve prolapse as well, these are not usually problematic. Then again, having looked at the very good reproductions of your childhood x-rays,  I don't see what looks like  pectus excavatum, either. I can see a bowing of the sternum with the inward curvature inferiorly, but it doesn't appear pronounced. If it's improved in the interim, it's probably not of any significance at all by now.   If you've had some symptoms which make you wonder if you may have some sort of heart problem then you're wise to have this checked out, and if there is any residual anatomical abnormality, trust me, the doctor will take note of it. It may just not rate any mention at the time of the exam.   Hopefully everything else turns out well. You could mention the anatomical abnormality if you like, and the doctor may be able to explain what it is or was. I don't think he's likely to bring it up on his own, however, unless he finds something specifically relating it to any heart issue that may be uncovered.   Best of luck to you. I hope this is helpful.  Let us know how things go with the doctor visit.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Intraaortic Balloon Pump - impella device",
    "content": "Hello -  The intra-aortic baloon pump counterpulsation device sounds like it may be just the ticket for this situation, assuming your husband hasn't had any valve replacements nor any other contraindications to use of the pump.  The device, inserted via the femoral artery and moved up into the aorta, pulsates in place, reducing the workload on the heart for given periods of time (five days is certainly within the window of utility for it).  A ballon is inserted into the aorta at the end of a catheter connected to a pump outside the entry point near the groin (into the femoral artery). When the heart pumps blood out (systole) the baloon deflates, then when the heart rests between beats, the baloon inflates (counterpulsation) to help force the blood along without the heart having to do all the work. Five days of this should fit the requirements of this repair surgery in most cases.   The possible complications are few, and include its  partial presence in the femoral artery which can cause compartment syndrome, which, at least in theory (and in a very few real cases) can cause mild to severe injury to the leg itself. This is still a relatively small risk vs the benefits of the pump, and a rare complication. Other possible complications include formation of an embolism while the device is being put in place, and embolization upon removal. Needless to say these problems are thoroughly addressed, so this  risk is relatively small.  I hope this explanation makes sense and that this will be considered as an adjunct to surgical repair for your husband. It sounds promising to me.   Best of luck to you. Please let us know how things work out.\n\n",

If  it continues to bother you more than a couple days you probably should have that hands-on exam just to be sure.   I hope this  is helpful.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: pain in back and chest (left) for about a year",
    "content": "Hello -  The pain you describe is almost certainly not heart-related. The fact that it's remained stable for an entire year argues against it, as does your age (or youth). Further, heart pain cannot be duplicated by moving the upper body, which is something  you mentioned (moving your back a certain way). Finally, cardiac pain is almost never described as \"sharp.\"  Since it radiates and is aggravated by certain movements, it probably involves impingement of a nerve. This is a very common problem, and  while a chiropractor may be able to help with it, first you need to know what the problem  is, so an orthopedist would probably be your best starting point for that.  You also state you have a lot of anxiety as well as some depression (the two often go hand in hand, as depression follows panic attacks many times the way a hangover follows a drinking binge). I don't know what medication  you've been prescribed for this, but there's very little chance that it would disagree with you and certainly wouldn't do any harm. If it should produce unwanted side effects such as a worsening of your anxiety (antidepressants sometimes do have this side effect where anxiety is also present) there are many alternate drugs which can be prescribed, but you owe it to yourself to at least give it a try, since more often than not the relief is enormous and unwanted side effects are relatively rare and not serious.  You definitely could be having panic attacks, and  your concern over the pain you've been experiencing could well produce the occasional panic attack, since the process of ruminating over physical symptoms can accellerate very rapidly and throw one into feeling as though  something terrible is happening when not much of anything is happening in reality. This is a rough thing to have to live with, and so is chronic pain. If you could separate the two and have each of them treated (you already have medication for either anxiety or depression, and quite often antidepressants are used to treat anxiety as well, so it's really worth a try -- and if it disagrees with you it can be discontinued and/or changed).  I  hope this has been of some help to you. Bring the pain to the attention  of an orthopedist, and give the medication a trial of maybe a set number of weeks (if is is an antidepressant  they can take up to a couple weeks to become fully effective, so maybe try it for a month and if it seems to be working, just keep on with it -- if not,  stop it and discuss the reason for stopping  with your doctor).   Best of luck to you with this. It's not easy, but it all can be managed. You just have to take that first step.\n\n",

    "content": "Last night while I was standing outside with my dog letting her do her business I started to feel sick. I couldn't place exactly how I felt except that my stomach didn't feel right. The sensation came on instantly. I went inside and sat down. Then I started to get an icy sensation just come on and went through my entire body. Almost the feeling you get when you've slept on your arm and it hasn't received any circulation and then you suddenly relieve that pressure. At first I though I should take my temperature but then I decided I just needed to go straight to my parents room and tell them. I went to my parents room and felt like it was hard to breath normally whether it was due to a symtom or if I just felt uncomfortable with the chills. I woke my parents up but had trouble holding myself up. My mom made me lay down on the bed and checked my pulse. She's a registered nurse and said that she had trouble finding a pulse at first and then when she found it she said that it was irregular. She said she was worried I was going to faint. After a minute or two the icy sensation started to subside and I started to feel well again. The icy sensation didn't completely go away for another 5 to 10 minutes. This morning when I woke up I felt fine.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Icy chill through my entire body.",
    "content": "Hi there -  From your description of the episode, I suspect one of two things happened. Either you suffered a vasovagal episode, with slowed heartbeat and a drop in blood pressure -- something that some people experience when they have blood drawn, see blood, are exposed to cold air or are immersed in cold water, or sometimes have it triggered by emotional stressors; or you may have experienced an episode of an irregular heartbeat such as atrial fibrillation or some other arrhythmia. The former (vasovagal episode) is not serious, but usually there is a history of this happening; the latter could be serious or not, depending upon what sort of arrhythmia you may have experienced, if that's what it was.   I am inclined to lean toward vasovagal near-syncope (near faint), but you really need to be evaluated for this, perhaps having an event monitor to record the heart's activity for a month, in which case the heart's activity could be recorded (you do have to push a button to catch the dysrhythmia, then phone it in), and maybe a tilt-table test as well. At any rate, a cardiological workup is certainly appropriate. I suspect this is probably not a life-threatening thing, but it could lead to unexpected falling due to faintness, which can cause indirect injury due to a blow to the head or if one is driving,  well, it's never good to pass out behind the wheel.   Definitely see a cardiologist for a complete evaluation. Most of the problems I've mentioned can be managed without too much fuss, sometimes with medication,sometimes simply with awareness of what's going on.  Please do this though, and keep us updated as well. Best  of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  I'm not sure what constitutes \"definitive\" information for you regarding this matter, but I can tell you that manufacturers of these devices specifically list arc welders among the devices to be \"avoided\" when one has an ICD. A MIG welder certainly qualifies under this proscription, and can absolutely cause the device to become \"confused\" and either fire inappropriately or fail to fire. It can also potentially cause damage to the microprocessor, so that you simply might not know the device was no longer operational. My source for this information has been face-to-face discussions with manufacturer's reps and also printed informational sheets from the manufacturers. Perhaps you could do an on-line search using the name of the manufacturer of your device if you require (perhaps for employment purposes) some documentable specifics in this regard. Otherwise, I can tell you that yes, arc welders are among the devices to be avoided.   I hope this is helpful to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  I would certainly advise against the use of ECA in any case, but by now it should be clearing your system. Due to the components there is always likely to be some increase in heart rate and cardiac output, and the flushing or skin redness is probably also due to the stimulant effects. If the reaction hasn't subsided by now, you probably would do well to bring this to the attention of your doctor.   Assuming you have no history of heart problems nor of high blood pressure, the untoward effects will probably be mild and transient, but again, I could not in good conscience approve of ECA use unless it were, for some reason, specifically prescribed by a medical professional, a very unlikely thing at best.   I hope this is helpful.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  Within the last month I have had four episodes of sudden onset, sharp (excruciating) left chest pain. The pain is always right next to my left breast and slightly underneath it. The pain comes on so suddenly and is so painful it takes my breath away. It only lasts for 30 seconds or so, but afterward that side of my chest has a dull ache. One of the times this happened my left arm felt heavyand achy for quite a while afterward. After that episode I went to the doctor and he did a CT scan where they inject the dye. The test results were fine. My doctor said it might be a pain caused by smoking and allergies where there is a tug on something in the lungs. I find that diagnosis hard to believe. I have never experienced this pain prior to this last month and now the episodes are happening more frequently. It isn't a constant inconvenience; however if I were to be driving when this pain occurred, I would surely get in an accident. Any suggestions are greatly appreciated. Thank you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Sudden, Sharp Left Chest Pain",
    "content": "Hello -  When you had the CT done, did the doctor also do an EKG? Although your description of the pain sounds like nothing cardiac-related, I would think the doctor would want to rule out the most serious things first.  The pain, as described, sounds like it could be muscular or possibly pain due to an irritated/inflamed nerve, most likely. It could also be due to costochondritis, and this can usually be demonstrated by the ability to reproduce the pain by certain movements of the torso. I don't know if that's a factor you haven't  mentioned.   I think the \"tug on the lungs\" suggestion probably meant pleuritic pain (from pleurisy, an inflammation of the pleura, the lining that separates the lungs from the chest wall). Pleuritic pain is usually deep and burning in nature, but also can be very sharp and stabbing, and in any case usually has a little \"after\" sensation, which you may be feeling in your arm when this happens. If this is the case (certainly another possibility) then it responds to non-steroidal anti-inflammatories like ibuprofin. However, it is usually aggravated by a deep breath.   If there are any other factors such as aggravation by movement or deep breathing, please let me know. Otherwise, I would simply bring this back to the attention of your doctor (or another doctor if this one seems uninterested in pursuing the problem) as the pain in itself is not a very acceptable thing to have to live with if there is a fix for it, which there certainly should be.  These are my best guesses, which is about all we can do at a distance. Again, if there are any other factors you can think of,please follow up with us here.  Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  It sounds as though you may have several different things going on at once. The one thing that is of greatest concern is of course defining the nature of the cramping pain in your chest. First, if you could describe it as accurately as possible, as well as its location (different people have differing notions of what \"the heart area\" is) it would  be helpful in trying to figure out what may be going on. Meanwhile, the next time you have this sort of episode (chest cramping and headache) it would be very helpful if you could have your blood pressure checked at the time. I realize this may not be possible, but it would be very helpful.   Have you brought all this to the attention of your doctor? That would be the most direct way to determine what may be going on. It is very difficult to guess at a distance.   I hope you'll give us some more details, and that you will also tell your doctor about this series of issues. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi kerry24-  It sounds as though you've been inactive enough for long enough that you've suffered some slight damage to the valves in the leg veins, which may be causing poor venous return. It sounds like it is not too severe, since it only happens when you've been lying down and then get up. If you continue your exercise program this may correct on its own. If not, the important thing will be to remain active so that you don't ever develop clots in your legs. You could have some other vascular problems upstream from the calves, but I doubt it given your description. If there is no swelling in the calves or at the ankles, then I don't think you are holding any water. Some people have acrocyanocis normally, which is a bluish discoloration of the extremities when they stand. It doesn't usually have any significance.   In your case I think remaining active is by far the most important thing.   Best of luck to you.\n\n",

It sounds as though you are making the best of a difficult situation, and  although exertion does seem to really tire you, it's of course important to get up and move around at regular intervals as much as is feasible. I know you're working against a diffcult set of circumstances.  I wish I could give you some more helpful answer to the problem, but we'll just have to keep our fingers crossed that you find a doctor who can come up with the answer. Meanwhile, take care of yourself as best you can. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Fast heart beat- really need beta blocker?",
    "content": "Hi, I am a 38 year old female, in good health, exercise regularly, my normal blood pressure is 100/60 or in that area.  I've recently been to a cardiologist for a fainting episode and also for an irregular heart beat, like a heavy beat.  The doctor said I have an extra beat, and he told me to wear a Holter monitor for 24 hrs.   I went back in for the results and was told that he wasn't concerned w/the irregular beat, it wasn't a matter of life and death, but he was concerned w/my average heart beats per minute.  For that day, when I was wearing the monitor, it was averaging 90, which he said, is on the high side of normal (between 60-100).  So, he put me on a beta blocker (Sectral).  My question is, he never asked me how active I was during the day- which I am very active.  Always up cleaning, vaccuuming, walking dogs, going to my kids' schools, exercising, don't sit down until around 8:00 pm when the kids are in bed and I finally relax. When I'm sitting, my resting bpm is around 70.  When I'm up and moving around, it's around 92 or so.  Do I really need to be on a beta blocker for this?  I was on it for a couple of days last week, and felt awful, drowsy, insomnia, restlessness, made me very very anxious, couldn't even go in and eat in a restaurant, could barely exercise...I was only on it for 2 days (200 mg. twice a day).   Thank you for your help!  p.s.  The fainting episode we think, was handled fine.  I had taken dramamine that day, and we know that it can cause palpitations, and low blood pressure, so the doc thinks that maybe w/my already existing irregular heart beat, the dramamine further affected it and also caused a drop in my blood pressure, causing me to faint.  I was sitting down though, didn't get up from a seated position, was already seated and fainted...that's the only peculiarity. Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Cat512 -  I think I replied to another post by you on this same subject elsewhere in the topic here, but it didn't mention the fainting episode. I was wondering what had caused your doctor to do the workup to start with, and now I know.   This was completely appropriate, since your faint was an isolated first event, and if the Dramamine was \"original forumula\", then yes, it could cause heartbeat irregularities and might have lowered your blood pressure as well. The original Dramamine is an old-type antihistimine, and some of those can do that in certain people.  None of this changes my feelings about your doctor prescribing Sectral in your case, however. Please see the other thread for my observations about that or, if you're still checking in here, respond to either post. I think it's important, and in your other post I believe you were planning to discontinue the Sectral. A good idea, and good that you planned to let the doctor know first. However, I'm now hoping you will follow up with us, because I am interested in the fainting episode, especially since it happened while seated.   Hope all is well and please do check back with us here.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi again, and thank you so much for your great thorough replies.   I wanted to update you, and you're right, you did reply to the same type question, but since the first one took so long to get approved on this site, I just thought it was thrown out, so I wrote a 2nd topic... and thank you for answering both. Well, since I got the 2nd cardiology opinion, I feel better about not taking Sectral.  He basically said what you said about Sectral...as a matter of fact, where he practices, they don't even use that medication at all, never prescribe it.  He thinks that possibly the first cardiologist prescribed it because it used to be used to stop pvc's/pac's and since mine were ongoing for 3 months at that time, maybe he thought it would stop them.  Either way, I stopped that drug like I said, and the 2nd cardiologist told me to come back in if and when my heart beats irregularly again and they'll hook me up to a 30 day monitor to wear.  So, just last week, my heart started beating irregularly again, I called them and I will now wear a 21 day 'cardio-net' monitor.  We're trying to find out what is triggering my heart to beat like it is.  I am thinking it could be anxiety...  I have not had any panic attacks, but have had recently a couple of episodes where I'm just very nervous/restless.  And, before the previous 3 month time span of the irregular beats, I was also a little anxious about a trip we were taking...I wouldn't say overly anxious, but I never had any nervousness/restlessness.  So, possibly anxiety plays a role in these heart beats??  I just don't see why they would last for weeks or months.  And of course now, I'm just concerned w/these nervous episodes, so possibly that has something to do w/my current irregular beats.  ??  So, we'll see what happens.  The fainting has not happened again, the cardiologist was leaning toward the dramamine explanation - just me having a bad reaction to medication - all combined w/the irregular beats in the first place w/a medication that can cause palpitations and low BP.   Thank you again for all of your insights, I appreciate the help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  You are very welcome.   Yep,  Sectral was briefly seen as a great thing about 15-20 years ago, but then after a huge study it was discovered that PVCs are best left alone most of the time, and by then the evidence was also piling up that a lot of people found Sectral disagreed with them, so it really fell out of favor, and for people who needed a slowing effect it was almost useless.   The anxiety you're currently experiencing would definitely create a cycle effect wherein the more you worry the more premature beats you have, and the more of them you feel, the more you worry, so the more you have. There is, of course, a theoretical limit to how far this can  go,  but it sure can create an emotionally disabling situation for some people, and the worst part is that most anxious people at first are prone to deny (or not even realize) they are anxious. It seems strange, but given the way anxiety works, it's not really surprising.   The CardioNet monitor could be of great help in determining just what sorts of arrhythmias you're actually having over a period of time, and the results should almost certainly provide you reassurance that what's going on is normal and  benign. Then if you are still really bothered by the ectopy (premature beats) your doctor can choose to prescribe you a  far less noxious beta blocker (like  metaprolol) which would reduce the frequency of these events. Doctors generally tend to use this as a last resort to help the  patient who just can't get a handle on the anxiety caused by the  palpitations, and metaprolol (especially as Toprol XL) has become the drug of choice for people who aren't able to break  the cycle of anxiety and ectopic beats. Some can, some can't, and at least there is a fairly effective family of drugs that can help in those cases.   The Dramamine explanation for the faint makes a lot of sense, and I'm really glad you got that second opinion.  Good luck to you, and please do stay in touch.\n\n",

    "title": "Staph, MRSA, Misdiagnosis?",
    "content": "I appologize for putting this in the wrong forum, however I searched the internet and found that Dr. Mohktar was familiar with MRSA, and I saw he was the moderator of this forum.    Anyway, my grandfather, who just turned 91 on November 29th of this year, started acting funny in mid October.  He has always been a strong minded man interested in CNN, reading News magazines, books, etc.  All of the sudden he started acting as if he had alzheimer's (sp?)  disease.  Here is how it started.  I took him out to eat one night, and he was acting fine.  It was raining and when we got home, he slipped and fell on the wet grass.  After that he was having some trouble getting up.  Well, this fall caused a small break in the skin covering his hip bone.  At this time, he was caring for himself.  After the fall, I guess he was having trouble getting out of bed at night and he would use the restroom in the bed, both urine and feces.  I discovered this around a week or two after the fall when he started showing signs of what I thought at the time was Dementia.  He lost interest in reading, watching the news, eating, and was not able to get himself off the couch to use the restroom.  He was basically just sleeping all day and all night and waking long enough to eat or get something to drink.  I called the ER and asked if it were possible that he had gotten a concussion when he fell. They warned me that he may have had a stroke and I should bring him in.  This was around October 26-28.  Well, he was complaining of his hip hurting, so the hospital did an X-ray of his body and found that he had no broken bones, but they found a 7cm spot on his left lung and a 3cm spot on the right.  They said he had Stage IV cancer but didn't take a sample of the \"tumors.\"  The doctors said it would be best to not disturb the cancer as it could spread faster.  I reminded the doctors that I had brought him in because of his sudden 2-3 week strange behavior and not because of the signs of lung cancer.  Well, they said that sudden onset was common given his age and told me to expect it to get twice as bad within the next 3 weeks to come.  He was discharged around November 2-5 (can't remember exactly) and a follow-up appointment was scheduled for a few days later.  At the follow-up meeting, the doctor said that his white blood cell count was much better than it had been in the past.  He'd had a low count for the past couple check-ups.  I'm not sure exactly what the numbers are, but I think he said the count was 12?  Well, he was sent home and placed under my care.  The doctor said we should give him \"comfort care\" and \"treat his symptoms as they arose\".  I had thought of a second opinion, as my grandfather, grandmother and father raised me, and my father and grandmother have already passed away.  My grandfather is all that I have left from my childhood...I do have a wife, 1 year old son, and a newborn daughter.  The doctor discouraged a second opinion, so I agreed.  Well, time goes by, and my grandfather's mental state worsens.  He's beginning to stay in bed for a couple days at a time.  He goes from walking with a cane to using a walker to get around.  His condition worsens a little more and we have to begin using a wheel chair to move him around.  He has no appetite, for a couple days, then eats two servings at each meal for a day.  We have a vinyl mattress cover on his bed and have to change his bedsheets at least twice daily.  Well, finally he fell out of bed on the 17th of December and broke his femur.  I called the EMS when I found him that morning and they took him to the hospital.  The doctors \"discovered\" abscesses/lesions between his thighs and questioned if I was \"caring\" for him as needed.  I had been wiping him and applying rash creme to his thighs, as I thought that's what the abscesses/lesions were (they were present when he was in the hospital in October also, and they didn't mention anything about it then).  The spot on his hip from his initial fall had never healed and was infected.  I was cleaning the wound with peroxide or alcohol and then coating it with neosporin and gauze.  Anyway, the social worker at the hospital said it would be in my grandfather's best interest to go to a nursing home.  My deceased father was my grandfather's medical power attorney/living will, but he's obviously no longer around to take care of this; I tried to apply and they wouldn't allow it...I'm his only living descendant.  Well, I went to visit him in the hospital each day and he would only wake up long enough to say Hello and then go back to sleep.  He's been in there for 5 days and they still haven't set the bone in his arm.  The bone specialist hasn't even seen him.  Then, today I go to the hospital and walk into his room...he's gone.  I ask one of the nurses at the station what was going on and they said he was moved to a private room...he had some kind of infection.  They advised that we keep the children out of the room.  The nurse in charge of my grandfather for the day told me he had a Staph infection and another infection or disease...she didn't say the name of it, but I saw the name when she was looking through his paperwork.  I can't remember what it was called, but he's receiving antibiotics through an IV to treat them.  Now, here's what I'm getting at...I've been doing some research and found that staph infections can cause delirium.  I've also read that MRSA can cause blood infection, and abscesses on different organs of the body.  I was wondering if the doctors mis-diagnosed my grandfather with lung cancer and if he had a staph infection when I took him to the hospital in October.  I'm a 25 year old man with no type of degree.  I know nothing of the medical field, so I'm not aware if this is even possible, but I've done a lot of research tonight and it seems to me that this scenario could be probable.  If anybody has any information, advice, or input, I would GREATLY appreciate it and I need to know this information ASAP.  My grandfather's life may be in danger.    He's in a small-town hospital that I should have never taken him to.  I just want to make sure he doesn't die due to malpractice.  Thanks ahead of time,  Paul\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Paul -  Your story about your grandfather is one we hear far too often. At his advanced age things do not necessarily play out the way they would in a much younger person, which is why the field of gerontology has evolved to care for the ever-growing population of older people.  So may possiibilities and so many questions. I will try to tie together some of your loose ends for you. This post is actually a couple years old, so things could be moot one way or the other by now. Still, it is worth a try.  With people of very advanced age, physical problems  do sometimes present with a very sudden and blunt onset and not much apparent symptomology to work with. The initial fall undoubtedly began a spiral of events, although he may well have been suddenly exhibiting signs of Alzheimer's prior to that. It is, of course, impossible to say, since Alzheimer's is hard enough to diagnose with certainty anyway, and usually the signs and symptoms must be used as a guide. The fall was probably just circumstantial, but it did leave an open wound which could have got something in it which contaminated it. It's difficult to know for sure, but since he subsequently became incontinent in his bed, this is likely how the contamination took place. It is also consistent with Alzheimer's.   The spots on his lungs could of course have actually been cancer but looking at an x-ray isn't definitive, and I think they were right to not disturb any possible tumors, but those spots also could have been anything.  The sequence of events beyond that sounds very understandable. The lesions on the inside of his thighs are very common among the incontinent, especially when bed-ridden. Total bed care on an as-needed basis is usually required at this point, and even then skin breakdown in the very elderly is common. A skilled nursing facility would be the best choice at that point.   Staph/MRSA can, in certain severe cases cause delerium,  but it would be profound and not just progressive, even over a period of weeks. While many things work differently in the very old patient, delerium is different from confusion and dementia. I don't think your grandfather had staph or MRSA at the onset of his initial symptoms.   While it is possible the cancer diagnosis was off base, it would seem moot given the other things that happened along the way. Had he had staph/MRSA back at that point, your grandfather would have had other significant symptoms of infection. His general trend would seem to follow that of late-onset Alzheimer's to a T. The infections are common in the bed-ridden, and especially in hospitals,  for reasons that should be obvious. (Lots of sick people in hospitals means lots of germs to control).   Hopefully your grandfather's course became more stable (it sounded as if it were) and  it would be well to keep in mind that for his generation he had lived a very long life by the time the troubles started. It is always difficult to watch a loved one deteriorate, and they don't always, but if one lives long enough, the simple law of averages dictates something untoward will happen. Hopefully he improved greatly after being hospitalized, and I'm  sure he appreciated all you were able to do for him prior to that.   I hope this is helpful. My best to you.\n\n",

They did not do any blood work or did any MRI they just check my blood pressure, my sugar and my temperature twice that was it.  The next day I still felt the same but less pain but when i would go to the classroom i felt kinda of light headed and i feel weird.  I was that for like the past two day.  The fourth day i could not stand the pain i had chest pain and my left arm felt kind of numb i went to class. after i went to class i went home and laid down to see if the pain would go away. The pain go worst so i told my brother to take me to the emergency room.  They did blood work a ekg exam they told me that the chest pain i was having was due to my obesity and i had to change my lifestyle.  So i started changing how i ate, i stop smokin, and drinking.  I have lost alot of weight since that day it almost been 5 days.  Right now i am feeling my numbness on the right opart of my face and also i am feeling both of my shoulder being weight down and kinda of numness.

    "content": "Hi chicoflo -  While your symptoms do seem to be worrisome, at least you are young enough that the odds of having developed clinically significant heart disease by now are very slim. If this helps you to recognize some ways you can improve your overall health and specifically your heart health then it will have served a good purpose. Meanwhile, I am not going to tell you it  is all due to anxiety, even though it may well be, because I'm not there and I'm not a doctor anyway, but if I were I'm still not there to examine you first hand. This makes it difficult. While  your ER exam was a little better than the first one, and a normal EKG is certainly encouraging (as well as negative bloodwork), I think a comprehensive physical exam, including perhaps a stress test, would be in order, after which you should adopt a long-term diet and exercise plan, a life plan, if you will, rather than a crash program to lose weight, as these almost inevitably result in an eventual reversal due to their unnatural nature. You also don't want to lose weight too quickly, as that's more dangerous than not losing any at all in the short run.  While anxiety would seem to be a very likely culprit in causing your symptoms I would urge you to get a comprehensive physical exam, and then work with a doctor or perhaps an exercise physiologist to get into a healthy eathing and exercise routine so that you can enjoy your life more and make sure you remain healthy into later adulthood, when the price of overweight usually starts to come due.   Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello  I am male, 31, and have a long term occluded IVC supported by collateral veins.  Coagulopathy and anticoagulation issues asided (i've already posted in Haematology section) I was hoping to solicite a general opinion on my following questions please.  I do realise that any opinion given is without hands-on examination, and I will be asking my Dr these same questions.  I just want a second opinion.  Thank you.  1.  Ever since I can remember, my exercise tolerance has been poor and on exercise in cold weather I get a burning pain in my throat associated with hoarseness.  I also find it is very easy to get my heart rate up around 220 without much effort, and with no pain.  Are these symptoms likely due to IVC and insufficient \"plumbing efficiency\" or am I just unfit and worrying about nothing?  2.  I was wondering if having a blocked IVC is likely to cause any long term complications (other than clotting), such as extra strain on my heart and if so, are there any precautions I can take early on?  Any recommendation procedures?  3.  I have \"always\" had borderline high BP, around 120/90 at the last reading if I recall.  Not enough to cause alarm, but useful to know.  I was wondering if this could be a symptom of occluded IVC?     Thank you, and have a great day.  regards Mike\n\n",

    "content": "Hello MikeW-   First, my apologies for your question having  been overlooked. Sometimes a question will get missed due to the volume. I've been working to catch up on the loose ends here, since I will be present on the Cardiology topic now.  So then -- let's take your sub-questions one at a time, as I think they are largely separate issues:  1) Poor exercise tolerance could be for any one of a number of reasons, including variant of normal. Not all of us can be athletic. The burning sensation in the throat in cold weather is very common and due to dryness. It can easily lead to hoarseness. The ability to get your heart rate up to 220 (the theoretical human maximum sinus rate) is probably due to poor conditioning. While it is very high, I've seen this happen before in healthy people. You might want to address this by taking on a very carefully stepped fitness program supervised by a doctor.  2) While the blocked IVC (another commonly seen item) should not cause any direct heart problems, it can occasionally be the site of infection, and so should be  checked on a regular basis. That's about the extent of that in most patients.   3) The \"borderline\" high blood pressure is really borderline. It shouldn't have any relation to the blocked IVC, and is so close to textbook ideal blood pressure that it only needs to be checked very occasionally as with anyone  else, to make sure it hasn't crawled upward.   I hope this helps with some of your concerns, and again, I apologize for your question having been overlooked. Please do follow up with us here. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  My mother is 82, and has always had great health. The past couple of months she has been in and out of the hospital with numbness in a hand and arm, or in her face. They've done test after test; EKGs, MRIs, persantine cardiolyte, etc., testing for stroke and heart issues, and all tests came back negative, but she continued to feel extremely weak with numbness. The only medication she's been taking, besides estrogen, is for high blood pressure, and she's had no problem with these meds for years. After a couple of hospital visits, they took her off a new med they had just given her (before the hospital visits) for high blood pressure: Norvasc. For whatever reason, she started doing somewhat better, slowly rebuilding her strength over a couple of weeks. Then her doc wanted to put in an internal loop recorder, to see if she'll need a pacemaker. This procedure occurred Friday, and immediately she became numb over her whole body. She can move, but barely even walk. The doc is telling us that her numbness can't be from the recorder, but it came back right in full force, all over her body, just after the recorder was put in. None of the docs she has seen can tell us why she is going numb (sometimes in isolated areas, sometimes all over her body). Could this be a neurological problem? Or is there some other specialist we should get her in to see? She is basically immobilized and no one can give us any help. Thank you!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Isolated and full body numbness",
    "content": "Hello knecht -  Well, when I read about the discontinuing of Norvasc I thought maybe we were onto something, as that drug has a history of causing odd problems, but of course not unilateral numbness. Then with the numbness returning with the insertion of the loop recorder I became more frustrated, because there truly is no understandable relation between  the monitor and the full-body numbness. There should be no earthly connection. The only one I can think of is that it may have triggered some sort of rejection response by the body, but that's really a stretch.  This leaves us with two basic areas to explore: either 1) your mom has a very exotic neurological problem that has not yet been diagnosed because it is so unusual (as in some sort of rare, obscure polyneuritis) or it is perhaps a conversion disorder, which is an literal conversion  of painful emotions into an acceptable physical symptom. The symptoms, therefore, are very real, but are not amenable to the usual medical approaches and the cause will not show up via medical tests. I strongly suspect this to be the case with your mom, although there is no way to know for certain without taking a pscyhotherapeutic approach while continuing to follow her for some clue as to a possible neurological problem. Sometimes a good psychotherapist can reach the mental source of the problem with a sudden resolution.   Not knowing much at all about your mom's medical or emotional history it's hard to guess more. I hope by now this has been solved. Please follow up with us here. Good luck to you and I hope your mom is doing better.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello dee39 -   What you describe does sound very similar to what chris77 described, and as doctor Madia suggested, the two most common causes are anxiety and sometimes supraventricular tachycardia, something that can also be aggravated by anxiety as well as being a very common cause of anxiety.   They way SVT can be recognized as a rule is by the fact that it starts abruptly and ends abruptly, usually with a fairly long pause at the end of the episode. It can last from a few seconds to hours or days, but usually it goes on for a few minutes. Sometimes it does cause the urge to cough, which, oddly enough, can often make it go away. If this happens frequently or lasts for long periods of time, you would do well to see a cardiologist who specializes in arrhythmias, because while SVT is not life-threatening, it can be very disruptive if it occurs frequently or for long periods. The distraction and unpleasant sensation is often enough to make one stop whatever one is doing. It can  also cause a lot of needless worry and anxiety.   Some patients are taught by their doctor to stop these episodes themselves, but as long as a cough makes yours stop then that is probably going to work for you for now. It may be all that's required in your case.  If you have anything to add or any further questions, I hope  you will follow up with us.  Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi chris77 -   I think you have diagnosed your problem. The fairly large amount of lager you are consuming on a regular basis contains quite enough bubbles to almost guarantee you will have some trapped gas (and probably fluid as well) which will rise to the upper part of your stomach, causing the gurgling you hear and the sensations you have. As it works its way out of your stomach and on down, the pressure and awareness of your heartbeat should become less and less. Also, you state you have sometimes pressure or pain which is relieved by burping. Again, the gas that is contained in the bubbles of the beer is undoubtedly causing this. If not for your general health then at least for your peace of mind and physical comfort, perhaps you should consider cutting back on the daily heavy drinking. It's probably not doing you any good anyway, and will eventually cause weight gain and other problems. But for now it's already making you feel bloated and uncomfortable. Nothing's good enough to be worth that.   Good luck to you.\n\n",

While you are pretty young to be having issues related to coronary artery disease, you also have a pretty exotic medical history, including the immunosuppressant drugs, and so are at a slightly greater risk for cardiac complications. There is also the very rare person who develops heart problems early , or has then due to some congenital abnormality. Hopefully you've been seen for this by now.

    "content": "Hi there -  It's not too surprising to learn, based on your age and history, that this is the diagnosis, and it does make sense, although it's not something one would jump to first. Fortunately it has been diagnosed and is being treated. Beta blockers can, over time, help somewhat with the structural problem by reducing the cardiac output. You may find your cardiologist wants to slowly increase the dose, and this may help with the pain.   Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy presents certain unique problems to be dealt with, one being the advisability of continuing an exercise program without wanting to increase muscle mass of the heart, which is precisely what the problem is to begin with.   There are other ancillary treatments, some medical, some surgical, some involving implantable devices, all of which work well in certain cases. Meanwhile, one thing which needs to be stressed is that while continuing your exercise program (or when doing anything involving physical exertion) it is important to include a proper cool-down. While everyone is encouraged to do this when engaged in a structured program, it is especially important for people like you,  who have this particular structural issue, because most of these patients will tolerate exercise pretty well, but post-exercise is when the outflow tract to the aortic valve (the main output from the heart to the rest of the body, including the heart itself), can become narrow momentarily. A careful cooldown (as opposed to just stopping, as many people do) can help the heart to adjust to the change in demand and avoid major problems.  If you're having pain during exercise and other exertion this still holds true, but it may mean the outflow tract is compromised routinely. If this is the case, your doctor would have been able to visualize it on the echocardiogram and should have given you appropriate advice as to how to minimize the resulting pain. Again, an incremental increase in the dose of beta blocker is often the simplest way to achieve this.   You'll have to be followed on a routine basis now, and depending on many factors, you may see an advancement of the problem or an improvement. Based on how things evolve over time, your doctor will recommend measures as mentioned above, from the conservative to perhaps a more radical surgical correction.   Best of luck to you in dealing with this challenge, and please do stay in touch with us here.\n\n",

So I thought I was fine but then one day I felt an odd heart beat. It only happened once and happens every once in a while but most of the time my heart beat is pretty normal. The thing that is been constant throughout the past four months is a tingly feeling in my back, shoulder, and chest usually in my back. There is also pressure in my left side of my chest. When I am wearing a shirt I feel it the most but when I am naked I can\u2019t hardly feel it. I am 17 years old no one in my family has a history of any type of illness. I really just wish it would go away. One thing I should mention is I had a heart murmur when I was about 3 but they said that it was gone. I\u2019m going in for a physical in about 3 weeks I am hoping that I can find out what is wrong with me before then. Please email me back with a result and if you need any further info I can tell you. email: jjfreeze87@hotmail.com\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  The odd feeling in your chest seems to be fairly superficial (you don't notice it unless there are clothes touching your chest), so that's probably not anything serious, although I can't imagine what it might be. It may be related to a too-finely tuned awareness of your body (extreme somatic awareness). This can be a problem, especially in anxiety-prone people. This is pretty common. The other sensations seem to be rather random and are probably unrelated. It would help to know if the pain in either side of your chest was constant or intermittent and if it happened on both sides at the same time, or switched. I am thinking that since you are a basketball player you might have pulled some pectoral muscles.   The tingly sensation you mention could well be due to a pinched or compressed nerve in your back or neck. Again, basketball comes to mind.   The one thing I can probably say something definite about is the \"odd heartbeat\" that happens occasionally. Most people have premature heartbeats from time to time, and sometimes quite frequently (especially if having used too much caffeine, smoked, been sleep-deprived, used cold medications, etc.). They happen very commonly but some people just don't notice them while others do. They do feel odd, and sometimes can be alarming, but they are normal and almost never have any clinical significance.   Hopefully your physical went well and served to ease your mind about these symptoms. If not, please do feel free to follow up with us here. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "I went to the urgent care center about a week ago for a sinus infection. After the P.A. listened to my heart she asked me if i was aware that I have a heart murmur. I wasn't, however when i was a child a doctor had wondered if i did have a slight one, though didn't appear to be concerned. Since switching doctors at 13 (I'm 21 now) no other doctor has ever brought the matter to my attention. The Physicians asssitant said it was no concern as it occured after the first beat, and had something to do with blood continuing to flow through the aorta (I may be mistaken on that part, but she did definately say it had to do with the aorta and that it occured after the first beat). Is this truly a benign finding, or should I consult my primary care physician for a follow-up? Also, will this develop into a problem when I get older? Thank you!  Jamie\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Heart murmur detected, need for additional follow-up?",
    "content": "Hi Jamie_brr,  This is a good question.  In general, there is a lot of confusion about a heart murmur.  A murmur is simply a sound that is heard coming from the heart or related structures.  A murmur, in itself, is not a diagnosis only a sign that is heard.  The bigger question is what is causing the murmur.  To subdivide this further, there are innocent heart murmurs and pathologic heart murmurs.  Innocent heart murmurs are typically caused by blood flowing quickly through the heart or vessels.  The occasionally are made from small cords in the heart (that keep the valves from flipping backwards) beginning to hum similar to a piano or guitar string because the blood flow is causing them to vibrate (termed a still's murmur).  These murmurs are completely harmless and need no follow up.  Often, they follow the first heart sound (as the PA was describing).  These murmurs can be heard into adulthood also, particularly in thinner people, although often they \"go away\" simply because as a person gets bigger there is more bulk mass (muscle, etc.) that keeps us from hearing the murmur (even though it probably actually is still there).  Pathologic murmurs often are more harsh sounding.  They can follow the first heart sound or be at other parts of the heart sound.  These can be made by blood flowing through a hole or constriction in the heart or blood vessels.  They can also be caused by leaky valves.  These types of conditions may or may not need treatment.  From the description of the P.A., I suspect your murmur is from an innocent condition; however, I can't be sure.  My advise would be to see your primary care physician to have another evaluation.  If it sounds concerning you can be referred to a cardiologist for further testing.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Daily swollen and red feet",
    "content": "Hello ksbee -  Your problem is a fairly common one and can be caused by any number of things, but the most frequent one, especially following a pregnancy, is poor venous return or, as you put it, \"circulation related.\" (the  valves in the leg veins are sometimes damaged during pregnancy). So long as the swelling is confined to your feet and doesn't extend up into your ankles or calves, it's not much more than an annoyance. The morning stiffness, however, suggests it might be a rheumatic problem,  as arthritis can also cause redness, swelling and, most notably in this case, morning stiffness. Of course the two can also coexist.   This doesn't sound like a serious matter, but it is one that probably warrants at least a visit to your primary caregiver, since there are things which can be done to help with the swelling and poor venous return (along with elevating your feet when practical), and if there is any arthritis starting up you'd want to know that as well so it could be followed and, if necessary, treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication.  Hope this is helpful to you. Please do keep in touch.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  One would want some information like where is the wound/wounds. Why they occured in the first place. Why there are more than one. What is the diagnosis of the wound. Are they infected wounds. Are they tuberculous wounds.   Non healing of wounds have many reasons, infection being one of them. Another being presence of slough [dead necrotic tissue] in the wound floor. Undermining of wound edges beneth the wound floor is also one of the major reasons of non healing. Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus can also lead to non healing. Bad blood supply to the area will not allow a wound to heal. Smoking impairs wound healing especially in the legs.  If plavix/aspirin are the cause of non healing then logically the wounds shuld be constantly oozing blood. I would not think it advisable to stop plavix/aspirin unless one has ruled out every other reason of non healing.  Apurva\n\n",

    "content": "Since I have asked this question, I have been to several specialists in wound care.  I have had many blood tests, cultures, biopsies, and have been tested for auto immune diseases such as MRSA.  They have all revealed absolutely nothing.  Wounds are clean of any disease.  Doctors would debride the wounds weekly and I would apply a debriding medication to the wounds, however, there was no change or healing process.  They are located in various areas, but mainly on the top of my arms, and a very large one on the outside of my upper right arm.  Two are on the outside thigh of my leg.  They have ruled out diabetes because there are none on the feet or ankles.  I have had a Doppler test for circulation and again, nothing.  All doctors have admitted that they have never seen anything like what I have and also each wound is different.  Cancer has also been ruled out.  My cardiologist will not allow me to stop taking Plavix.  It is quite frustrating! I have now enrolled in an experimental program where results are needed, so everyone gets the medication.  I am getting something called \"Vashe XT.\"  I have to report that in the first two weeks, one of the wounds has begun to respond and finally I feel hopeful.  However, no one has been able to discover the reason why these wounds are there in the first place.  One doctor has surmised the possibility of a lack of collagen, but is not positive. Just thought I would answer a few of your questions and report what is happening to date.  I thank you for your response. judilenn\n\n",

They took me off of Lovastatin as my liver functions were slightly high at ALT of 59 and AST of 38.  I do drink 2 glasses of wine per night with meals most nights.    I have had tests done also; EKG with no abnormal findings, Stress Test with Echo all normal, and xray of the chest also normal.  I have been going to psychiatrist for anxiety and put me on xanax for a few months (which was tapered off) then zoloft and buspar ...zoloft 100 mgs per day and buspar 10.    The pain and arms being tired are very annoying and wondered if it had to do with cicruculation or heart problem. I am scared most of the time.  Can you please give me some advice.

Chest pain in the center or left, squeexing type, diffuse, vaguely localized and come on with exertion and goes away on stopping is usually a heart pain.  However yours does not seem to be the type. And then you say the Stress test, EKG and Echo are all normal so it effectively rules out cardiac origin of the pain.   I feel that 100 mg of Zoloft just could be the cause of your tiredness and nubness etc. I have seen in my practice, patient not tolerating the 100 mg dose very well. Try to talk to your doctor about cutting the dose to 50 mg and see if your synptoms get better.  Take care,   Apurva\n\n",

    "title": "Re: two leaking heartvalves - how serious is this?",
    "content": "Hi Julie,  Echocardiogram is a very sensitive test. The doppler aspect of the test can pick up very minute amount of flow reversal from the velve sites. Even the process of a valve closure during a cardiac cycle will push a little volume of blood back, this is known a 'closing volume regurgitation'  which is actually no regurgitation at all.   Having said that, many times a trivial regurgitation from the valves IS actually seen on doppler interrogation which is of no consequence. In your case, since you have been prescribed a beta blocker after the Echo result, the likely diagnosis is a condition called Mitral Valve Prolapse. Here the leaflets of the valve are a little longer than necessary, and they skid against each other when they close. This condition is entirely innocent and has no major consequences. It is associated with small 'leakage' in the valve.   So my advice, rest assured, there is nothing wrong with your heart. Keep taking your beta blocker and report back to your GP when you are called.   Take care,   Apurva\n\n",

I have had high blood pressure for several years now, but I've been on an ace-inhibitor and it is controlled.  It is most likely a genetic problem because my father has had high blood pressure since he was young too.  For my new years resolution this year, I decided to really get in shape.  I got a personal trainer, started running 20 miles a week, lifting weights 3 days a week in the gym very intensely, and I completely changed my diet...I now eat 6 small meals a day and a lot of protein, no fats, and lots of fruits and veggies.  Everything was going so well, and I was feeling stronger and better everyday, and then all of the sudden... I woke up one day and my heart was palpitating like crazy.  Felt like an extra beat every 10 seconds or so and and then it would cause me to feel like I had to belch.  I also had a weird, kind of hazy lightheadedness...nothing too severe but just a general hazy kind of feeling.  I made an appointment with my doc right away and he hooked me up to an EKG and saw the palpitations I was talking about.  He said it was a PAC and that it was \"nothing to worry about\" and \"completely benign\".  He didn't explain at all why I have this hazyness feeling though.  I have been having these supposed PAC's for 5 days now.  It's driving me crazy.  I have a headache too...feels like pressure on my face and around my nose.    Why did this happen all of the sudden?  Am I in any danger?  Is there anything I can do to stop it?  I want to get back in the gym and continue training, but now I'm scared cuz these PAC's keep jumping.  Opinions?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  Extra beats can be sometimes very uncomfortable. Most of them are benign but some are serious too. Mostly, as a rule of thumb, PACs are benign, where as PVCs can be dangerous, although most PVCs are benign too.   Reason one gets these PACs or PVCs are many. Stress is a factor, stress causes secretion of adrenalin form the glands sitting above the kidneys which in turn stimulates the myocardium to produce these extra beats.   Minor valve variation called Mitral Prolapse can cause these extra beats too. A patient of Coronary heart disease will get these from scar tissue left by the ischemia or infarction. A person with high thyroid levels will also get these extra beats.  It is difficult to pin point the reason in your case without adequate data. However there is one suggestion here. You being a hypertensive should not indulge much in Isometric Exercise like weight lifting, which can contribute to HBP. Instead you should concentrate more on aerobics like jogging, walking swimming etc.  I hope this is of help.   Apurva\n\n",

    "content": "I am trying to get insurance 2 years after my ASD closure.  THe insurance company, after jumping through many hoops, said to get another echo done and if it came back clear, they MAY give me insurance.  Obviously, not having insurnace to get the echo hurt me....because I had to pay cash for it.  So, I got it.  Now, I got the results....and my cardiologist has taken a 3 month sebatical.  If I want the results explained, I have to start over with a new cardiologist...again, no insurance.  I am just hoping someone can explain my results to me so I understand what I am sending the insurance company.  I don't understand the medical terms and want to know if I am OK, first of all.  And, secondly....is this something insurnace would typically been afraid of?  Below are the main notes on the results:  1. Normal left ventricular size and systolic function.  There is fusion and mild E/A reversal without left atrial enlargement.  2.  The right ventricle is enlarged with history of atrial septal defect repair.  Mitral valve appears competent.  3.  The inter-atrial septum appears thickened with history of atrial septal defect repair.  No specific shunting is noted in this technically difficult study.  Study quality:  This is a technically difficult study with significantly  reduced visualization  of valvular structures.  EKG Rhythm:  Sinus  Left Ventricle:  Normal in size  and thickness .  There is normal systolic function.  There is some mild E/A reversal with an E/A ratio of .82.  E/E prime ration would suggest normal filling pressures.  Left Atrium:  Normal in size  Right Ventricle:  Enlarged at 3.1 cm.  Right Atrium:  Does not appear significantly dilated.  Aortic Valve:  Tricuspid and opens normally.  Mitral Valve:  There is some redundancy of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve suggestive of prolapse of the anterior leaflet.  On the M-mode there does not appear to be definite prolapse.  Tricuspid Valve:  Structurally normal.  No significant tricuspid regurgitation is noted.  Pulmonary artery pressure is normal.  Pulmonic Valve: Not well seen.

The Enlarged ventrical will grow normal over a period of time. Mitral prolapse is a benign inconsequential 'disease' which should be ignored.

    "content": "Hello doctors,  I am a 22 year old male. In late 2003 during a holiday (to mention after i ate some seafood) i had gotten symptoms of difficulty in breathing and palpitation. This usually happened during evenings and i had trouble sleeping. Once asleep the breathing problem didnt persist.  This lasted for a week and went away on its own. About a week after this i started getting muscle weakness problems starting with the eye and the jaw and then feeling it in other parts of the body. The eyes later also got some floaters which the eye doctor said was debris from the weak eye muscles.I get random nerve twitches as well.   I showed it to doctors who said its nothing but stress. I am sure it is not stress though since i don't feel stressed or lead a very stressfull life I do not smoke and am only a social drinker. I usually ignore the symptoms in my everyday life but once or twice a year the symptoms hit hard, maybe me just noticing them again but they are definately there. Cramped nerves in the hands and legs feeling very dry and sometimes itchy. The nerves also cause crackling. This though is restricted to my hands.... perhaps because i have a habit to keep my head on my arms when i sleep.  When this happens i get frustrated and don't feel like doing anything.   The only family history of ailment from my side is my dads older brother getting a heart attack. Other than that everyone is fit as a tree.   Is this a cardio problem? I got an ECG done recently which was fine, and some other tests like sodium and chlorine were marginally high. Could this all be some vitamin deficiancy? Or a nervous problem? I never get headaches.  Any information will be great, its been 5 years and its getting a bit tidious now.  Best regards Mikoyan29\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  Since you are having pressure symptoms in your chest I would advice you to immediately check with your doctor and get necessary tests like EKG and blood work done.   However excess gas in the stomach or intestine definitely  can cause heaviness in chest, it can put pressure on the heart through the diaphragm and cause the heart to skip a bit too!. Add to this some anxiety and the heart will beat faster and with more force.  Four cans of lager a day is far on higher side in my view and you must cut it down by half. Beer itself is known to cause gas in some individuals. I see from your profile you are on two antidepressants. I have a small piece of advice for you. Please cut down on beer and start exercizing vigorously on a regular basis. This will go a long way toning up your body and increasing the vagal tone of the heart and then your heart will not skip the beats or give you the feeling of thumping. Exercise is known to relieve anxiety and depression too.  Take care,   Apurva\n\n",

I found out that she was adopted when she was very young and that her biological mother had an unknown heart problem. She was told about her adoption and mother's medical problems when she was young but never felt any pain or discomfort, she's currently 46 years old. The heart problem wasn't explained to her very clearly and I wanted to research on it some more incase it was ever an issue in the future.  Apparently the genetic problem is only passed down to next generations of females only and that either the heart itself or an artery swells up to the size of a small orange which can 'pop' and can be fatal. Now i'm no medical specialist but it does sound rather far fetching, I just want to know if this is a real known genetic's disorder and a little information about it. Can't really think of any further information you might need, my ethnic background is Chinese. Thanks.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Genetic Heart Problems",
    "content": "Hi Jenny,  What you are describing looks like Thracic Aortic Aneurysm. An aneurysm is a balloon like enlargement of a segment of the Aorta, an artery or a part of the heart itself. It occures due to perogressive thinning and weakening of the medial layer of am artery called Media. The part of the artery becomes thin like a membrane and due to pressure of blood inside gradually gets bigger and takes a shape of a baloon. This is a very dangerous situation because the aneurysm due to its thin walls can burst any time leading to disasterous consequences. This type of aneurysms many times are genetic.  Another type of aneurysm is a dissecting aneurysm. Here, due to very high unchecked blood pressure the inner layer of an artery or aorta tears up and gets lifted from the inner surface., called 'dissection'.  This becomes a 'Flap' and blood under high pressure burroughs beneath the flap causing even more dissection. This too is an emergency situation.  This first kind of aneurysm is found in families. There is a 21 % chance of a first degree relative to be affected of the condition in 'probands' of an aortic aneurysm. [Proband is the first member of a family to seek medical attention for a genetic disorder].   In addition, a situation called 'Marfan's Syndrome' [wherein a peron is extraordinarily tall, thin, has excessively long arms and fingers, has a high arched palate, and may also have aortic valvular and aortic disease. MS can also be familial.  The inheritance pattern in Aortic aneurysm is what is known as 'Autosomal Dominant' meaning only one parent need to have a genetic trait to propagate the disease in subsequent generations, as against 'Autosomal Recessive' wherein both the parents need to have the trait, so chances of propagation are less. As far as being transmitted only in females I don't think its the case. Only in 'Sex linked recessive' disorders the disease is propagated to a particular sex and that too Males!  I would strongly advice all your first degree relatives to get screened for Aortic Aneurysms.   Apurva   References:  1. Elefteriades JA.

    "content": "i am a 19 year old female. i have been having random chest pains in the upper right side of my chest for over a year now. i have tried to figure it out by myself but with only reference books and a combat medics medical knowledge  i have had no luck. this is what i have found can you PLEASE help me.   the pain occurs randomly, there is no obvious pattern. it can happen while im walking through the grocery store or while im sitting on the couch at home. its generally felt in the upper right side of my chest along the mid clavicular line though sometimes it  is closer to the inside, and sometimes it radiates to the right      shoulder and/or through to my back, and there have been a few rare times that the same pain has been felt in the same place on the left side and also at least one occurence that radiated all the way up the right side of my neck to my jaw. the pain is deep in my chest and starts out slowly but intensifies quickly then suddenly stops and then leaves behind an ache for a while which fades and goes away. the whole episode never takes more than ten minutes and seems to have no hindrance on my breathing.        other symptoms- tachycardia- resting pulse rate of 80-100 bpm,occasional  dyspnea- not like i have trouble breathing but like i cant get enough air, occasional nausea sans vomiting.        at the time of the first occurence i was chain smoking clove cigarettes shortly afterward i quit cold turkey for a while because of training spent two months coughing up sputnum and with a uri but that was a result of bacteria and viruses being passed repeatedly around our barracks, mine just always seemed to go to my lungs, i assumed because of my being a heavy smoker before. at any rate i continued to have chest pain, and continued on as i went to ait where i picked up smoking again. (i currently have quit smoking and have been solid quit for two months)       my breath sounds are normal at all four points and i have had no problems with coughing since the initial illness in basic. at least nothing that was constant enough or frequent enough to be noticed. i ran a good deal in basic and in ait and did fairly well. i never seemed to have a problem with breathing or with my chest at all when i was running aside from the norm, so i ruled out the possiblity of it being lung cancer.       while i have a slight history of GERD in my family (my younger brother was just diagnosed with it being the cause of a severe cough, and my half sister has it)  i don't have pain at any really specific time, either after ive eaten or before, its not provoked by laying down, i don't have the feeling of fluid built up in the back of my throat and i have never had irritation of my esophogeal tissues. so i don't know if that could be it or not         i have a very extensive history of heart problems on both sides of my family. ranging from an enlarged heart to my paternal grandfather dying at 45 by way of a major heart attack, and i have been told once before by a gym teacher when we monitored our heart rates in class that i had to go to the doctor to have my heart looked at because my heart rate was irregular and because once we brought it up it did not decelerate or it decelerated very slowly. but i have pretty much ruled out the possibilities of heart issues due to the fact that.... well ......its on the wrong side. if it were on the left side of my chest it would fit the bill for everything i have read about prinzmetals angina...but its on the WRONG SIDE.       last but not least. i don't know that its at all related but it seemed worth mentioning. i have anxiety...pretty bad. i have anxiety attacks that range from just a rise in my heart rate, a jittery anxious feeling, and an innability to concentrate or sit still, to full blown tachycardia, hyperventilating, fetal position, with my entire body shaking. i had read in one reference book that anxiety could be a cause of chest pain but the two problems never really crossed paths. i don't have the pains when im having and anxiety attack niether am i anxious when i have them, only during while im in pain do i get a bit anxious...but i think that can kinda be expected.   so thats all ive got im lost, nothing i try helps it and i cant find anything to match the symptoms. i realize im throwing a lot of information at you but i have been trying to figure this out on my own for the better part of seven months now with no success  i have no insurance because i am in the national guard and not active, and if it turns out to be something serious then best case scenario i get discharged  from the military, not at all what i want but the other possibility is that i present a danger to my unit as i am a medic and have to be relied upon in a deployment to be able to perform certain duties for the care of my fellow soldiers. my body needs to be as healthy as possible so it keeps working when i have to abuse it. i desperately need answers that  i cant seem to find anywhere else.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  Chest pain in a young female like you [19 years] is more likely non cardiac. Females are blessed with estrogen till menopause. Estrogen somehow seems to protect from atherosclerotic heart disease.  The pain you describe is not typical of cardiac pain. Contrary to populat belief, cardiac pain is more often central and retrosternal rather than on the left side. It ususally comes on with effort and subsides on rest, unless it is a heart attack.   Non cardiac pain comes on any time-resting or working-, is well localosed or shooting kind, may migrate, can increase on deep breathing but not necessarily so.   You may have family history but that need not necessarily mean you have heart disease, more so, not at your age. You have more of anxiety related symptom complex what with your jittery feeling, hyperventilation, tachycardia, fetal position etc.   Please rest assured, you are most likely not having major cardiac diagnosis. If you be a little firm in your mind, you are only going to be an asset to your army unit and will never let them down!  Apurva\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 59yo white female, overweight, don't smoke, don't drink, one cup of coffee a day. Had arthroscopic surgery for ACL repair in Oct 2007. In Dec 2007 had a flu shot, two days after that I became very ill, upper chest pain, short of breath, no fever, couldn't walk across the room without stopping due to shortness of breath, hard to talk due to shortness of breath and chest pain.  In January my doctor put me in the hospital because she thought I had pericarditis. Everything came back normal, including a V/Q scan.  My cholesterol and triglycerides are high, I take gemfibrozil for that.  My last cholesterol/triglyerides were both around 230. (triglycerides were over 900 before med).  ER doc said I had costochondritis. Pulmonary guy said there was a bad batch of flu vaccine this year.  Cardiologist did not think it was heart related.  I got better (on no different meds in hospital).  Now the pain in my upper chest and shortness of breath are coming back. Hard to take a deep breathe. Much worse when I try to lay down and are constant.  I do have GERD.  Due to the shoulder pain from surgery, I take Tramadol/APAP 37.5/325 mg twice a day.  The pain goes from the bottom of my neck to the center of my chest in a straight line.  I'm thinking maybe hiatal hernia. I did not take Tramadol yesterday or today and no caffeine this a.m. But the pain remains constant. I've also started Maalox.  I'm not sure what the next step is here...barium swallow? endoscope?  What else could this pain be caused by? Thank you for any answers or suggestions you can come up with that may help that my team of doc's didn't.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Blondie,  There could be several different diagnoses for your shortness of breath.   It could be some chronic bronchitis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which may be subclinical till now, and has had a flare up.  The fact that you had a very high triglycerides may have predisposed you to come 'heart artery blockges' causing angina and dyspnea.   Your heart's 'pumping action' or Ejection Frcation is also important and can be the reason for shortness of breath.   Since your v/q scan is normal, Pulmonary embolism is ruled out. However it would be helpful if you posted here the reports of your cardiac tests such as Echocardiogram and chest x ray.  Apurva\n\n",

    "content": "Early last year I has an episode where I almost passed out after a large bowel movement.  Almost felt like a heart attack. The doctors ruled out heart attack but ordered an abdominal ultrasound, which they say indicated a fatty liver.  So recomended diet and excercise. During this time I was experiencing hip and joint pain. Also, had swollen glands under the armpits and neck. Blood pressure was not too out of line.  I was able to loose about 12 bs. but can't seem to drop more. Currently 5' 8\" and 236 lbs.  Later in the year around November I experienced some kind of episode during sex that caused intense pain at the back of the head and neck. After which I still have headache, ears very sensitive to noise with ringing, and trouble sleeping. Doctor ordered MRA  that showed normal, no sign of stroke.  Doctor said blood pressure was a little high and prescribed 20 mg Lisinopril daily, and Niacin 500 mg twice daily, and one 81 mg aspirin per day. Blood pressure is normal now.  Problem is that I still have constant headache, glands under arms still swollen, aching joints, and large bowel movements that often cause me to feel lightheaded, and trouble sleeping.  Below is results from 12/20/07 blood workup; cholesterol 220, HDL 30, LDL 125, triglycerides 327, uric acid 8.2, glucose 94 fasting, cratinine 1.1 mg/dl, bili 0.6 mg/dl.   Doctor just keeps tryng to treat headache but nothing is working. He had me try Inderal but that did not work. Taking naproxen on and off for the headache and joint pain. Basically, I feel terrible everyday, and have not been the same since the November episode.  Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

Headache more on the face part could be a sinusitis. An uncontrolled blood pressure will also sometimes cause a headache. Severe stomach disturbance is also one of the causes.   Swollen galnds are generally the result of some focus of infection in the area of the glands' drainage. Some tubercular infection is also one of the causes of swollen glands. However in rare cases it may be some viral infection like infectious mononucleosis. In this condition, the gland swelling is a prolonged one and is associated with joint pains and mild fever as well as headache.   In such cases a detailed battery of tests to pinpoint the cause of headache along with tests to determine the cause of swollen glands is needed.   Please get back with the further developments. Thanks,  Apurva\n\n",

    "content": "Im a am a 25 year old male I have for years fought with the feeling that I can not get enough sleep and I am wondering if it's due to any underlying illness or disease.When I was younger I was diagnosed with ADHD OCD ANXIETY also when I was 14 they had discovered that I had high blood pressure but upon further investigation It wasnt,It continue's just at times.Well im 25 now I feel my ADHD is somewhat undercontrol same as the OCD the Anxiety is not though but I don't and have never taken any medication regarding any of this and my blood pressure is still doing the same thing some times it will be high and other times it will be normal it's mainly high in the morning and in the evening the Dr has given me a prescription for a ace inhibitor to try but I have not yet,Another thing of concern is at night when I fall asleep rarely but on occasion I will get this pulsating like vibration feeling that I can hear as well that runs from my feet to my head in a wave,that's the best way I can describe it when these brief episode's happen I am fully concius about what is going on around me but I a relly hard time waking up I have to wake my selfup meening I have to roll off the bed or move which at times I cant do.Back to subject I will go to bed a 12pm-2am and sleep untill 8:30-9am and still be tired all day and at times will take nap's does this sound like a sleep issue or do you think if I treat my high bp and anxiety and get beeter sleep habit's like go to bed at a decent hour that this will improve or do you think it's something I need to have looked at    thank you very much michael murphy\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I certainly believe you should have all your issues addressed and some of your symptoms may be related and helped with the correct treatment.  As for your sleep, I would caution you as to your expectations.  Many people believe they don't need as much sleep as they actually do.  In truth someone in your age range usually needs 8 or 9 hours of sleep at night.  We rarely get this in our fast-paced world.  This would be a good place to start, however.   It sounds also like you have experienced sleep paralysis, which can occur with or without narcolepsy (where you fall asleep during the day, sometimes without warning).  The paralysis is not harmful but it may suggest you aren't getting enough of the REM phase of sleep.  The best treatment for sleep paralysis includes getting enough sleep, reducing stress, regular exercise and keeping a regular sleep schedule.     Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there,  High cholesterol levels are a risk for ischemic heart (IHD) disease but it does not mean you will have IHD, but since you have had a battery of investigations and they all came back negative I would feel reassured.   What your cholesterol levels entail is that they should be managed properly so that you do not develop IHD in the future.   On the other hand IHD pain is typically not continuous, its usually exertional (i.e. comes about by activity and is relieved by rest).  However, given that I am unable to assess you, I would suggest that you report any increase or change of the character of your symptoms to your doctor.  Other risk factors for IHD inclue old age, hypertension, a family history of IHD (especially at young age), diabetes and it appears that you have none of those.  Best regards,\n\n",

I have had gastric bypass surgery, gall bladder removal, a complete hysterectomy, and a cervical fusion and spur removal.  My blood pressure is great, but there is a history of high blood pressure in my family.  I am not diabetic, but my father is and his mother was.  Heart problems also run in my family.  I currently take Lithium, Celexa, Adderall, Mobic, Mirapex, Vicodin, Glucosamine/Chondroitin, and 2 baby aspirin daily.    Two weeks ago I woke up and felt like a blood vessel ruptured in my index finger on my left hand.  Throughout the day, the finger hurt, began to turn blue, and became very cold.  The next morning, the same thing happened in my thumb and middle finger.  After a week my index finger was almost black so I went to a general practitioner.  He said it was Raynaud's.  So I went to my rheumatologist.  He said it was a vascular issue and sent me to a vascular surgeon.  He did an arteriogram last week and said my arteries were \"pristine\" but that there is no blood going to the last joint of those three fingers.  (A lot of lab work was also done and was normal.) The vascular Dr. sent me to a cardiologist who performed a TEE Friday.  Everything was normal.  My fingers are not as blue now but are very painful and the fingernails and ends of my finger are beginning to develop black spots.  The pads of the fingers have what look like blood blisters under the skin, but they don't bleed if it try to make them.  The thumb and third finger are not as cold as they were but the index finger is still cold.  Do you have any idea what it could be and what my next step should be?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Bwnewsome,  Your description sounds like there may be an issue with the venous side of things rather than the arterial side of blood flow to your finger.  As the vascular surgeon found, it sounds very much like there is compromised blood flow to your fingers.  The pain you are feeling is likely related to beginning reperfusion, similar to the pain when your hands get really cold then are warming back up.  The possibilities I can think of include small blood clots causing blockage of the small arteries that feed the hands.  This is why they did the TEE, to look for any vegetations on the valves of the heart that could be throwing clots.  It may also represent vasospasm with the blood vessels simply closing down inappropriately.  This mechanism is probably similar to the mechanism of Reynaud's syndrome, although I believe the time frame of this really doesn't fit Reynauds that well.  You may want to consider seeing a rheumatologist for further evaluation.  You may also want to follow up with the vascular surgeon to see if there are any more studies that should be done from that perspective.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Periodic chest pain and fatigue with other symptoms",
    "content": "I am a 35 year old female, who has had extensive cardiology tests and check ups over the last five years. The reason for these tests initially started about five years ago with palpitations and shortness of breath. The doctor then prescribed arrhythmol, which worked well. Along the way, my BP was taken, and found to be slightly elevated, so I am also taking Ramipril 2.5mg. I have since come off the arrhythmol and only use it very occasionally when I feel that my heart is not maintaining a steady rhythm and I feel exhausted as a result. Then I go back on it for a period of 3-4 weeks and everything settles down again. However since then, I have been back to see the doctor with intermittent chest pain,shortness of breath, and pain spreading across my neck down one or both arms. This is always followed by severe fatigue. On one occasion I visited casualty with a severe squeezing sensation in my left arm, accompanied by sweating and nausea. On each occasion, I have one episode of diarrhoea, which then goes away. ECGs have all come back clear, and I also have had a 24hr tape, which has shown a few ectopic beats, but clear otherwise. Along the way the tests have picked up a small hole in the heart, but I have been told this would not have caused my other symptoms.  On occasions I have dizziness, and faintness, where I feel everything go black, and then it clears again. I have not actually fainted.  My latest episode of this chest pain happened last weekend. I woke from sleep in the middle of the night, to a tightness in my chest, going through to my back, shortness of breath, and pain in both legs.This lasted about an hour. The pain in my legs was relieved slightly when I sat upright for a while. Since then I have had small twinges of chest and arm pain which have lasted for a few minutes and gone away again with rest. Accompanying this has been an unbelievable fatigue, where I have been exhausted with the effort of sitting up. Even the smallest task at the moment means that I break out in a sweat and my legs get shaky again. I have also had soreness all over, with joint pain. However, this is achy in kind, and is bearable. I am impatient to be back at work again, but know that I would not presently have the strength to do my job. The last episode of this nature, kept me off work for a week. I have been off for a week and a half so far. As all the tests (chest x-ray, heart scan, bloods etc) are coming back clear, my GP is inclined to think it is not my heart, and has ordered further blood tests for rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatories.  From past experience I know it will take me about three months before I have a reasonable quality of life again, where I can engage in something other than work, rest, sleep.  Sorry for the extensive length of this post, but my symptoms are so varied, even I have trouble keeping up with them.  I would appreciate any ideas or feedback, because if this next set of bloods come back clear, as I suspect they may, I don't know where to turn next.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Danie,  Initially, your symptoms do sound cardiac related but it sounds like you've had quite an extensive cardiac workup that has not shown any problems.  Because of this, I am inclined to agree with your doctor that this probably isn't cardiac related.  I'm not sure exactly what is causing this but my suggestion would be to next see a pulmonologist for evaluation of your lungs.  Occasionally, lung problems can present very much like cardiac issues.    If this doesn't turn out to be the source, seeing a rheumatologist is reasonable.  A neurologist may also be of some help.  Sorry I can't give you much more of an answer.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Karen111195,  Traveling to high altitudes can be quite taxing on the body.  I happened to be in Breckenridge myself last summer and felt its effects first hand.  The more common symptoms felt are nausea/vomiting, fatigue, and headaches.  Disturbed sleeping is very common, sometimes because of a change in breathing pattern while sleeping.  The breathing pattern often seen is known as Cheyne-Stokes breathing which starts as shallow rapid breathing then progresses to deeper breaths which drop off suddenly  and goes back to the shallow breathing.  The drop off time can actually have a pause in breathing.  This is considered a normal occurrence at high altitudes.  I would not be particularly concerned about the veins.  These veins may be more noticeable but are unlikely to cause any problems.    Things that can help with high altitude visits are to take it very easy the first few days and to drink lots of water.  Over the course of several days the body will begin to adapt and get used to the limitations but even with this acclamation caution should still be used not to over exert yourself or the fatigue and other symptoms may return, especially if you happen to be hiking some of the mountain ranges in the area that can climb as high as 14,000 feet.  Also, some people are more prone to altitude sickness problems than others.  There are a few medicines that may be of some benefit to help reduce the symptoms.  If you may need these your doctor can determine if they would help you.  Best wishes.\n\n",

It is possible that as you doze off you may actually be obstructing a bit and causing your body to have a stress response, resulting in the increased blood pressure.  Another possibility is that you are having some decreased blood pressures due to your medications (particularly the Klonopin) that is resulting in a rebound increase in your blood pressure.    Neither of these is that great of an explanation, though.  I would recommend you see your doctor to discuss this.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 56-year-old male of healthy weight, but a smoker. My doctor recently suggested taking Zocor (simvastatin) for my cholesterol (total = 219, HDL = 40, LDL = 151, Trigl = 139). I had not been exercising when tests showed those results.   I\u2019d be interested in knowing if these numbers could be reduced to healthy levels without drugs. My diet is already pretty good. Less than 30% of my calories are from fat, my saturated-fat intake is less than 20g, and my cholesterol intake is around 20mg per day.   I\u2019m not sure how much I could improve my diet, because the numbers already seem pretty good (although I could probably work more fiber into my diet). But are my cholesterol levels in a range that could be reduced to healthy levels through more exercise, without taking drugs?  Also, if I do try drugs, would a less-expensive statin (i.e. lovastatin or prevastatin) work just as well as simvastatin? Thank you very much.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Renklauf,  Normally, diet and exercise changes can improve cholesterol levels.  For many people, this alone may simply not be enough.  Often one can get about a 10% or so reduction.  If the chlesterol level is 250, a 10% reduction alone is simply not enough.  In your case, your numbers are borderline so exercise may be enough.  However, if you do opt for this it is important to follow up and make sure that your cholesterol has dropped sufficiently.  If not, medications may still be needed.  Regarding which statin to use, all work in basically the same way.  Some of the newer ones work a bit better and may have a few less side effects; however, these benefits may not be enough to be significant.  I would recommend you discuss with you doctor which one would be appropriate for you.  Even if you choose to use medicines, adding exercise to your program will be beneficial.  Exercise helps so many different issues with the body that you'll get benefits more than just lowering your cholesterol.  Talk with your doctor before starting a new exercise program to make sure there isn't a reason not to.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Rene,  There are actually a few ways to interpret this.  A drop of 20 mm Hg in the blood pressure is, by definition, a significant drop in blood pressure.  The converse to this is that both pressures are still normal.  I suspect that your dizziness after standing for long periods of time is due to the blood beginning to pool in the legs causing less to go to your brain.  This is actually very common, especially in women.  It can be helped by keeping the legs moving when standing and making sure to stay very hydrated.  The goal should be to keep your urine colorless (no yellow).  This would indicate you are maximally hydrated.  If you continue to have trouble with this I would recommend you discuss this with your doctor.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Turns out, my heart rate had dropped to 31 when I'm in the deep sleep pattern. It would really concern them, so they would wake me up. I had an ablation done a year ago for tacycardia. Don't know if that had anything to do with this now or not. Earlier in the year I was having slow heart rate during the day, sometimes falling to 48. I would really drag, I would be so exhausted. It seems to be fine now during the day, but at times I still get exhausted doing little things or just walking to the mailbox and back. Now its at night when I am sleeping. The night nurses all said that was very dangerous to go down to 31. I told my doctors associate that came to see me and he didn't seem to be too concerned. Should I worry about it going that low when I'm asleep and check with another doctor?\n\n",

If there are symptoms indicating that the heart rate is too low, such as low oxygen levels or signs of acidosis, then it may need some treatment.   If there are no symptoms it should be followed closely to see if there are any symptoms that develop.    You may also need to consider the dose of your norvasc.  This can affect heart rate also.  In particular, if you are taking it at night, before bed, you may need to adjust this some.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Basically, anything that decreases blood flow to the brain can induce syncope.  The relationship to eating is a little difficult to put together.  I would recommend you see your doctor to have a general evaluation.  Doing an EKG to look for any possible rhythm problems such as long QT syndrome is a good idea.

I would think it difficult to get this high simply by diet alone.  As such, using a medication to bring them down is very appropriate.  Both do have generic forms available.  The niaspan is vitamin B3 (niacin) extended release form.  You may be able to find this at a vitamin store.  It is important to get the extended release form though.  Taking a large dose of the non-extended release form is likely to give you some very nasty side effects.  The Lovaza is Omega-3-fatty acids.  Each 1 gram pill contains about 465 mg of EPA and about 375mg of DHA.  You may also be able to find this at a vitamin store.  You can compare ingredients to see if they are the same.  Be sure to let your doctor know if you are using these generics so that your doctor is fully aware of the medications you are taking.  Best wishes.\n\n",

It is important to determine if there is an underlying disease process that is causing this or if it is just within the normal range for you, as part of the aging process (electrical system) .  There's not much to be done in the meantime unless you develop other unusual symptoms such as dizziness, difficulty breathing, pain or other symptoms of heart attack (feeling faint, dizzy, chest and/or arm/shoulder pain, feeling of impending doom, sweating, pale skin, anxiety, etc.  If you notice a pattern or palpitations, keep a record of these to report to your doctor.

Frequently, the heart monitor alarm would go off, and read \"ST II HI 2.1\" or once, \"ST AVF HI\". However, the nurses and doctor didn't seem to think this was important. Could anyone tell me what these readings meant? Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi SeraphisCain,  If I am correct, the monitor you are describing is the bedside monitor.  These monitors are referred to as rhythm monitors because they are very good at assessing rhythms but not very good at assessing other subtle things such as ST changes.  A formal 12-lead ECG is need for this.  ST is a segment of the heart rhythm that often becomes elevated during episodes where the heart is not getting enough blood flow to one of its areas (termed ischemia).  I suspect that the monitor was trying to say that the ST segment was elevated and alert the medical team about this.  The team was likely not concerned because the monitor can't really tell this even though it thinks it can.  If you were not having symptoms of a heart attack the machine is almost certainly wrong.  If your doctors wanted to truly assess this a formal 12-lead is needed.  Best wishes.\n\n",

My breathing gets shallow and my heart is beating way harder than it should. I know you're not supposed stop cold after jogging but i have no choice since i feel im about to keel over on the pavement.  I saw the cardiologist she said nothing was wrong with the way my heart looks. I do have asthma which flares up when i exercise sometimes, but not necessarly when i experience these symptoms. I also have a benign heart murmer, my sister was born with a hole in her heart, prolapsed valves run in the family.   I stopped worrying about it because i stopped jogging since i was afraid, until last night when i was with a partner and afterward the same thing happened.

    "content": "Hi Hesta,  Your symptoms are consistent with not getting enough blood flow to your brain causing the lightheadedness.  This is most commonly caused by being dehydrated.  If you are a little dehydrated then exercising it will accentuate the symptoms of the dehydration and may be enough to begin to make you feel lightheaded.    Being sure to drink plenty of water and staying well hydrated during the exercise may help prevent this from happening.   You may also want to see your doctor to see if you are anemic.  If you are anemic it is similar to being dehydrated since you don't have as many red blood cells to carry oxygen.  I would recommend you see your primary doctor for a general evaluation to look for some of these things.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I'm less familiar with adult ECG's as I'm a pediatrician so I'm not sure how much a difference of 10 years will make in interpreting the results.  I do not think it will make much of a difference, though.    Tables exist with standard, age related \"normals\" for ECG's.  You may not need to have the ECG redone.  Rather, you may just need to have the doctor know that the age is wrong and to reanalyze the ECG by hand rather than using the computer interpretations (which should always be verified by direct visualization anyway).

At about 2 years ago, I went for an ECG test and it was cleared.   Recently I realised that the frequency has increased and I even start to have the pain around my left jaw and left arm. The pain is sometimes mild and sometime strong. Again it lasted just a couple of minutes and stopped. Recently it even occur when I'm not stress up.  2. The back of my neck seems to be rather tensed up and when I rest my neck against something solid such as dining chair, something like leaning back to rest my head, my neck just below the skull become numb! I didn't have this problem before.  Is it normal? Has anything wrong with me??\n\n",

Regarding your head pain, it sounds like you may be having some tension causing your nerves that supply the back of the head to be more sensitive than normal.  So, when you lean on the back of your neck it is causing more irritation of the nerve.  Your doctor can help evaluate this also.    Bets wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Mutant1981,  There is a well known syndrome called \"white coat syndrome\" where the heart rate and blood pressure can elevate when seeing the doctor.  This can occur due to having vital signs checked also.  Trying relaxation techniques can help, such as taking deep breaths.  If the pulse is high but the blood pressure (systolic) is unaffected it is a little bit less likely to be due to this.  The reason is that the pulse elevation is due to release of epinephrine by the body due to anxiety.  The epinephrine causes increased heart rate as well as increased blood pressure.  If your heart rate is elevated without BP changes it may be due to some dehydration.  Drinking plenty of water is important when donating plasma.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I get heart palpitations from time to time and really strange abnormal rhythms rarely. I also get dizzy and weak and sometimes short of breath when I exercise. I exercise a lot so I'm in pretty good shape, and these symptoms get better when I'm in better shape and exercise more. I also have mild asthma, so it could just be that. But another thing is, my friends tell me sometimes I look greyish, especially around my lips, even blue. What else could this be? I had an echocardiogram abroad where it was much cheaper, and the doctor said he didn't see anything wrong, but I don't trust him because he also said he didn't hear a murmur, and every other doctor does. I looked at the echo printout and it says everything is normal--chamber size, contraction, etc--except, \"trivial tricuspid regurgitation, trivial mitral regurgitation.\" I know I'll eventually have to pony up the money and get an echo in the states, but in the meantime, what do you think is going on?

    "content": "Hi Betty123,  Split heart sounds are a normal finding.  They occur because the blood pressure in the body is higher than the blood pressure in the lungs.  This causes the valves of the heart to close at a slightly different time leading to the split sounds heard.  Murmurs are very common.  They can be innocent and harmless or can be related to a more severe problem.  Based on these echo results, they may be hearing an innocent murmur or possibly a murmur related to the regurgitation.  Follow up with your doctor is important.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Methadone and blood pressure",
    "content": "I am currently attending a clinic and undergoing Methadone Maintenance Treatment (MMT) for opioid dependancy.  My clinic uses the cherry flavored liquid methadone mixture as opposed to pills or wafers, and lately I have been IVing my \"take-home\" dose.  I know this is discouraged and in no way benefits me.  I also know that the bio-availability of orally ingested methadone is just as high as any other method of ingestion, but I am apparently fixated on the ritual of IVing from when I used to use illicit opiates.  My question is this:  can injecting liquid Methadone mixture into my veins eventually clog up my cardiovascular system?  Can it also raise my blood pressure?  I just found out I have a very high BP (180 over 118) and I'm only 27 years old.  Since I found out about my high blood pressure I've abstained from IVing altogether.  But I'm still curious if my past practices have had an impact on my BP.  Thank you very much for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 40 year old female with no history of heart problems. While there is no history of heart disease in my family, I am experiencing some unexplained pain. Yesterday, out of nowhere, I felt like I pulled a muscle in my chest (ribs, front, side and back), shoulder blade, and  my left arm hurt, all with constant pain that turned to stabbing pain with movement, including while breathing. I cannot take in a full breath without stabbing pain in my sternum. My upper abdominal area aches too. I sweat through the night last night and have been fatigued and light headed all day today. The pain is still here, though slightly better. In the past, I have had salpingitis, followed by surgery (oopherectomy salpingo & apendectomy) in 1995. I have IBS, and 2 years ago was told I have very high cholesterol, but not given meds for it. I take birth control pills, and use Clariton D and Nasocort AQ. Years ago, my OB/GYN mentioned my heart sounded like I may have MVP, but I have never seen a Dr. about it. I am wondering if my pain is bad enough that I should be seen at the hospital. I don't want to be viewed as a hypochondriac. Your thoughts?\n\n",

My blood pressure has risen in the last year. I also have constant headaches that sometimes make me sick to my stomach. I do smoke and probably do not eat correctly or i should say enough.

I have had 2 acl replacements. neither were cadaver replacements.  I have had a pnuemo thorax, complete collapse of left lung.  I've had 3 oral surgieries. I also had non contagious hepatitis when I was 9. I have a torn superior labrum in my left shoulder.  And on and off back problems.      My father has marphans. My grandmother died from an aortic rupture due to marphans. My father has diabetis. And both sides of my family have several heart, diabetic, and cancer problems.      I am currently not on any meds. As I have no insurance and can't afford it at this time.

    "content": "Hi Elephantgirl,  You may want to have a tilt-table test done.  This tests for a condition known as neurocardiogenic syncope.  This is a complex condition that involves the heart and the nerves.  Normally, when a person stands up or is standing for a little while the blood \"settles\" a little to the legs.  Subsequently the heart speeds up a bit to compensate.  In this condition, nerve fibers in the heart sense the increase in heart rate and \"think the heart is beating too fast\" so they signal to slow the heart rate down.  This slowing causes a reduced blood flow to the brain and the person passes out (has a syncope episode).  The body then compensates and blood flow is restored appropriately.  This sounds bad but is not actually dangerous.  The danger comes by falling and hurting oneself when passing out.  A tilt table test looks for this condition.  If it is found it is quite easily treated.  Treatment for syncope in general is to stay very well hydrated.  Best wishes.\n\n",

The treatment for this condition (though a little counterintuitive) is to take a beta-blocker to blunt the rapid heart rate rise and prevent the slowing of the heart.  I would recommend you discuss this with your cardiologist.  If you do have this condition treatment can make a huge difference.  If the heart isn't the cause you may want to see a neurologist.  Another possible treatment to discuss with your doctor is taking a mineralocorticoid medication to help you keep your blood vessels at maximal \"fullness\".  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I am eighteen years old, female, and have not had any serious medical problems since I was a child. When I was a baby, and then again when I was around seven, I had a seizure. I was not told the exact details, ect., nor do I believe any of my past medical history is related to the question I am about to pose.  Two years ago, mid-2005, I woke up to go to school and was feeling very cold and weak. I put on a hooded sweatshirt and attempted to dress, but could not find the energy. Later in the day I discovered that my hands were dark purple and blotchy, and also shaking. I was sent to the doctors, and then (when the doctors could not draw blood from a prick in my fingers), to the hospital.  Everyone on my mother's side of the family has tiny veins. At the hospital the doctors had to do a little something they called the \"butterfly\", and drew blood from around one of my elbows. The blood was sent off for testing, I was given heating pads for my hands, and was sent home.  The results of the blood test came back normal; my blood was not brown or another unusual color.  Last year I discovered that the purple color in my hands had spread halfway up my forearm. Now, in 2007, the purple color has creeped all the way up to my shoulders, and my feet are also purple.  My temperature usually lingers around 95 degrees, and I shake constantly, sometimes to the point where I cannot write with a pencil. I am tiring more and more easily these days, and though it is summer, I've worn sweaters to sleep in nearly every night.  What is wrong with me? Should I be seriously concerned?\n\n",

    "content": "This is about my father, he's a 63 year old man with several problems going on right now and I'm worried about the care he is receiving.  To begin, he has had stents put in his legs for circulatory problems, then he had a kidney removed due to cancer this past December.  Those problems seemed to be going well then he had a TIA (mini-stroke) in the middle of June.  Since then he has been in and out of the hospital.  When he came home from the TIA (2 weeks in hospital), he had contracted a staph infection. He was home for 2 or 3 days and had to return due to breathing difficulty. He was on a respirator and oxygen, he's had high blood pressure and that was over the top and he also had fluid in his lungs. At this time his kidney began to fail they said and he was put on dialysis.  This went on for a week or so and he seemed to improve, said he didn't need dialysis anymore and sent him home.  He was okay the first day but the 2nd day home he started having breathing problems again.  EMT's came again and they did tests at the hospital and said he had pneumonia.  Said there was a spot on and fluid in his lungs.  Then they diagnosed him with having a panic attack and sent him home a few days later.  He was home 3 days and was on oxygen, Klonopin (which he reacted horribly to) and couldn't breathe.  We were told it was panic attacks so we kept telling him he's not dying, just breathe etc... He couldn't walk, would curl up in a ball and when the nurse who was giving him his intravenous antibiotic for staph was there, he began crawling on the floor unable to breathe or stand or sit.  EMT's rushed him to the hospital, his oxygen was at 70, he was ashen and they almost lost him.  He has been in since then and I don't know ALL the different meds he is on (I live in Tampa and he is in Miami) but he had to be sedated due to water around his heart and have a tube put in his throat for a week.  They tried to take him off one day and he couldn't breathe again so they put him back on.  Now, he is awake and his oxygen is good, his kidney is good (they say) and now he has heart problems.  Also, he has been hallucinating and not being himself at all since they brought him out of sedation (tube was removed and he was awake on Friday, today is Sunday). He is having a catheterization on Monday to check his heart but they have him on Haldol, to try and stop his hallucinations and help him sleep.  I'm not a doctor :)  but I read that Haldol is an antipsychotic (my dad's NOT crazy or anything like that) and not good for kidney and heart problems.  I can find out what other meds he is on but I hope that someone can maybe shed some light on this for me.  I am worried that he isn't being treated correctly for his problems and I'd just like to have an opinion on this! Sorry this is SO long but I there's alot going on and I wanted to give the best picture of the situation.  Thank you for taking the time to read this and hope to hear from someone!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Pandorella,  Your father's case sounds quite complex.  It sounds as if this all may have been started off by a toxin from the bacteria.  These types of infections (particularly from staph) can be quite dangerous and lead to multisystem failure.  Regarding his ongoing issues my best advise is to talk with your doctor about your concerns.  Even with all that you've told me I have a difficult time grasping all that is going on given that I cannot exam him and review his chart.    Haldol is an antipsychotic but it is also frequently used to help treat hallucinations and \"hospital induced\" psychosis where patients can be come disoriented during an illness.  It sounds as if his doctors were using the haldol for the hallucinations.  It also is sedating and can help with sleep.  Sorry I can't be more specific.  I hope your father gets better soon.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Luke2003,  There are many causes of chest pain.  With her family history, I'm sure you are wondering if it is her heart.  I can't say for sure given the limitations of the internet but her pain being stabbing doesn't fit well with heart pain that is generally described more as a severe pressure.  heart pain is also difficult to narrow to one specific area.  Her age also argues against a heart problem.  Other common causes of chest pain are pleurisy (inflammation of the lining of the lungs), reflux, pneumonias and other lung problems, and costochondritis.  Given her history of pneumonias, she may have some pleurisy causing her pain.  Pleurisy is often made worse by deep breathing, which causes the lung lining to rub the chest wall.  If her symptoms don't improve  I would recommend that you have her see a doctor.  There are often clinics in town that can see people without insurance on a free or reduced fee basis.  The local health department can often help locate these clinics if needed.  Best wishes.\n\n",

No meds now other than occasional OTC\u2019s for heartburn, headaches etc. Have excellent BP (generally 110/70) and good Cholesterol (144/59) Symptoms:  Was having palpitations in my chest \u2013 the sensation of falling \u2013 possibly heart skipping a beat. It happened on a daily basis \u2013 sometimes 2 \u2013 6 times a day \u2013 for about 4 months. Then suddenly gone \u2013 have not had in over a month. Now I am having excessive belching. About 4-8 times a day I get the feeling that I have a bubble of air stuck in my throat. It passes within seconds (I make myself belch) but as it happens I feel like I can\u2019t breathe and clutch my throat.  I also often have a \u2018numb/tingly\u2019 feeling in the roof of my mouth and upper front teeth. Very odd.  I also regularly feel that it is hard to breathe through my nose (stuffy) and when I laugh a lot or talk a lot I often lose my breath\u2026 Also \u2013 I get hot flashes VERY often and feel dizzy on occasion too. Never passed out though. Sometimes get a tingly feeling in top of head too. I have had many tests done but no conclusions \u2013 everything checks out fine. Lungs good (despite smoking for 8 years) and heart okay too.  This all started in December last year \u2013 right after my father had a mild heart attack at 55. At first I thought it was some kind of sympathy symptoms! But now I am frustrated and desperate. I have done a lot of research and much of it leads me to heart related issues \u2013 yet ECG, ECHO and Holter Monitor checked out ok. Plus, no chest pain (or any pain period). Any thoughts \u2013 grateful for anything you can toss my way! Maybe I should just go to the ER and let them barrage me with all tests possible?! Maybe all these symptoms are unrelated\u2026 ugh!\n\n",

You may want to consider being evaluated for reflux.  \"Silent\" reflux can cause many of the symptoms you are describing without the actual burning feelings associated with classic reflux.  It may also be worth having your thyroid checked.  If the thyroid gland were enlarged a little it may be pressing on the trachea/esophagus some and creating your symptoms.  Best wishes.\n\n",

However, I am able to walk as many hours I want.  This problem is there for quite some times even in my child hood.  Any activity which require running, climbing or hard physical activity, I get tired immediately.  Is this lack of stamina? if year what will be the cause?

    "content": "Since it only seems to affect you when you are doing increased exertion and not simple muscle workouts I would be a little suspicious that there may be a problem with your muscles ability to metabolize energy correctly.  It may be that at low levels of activity they are able to keep up but at higher levels they simply can't make enough energy and fatigue quickly.  Unfortunately this is quite a complex biochemical pathway and there could be a problem anywhere along the way.  There are a few places that I would recommend starting.  First, I would suggest you see your doctor and draw a lactate level after doing some strenuous exercise to see if it is inappropriately high.  From there it gets more complex.  You may want to see a sports medicine physician for further evaluation.  I can't think of a different specialty to see.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 26 year old female and I am (normally) of good health and fitness. I have recently been seeing the doctor due to feeling \"shaky\" (almost like in car that's idoling) - although it is not all that visible. In addition to this I've been oddly aware of my heart beat and can feel it racing and having palpitations.My heart rate would be well over 100 which is unusual for me (usually mid 60s). My doctor initially took several blood tests and all came back normal - He also took an EKG and it came back with a fast heart rate and a few palpitations. I have decreased caffeine to only one a day and still the symtoms persisted. He now prescribed Toprol (25mg) and it has lessened the symptoms drastically but they have not gone away. I am scheduled for an Echo next week but don't think they'll find anything because I had one a year ago (they were looking for cardiac sarcoidosis due to a family member)  The doctor mentioned Mitral Valve Prolapse syndrome and so many of the symptoms I've had (although some have been going on for years), according to various sites, are listed for MVPS such as:   - heart palpitations (heart fluttering)  - chest pains  - feeling dizzy - balance problems/vertigo  - fatigue/low energy  - loss of memory, trouble concentrating  - depression  - panic attacks  - irritable bowel syndrome  - mood swings  - shortness of breath  - shaking after exorcise  - sleep problems - bad reaction from novocain\u2026flood of adrenaline (I have to use carbocain instead at dentist)  Additionally a year ago I experienced a tramatic and unexpected loss of a close family member an event for which I read to be a possible trigger.  Do you think that MVPS is likely? The problem is that I don't usually see much having to do with \"shakiness\" listed for symptoms...  Thank you so much for your time and help.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Kaestar, Toprol is a cardiac medication known as a Beta Blocker. As such, it has the ability to slow the heart down as well as decrease blood pressure. I am not sure how often it was prescribed for you - but even twice a day 25 mg is a medium level dose (doses range typically from 12.5 to 50 mg once to twice a day.)  Tachycardia can explain nearly all of the symtoms you display.  An echocardiogram (non-invasive ultrasound of the heart) is the best next diagnostic test to determine what kind of problems your heart is having - mechanically. There are additional tests - TEE (transesophageal electrocardiogram) that can also be done which is even  more specific to cardiac function, and can identify if any valves are dysfunctional.  If the Echo and TEE are inconclusive, an EP (ElectroPhysiology) study can be done to determine if the problem is electrically driven.  When your Echo is done, please ask your cardiologist to go over the findings and explain them in plain English.  As far as havig had an Echo a year ago, things can certainly change in a year.  Please go into your test with an open mind, and be prepared to ask questions.\n\n",

I am stating that there are diagnostic tests that can help determine the cause of your dysrhythmia (problem with your heart rhythm).  You posted that you already have an Echo scheduled. Please be sure to make that appointment. And ask the cardiologist who will be present for that test to explain the test and the purpose of the test, and the results of the test in plain talk with you.  There is an abnormality as you have noted yourself in the fact that the heart rate is twice what you know your baseline rate to be.  The question is why.  It is more prudent to explore cardiac problems first, to make sure that the heart pump itself is functioning fully properly. Then you may feel to pursue other sources such as anxiety, stress, and grief.  Please keep your appointment!  The other symptoms such as shakiness may or may not be related. Your cardiologist, armed with the results of the Echo, may be able to lend more light to that question.  Please keep us posted on the findings.\n\n",

Gastric acids can cause severe pain under the breast bone - which could be described as \"brain freeze\" as you state, or cramping, or dull ache.  It may also be that your mother suffers from GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) as well as you may.  Have you ever tried any over the counter remedies like antacids?  If the pain persists, it would be wise to bring it to your primary physician to evaluate. I would hate to see you suffer from something that may be easily remedied! Or worse, have an underlying problem that really does need the input and advice of a doctor!\n\n",

I can feel it most often when lying on my back. I can also see the surrounding areas of the belly button pulsating. The doctor told me sometimes you can feel the aorta pulsating while resting. He felt my abdomen around my belly button and decided I have an ultrasound of my aorta and a x-ray of my chest done. He wants to rule out an aneurysm. As I researched this issued I found that this condition usually exist in peeps over the age of 50. I'm thinking like wow I'm too young for this.  The image tests is scheduled on the 14th of this month... I'm so nervous. My question is, Can a healthy aorta cause pulsing sensations and is there a possibility that I'm worrying for nothing?

If you are healthy it is likely that there is no problem; however, doing the ultrasound is very reasonable and wise since aortic aneurysms can be dangerous.  It's best to be sure there isn't one or find it early if there is.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 21 year old male. I have had my symptoms for 3 years now. I get it EVERY month. It starts with at my left shoulder. When i breath in, i will get a feeling like oxygen cant pass through with ease. This usually lasts about 6 hours. After that, i no longer feel anything in my shoulder, but i feel a pain on my left side. When i breath in, it feels like there is not enough room for my lungs to expand. My heart, and my lungs feel like they are being pressed against my rib cage. Its very frightening. The pain is an unimaginable one. It keeps me up for 2 days, because it is so hard to breath. My breaths are VERY short, and fast paced. I am also very sensitive to cold during these 2 days where the pain is unbarable. i shiver uncrontrollably sometimes, and this only makes the pain WORSE! Please help. I have been to 2 different doctors. Both gave me anti-inflamitory drugs, which does absolutely NOTHING! I've had an X-ray, which showed nothing. Please, Please, Please help.\n\n",

I can provide a few ideas that really don't perfectly fit but may help give you some direction to see if a diagnosis can be made.  You may consider seeing if albuterol (a bronchodilator) will help during one of these episodes.  If it does you may be experiencing an atypical asthma attack.  Perhaps you have some pleurisy-inflammation of the lining of the lungs that can cause pain.  Usually this pain is sharp and will be relieved to some degree by ibuprofen.  Beyond this I can't come up with a good explanation.  You may want to see a pulmonologist or possibly a GI doctor for further evaluation.  As a long shot, a neurologist may be able to give you some help also.  Best wishes.  Keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "That's an odd set of problems.  I have a few questions for you:  -Are you overweight or at a healthy weight -How tall are you? -Generally are you physically fit -What medical problems have you had in the past -And what, if any, medical history do blood relatives have -Was there any significant event 3 years ago that occurred just before onset of the symptoms -Do you smoke or use any drugs; or do you take any regular medications other than meds you take to attempt to treat these symptoms -What's your blood pressure like -Are your symptoms exacerbated during times of physical exertion, or are symptoms provoked by exertion and when you're not experiencing the symptoms do you get \"winded\" easily when walking -Is there any common denominator to the onset of the symptoms like seasonal, stressful situations, etc that you can find?  Are there any triggers that are identifiable?  Do these symptoms occur during times of high stress? -Is there anything that you do that relieves the pain, even just a little, during an episode?  This could be something really simple that your doctor hasn't made it to or a combination of different problems that presents in a confusing, difficult to treat manner.  My first reaction was just as Dr. Lowe described; pleurisy, but if anti-inflammatory meds aren't relieving the pain then it's a little harder.  What anti-inflammatory medications have you been prescribed?  Maybe the answer will be revealed if you provide some more information.  But regardless, you should investigate this with your doctor during a physical exam.  How long have you been seeking treatment for this?  Throughout the course of the three years or only recently?  If it's been three years with no resolution, I would suggest speaking with a third physician.  Get back to us with some more information and to let us know how things are turning out.

    "title": "A lot of info",
    "content": "I am 140lbs, and about 5'8\".  I used to work out regularly prior to my condition. I would say about 18months prior to my condition is when i started to work out regularly. Lifted weights, did some cardio, etc... I am still pretty fit, although i don't excersise as often as i used to. I thought maybe my condition was because of the weight lifting so i've stopped. My condition continued, so i assumed it wasnt because of weight lifting, so i still do it every so often. About 1-2 times a week, i will do some push-ups, and curl some weights, But nothing to straining. I do this just to keep my physique.  I remember the day i first felt the pain. It was my first year of college, and i was in a class taking notes. All of a sudden, i felt a sharp pain in my side. I left immediatly and went to the health center. They gave me ibuprofin. I don't think it helped, and i cant remember how long the pain lasted. (maybe its stress related? Im still in college, in my 4th year now.)  I have started to keep a log in excel of how often my symptoms occured. There are 4 fields:  1. The date i feel the should \"thing\",  2. The date in which the pain in my side becomes unbarable,  3. The date in which the pain becomes barable (i can move around i.e. walk), and  4. The date in which i no longer feel anything. Let me share with you what i have so far. First Sign\tStarted Hard\tHard Ended\tEnded N/A\t2/28/2007\tN/A\t3/9/2007 4/16/2007\t4/21/2007\t4/23/2007\t4/30/2007 I started logging it recently. So this info might not be worth anything for now. But so far, it seems to be about 52days apart, and lasts a total of 14days. The N/A's are there because i didnt add those 2 fields untill the second time around.   I have never had any medical problems except for these pains.  Here is where things get even more interesting. One of my 2 older sisters has sysmptoms similar to mine. She has had her pains for 9 years. She is 23 years old, and about 5'2\". She has been to a number of doctors. She's had cat scans done, blood tests done, colonostpies, and X-Rays.  The difference between her symptoms and mine are:  1. She gets the pains on both side (Sometimes on the left side, and sometimes on the right side).  2. She has the same \"heads up\" as i do with the shoulder. The same day she feels the shoulder \"thing\" is the same day the side pains hit, and become unbarable.  3. Her pains last a total of only 3 days. But these 3 days for her are unbarable.  4. The frequency of these occurrences for her (9 years ago) would be about twice a year. Now on the other hand, she gets them about twice a month.  (they started to occure more frequenctly when she started college) . 5. Sometimes she will get the pain exactly 1 week after she felt it the first day. For example; if she felt the pain on monday 1-1-2007, it would last for 3 days, then go away, then on monday 1-8-2007 she will get the pain again for 3 days. 6. The pain moves. If it starts on the left side, it will stay on the left side, but it will move up and down on her left side. Same thing on the right side, It will stay on the right side, but it will move up and down, untill its gone. (My pain does not move. Its always pretty much in the same region on my left side)   Neither me, nor my sister uses any drugs or smokes.  My pains are not induced by physical exertion, and i do not get winded easily when walking. I can play basketball, football, and do anything normally when i do not have my pains.   There is no common denominator to the onset of the symptoms that i can find. The only trigger i have is the shoulder \"thing\".   The only thing i do to relieve the pain is to lie down, and let it pass. Movement hurts a lot!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Jennycrab, Yes, having your heart go \"pitter-patter\", (and not because you are in love) can be very scary. You aluded to but were not specific as to how frequently you have been having these palpitations. I would also be interested in knowing what is the typical response you exhibit to the extremes of stress that life can throw at us. Many people find that the \"flight or fight\" response that is a normal reaction to stress causes such an adrenaline rush to their system that they experience a rapid heart rate as a result.  Your experience of this rapid heart rate could very well be felt as palpitations. I would venture that if the cardiologist is telling you it is benign, tnen your vital signs must be within normal range, and you have only the discomfort of the feeling to plague you, and not a genuine problem. if on the one hand, you find that you have a heightened response to stress, you may wish to explore ways to \"de-stress\", and improve your coping mechanisms. If at any time you have chest pain, or the pallpitations cause you additional fear, please go back to the emergency room that already has records on you and be evaluated.\n\n",

While you may get some relief form an antacid, it is possible that a severe gastritis may not be helped by antacids and may need a stronger medicine.  The pancreas is also in this area and is classically described as causing pain that radiates to the back.  Pancreatitis can produce your pain as well.  If your pain is not improving over the next few days I would recommend that you see your doctor.  There are often clinics that can see patients without insurance for a free or reduced fee.

I asked him to tell me about this condition and all I was able to extract from him is that it was nothing to worry about, but if one day I wanted to be, say, an airforce pilot, it might affect my candidacy for such position.

    "content": "The electrical system of the heart starts at the Sinus Atrial or SA node where the signal for the heart to beat originates (sort of like the battery of an electrical system).  The signal then travels through the atrium to the atrio-ventricular node (the AV node).  It then moves down into the ventricles into the bundle of his which shortly there after divides into two \"wires\", the left and right purkinje fibers.  In a bundle branch block, there is a delay in the electrical signal traveling through these purkinje fibers.  A delay of the right system results in a right bundle branch block and a delay in the left results in a left bundle branch block.  A RBBB may be associated with underlying heart problems; however, it is also a fairly common in normal, healthy hearts.  A LBBB is not generally considered normal so a work up should be done to look for any problems.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Dextrocardia may or may not be associated with Situs Inversus.  If you were not diagnosed until age 23 I suspect that you are not having any problems with it.  Dextrocardia may not be picked up initially on an x-ray because it is rare so when we see the heart on the right instead of left we usually assume the x-ray is backwards.  Unless an astute physician looks for other clues it can easily be missed.  Dextrocardia may have associated cardiac abnormalities or it may be an incidental reversal with no complications.  If there are no other complications the heart will function as if it were on the left without problems.  To my knowledge, this condition is not increasing in the population.  It is fairly rare but I have seen a handful of cases over the past several years.  To determine if you also have situs inversus one should have an x-ray of the abdomen or ultrasound to look at the positioning of the abdominal organs.  As an aside, when this condition is diagnosed it is always advised to actually listen to the heart and determine which side it is on to be sure the x-ray is not, in fact, backwards and that dextrocardia is the diagnosis.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I was wondering what would cause the heart rate of a 15 year old male who is physically fit to drop while horizontal to around 30-35 bpm.  Some symptoms include tingling and numbness throughout the body.  He has fainted 2 times.  He has also had twitching once during the tingling and numbness.  We are seeing a pediatric cardiologist and she suggested increasing fluids.  We are returning to her at the end of the month to have him checked to see if the fluids have helped to increase his blood volume.  The numbness and tingling are still continuing, even with the increase in fluids, and the twitching occurred after our initial visit to the cardiologist and with the increased fluids.  His maternal grandfather died of a heart attack at age 53, but he also had diabetes.  His paternal grandparents both died from heart failure, but were later in age (early 80's) when they passed.  He is not taking any medications.  He wrestles for his high school and is pretty physically fit and is healthy otehrwise.  An echo of his heart showed that it was not abnormal.\n\n",

A 24 hour holter monitor may be needed also to look at the heart rhythm over a full day.  In some very conditioned athletes, the heart rate can slow down to this low and be normal.  Generally, if it is normal there should be no symptoms.  Given your son's tingling symptoms his heart rate may be \"too low\" for him.  Seeing a cardiologist is the best next step.

While I am at it....the cardiologist said something about putting him on a tilt table to see if the heart stops at anytime if the increased fluids does not help.  Isn't that kind of dangerous?  Should I get a second opinion before doing anything like that?  Is it possible that she just worded it wrong?  I do not like to hear \"we will see if we can get his heart to stop\".

When a positive test occurs, the heart rate slows down dramatically during the vertical positioning and the patient passes out.

    "title": "Low Blood Pressure / BradyCardia?",
    "content": "Before i start, i'll let you know that i have seen my family doctor, and i'm scheduled for a barrage of tests next week (blood tests / ecg) etc..   I'm just starting to get paranoid waiting, and have questions...  Male / 28 / 5'11\" / 181lbs  In the last 4 - 5 months i've been having trouble with Postural Hypotension (Orthostatic hypotension).  I only ever seem to get very dizzy is when i stand up from sitting down or laying down.  Usually this lasts for 5 - 10 seconds, once i'm over it, i'm 100% fine.   I have only ever passed out once from this (this is when i made the dr. apt with my family doctor).  My doctor took my blood pressure in the office sitting down, he said it was low, \"below 100/60\" is what he said, and when he took it right as i stood up, he said one of the numbers dropped by about 10.  I assume the first number.    I started googling and found some links to heart rates.  i took my resting heart rate several times over 2 days,  and I'm always around 47 - 49.  I've never gone into the 50's, or below 47.    I've read that in atheletes, or people who exercise regularly , low heart rate is normal, i'm not sure if i fit into that category or not.    My history:  On April 8th 2006 i weighed 355 pounds.  with diabetes running in the family, i decided to do something about it and i started a low glycemic diet.  I did this following a registered plan, and was monitored / weighed weekly.   In 13 months i've lost 170 pounds, and am now at my goal weight of approx 181 pounds.   In the last 9 months, i've exercised A LOT.  I get to the gym about 5 - 6 times a week (although 5 times is average).  I do not do any weight / resistance training, i only do cardio.  I usually do 45 - 60 minutes (50 minutes average).  When i do this training, i definitely push myself as hard as i can.  Would this put me in the 'athlete' category, after only 8 - 9 months of hard training?     I drink 3 - 4 liters of water daily, and have had my electrolytes checked (came back fine, they're one of the things being re-tested next week).     I used to smoke marijuana (almost daily for a couple years), but since i started on the change lifestyle, i don't do it a lot.  only sometimes on weekends, and not every weekend at that.  I do not smoke cigarettes, nor have i ever.  Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Schitzo - First off, congratulations on a remarkably successful (and very timely) weight loss program. You've done incredibly well with that. Stay with it and be well.   Between the marked change your body's regulatory systems are having to adjust to and the consistent and high intensity workouts you've been doing it isn't surprising that your heart rate might have fallen into a below normal (sometimes \"athletic\") range. This may or may not be related to the orthostatic hypotension, since there are other things your body lived with for a long time that are different now as well. If this problem doesn't correct itself in a reasonable length of time, there are relatively simple tests (tilt table, for example) that can be used to determine if you have a defective autonomic response that has decided to stay that way. Baroreceptor failure is a common cause of orthostatic hypotension and also of common syncope (fainting). It's not unusual to see this after a large weight loss, but it should reset itself over time. Since this is happening rather late in the game, it may be that your baroreceptors (strategically located nerve bundles dedicated to regulating blood pressure) have gone on strike. If so there are medications which can be prescribed to treat this.   Your cardio workout program, combined with the weight loss would be enough to put your heart rate into that athletic range, and that, combined with confused baroreceptors would be likely to cause your problem. I don't think the marijuana use has anything to do with this.   I hope you find this helpful. Please let us know how things go.\n\n",

The more likely possibility is that you had some low blood pressure, possibly from standing to quickly or from standing too long, especially if you were dehydrated a little.  Drinking plenty of water will help prevent this from happening.  If this happens again I would suggest that you see a doctor.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello - While waiting for Dr. Lowe I'd like to  offer an opinion based on what you've added here.  I think it more likely, based on  everything including seeing  black and white fields in your vision before you wound up on the floor, that you very likely have had a seizure of some  sort. These are often announced by a visual \"aura\" of lights, colors, or other odd patterns or a loss of vision. This, along with the twitching, dizziness, etc., may well have been a seizure. It  is of course also possible that you had a really extremely violent episode of vertigo, but that can also occur alongside other symptoms during a seizure.   I  would strongly suggest you bring this event to the attention of an internist or neurologist, especially if it happens  again.   Good luck to you.\n\n",

In addition, when low blood pressure causes fainting, the person often will describe the field of vision going black (sometimes described as going into a tunnel).  This is due to lack of blood flow to the visual center of the brain.  The lack of blood flow causes the fainting.  Then, when one does faint, the fainting causes the person to become more flat allowing blood flow to improve to the brain and conciousness is restored.  Best wishes.\n\n",

In Febuary 2007 had chest pains with shortness of  breath was admitted to the hospital overnight.

Imagining test before and after chemical stress test was fine.  As of March 2007 I have been  seeing a cardiologist  had a echo cardiogram and ekg. Tests was fine. Additonal blood tests all were fine.   My problem is this heavy pressure feeling in my chest. Lasting for 30 minutes to an hour. Comes and goes if I\"m sitting or standing. Feel tired a lot.... no energy sometimes. Shortness of breath sometimes with the heaviness in chest area..sometimes my chest bones feels sore.  Don't have diabetes my blood pressure runs low sometimes. Never had any high blood presure.  My pressure runs 100/70.  My doctor ruled out doing a cardiac catherzation to further explore possibilites. I'm not imagining this heavy feeling my chest it scares me but I don't know what else to do. I have weird cough sometimes when I get this heavy feeilng in my chest. They check for blood clot in lungs but my test said my lungs were fine.   I'm seeing the best Cardiovasular Team in my city.

    "content": "Dear Lena23, Sometimes our bodies will say what our minds are not able to express.  Have you been experiencing other stressors lately besides your concerns about your heart?  Are there additional stressors in your home, work, or family?  Many people I know who are very self reliant, have difficulty dealing with stress, and have such overall feelings of being out of control of their life, their work, their health, that their bodies will shout out loud with pain, and soreness, and palpitations, and heaviness....... all in an effort to relieve the bottled up pressure cooker of stress deep inside.  If any of this is a possibility for you - I suggest you explore some mental health professionals in your area. Clinical psychologists are ones who are specially trained in helping people find out how to deal with the problems of life... and to provide a gateway to support services.  We all have stresses - we don't all necessarily have the resources to deal with them.  Please consider this as a possible underlying source for your chest/heart pain.\n\n",

    "content": "My 36 year old male friend who I have known for 8 years has a constantly runny nose which he has always said based on a doctors diagnos that he received is is due to one lung being smaller than the other...could this be true?  Also, I have just recently learned that this person has been using cocaine once in a while for the past month which they first denied and then later admitted to but he does not see it as a problem and said that it was just a temporary thing to sober up from drinking as a result of stress.  This friend also used cocaine the first day that I met them but I personally never saw them use it again until they got busted six years later for having cocaine on them and admitted to using sometimes.  I have always known this person to use visine and dristan on a daily basis.  As well my friend also experiences neck and facial twitches.    I am wanting to know if the one lung being smaller than the other would cause such a problem with their sinuses.....or has this likely been a coverup for his addiction and symtoms?  Much appreciated!!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello  carduzzi - While this is not exactly a cardiology question you've posed,  I'm not sure where it would go anyway. I will say this, however: your friend clearly has lied to you about cocaine use over a long period of time. I know of no reason why one  lung being smaller than the other would cause a chronic runny nose, but I do know that chronic cocaine use causes many people to have a runny nose, constant  sniffling,  etc. The odd-lung  story sounds like one more lie, and after the lying was already established anyway, my best advice to you would be to find a friend who is not committed to long term cocaine use. You may one day have a reason to be asking a cardiology-related question about this person,  as cocaine can cause seroius heart problems. It can  also cause major legal and personal problems. Do yourself a favor and  find a friend with less dangerous habits and who is more honest with  you.  Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear carduzzi, It is not at all likely that one lung being smaller than the other has anything at all to do with rhinitis (runny nose).  It is very possible that there are two contributing factors to your friends complaint.  Constant use of dristan type products will certainly contribute to \"rebound\" stuffiness and runniness. In fact the directions for use on the container warn the user not to use more than  3 concurrent days in order to not have that problem.  The use of cocaine when snorted will also be a factor in rhinitis.  The alarming part of the use of the cocaine however, is the impact on the heart.  Cocaine is well known to cause heart failure - partly by disturbing the electrical pathways of the heart.  These disturbances are not recouperable.  I have seen young 30ish year old men die over a year's period of time due to heart failure directly connected to the use of cocaine, even after they finally quit.   It sure seems like your friend needs professional help to quit his addictions, and to find the pathway to health away from the drugs.  The first thing your friend, and you, need to acknowledge is that he has a problem. Once admitted, the potential to quit the addiction is better than when a person remains in denial.  I admire and respect your wish to be helpful to your friend.  Please encourage him to accept your concern, and to seek professional help. The local hospital emergency room should have phone numbers for the local support systems available in your area.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Barsan,      I appreciate your concern on behalf of your mother.  While her weight may be somewhat higher than ideal, that fact may be contributory to her cardiac issues, but is probably not in and of itself the only factor. You mention that her lab work is somewhat abnormal.  You did not mention what medications she is taking to correct them.  Many medications can have adverse effect for some people, including generalized weakness.  You did not mention if the doctor had changed her statin.  Also, grapefruit can have an potentiating effect (strengthening effect) when taken with most of the statins, so it is wise to stay away from grapefruit juices or fruit while on the drug.  Other citrus products do not seem to be a problem.        As far as how quickly can a blockage develop:  Very quickly sometimes depending on the source.  An occlusion that was compressed through angioplasty can re-occlude spontaneously.  Even stents that were placed in areas of occlusion can occlude.  There needs to be a combined team effort between cardiology, interventional cardiology and your primary care physician that addresses technological diagnostics/interventions, medical treatments, and nutrition. Please discuss your concerns with your PCP as soon as you are able.\n\n",

Along with that, my head will also feel like it's being inflated and I can't say that I black out but  it's almost like I go blind for about 10 seconds. I also feel like if  I don't sit as soon as possible, I'm going to fall over. The only  time Ive had medical insurance in the past 5 years is when I've been pregnant and my Doctors, no matter what I say to them, tell me that it's coming from pregnancy. Although, I experience this MORE often when I'm NOT pregnant. Please, someone help me out here. I'm so afraid that one day I'm going to fall down the stairs or even drop one of my children.  Oh, and one more thing, my symptoms appear to be getting worse and worse AND when I was pregnant I was told that I had a heart murmur. Not sure if that will help but I figure it won't hurt to mention it.  thank you\n\n",

    "content": "Hi tabithakristen - Your description of the problem is one of the more accurate ones I've heard, and sounds very much like you suffer from orthostatic hypotension - basically a failure of the baroreceptors in your body (which are designed to refexively increase blood pressure and heart rate to compensate for the effects of gravity when one stands up) to do their job. This can range from the occasional and mildly annoying to a real nuisance and, as you've noted, a potential secondary danger from falling.   The short-term trick is to avoid actually passing out. The solution, usually, is to get up slowly, stop, and wait for your body to adjust to the new position. This can be tricky, however, because our natural tendency is to get up and do something. Also, there can be a lag before the pull of gravity causes the blood to drop from your head down into your abdomen and legs, so you sometimes may get up feeling fine, take a few steps (or more than a few) and then get the drop.   While the condition commonly occurs during pregnancy, those who have it all the time may actually, again as you have observed, experience it less when pregnant than otherwise.   If the problem is becoming more severe with time there are any number of possible explanations, most of them in themselves fairly benign, but still well worth looking into. If the condition is the result of a provable failure of the baroreceptor reflex, there are a couple of different medications that can be tried which might relieve the symptoms. First, though, usually, a tilt-table test is performed, which is probably something you wouldn't want to have done while pregnant.   If you can work out some way to have an exam specifically for this problem when not pregnant, I would advise it. Failing at that I can only suggest - very strongly - that you pause after standing and start moving cautiously at first, as big a nuisance as that may be, in order to avoid a possible fall and the risk of whacking your head or otherwise injuring yourself. You may never actually \"fall out\", but the potential is there.   It seems unlikely that the perinatal murmur would be related, but again, it's hard to tell for sure without a neurocardiological workup while not pregnant. There's probably something you could be taking that would help reduce or eliminate the problem.   Wish I could give you something more, but lacking health insurance it's going to be tricky. You might comfort yourself with the knowlege that while it's a very unpleasant sensation it is almost always benign - so long as you take your time in getting up and moving.   Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello again - There are medications to treat baroreceptor reflex failure (BRF) and neurocardiac syncope (a less likely possibility, as you apparently never actually faint and only have the symptoms when you rise from a seated position). The point is that if you can  be diagnosed correctly this can be treated and you likely won't have to live with the problem indefinitely. The only barrier seems to be the cost of the testing and diagnosis. Hopefully there is some sort of workaround for that.  As for RLS being related to this problem, while I  don't know of any specific relationship between the two, there may be, at least in your case. RLS involves the nerves in the legs in some way not clearly understood. So does BRF, in that somehow the nerves in the legs which control the normal function of the veins in them somehow malfunction and the normal veinous return doesn't happen promptly,allowing the blood to pool  down there when it should be getting forced back to the heart and then to the head. Only for a brief moment.    It's not even a theory, just a thought. A tenous connection. Maybe.   I wish you all the best with both things. Please do stay in touch.\n\n",

There are many other contributing factors to a genuine arrythmia, and some of these are unrelated to antihistamine use. And, there are some arrythmias that are fairly common in seniors, are strictly cardiac based, and are treatable when properly diagnosed. Also, while I respect your interest in self treatments, why are you needing ongoing antihistaminic interventions?  Have you discussed your respiratory difficulties with your doctor? Also, do you have any existing underlying medical/cardiac health issues?  What other medications are you taking?  Sometimes a symptom isn't only caused by a single medication, but by a combination of medications - even over the counter ones.  Please consider an office visit with your physician to discuss your concerns.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I'm a 25 years old and about 2 weeks ago I started to notice a dull pressure like pain in my chest towards the upper left between my shoulder and arm pit. It came on suddenly while I was out with some friends that evening and would come and go the rest of that night. Now, I had been doing some moving around of items at my office that day and thought I might just have stretched a muscle funny, but I'm not sure.   Since then, I've been having on and off pressure like poking pains (ranging from mild to dull) towards the center of my chest with it sometimes radiating alittle to the left and right of the center,  to my throat, and sometimes around my lower ribs. I've also been feeling a spasm like pain in my left arm from time to time, but I'm not sure if that is being caused by this or an anxiety pain brought on by my worrying so much on the issue. Also, when I flex my chest forward and pull my arms back I can feel like a tightening in the center of my chest, I feel it also when I wake up,  and the pain seems to lessen when I take a tums or belch, but not fully. Most of the time I usually experiencing these pains randomly throughout the day, but most often when I first wake up and when I'm driving to and from work.   Now, my question about this is- Could this be acid reflux and anxiety I'm having? About three years ago I was having similiar problems and was diagnosed to have acid reflux in my asophagus while the rest of my pain was being caused by  panic attacks, this was determined after two EKGs and a few other tests. The last time I went through this was about two years ago. I guess the reason why I worry is that I haven't been to a doctor since then, I've gained about 20 pounds, and last year my father was diagnosed with Diabetes. I'm already going to see a doctor about this on either monday or tuesday, but I thought I'd ask on here if anyone could give me some insight.\n\n",

Anxiety can most definitely worsen symptoms.  Your doctor may recommend a trial of an acid blocker such as famotidine or ranitidine to see if this helps.  If these do help, but not sufficiently enough there are stronger acid blockers available.  Best to start low and work up as needed.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "my daughter is 16 yrs of age, she is 5'3\" , 122 pounds, generally healthy, except asthma. Family history of heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes. current meds..albuterol inhalation solution for nebulizer.  She had chest pains a few months ago, I took her to the ER, she had an abnormal EKG, but they said for her to see her MD, her MD is the local health dept. they said she is fine. she is now having tingling in her left arm, dizziness upon standing, blurred vision, stiffness in neck and shoulders, and frequent headaches. this is almost daily. She is NOT overweight at all. The past 3 times I have taken her to the store and checked her blood pressure on those free machines, it has been low. Should I take her back to the ER ?? Could this be serious?? She was also a premature baby if that makes a difference, she was born at 26 weeks, and weighed 1 pound 7 oz. , but has been healthy since then.\n\n",

    "content": "Much of the possible diagnoses depend on what the abnormality in the original ECG was.  Do you happen to know what they said was wrong?  Unfortunately, ECG's are quite sensitive to lead placement.  If one of the stickers was placed in a slightly wrong position it can skew the results.  Thus, it is important to have an experienced physician read the ECG to be sure that the \"computer diagnosis\" is actually correct.  Heart problems in healthy children are very rare.  Generally, chest pain is from something else.  Her symptoms may, indeed, be from a heart problem that may have been signaled by the ECG findings.  If her heart is normal, there are a few possible other explanations.  Very commonly, adolescents (especially girls) will have some vasomotor instability (basically the blood vessels aren't quite up to speed on keeping the correct blood pressure).  Those with already low blood pressure (even though normal) are more at risk.  Essentially, changes in position such as standing up, or other causes can result in a sudden drop in blood pressure creating the feelings of dizziness, nerve tingling, headaches, etc.  Generally these feelings pass quickly.  In your daughter's case, I think there are still some unanswered questions.  I would not be too quick to label her symptoms due to something such as vasomotor instability until other things have been ruled out.  I would recommend that you have her evaluated by a pediatrician if possible.  If needed, they can refer you to a cardiologist.  At the very least, she should have the ECG repeated to see if it is still abnormal.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I am a 25 yr old female and 6 months ago I fainted and fell and fractured my shoulder. Since then I have been experiencing a few symptoms including stabbing and shooting pains in the middle of my chest, pains in my right arm and leg, pins and needles in my right hand and feet, increased pain when coughing, sneezing and laughing. I have also experienced breathlessness, weakness in my right arm and occasional blurred vision. I am not very fit but eat healthyish, I am a vegetarian and don't eat wheat as it gives me stomach pains and diarrhea. I also have Bi Polar (I was diagnosed 4 years ago and am stable on my meds). I take Depakote and Citalopram, because of the Bi Polar I feel that my family and even my doctor (even though she's really nice) think I over react slightly and always tell me its just stress.   About 3 months ago I had a chest x-ray and either and ekg or ecg I'm not sure which (they wired me up to a machine?) which the hospital told me was inconclusive. They also did blood tests and told me I was slightly anemic. My doctor has also given me an inhaler.   I don't think there are any heart problems on my dads side of the family but my moms dad died when he was 40 from his second stroke and my moms mom has had about 4 strokes and 2 heart attacks. I think my mom had a stroke and she also has high blood pressure. My brother is diabetic and has high blood pressure. I've also been tested for any thyroid problems because my cousins have under-active thyroids.  I want to go back to the doctor but feel I'm making a fuss.  Thank you for your help\n\n",

    "content": "Helo Icklegem - You have two or three potential issues going on: you fainted, which in  itself warrants a thorough workup to rule out certain system problems (although many people faint once or more than once in their lifetimes without an apparent trigger and are still fine), and  you also injured yourself as a result  of the faint. Both or either could be responsible  for your current symptoms, and there is also a potential for medication  to be playing a role in some of the things you've been feeling. Plus you have the celiac problem which not only means you must avoid wheat in your diet but also is suspected in some forms of psychological illness. All these things should be weighed by a doctor who can \"quarterback\" any consults with cardiology or neurology specialists. There's just too much to sort out at a distance, but I most definitely would feel justified in requesting a thorough evaluation of the symptoms with full consideration  of all the factors you've mentioned here.   Hope this is helpful.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Lizzie - Use and withdrawal of antidepressants (and some other medications) can cause non-specific EKG changes. Your daughter had two such changes noted. T-wave abnormalities are common enough in the general population, and moreso in adjustment or change of antidepressants. Usually, in the absence of symptoms  which can be tied to the EKG changes or abnormalities, these changes mean nothing. It  would seem to be the case with your daughter, although it would be  helpful to know what symptoms brought  her to the doctor to start with.  As for \"moderate right axis deviation\", here again if something is not according to  the textbook definition of normal, it must be noted, even if it means nothing, which it likely does in this case. The axis is difficult to describe without pictures, but is reflected in the shape and  position of the complexes  in the EKG. The axis is noted in order to determine  a few potential problems, and if those problems are not present then it  really means little to nothing. The axis can also help determine the literal position  of the heart (which can sometimes be rotated \"abnormally\", which means - that's right - nothing). Regardless of whether  the  axis deviation is significant or not, it must be noted along with everything else that doesn't match up with the picture in the  textbook, as it could help rule future possible problems either  in or out. It may just be what is normal for your daughter. That's the most important thing, that there is a record of the baseline (normal) EKG for a given individual,  since many of us have normally \"abnormal\"  EKGs.   When there are certain symptoms which can be correlated with abnormal findings, then they can be assessed in that context. When those are not  present, then you just have a nice record of how things looked on a given day.   Sounds like a normally abnormal EKG, at least at the  time it was done (since there was  the matter of Paxil withdrawal going on at the time and so it could change again later when that is over).  Basically, it sounds fine.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "title": "My wife needs a diagnosis - heart issue?",
    "content": "My wife, caucasian, 27, was admitted to the hospital in March 2003 after fainting while sitting with me on the couch (watching TV).  She had many tests:  EP study, EKG, chest MRI, Stress Echo.  Everything \"normal\". She failed the tilt-table.  Diagnosis:  Neuro cardiogenic syncope.  Treatment:  Celexa, 20mg daily.  NO pacemaker implanted.  Second hospital visit a few weeks later.  Celexa increased to 30mg daily and added Florinef (spelling?).  These problems have been on-going and getting worse.  Symptoms include:  dizziness, chest pain (\"cramping\"), shortness of breath, tingling in arms and legs, fainting, awareness of heartbeat, fluctuating pulse.  Symptoms occur sporadically and last for varying amounts of time 20 minutes to several hours.    Recently her left arm has been going numb during these episodes and that numbness lasts several hours at least.  This led to a third hospital visit.  They ran CT Scan and head MRI - both \"normal\".    This does not seem to be stress related.  It also happens while sitting, standing or lying down.  Every Dr thus far says all of this is normal.  I cannot see how fainting and arm numbness are \"normal\".  Is this a heart issue?  Is this neurological?  What other information can I provide?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear PrayingForAnswers - This is one of those really frustrating scenarios where nothing seems to make sense. First of all, let me address the issue of \"normal.\" What your wife is experiencing is not normal. The medical test findings are all normal, which is frustrating for everyone, especially since the symptoms are so disturbing to witness, let alone experience first hand. Nothing \"normal\" about them. The findings are all normal, which doesn't help much.  However, your wife has been put on both Celexa (an antidepressant) and Florinef (a treatment for Addison's disease), so apparently someone has some theory about what is going on, whether it is correct or not.   Celexa is one of the SSRI family of antidepressants, and so is often also tried in the treatment of generalized anxiety. This is not an unreasonable guess, but doesn't seem to have hit the target.   Forinef being mainly a treatment for Addison's disease (a condition in which the adrenal glands don't produce enough adrenaline) might make some sense if there were an explanation to go along with it. If your wife has been diagnosed with Addison's, some of the symptoms might fit the picture. She would have to have had lab results showing abnormally low levels of adrenaliine in her blood or urine to even suspect this.  Assuming (since the symptoms continue) that these medications aren't htting the target and therefore something else is causing the problem, is is entirely possible that your wife is experiencing a malfunction of the autonomic nervous system (which is exactly what \"neurocardiogenic syncope\" suggests). Often it is a failure of the autonomic nervous system to behave appropriately, resulting in all sorts of disturbing, disruptive symptoms. The common name for this is dysautonomia. It is often treated, when recognized, with beta blocking drugs, although when blood pressure is low this is contraindicated at first. Other approaches include the SSRIs like Celexa, benzodiazapine drugs (especially clonazepam), and a graduated exercise program. While this last may seem strange, it often winds up being the most effective therapy.   A neurological consult may wind up being considered, as a lot of doctors see this syndrome as an emotion-based one. While it certainly can involve the emotions (and stress is usually a precipitating factor),  it is physical in nature, if not origin.  The good news is that this is probably a benign problem. The bad news is that it will probably take some trial-and-error to find what works to best control it and get things back to normal.  I hope I've been of some hellp. Please keep us informed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello studdlyduddly - Your confusion is understandable. You are perceiving a sensation of one side of your body not working in concert with the other side, yet there are no medical findings. This is actually a well-known neurological finding and often results in a deferred diagnoisis, as the symptoms can persist even though nothing appears to be wrong. This would probably have been better served through a discussion in the neurological topic, but here we are. I would only say, here, that you appear to be in fairly good company, and wonder if you have had a complete neurological workup (the patient often is unaware that this has been done because of the concern on the part of the physician that an anxious or hypochondriacal patient may be overly suggestible and may read more into the information than is actually there). A referral to a psychotherapist may also be warranted, at least if your own self-diagnosis of hypochondria is correct.   The appended question about palpitations would seem easier to answer, as what you have described sounds precisely like heart palpitations. While these are extremely common and rarely medically important, they are, according to one study of unilateral (one-sided) body weakness with no obvious cause, a feature reported by one-third of the participants in the study. This is hardly surprising, as persistent and vague symptoms are often the cause of great anxiety (people tend to feel much better knowing the cause of a problem, even if the problem has no major affect on their physical well-being).   You've had all the logical and obvious tests, both cardiological and neurological, and been deemed not to have any serious disease. However, your doctor my reserve diagnosis because he or she finds your symptoms to be convincing yet without any known cause. This can be depressing and distressing, but \"doctor shopping\" willl likely not gain you any ground. Since you are able to function physically perhaps the best thing would be to embark on a regular exercise program (even if you don't feel like it due to feeling depressed) and you may be surprised at how much better you feel and how the sensation of weakness can lessen or disappear. You should always start a new exercise program slowly and build itensity slowly, over a period of weeks. You also should consult your doctor about the advisiability of doing this before starting. If your symptoms should worsen during the course of exercising you should of course stop and bring this to the attention of a doctor at once.  Don't sell yourself short by a self-diagnosis of hypochondria - unless of course you get that same diagnosis from a psychotherapist you trust. More likely you have simply become acutely aware of a vague sensation that may not have any medical signifcance. This is known as \"somatisization\" and is very common. The less attention you pay to vague symptoms, the more clear your perception of distinct (and important ones) will become.   It is a difficult thing to diagnose when there are no physical findings, but perhaps someone with more expertise in neurology and psychology could offer some useful suggestions. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Numbness or tingling in your hand and fingers, especially the thumb and index and middle fingers.  Pain in your wrist, palm or forearm.  These are typical symptoms for Carpal tunnel syndrome   It is usually due to increase pressure on the median nerve and tendons in the carpal tunnel and not due to an injury in the nerve itself.   The carpal tunnel is smaller in some people leading to congenital predisposition to the syndrome.   Factors involved in the disorder include :  - Direct trauma or injury to the wrist resulting in swelling swelling,.  - Swellings due to hormonal disturbances like pituitary gland hyperactivity; Hypothyroidism; rheumatoid Arthritis;  - Work stress , repetitive movement can cause tendinitis.  - Fluid retention due to hormonal changes like in pregnancy.  - a cyst or tumor formation in the canal.  - In some cases there is no apparent cause.   Treatments for carpal tunnel syndrome is preferred to start as early as possible. Underlying causes should be treated first.   General measures include:  Rest of the affected hand and wrist for at least 2 weeks and immobilizing the wrist in a splint to avoid further damage from twisting or bending.  - Use of cool to reduce swellings if any is present.  - medications like NSAID  - Finally surgery is recommended to complicated persistent cases for 6 month after conservative measures.  I advise you to seek neurological consultation. Direct clinical examination is essential.  Keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

I am a 33 year old male, single, light- drinker, non-smoker, no known allergies.  I have been having muscle spasms quite a lot in the past couple of weeks.  Normally, I would get a muscle spasm maybe once every 3 to 6 months and then it would go away.  These are very miinor incidents, like a finger slightly flexing without my action, or an eye lid that twitches and is nothing more than an annoyance for a couple of minutes before going away.  But, these incidences are becoming more and more prevalent, particulary, my fingers and biceps muscles twitching.  Again, this is minor.  It doesn't prevent me from doing anything, its just a nuisance to me, but I'm wondering if I should be concerned about it.  Does the increased frequency mean that I'm coming down with something.  MS maybe?    Wondering if I could get a professional to provide me with some insight as to what may be causing my muscle twinges and if I should be concerned about it.  Thank you for taking the time to read my request for assistance.\n\n",

This can be caused by lack of sleep, stress, electrolyte imbalance in the body, too much coffee or tea, too much drinking. Many times a caused is not is not identified.  If this continues and becomes a nuisance, i suggest that you see your health care provider.  Multiple sclerosis usually does not present in this way.

    "content": "You are correct regarding the QTc interval.  A QTc interval of less than 440 is considered normal.    Regarding the ECG findings, did the statement \"ST abnormalities - effects of digitalis - abnormal ECG\" come from the ECG machine's interpretation of the ECG?  ECG machine interpretations can be misleading in that the machine is not able to identify possible causes of errors in the production of the ECG.  For example, if a lead was placed in the slightly wrong place it can produce flattened T-waves as you describe.  The machine has no way of knowing this has occurred and interprets it as if the findings are from the heart.  If this is the case, I would suggest you talk with your doctor regarding the results of your ECG.  He/she will be able to give you the best interpretation of the findings.\n\n",

    "content": "Absolutely I would recommend that you pursue the work up for long QT syndrome.  If you can visit a cardiologist, that would be the best place to be evaluated.  Otherwise a physician who can do EKG's and can read them is what you need.  One piece of advice, have the doctor calculate the QTc interval himself rather than trusting the EKG machine's calculations.  A QTc of greater than 440 is considered prolonged.  Also, the patient's older brother should be evaluated as well.  It would be rare for asthma to cause fainting-generally they have to stop exercising due to cough, but don't faint.  Fainting during exercise is a very serious matter until it is proven not to be.  This can be caused by long QT or several other conditions.  I highly recommend a medical evaluation of both boys.  Also, if Long QT syndrome is diagnosed, the rest of your family should probably be screened also as it is an inherited disorder.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

But in the last week, I am having problems catching my breath and even kind of panting or mouth breathing in the heat. No pain, just can't seem to catch my breath or let it out right. When I remember I measure the bp and pulse and peak flow. The bp is normal, pulse is 141 or around there and the peak flow is still in the green but down from normal. The pulse is taking longer to go down than usual. My question: is this just normal for someone with my history or should I mention it to the doctor soon? Also, is it heart or asthma or both? I sometimes have problems telling them apart. This is messing with my exercise program since I get sick in the car it is so hot and so am currently avoiding the gym till it cools off some.  When I get home I jump in a cool shower and am very exhausted for a couple of hours then slowly recover and something will happen and I have to go outside and the whole thing starts over.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi  I am a 25 yo female, weight 116 lbs.  I recently started exercising on a stationary bike (i was just on level 2) and noted that the machine was suggesting my heart rate to be in the 170-180s.  i was not feeling anything though, just was a bit alarmed on seeing the heart rate.  My resting heart rates are normal whenever i have been to a doctor for wellness checks.  Yesterday while shoveling snow, i felt suddenly \"out of breath and a bit dizzy and sweated all over\" on sitting for two minutes, everything was back to normal.   This has happened to me previously also, once while i was trekking and once when i was cycling (Both days were hot) This happens i think at times when i have stressed myself too hard on a hot day.   If i drink a little water or juice and sit down for some time, (2-3 min), everything is back to normal.  I wanted to have an idea why am I having such short and sudden onset of \"sweating profusely, dizziness and out of breath feeling\"   Is it due to lack of exercise, am i getting hypoglycemic (i feel better at those times on taking something to drink) or can there be another cause to it.  my bp is normal.  \"\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Akansha, If your symptoms were related to a Hypogycemic episode it would most likely take more than a few minutes to resolve and would only improve with intake of, for example juice or food intake. Since the symptoms, elevated heart rate, dizziness, shortness of breath, etc., appeared after vigorous activity, and improved over a short period of time with hydration would be more indicative of an overexertional or heat related illness, ie., heat exhaustion, etc. I would certainly suggest that you bring this to the attention of your physician that you are experiencing such symptoms so that any other causative factor can be determined.

    "content": "QUESTION: I frequently have blood (mixed in mucus) coming from my nose (for several months), non-stop feeling of pain/pressure and/or like something is stuck up in there and it's always bothering me and take uncontrollable forceful inhalations through my nose. I have not discussed seeing this blood with my doctor. But I have these problems even when I do not have a sinus infection. And I feel like something is more wrong in my nasal passages. Can chronic sinusitis actually cause such nose irritation and this bleeding and inhalations? I have a sleep breathing disorder but if the inhalations were being caused by that, then why would I do it while awake? Also, are there any other treatment options for sinusitis other than long-term use of nasal spray as it seems to just be making things worse. (Thanks!)  SYMPTOMS: blood mixed in the mucus from throat and nose, facial pain,  pressure, numbness, congestion, post nasal drip, headaches, sore throat, middle ear infections, coughing hard and spitting up mucus only when waking up from sleep, forceful inhalations through the nose (when awake and asleep).  ENT diagnosis: TMJ (diagnosis based on pain issues - they did not review any of my medical records)  MD diagnosis: chronic sinusitis  TESTS done: sleep study  DIAGNOSIS - UARS with decreased breathing TREATMENT: antibiotics as needed, flonase (till death do us part) and waiting for Cpap therapy.\n\n",

Can you really exclude sinusitis from only one physical exam? The doctor that sent me to him said that he was positive that's what was wrong. This doctor did not even bother getting my medical records to see what I was saying was true and in the same breath didn't believe a word I said. I know that because he didn't do anything to try and help. The only thing I can figure out is it's because I take antidepressants and he was just being a total A-hole because of it. Some doctors (god only knows why) automatically assume if your depressed, then it's all in your head. I've been told by another doctor that chronic sinusitis is just something you have to live with. I have not ever heard of saline nasal irrigations. What exactly is it? ps thanks for the information..\n\n",

    "content": "Hi angelforever34, Much of the population have a deviated septum but when it is a very mild deviation, there may not be any symptoms at all. Deviations may be caused by injury to the area, congenital defects, etc. A severe deviation may cause a feeling of a blocked nostril, make one more prone to nosebleeds, and may cause inflammation in the sinuses (sinusitis) because drainage does not occur properly. Deviations may also causes breathing problems including playing a role in obstructive sleep apnea. Nasal irrigations are typically done twice a day by using salt water and irrigating the sinuses with a bulb syringe. This actually clears sinus congestion and promotes healing of inflammed tissues. I would suggest inquiring with your physician about some diagnostic studies, the possibility a deviation contributing to your symptoms and the advantages of nasal irrigations in alleviating some of your symptoms. I hope this has been somewhat helpful. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "Hello. I'm desperate to find out what I can do for my grandmother.She had heart valve replacement surgery this past December. The hospital was absolutely incompetent, her wound became infected, pacemaker was defaulty and had to be replaced twice, the doctors just didn't seem to care(my mother and I had to literally beg doctors to pay attention to her). Anyway, now that she is home, she is increasingly worrying all of us. She calls us hysterical because she says that somebody is coming into her house and moving papers/taking jewelry/stealing from her. My grandfather says her new favorite phrase is \"I don't know\". She has lost a lot of weight since she had surgery (she wouldn't eat at home, at my home, or at the hospital facility she went to post op) Pre surgery, she was as alert and aware as I am, always cooking. My completely independant grandmother has become needy and scared. She never had any of these symptoms, or indications. I know that heart surgery can be a rough recovery, but she won't even go to church now, something she used to enjoy doing and made a habit of going at least twice a week. She's slowing down, she's aged about 20 years since this sugery.   She is 74 with diabetes, fiber myalga, heart murmer.. I know she is taking medicine for her thyroid. I can't be exactly sure what else she is taking.  The worst part of all of this is the fact that I know that she is terrified of being in her own home and there is nothing we can do. Please tell me, could the surgery have caused this? Can this be reveresed? What can we do to get her back or to help her feel safe? What should we do to help her? I'm willing to try anything I can in my power to help her.  Thank you in advance, please help me help her.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Casey26, The surgery that your grandmother had is not a minor one indeed. Multiple factors play a part in recovery during a post op phase. Sometimes, especially in older generations, anesthesia, post op infections, oxygen deprivation, may have different effects and present a more delayed recovery than in the younger population. Keep in mind that prolonged episodes of illness may also trigger the onset of dementia.  My questions for you are, has her oxygen levels been checked, labwork to identify electrolyte imbalances, etc. been done to attempt to identify the cause of changes in her behavior?  Alterations in either of these will cause a paranoia type behavior. For example, electrolytes such as sodium deficiencies trigger confusion, paranoia etc. Insufficient oxygen levels trigger the same.  I would strongly urge a physical evaluation to identify if an underlying disorder is present. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "Hi dixiemom8203, You are correct in stating that situs inversus (totalis) is rare, and occurs in approximately 1 person out of 10,000. The incidence of congenital heart disease is 95% (almost always) in situs inversus with levocardia, which is even more rare, (where the apex of the heart points to the left side of the thorax). A much lower suspected percentage (approximately 5%) of congenital heart disease is identified in those that have the apex of the heart on the right side of the thorax (situs inversus totalis). There are also lung disorders which may be associated with this condition which presents with repeated respiratory infections because the cilia in the lungs have abnormal movement and when infections arise are treated accordingly. Of course a thorough physical exam including a cardiology evaluation would be advisable. Always inform those that are providing your healthcare that you are more unique and have this condition so proper assessment of any health conditions can be treated appropriately. I am actually surprised that this wasn't discovered in your childhood years. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you so much for your reply, I greatly appreciate it.   I was wondering, since you brought up the lung issue; when I was in middle school and part of high school, I used to get out of breath fast and almost to wheezing point that I got light headed and had to sit down otherwise I felt as though I would pass out. Ok...both my parents have asthma, but somehow I never had it or at least it was never ruled out, and I was wondering if I could have at some point had a little asthma but because I wasn't ever treated for it and just kinda toughed it out when it happened that it went away on its own as I got older?   I was also wondering about the sharp pain in my chest that sometimes happens (even if I'm not doing anything that gets my heart racing) and often takes my breath away. Sometimes the pain radiates from the front of my chest through my back...  Once again thank you for your response.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi dixiemom8203, Your symptoms when you were younger could have been Asthma related in which some children do seem to sometimes out grow or symptoms are less apparent, but if you suffered from frequent respiratory infections I would be more inclined to consider it as a result of the Situs Inversus because the cilia in the lungs do not function normally. One of the functions of cilia and mucous membranes are to essentially trap particles and and get rid of them, which again doesn't function the same as in those without this condition because the cilia or hairlike structures are less mobile. As for the chest pain and heart racing, precisely why it would be advisable for you to have an evaluation by a cardiologist to identify if a cardiac disorder is present (just to assure that you are not in that approximate 5% group) especially considering the fact that your condition was not discovered until adulthood. I again advise a Cardiologist's evaluation. I hope you will consider posting an update when your time permits. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "title": "HELP: Unexplained shortness of breath",
    "content": "Hi. Almost a year ago I had an episode of Anxiety, Shortness of breath and dizziness. Went to the ER and after examination and several EKGs been diagnosed with pretty much nothing (neuro-vegetative disturbances) and prescribed to take calcium and magnesium supplements. Checked with my doc and he ran blood tests which came back normal, except for a mild Anemia (low Iron, magnesium and ionic calcium levels, not too low but near-minimum). Doc prescribed iron supplements. Gradually the sensation of not getting enough air pretty much dissapeared. During the summer I experienced a mild sinus Tachycardia (rate about 90-100) treated with Propranolol. Now my pulse is around 70 and I do not take any more pills for it - it sometimes rises especially after exercise, and doc told me I am not in the best physical condition (raises to about 90-95 for a few minutes after stopping). However, I still get a permanent feeling of Shortness of breath, not like my lung doesn't fill normally with air, more like needing a good deep yawning or like my breathing muscles are too tense and can't let me take a really deep satisfying breath - all is well until trying to inhale the last \"bit\" of air, when I get this sensation. Also my chest hurts, sometimes in the left area, sometimes in the right, almost always near the sternum. The chest hurts when pressed with my finger. Ribs are painful too. When I contract my chest muscles the pain increases slightly. The pain is not intense and goes away for a few days, comes back for a few days in some other area in my chest. Sometimes my ankles hurt a bit and my right hand, the small bones right near my fist. Fingers at my right hand are painful at times. These pains go away quickly when applying Ibuprofen or the like(spelled it right I hope) to the area. However they are back after some hours. I have done blood tests 3 times in the last year, went to 3 different cardiologists, had Echo of the heart, Echo of the abdomen, neurological exam, Spirometry, stress Echo,etc. etc, everything is OK. I went to the cardiologist when I was at peak with my symptoms and nothing was found I am currently taking mineral supplements and following psychological counselling since I have developed a strong fear that something is deeply wrong with me. When in session and days after I feel ok, no more symptoms. My symptoms are generally not very intense, I feel like my fear is amplifying them somehow. I am a 25 year old male, no heart disease or other medical condition, good health, good family health, not overweight, smoker (under 1 pack a day), not in best fitness (sitting job - programmer). My questions are: 1. If sometimes were wrong with my heart, would it have been diagnosed yet? 2. Need I do more investigations regarding my heart? 3. Does all this look more like a psychological condition than a physical one?  4. In a few words: how should I change my lifestyle in order to keep my heart healthy? Thank you for reading this message.

When I got to the hospital they thought it may have been my appendix but it wasn't (as I have situs inversus and my appendix isn't even on that side! lol) they never did find out what it was but I was under alot of stress and things at home and work and with a child, so I did research on my own. What I experienced was an Anxiety attack...I've only had them twice now but since I got rid of my stressful issues I've been fine. Are you under alot of stress? Do you get nauseous along with your other symptoms? If you do it may just be stress related....if not then I'm not really sure what else to say since I'm not a doctor I just answer questions based on my past experiences in some hope that I could help. I hope you get feeling better soon. I would also get a second opinion. Bye now.\n\n",

I asked my gyno about it considering they didn't find a cyst in the exam but she said it was possible that it was a cyst and it burst (which they want it to do...so don't freak out if this happens to you...) but it just wasn't big enough to see on the ultrasound. They happen and it is normal and more often than so they aren't worried about them bc they are so normal in women (mostly during our menstrual cycle). They come and go but most we don't know are even there.   I hope this helps and good luck to you!!!\n\n",

    "content": "I have a problem and I need some advice about what it may be such as any type of respiratory or nasal conditions that may cause this as I am having extreme fatigue and it's not just an physical impairment to me now, I couldv'e died weeks ago from being unable to keep my eyes open while driving, the front of my car got completely smashed in. The problem is I'm having frequent awakenings in my sleep from sucking in air through my nose and having to rub the side of my nose. I had a sleep study and could not reach most of the stages of sleep due to the pain from the car wreck but they decide to diagnose this anyways as psychopysiological insomnia. I do have frequent awakenings as with this sleep disorder as it showed 18.5 an hour but I do not have this disorder. I was misdiagnosed. Most of the time I go to sleep within minutes after laying down, not even needing my sleeping pills anymore. The problem isn't that I can't sleep, it's that I'm sleeping WAY TOO MUCH but I never feel like I've had any sleep. This is not that type of insomnia. I have what seems to be mild central apnea events during deep sleep but unfortunetly failed to reach that stage during my sleep test. The breathing problem through my nose is during any sleep stage but I absolutely do not quit moving in my sleep unless I'm in a deep sleep. I have it on video and I know what's going on. I am not worried about that though as this nasal problem is obviously the bigger issue here, it disturbs my sleep continuously and I almost know it's what's causing the fatigue to be so bad.   I just don't know what to do. I went to an ENT doctor and he completely ignored the problem. I can't see myself being treated for this insomnia when it's not the problem. The problem is these breaths through my nose. Any idea whatsoever what would cause you to frequently suck air in forcefully through your nose?\n\n",

Central, essentially neurological, in which the brain fails to send appropriate signals to muscles to breathe. Mixed (which is a combination of both). Sleep apnea typically causes fatigue, headache, daytime sleepiness, etc. A pronounced characteristic of obstructive sleep apnea snoring. Again, I would suggest a repeat evaluation.

PVC's happen most of the time when I have this aching and well as shortness of breath every once in while.  When this is happening, the aching in my left arm is made worse for a few seconds by taking a deep breath.  This occurs within an hour or 2 of eating and can last anywhere from a couple hours to all day.  I don't have any burning in my throat from heartburn and had normal EKG 6 months ago.  I went to the doctor 3 weeks ago with the above symptoms plus central chest tightness and more frequent shortness of breath.  I had a chest x-ray which was normal and was put on Inflammide for asthma.  Since I started using the inhaler my central chest tightness is pretty much gone so it looks like I'm dealing with 2 seperate issues.  Can anyone give me some ideas before I return to the doctor.  I am a 28 year old male and don't smoke. I also excercise frequently and eat healthy.  Thanks in advance.\n\n",

I have had the pain in the side, in the arm, and gone to many doctors. they all said everything was normal. your dizziness may be in your head.   reading about your symptoms can be worse than not.  I have been all through this and still have a hard time dealing with it.  i think many times it has to do with how much and what you eat. also how much sleep you get and how excitable you are.  hope this helps.  in the mean time if you have any positive results with something other than medication let's hear it!\n\n",

I have no history of heart disease or heart related problems in my family.  For the past month or so I have had a recurring dull pain on the left side of my chest, right under my nipple and slightly to the left.  On occasion the pain gets really bad and turns into a sharp, stabbing pain that can last anywhere from 1 minute to all day long.  In the beginning the pain would go away, but the more recent episodes have been lasting hours at least.  The episode that I am currently experiencing started this morning when I layed down after a 1 hour bike ride.  The paid increases when I take deep breaths, bend at the waist, lie down, and immedietely after I eat.  I thought that it might be heart burn, however I have taken Tums and Rolaids and nothing is working.  Also, I don't have a burning sensation in my throat.  The pain is generally secluded in my chest, althouh I have had back pain since I started university 2 years ago.    Is this something that I should see a doctor about???\n\n",

In addition, I sometimes had kidney pain and dizziness that last a few seconds.  Rarely, but a few time tingling or numbing of the hand or feet.  Forcing a cough seems to give me a few seconds of relief.  I have been to my primary doctor, a heart specilist, and all tests came out normal.  I went to the emergency room, and the X-ray show nothing, and the diagnosis was some kind of acid reflux.  Idon't think so.  No help what-so-ever.  Most recently (in the past 4 weeks), I have have been having the chest tightness/pain all day even BEFORE eating, and an additional symptom, mild headaches. The chest pain does not seem to increase with exercise.  I do not smoke, I do not drink, and I am 45 years old male.  I am afraid that something is really wrong, and would like to find a diagnosis this whatever this is, ASAP.  Thanks in advance.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 41 year old overweight female. I have had female problems in the past but no big deal. I have recently been to the urologist and had a staff infection and my bladder had fell slightly but infection is gone and going for a check up this month. I have had 1 stereotactic biopsy and about 4 needle biopsies but all were good reports. My family has a history of cancer. My father had two bouts with bladder cancer and my maternal gradma died from lukemia(sp?) problems @ the age of 80. My mother went throught menopause in her 40's.   I have been under a lot of stress for about 3 years due to family and finacial problems. Have a wonderful marriage we just have had bad luck for the last few years. I am a full time secretary and I commute 1 hour to and from my job. I get home and go to my waitress job which is part time. I am very active in my church and spend the rest of my time there or with my family.   I have been tired a lot and can't sleep and when I do it is restless. I have been experiencing blurred vision and I am near sighted but can't even see up close now. I have to hold all my books out just to read them. I have been also having problems walking once in a while. I will be walking and get off centered. I also have times when my arm will ache bad and then it will go away. I also say the wrong words when I speak which is getting embarassing. I will mean to say \"go take the trash out and come back and do your laundry\" and I will actually say something like :Take out your clothes and go wash your bed.\" My family laughs at me but I have noticed it gets worse and when I have to lead my church congregation in singing I constantly double check and still look at a word and say something else. My family MD is getting close to retirement and has cut down on his workload and do you think that all of this is just due to my being overweight.  I take pills for my acid reflux\n\n",

    "content": "Hi pennygaile, I would strongly suggest an evaluation by your physician. Generally speaking, TIA's (transient ischemic attack) sometimes referred to as \"ministrokes\" may cause symptoms of visual disturbances, confusion or difficulty with speech, dizziness or loss of balance and coordination, severe headache, numbness or weakness of the arm and or leg typically on one side of the body. TIA symptoms may disappear in a matter of minutes or be longer lasting but leave no residual side effects as does a CVA (stroke). Experiencing any of the above symptoms warrants an investigation. Regardless of the causative factor of your symptoms I would again, strongly suggest, an evaluation. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

My father has had one mild heartattack and there is a history of heart disease in his family. I usually run 5 miles three times a week. In the past couple weeks, I've been experiencing stabbing heart pains while running, usually after my first or second mile. While experiencing the heart pains, I can only take shallow breathes and sometimes my left shoulder feels tingly. When I stop running, it takes the pains a couple minutes to subside. I usually cannot resume running  without experiencing the pains for hours.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear katmil8  Since you do have a family history of heart disease, and since you have mentioned that your asthma has been under control for years, my suggesstion is that you visit your doctor, and he/she might refer you to a cardiologist. This is important since you have mentioned that the pain feels like stabbing, and stops you from continuing the running.  Your doctor or the specialist might order an EKG, or an echo depending on your symptoms. Both proceedures are very simple.  Thank you very much and i wish you all the best.\n\n",

This is very important in your case since you already have some risk factors for hypertension, diabetes, etc ( family history) that might predispose you to any of them  However, if you feel that your chest pain is getting worse, and stopping you from doing the normal activities you usually do, i will definitely recommend that you ask your doctor and get it checked.

    "content": "About 5 months ago i began having chest pain, it was a sharp pain when i took a deep breathe that would last a mintue or so. It would come on random times of the day maybe about 3-7 times per day. Then i started feeling numbest in my chest area and arm and evenually started having pains in my shoulder,arm and back. Sometimes I would have a dull ache pain all day and one other time i bent over to pick something up and it felt like someone was grabing my chest for about 2 hours after. Other times I felt like was gonna die I was so scared. Then It got better for about 3 weeks  but as of the last 2 weeks I started to become lightheaded all day for about 2 weeks where now its starting to ease out. But now its my back acting up in pain and sometimes I get chest ache and pain when I take deep breathes. I don't smoke not overweight exercise alot and theres no history of any heart problems in my family and only one minor heart attack by a family member at age 59 which he survived and is still alive today. I went to the er serveal times. I don't know it can be beacuse I took a hard knee into my upper back around the time it happened or not to long before and I used to lift weights until it started paining at least I think it was around the time. I have had 2 ekg`s, on the first one they said I mite have a right block or something but said don't worry about, because the 2nd one showed nothing. I have had a chest X-ray which came out normal. A echocardiogram which came out normal and a exercise stress test on a tredmill which I was able to finish without any chest pain and it also came out normal. My question is could they have missed something with my heart after seeing different doctors and all these days. The pain is getting less and less bothering but still there at times, My mom told me it can be aniexty developed from being scared because I have took panic attacks, and I took alot of ibuprofen so could that cause lightheadness as a side effect but my questions is Im really big into hockey and soccer playing for my school and I stopped playing soccer this summer because I was scared something could happen and now that hockey starts soon im asking could they have missed sometihng on all those tests and so on they told me it sounded more muscluar so am I good to play intense sports again and not worry about anything happening? any answers would be greatly appreicated.\n\n",

This has never happened before and I don't know what could be wrong with me.. if you could PLEASE help me that would be great.

    "content": "Wow, it's good to know I'm not the only one with these symptoms. I have exactly what one of the posters on this forum described in terms of skipped beats, and we're even similar in terms of what led to it: same lifestyle, same causes (stress, lack of sleep), all of it.   I've been to a cardiologist and gotten an EKG, echocardiogram, and stress test performed; all of them came back normal. I've found a direct correlation between how much stress/little sleep I get and what happens I'm scared to death; just tonight (this morning?), after having stayed up too late I felt as if I were zoning out and was brought back to a very sharp, clear frame of mind by the feeling of a skipped beat. There was no clenching feeling, though there was a very slight, low-grade pain in my chest that seemed to build up slowly right before the skipped beat. It's a horrible feeling; my heart simply *stopped,* and if I hadn't gasped and jumped I have an awful feeling it wouldn't have started again. I felt somewhat oxygen-deprived before and could not make a full yawn. Realizing that tiredness is the probable cause, I immediately went to bed. I cannot lie on my front or my back without this happening right now, and as I started to doze off I felt as if I were slipping out of consciousness and then felt the delayed or skipped beat again. As of now I'm sitting in my RA's room typing this up on his PC because I don't want to be alone or in the dark feeling like this. I've noticed that being tense and tired seems to make this happen more often, and that I have a slight pain in my back at the exact same level as what feels like my heart. Additionally, I have had times where there *was* the kind of clenching sensation the original poster described.  I keep seeing people say that this is harmless, that if all my tests are green then I should just try to ignore it, but I *can't.* This is driving me absolutely up the wall and I cannot sleep for fear of having another attack...and the lack of sleep will only serve to make it more likely that I will have another. I can't take any more of this...please help me. Professional reassurance that this is not deadly (if indeed it is not) would go a long way toward alleviating my fear; if I know that the single skipped beats are annoying but not dangerous I will be much more at ease. If I can be truthfully assured that my heart will not stop, or need me to \"jump start\" it when a beat skips/is delayed, I will feel much safer and less stressed. Please reply soon...I don't know how much more of this I can take. I'm constantly feeling my wrist for a pulse and am hyper-aware of my heartbeat almost all the time.\n\n",

    "content": "Hey Cryogen,  Did you say that you have the same \"skipped beats\" I feel? I'm willing to help you understand this as far as I can too because yes it is a worry, but I think if yours is also related to stress as mine is (as far as I believe), we can solve this pretty quick.  Since posting here I've gone from having mild to noticable \"skipped beats\" as I described previously, to having bearly any. I know for a fact that my lifestyle was probably the main cause and I know for a fact if you are able to calm yourself to a minimum you will be absolutely fine! Everyone experiences anxiety, I know that:p I used to scare myself silly when I was younger whenever I was left alone but that wasnt prolonged emotional stress as I have experienced in the last couple of years.  As I know myself, ANY thing is of great help. I've been in your shoes and I'm still trying to work myself out of them. The best thing I could say to you would be to look at what stresses you out. Being around people is one of the most important things to reducing stress in my view.  Do you ever notice that your mind is distracted around people and you don't notice it as much, whereas being idle causes you to dwell on it more and thus have bigger onsets?  Age and life experience is also of great help. I'm 19 now, and feel independent in my life and hold my own responsiblities. I am unsure of your age so its hard for me to say, but if you are young, which (no offence intended) you sound it from what I have read you need great social attachment.  This can be bad though as I have found because you can do the complete opposite in excitable situations and trust me, it will cause the same \"skipped beats\" you feel!  Listening to the physicians advice will help a lot here and I'll keep posting to help you out on this, anything you want to ask just fire away because I still need to build in my own mind connections to its outlining cause.  Theres so many things I could say in one post but I cant put them in any sort of order without really thinking about it.  All I can say to you is find some other focus, blame your \"skipped beats\" on a certain type of food if you wish, something you really dislike. Just try to distract yourself, and avoid, as the physician says, any type of stress and see what happens. Get more sleep too!  Saying that when you laid down caused those skipped beats, SAME here! If I laid on my back or front it only induced them worse and worse. If I took a sudden deep breathe even, that could cause it! If I JUMPED ON THE SPOT!, caused it. One reason is because (in my view) you are so tense and stressed. I've taken out the stress and bang, i can lay down fine now without feeling it.  This may seem a bit jumbled as I don't have much time, but I'll keep checking this everyday, I'm around to help you out too:p.  RichardC\n\n",

    "content": "Oh, it makes perfect sense...I'm so glad I'm not the only one with this problem. Like you said, yes, relaxing makes it easier and less likely to happen. I slept a good 8 or 9 hours (missed class but oh well) and woke up feeling much better. It' definitely caused by stress and lack of sleep.  I'm also intrigued that you made the connection between social life (or lack thereof) and this problem...because I came to the exact same conclusion before. I was taking too much on myself and had practically zero social life, and humas weren't meant to be alone like that. So I joined my uni's Facebook, made like 6 friends in 2 days, and have been feeling much better. So much, in fact, that I decided to force myself to go to all my classes yesterday despite not having much sleep. And last night/ths morning, as you know, was when this happened again. I can definitely link lack of sleep and stress (even a good thing can be stressful) to the skipped beats. But being around people or otherwise occupied definitely helps take my mind off it, and the fact that I've rarely had attacks in a non-stressful social situation helps me rule out the possibility of a really serious cardiac problem combined with my test results (knock wood...).  It's really bizarre how much our situations mimic one another, too...the only real difference is it was my grandmother who died. We're both 19, at college, very clean-living compared to most...uncanny. I was worried I was having a heart attack when this first happened, and one of the dominant thoughts was \"What the hell?! I don't drink, smoke, do drugs, even take a lot of caffiene or eat hardly any red meat...what did I do to deserve this?\" If you know conclusively whether these are deadly or not, please, please tell me so I can stop worrying so much...it feels like being under a perpetual stay of execution.\n\n",

    "content": "Richard,  My sister has every single symptom that you've described and she explains these episodes as \"I feel as if I'm going to die.\" She started having the skipped beats etc after a long period of extreme stress, much like post traumatic stress disorder.  She has since been diagnosed with panic disorder and her heart has been declared as A-OK. Since she has learned how to manage her disorder through breathing exercises and relaxation techniques she has the episodes less frequently.  They have never subsided completely but she has learned how to manage them.  Before this it was kind of a cycle she was in.  She would get a panic attack out of the blue, become worried and fearful about it which brought on more panic, which made her more fearful and made her feel worse until she was in the emergency room thinking she was going into cardiac arrest.  Now that she knows her heart is healthy and that it is panic disorder she attempts to stay calm, relaxes, and in about 15 minutes she's back to her old self.  From your past experiences I can see that you were under an extreme amount of stress which can build up and then you're on overload, like my sister.  She's much better since heart problems were ruled out and  she realized exactly what's causing her problems.  I wish you luck with yours.\n\n",

    "content": "Firsty, thanks John for your post about your sister. It's very reassuring like Cryogen says to know that there are others out there that experience these same symptoms.  As an update, I can successfully say I have identified the stress in my life and eliminated it. I'm actually still under some stress obviously, but not enough to induce the \"skipped beats\" thus far. I think dealing with stress is the big key, instead of completely avoiding it to the point where you never get anything done! hehe. But I'm not saying don't be sensible in lowering your stress levels.  Cyrogen, you say \"So much, in fact, that I decided to force myself to go to all my classes yesterday despite not having much sleep\" - in your last post. Be careful about pushing yourself too hard as this can, in my view, just induce stress to provoke \"skipped beats\" - But saying that, now I have eliminated my main source of stress, any provoking seems dealable. Mass emotional stress is what caused mine, and even if I forgot about it, it could still loom and induce them which would cause a hell of a lot of confusion as I'd be like \"Well what the hell, I took out the stress why can't I relax?\" In all honesty I hadent eliminated it and I knew it! Just think about what REALLY stresses you out at any given moment and either completely stop doing it or avoid any chance of it reoccuring.  Social attachment is very important as you say Cryogen, just don't over do it at this stage:p I'm not, but as I say above im just learning to deal with it. I still think about my heart and its rhythm a lot, I suppose so much is to be expected I guess? But that doesnt induce them:p.  Keep filling me in on how things are going for you. I'll continue posting here as I say, and yeah, it is weird with our situaton isnt it Cryogen? Same age and stuff?? :p  Thanks again John.  Hope things are going well your end Cryogen.\n\n",

My reports of ECG and ultrasound was 100% normal and my BP is also alway normal...the story of  \"RichardC\" and mine is just same i was also having same kind of problems but thanx to God that my mother and father are alive and they love and pray for me all the time...

I am thankful to \"doctorslounge.com\" and \" RichardC\"+ \" HeatherJ\" who posted here...because of them I also found my answer... Maybe  \" RichardC\" + \" HeatherJ\"  and I should keep in touch with each other and tell about their problems and experiences regarding those strange heart flutters it is very hard to explain it to a doctor... But \" RichardC\" has explained it very well.. I'll like to tell  \" RichardC\" +\"HeatherJ\" and any other who is having same kind of problems to calm down and to live a happy life... May be the cure is in our own hands as \" RichardC\"  has said when he becomes happy the heart fluttering goes away I think the only cure to it is to be happy this is my experience also... Thank u again  \" RichardC\" and keep it up I know that it is not a dangerous  illness one day we'll get out of these things...I am sure because my grand mother was also having these problems but when she died she was 85+ years old and that is enough life to live\n\n",

They referred me to a Cardiologist - I had to wear an \"Event Heart Monitor\" for 30 days , I would record an episode and transmit it to the Department and mailed the heart monitor back after 30 days - Went to see my doctor last night for the results - They basically said its just an \"Irregular heartbeat\"  PVC I believe she said with a flutter - Contractions with flutters. Nothing to worry about. I could go on a very low dose of Tropal ( spelling? ) which is prescribed to people with high blood pressure, but didnt have to if I didnt want to.  I don't have high blood pressure and the Irregular heart beats now come and go..so I am just getting used to it now and dealing with it that way.  She said there is absolutely nothing to worry about at all...Im thankful I went to check it out as it has finally put my mind at ease.  Good luck to everyone.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello everybody.  I have been having a severe problem for just over a year and a half now.  I am 22 years old and i do not smoke, i drink only once every while when i do go into town (few months between) and i certainly do not use drugs.  I must say that until about january in 2004 i was living well and feeling healthy.  I had no anxiety other than not having a job and recieving grief for it (understandably).  Suddenly, however,  things changed one night when i was downstairs on my PC playing a game.  I was sitting there having what seemed to be a normal and enjoyable game when suddenly a feeling of dread came across me.  My face and head went funny and my chest became abnormally light feeling.  I tried to nod this off but soon noticed my heart rate was seriously abnormal and soon i went dizzy-ish in the head and dry in the mouth.  Now i know these are classic anxiety symptoms and i appreciate that some of the affects during that episode were brought on by my mental response to this trouble (the dry mouth etc).   I didn't allow myself to panic and did not seek doctor examination.  I simply allowed this to pass.   Now this was just the first day i noticed something of this sort.  Let me tell you about the problem...  I have always just trusted my body to sort something and never took anything to fix a problem (pain killers etc).  I have been relativley healthy during my life and grew to be physically stronger than most people i knew.  I've always exercised well and ate nice foods as well as appreciating junk foods on occasion.   Now when something like what i explained occured i would just accept it as a one time twitch and get on with my day.   But here's where my problem lies:  I have since this day suffered from a number of new problems.  After about 2 months from that day i visted a doctor.  I had started suffering from chest pains and headaches etc.  I explained to the doctor that i was not panicking considering the symptoms and that i always knew about the effects of stress and anxiety - i notied this to him so that he'd appreciate that i was not just a typical 'wind up' and flying in the GP door for the slightest twinge!  The doctor checked my blood pressure and my heart with a stethoscope.  He concluded that it all seemed fine.  He advised me to take Ibuprofen for the pains and told me not to worry.  So i just put up with these 'irregular heart rythms' and chest pains etc and, admittedly, began taking the odd aspirin (i read they we're good for heart in case of clots) instead of the Ibuprofen advised.   Soon my symptoms worried me beyond resistance.   I began noticing my fitness was declining (despite my exercising) and that i was waking up extremly tired and pale etc.  My pains became very serious - they shot an involuntary panic right through me and caused sweat on palms and painful tingles (like nipping pains).  I was breathless at times without explanation.  I'd puff out when eating cereal etc.  I was dead after short running bursts during football with mates (i used to be alot fitter just a year ago).  My left arm started getting funny 'nervous numbness' (trapped nerve feeling) in tricept and pains in fingers and wrist.  My head got really sore and i got visual disturbances (very bright little white lights would float about outta nowhere - only last about 20 secs mind).   I went to see doctor again and this time he gave me ECG...  Turned out fine (my heart was perfect that day!!! Steady rythm!) and as result he figured i was ok again and pinned anxiety on me and offered a beta blocker drug to control adrenalin etc.  I refused to accept  this because i do not trust diving into treatment which could screw me up when i've barely been physically checked.   I made myself feel better by thinking that if, despite all these troubles,  i haven't collapsed or died that it can't possibly be serious.  But this didn't stop a thing.  I soon got a problem which drove me to going to A&E (accident & emergency).  I began getting a heart rythm problem which was worse than any other i ever had.  It came on upon first going into bed.  When lying straight it would become seriously messed up and my stomach would feel funny and head would go strange when trying to ignore it (the blood itself wasn't being pumped right).     Here's an example of it:    .......O....O..OO..OOOO...............O...O...OOO.....OO  (.'s being small very fast beats and O's being large booming thuding beats).  This would last up until i sat up - which was normally quickly due to getting worried.  The pattern is too dodgy and too different each time.  Some days i have slow heart ( i'll feel tired and weak) and others i have fast pounding (feel anxious - yet this is not reason for hard heart beat with adrenalin) and yet others i get very fast and shallow heart beats (feel faint and light and eyes feel strained).  For me to be told to ignore this is hell!  It cannot be ignored.  A&E checked me with ECG and said same thing.  Nothing wrong!  I should've went when it was happening and not waiting until next day!  So i just got on with it  and made the most of the times when i did feel good.  But not recieving answers, i soon started to became very angry.  I questioned my sanity on it; wondering if it was all in my head.  My mates were making me climb the wall with anger when they'd call me a hypocondraic and that i was being a sap to the 'slightest pains'.  They couldn't appreciate what was happening to me.  This started ruining my life.  I would be playing pool when suddenly i'd go all sick and weak feeling and get pains and become breathless, then due to sitting out the game to this,  my mates would become annoyed with me.  I must fix this!  It's weakening me now.  I used to be alive and well just before this started!  Now i'm physically weaker and mentally weaker too!  I must figure this out!  It's definately getting worse.    Thank you all.     P.S Sorry if i may have left out certain details.  Maybe i'll reply.    Michael\n\n",

I have recently been getting a fluttering feeling under my left ribcage towards my back.  It happens every couple of seconds - it almost feels like a rumbling feeling or a groaning.  It has been there consistently for about 3 days now.  It is not similar to palpitations as I have had these in the past it's a mix of twitching, rumbling or bursting bubbles is the only way to describe it.  Should I be concerned?  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi I am new to this forum but wish someone could help me about this problem I've been having lately.  I am a 21 year old male, college student. Only history of heart disease is stroke in my grandparents. For the past week I've been having more an more discomfort in my chest. First couple of days, I only had it when I woke up or went to bed. Then since Tuesday I've been having it much of the day. Along with that my heart seems to be beating faster than normal, making me break into sweats at times including at night. The discomfort is mainly in the left side and is hard to describe. Generally it feels raw, like some object is crawling around. Sometimes I feel it coming from my heart, going up or down my esophogus and I get a lumpy feeling at the notch of my throat and upper chest, exacerbated by swallowing. The sensation makes me belch somestimes. I don't have any pain except that it hurts when I press on my left armpit. The feelings come and go. Sometimes I also get needle feelings in my fingers.  Worried it could be a heart problem, I saw my doctor Wednesday who did an EKG, chest xray, and listened to my heart. My EKG had a slight ST elevation, but everything else was normal. Went back 2 days later where I did another EKG, same result as before. He told me the ST elevation could mean possible MI, but said it was common in young males and my symptoms due to anxiety. True I have been stressed about school and I was very worried about this, but even after his reassurance and tried to relax, I still feel those constricted feelings in my chest. My doctor says it might be GERD, but I don't have any heartburn and taking a Zantac didn't seem to help. Could my problem be something quite serious? Should I see another doctor or would anxiety really cause all these odd symptoms?\n\n",

    "title": "PSVT and Panic Disorder",
    "content": "Hello. I am a 30 yr old mother of two. During the 2nd pregnancy I started having, what I know know to be panic attacks, during the last trimester. After a series of testing, the cardiologist diagnosed me with PFO, administered Toprol from 2 months, I had a healthy baby, and all symptoms went away. Exactly 1 year later (nearly 10 weeks ago) I started having these attacks again. The symptoms are heart racing, shortness of breath, palpitations, headache, dizziness, nausea, and eventually hyperventallating. My family Dr. diagnosed me with anxiety. I never thought or felt it was anxiety. I first started out taking Lexapro 20 mg / daily and Xanax 1mg / as needed. After 6 weeks, I was still having these horrible attacks and was ordered to change meds to Zoloft 100 mg / daily and Ativan ?mg / as needed. I've had chest x-rays, MRI of the head, visited a Neurologist, wore a 24 hr Holter monitor, worn a 2 week event recorder, had an electrocardiogram, then another with a bubble study, have had an EKG, and have seen 2 different cardiologist. The second cardiologist diagnosed me with PSVT. My resting heart rate would get as high as 184 bpm. I have been taking taking a double dosage channel blocker, Cartia, for over a month and still have the exact same symptoms everyday. I have an attack 2 and 3 times a day. I am now bouting insomnia and having to take sleeping pills everynight. Each Dr. states that the PSVT and the Panic Disorder are not related. I decided to research this myself on the web and found site after site of \"misdiagnosis of Panic Disorder to be PSVT.  (http://www.pslgroup.com/dg/20702.htm and http://www.adenocard.com/no3.html ) This is severly affecting my life at work, home, travel, family, and friends. I know this is not a life threatening illness, but I cannot keep on feeling this way. I see the cariologist again today and will request that he revisit the subject of the two being related. Do you have knowledge of the relationship of PSVT and Panic Disorder? Could this be something more serious? Sincerely, PSVT\n\n",

    "title": "Symptoms worsening at increasing rate",
    "content": "It is ironic but to read that some many people have similar problems kind of makes me feel better. But I am sure you would all agree you would not wish this on anyone. I understand the rules of this site are to not make multiple entries but in the week or so since I originally posted my responses under \u201ccardiology\u201d I have had some significant and dramatic changes to my condition. Like many, my doctor suggests I have some sort of panic, or anxiety disorder. I feel this is a great \u201cfall back\u201d when nothing else can be explained even though I have been diagnosed with Wenckebach Heart Block (5:4) and an echo showed LVH of 13mm. I am 31 yo male, non smoker, minimal drinker, do not intake caffeine. There is no doubt in my mind panic/ anxiety is part of the problem as I have had 2-3 \u201cepisodes\u201d where I thought I was having a heart attack or similar and have been taken to hospital in an ambulance. Now I feel dizzy every waking moment. This varies from feeling like I am suddenly jolted forwards or back to feeling like I am on the deck of a ship, sometimes this is worse when I move. An MRI of my neck showed nothing out of place. I also feel \u201cnerve\u201d type pain on and around my sternum and around my lower ribs, often quite badly and this can be a constant ache to a sudden sharp stabbing pain. Like Cryogen I often feel sharp pain around the same level of my heart but to the left and right of my spine. I constantly feel palpitations. I cannot remember not feeling them recently. In most cases I can strongly feel my pulse in my throat (the soft area between your collar bones) and minutes later I will barely feel it at all. Sometimes the heavy beats will last for 3-6 hours. At times I can barely feel a pulse in my wrist also. Then, even without any activity I will feel it strong enough that without touching my throat or wrist I can take my pulse by just looking at a clock. Further to this in a 15-30 second interval I may feel my heart beat regularly, then 3-6 beats will be very very fast, then it will slow again. At one stage I was on an ECG and the bpm displayed was jumping from the mid 80s to over 110 and then would jump back down to the 70s and back to the 90s over a 10-20 second period. The ECG was normal but based on this I was taken to hospital. Nothing found!. As of 4 days ago I have experienced similar problems to Richard C. That is, I will feel as though my chest has suddenly had a balloon fill in it from behind the sternum. Then I will feel as though there is nothing, no pain, no feeling then I will feel a sensation diagonally up from my sternum to my left shoulder. This all occurs in 3-5 seconds and I am sure my heart does not beat once during this. Then WHAM it is all released and I feel dizzy and nauseated for 10-15minutes. This happened once after climbing 20 or so stairs, the other time I was seated and had been for 15-30minutes prior. On top of this, during and after 20minutes of exercise, which I have been doing daily for 2 years, my heart rate has peaked at more than 160 per minute. With even more exertion in the past I have never exceeded 130-140bpm. I would really appreciate a professional providing me with some advice here. I am returning to my doctor this week and want to ask for 1) a Loop Recorder to hopefully catch what the Holter Monitor has not, and/ or 2) a stress echo (I have had an echo and told I have LVH 13mm) and/or 3) an EPS. Assuming this was purely anxiety or panic would I be feeling constant pain and/ or palpitations. Aren\u2019t these more specific to \u201cattacks\u201d, albeit they could be frequent. As the pain and palpitations is frequent, and becoming more so, as well as becoming evident and painful with exercise suggest a not yet identified heart problem. Like most on this site I am seeking even that little bit of reassurance I am not going to see this worsen and drop dead before I am treated.\n\n",

I have always been weary of that these panic attack were of themselves and not a side effect of something else. I have been recently diagnosed with a very large PFO that I am having closed through a catheter next Tuesday and from all the research I have done I find it surprising at how many of the symptoms of this I have blamed on the panic attacks. If you have not had a bubble test done to see if you have a pfo. Another thing you may want to have check that no doctor every had me check is your adrenal gland, there is a problem where a tumor can grow on it and cause panic attack like symptoms and it is diagnosed with a simple urine test.

    "content": "Over the past 2 years I have been been to 3 different doctors (7 times), and went to the emergency room twice.  I am a 35 yo female.  So far I have been diagnosed with Pulmonary Emphysema and Chronic Bronchitis.  I have tested for type 2 diabetes, (negative).  At The emergency room I had all kinds of tests for my heart, and I am happy to say that my heart is in great shape.  I have had 3 xrays of my chest.  The first one I was told everything was fine, all they seen was a very little calcium deposit.  The second time they seen a small to medium size calcium deposit and the third I was told I have a calcium deposit.  OK, heres what I have been experiencing.  (1). Pain starting from underneath my breast bone, right in the center of my chest, between my breasts. (2). Severe pain all the way up my breast bone, (from under it). (3) A lump on top of my breast bone, about fourth rib down, very painful.  This lump pops like a boil and I can feel it draining inside of my chest cavity.  It is very painful and gives me diarreah for a couple days.  The lump drains from the bottom of my breast bone.  The swelling goes down but within a week it comes back, and each time, the lump is a little bigger. It is the size of an egg now.  I was told it was probably air and not fluid.  I have had to live with this pain for two years now and I have pinpointed where it starts and the path it is taking.  This is very painful, so much it makes me sick sometimes.  I was told not to take anymore ibuprophen for the pain and just take this prescription medication for acid reflux.  I have taken it for 2 months now but had to stop because I couldnt take the pain and it was not doing anything for my problem, although I didnt have any heartburn.  I have also had blood work done and everything came out fine.  Any ideas?  I am worried that although my heart is fine that this may be indirectly related.  The only meds I am on right now is an inhaler for breathing.  The doctor tells me that my pain is air.  Although that is probable I know air is not what the problem is.  The pain does not go that deep into my body unless the lump is draining.  The lump is not on the surface either.  I have felt different pains in my chest and my Dr. is probably right on the air thing.  But I know this has nothing to do with that.  This is a different pain.  Not one of the doctors have checked the lump because they say its something else.  CARIE\n\n",

For various reasons I have recently been really worried that I have a heart problem. This has made me really sensitive to anything I percieve as being unusual (although I don't necessarily know what usual is).  My resting heart rate is normal - around 60 bpm. I've noticed after a fairly intense exercise session that my heart rate seems to still be up in the 90s an hour or more after exercise. I don't particularly rest in the immediate aftermath of my exercise, I just get on with my usual routine but I'm really worried that this is too high. I don't really have anything to compare it to as I never bothered checking my heart rate before I started worrying about it.  Am I correct? is this high?\n\n",

If you're in the 90 range, it's still in that normal range anyway (and it sounds like you're not completely at rest).  I asked my cardiologist once if it was ok that my heart sometimes went to about 120 beats a minute when I was doing normal houehold chores.  He didn't sound too worried about it.  Once again, I'm not a doctor or anything but I hope that this may make you feel a little better...   Good luck - hopefully you'll get a professional respond to you to make you feel a little less worried.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 25 year old male and have always considered myself reasonably healthy. I don't smoke and rarely drink. About 3 months ago I moved into a flat on my own for the first time. After about a month I was sleeping when I had a pain in my chest and a 'bubbling' feeling. I tried to shrug it off but a couple of days later I started breathing strangely - felt that I needed to take really big breaths. This went away after a short time. I went to the doctor and was told that the pain I'd experienced was nothing to worry about and that the breathing problem was caused by a panic attack.  I went home relieved but still didn't feel quite right. Since then I have had periods when I would suddenly realise I wasn't breathing and, more generally I felt I needed to breathe very deliberately. This has since calmed down but I have a tightness around my head, have felt very tired recently (this has eased a bit lately), find my arms twitching involuntarily sometimes, am generally shaky, have strange, very short dizzy spells (seem to 'tune out' for 1 second or so), sometimes feel a tightness in my chest, have had the odd, dull, pain on the left side of my chest (which has woke me up from sleep a couple of times), had palpatations on at least one occassion and feel generally ill (the thing that's actually making my life miserable is a general ill feeling in my head rather than anything to do with the heart. I don't feel clear-headed).  I've had an ECG which was fine and my blood tests all came back ok. My doctor hasn't a clue what's wrong (he thinks it's most likely psychological/sub-conscious, maybe anxiety but I think the symptoms of anxiety should come and go. While some of my symptoms do I've not felt really well for over 2 months now). He's now referred me to a cardiologist although it may be sometime before I see them and in the meantime I'm pretty miserable.  Also, I'm not sure if I'm imagining it but my hands seem to be very cold sometimes and very white (I've always been quite white looking so this might be normal). Sometimes the heel of my left palm feels like it's numb but looks normal.  I've continued to exercise during all this and, if anything feel slightly better when I'm doing so.  Help!\n\n",

None of the information that I am providing is intended to substitute for the experience and knowledge of your qualified health care professional.    However prior to making any type of assessment of your medical condition, it is important to know the following things:  1. Are you taking any medications?  2. Previous Medical History/Surgical History/ Hospitalizations? 3. Immunizations? 4. Do you have a family history for any cardiovascular events or heart disease?  5. What is your occupation and social situation like? 6. Besides the exercise, is there anything that makes you feel better? 7. What is your diet like? 8. Of all the symptoms you present, what is the most prominent one? 9. Is there any change in your vision? Do you get headaches?  The reason I ask, is that there could be cardiovascular things that may be propogating your symptoms.  Often, valvular defects in the heart can cause a decrease in blood flow to parts of your body(this could account for your light headedness and cold extremities).  Such valvular defects can also cause a back of blood in the heart and into the lungs(which could account for your respiratory symptoms).  And of course, psychological issues can also account for the palpatations that you percieve.  My differential diagnosis for your condition could include:  Cardiomyopathy Valvular Defect (Aortic Stenosis, Mitral Stenosis, etc.) Angina Anxiety  Of course, a physical examination would help identify some of these anomalies; sometimes a trained cardiologist can confirm the presence of these findings a lot quicker than your family doctor.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, in response to your queries:  1. I am not taking any medications 2. I haven't visited a doctor in about 17 years before this so there's certainly not much of a history. Nothing serious certainly but I can't remember that far back! 3. I've had the usual immunisations that were administered at school but I'm not sure what these are. We called one of them the 'BCG' and I reckon maybe Tuberculosis? 4. No, most other things but no heart problems. 5. I am a civil servant but have not been stressed about work recently. As i said I've moved out of my parents' place into my own flat. Still manage to meet up with friends fairly regularly but I have been quite 'depressed' recently, not just because of the health worries but a bit lonely too. 6. Most of the time I look forward to lying down as I imagine I'll be safe when doing so! Having said that, sometimes I feel worse when I'm in bed. 7. My diet is ok but I don't eat enough fruit and veg and have a sweet tooth. Also, I've maybe been relying a bit more on ready meals since I moved into the flat. 8. This seems to change over time but I'd say that I just don't feel clear-headed ( if that's a word) ever and I'm constantly waiting to have another dizzy spell/moment. Over Christmas I was back in my parents place and did feel a bit better but there the most prominent symptom was tiredness (which is not so bad now). The 'cold extremities' might be in my head, it's something I only noticed recently and I've always had 'bad circulation'. 9. I'm not sure about my vision. I went to the opticians and they said my eyes were fine. I think vision is ok. No headaches, just a tightness around the head.  Thanks for your reply.\n\n",

    "title": "Quit Breathing During Surgery Recovery - Is That Normal?",
    "content": "I recently had surgery and during recovery, was woke up about 6 times because they said I wasn't wanting to breath. I have been waking up in my sleep the past few weeks with a very forceful breath through my nose. I do this repeadedly in my sleep, about 15 times or so an hour. My doctor sent me home with an oximeter but the results was negative though I have about every symptom there is of sleep apnea. Now it seems he isn't wanting to do anything else but I'm really worried about this. Could the fact that I quit breathing like that prove it's apnea? They just wouldn't return my call about it. But there's no way that can be normal, can it? I also develop a rapid pulse following these breathing spells.\n\n",

Because all these factirs are inportant for the diagnosis of sleep apnea.   Even then what you describe does fit into the diagnosis of sleep apnea. But 15 times an hour is a bit too much. You need to see a pulmonologist at the earliest who will administer some tests and then may be you need a bi pap.  A.Madia\n\n",

My symptoms related to this are excessive daytime sleepiness, unrefreshed sleep - feeling like I haven't even had 5 minutes of sleep, chronic fatigue for 9 years, fibromyalgia, loud snoring at times, morning headaches, irritability, recent change in personality (mood swings),  depression,   insomnia (have had to use sleeping pills for 5 years), rapid/pounding pulse, recurring upper respiratory infections with otitis media & sore throat, sinus type pain, and pressure & pain in nose. But I do not have the high blood pressure or diabetes. Though it's high risk in my family. My grandfather had apnea and my brother had a severe case of it from a deviated septum, he quit breathing over 100 times a night before his surgery. He told me that all of his physical symptoms were exactly like mine. This recently has started happening to me during the day too while awake and he also had that problem. Could it be apnea? I would really like to know if it is normal to quit breathing during recovery after being sedated for surgery. I cannot go see a specialist about this as that would be up to my primary care physician and he won't even respond to this. I called the office about it while I was still in the hospital but they didn't even bother to call me back. Should I be concerned and demand that they do something about this? I really don't understand why he's ignoring this anyways. I know my oximeter reading was okay, but I also know that's not 100% accurate. And something is wrong with me causing this. I have gotten so horribly moody from being so tired from this that I had thoughts of taking a bottle of sleeping pills just so I'd get some sleep. It's just a stupid thought, not that I was going to do it, that's just how bad it's been.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi.  Thanks for providing the data and a detailed history. Things have become much clearer now.  In my view, you are unnecessarily worried about your breathing. All you are sufferring from is a complex syndrome of anxiety depression. Following are the positive points in your history: 1. You are only 35. Sleep apnea not too common at this age. 2. You have no hypertension. 3. You have no diabetes. 4. You are not obese. 5. Pulse oxymetry readings are normal. And let me state that in contrast to Glucometer and digital BP machines, pulse oxymeters are remarkably accurate.   Just don't be so hyper about the whole thing. Cool down, Take a capsule of fluoxetine 20 mg daily after breakfast for at least 4-6 months, the positive effects will be seen only after 2 weeks. I hope you can get this there over the counter. Otherwise ask your primary care physician to prescribe this. In addition also take some tranquiliser like Ativan or Xanax at bedtime.  You will be much better in 2 weeks time. Stop thinking about sleep apnea.  Wish you all the best.  Get back to me whenever necessary.  Dr. A. Madia\n\n",

    "content": "I've had anxiety problems since I was 17. I take Buspar for it and that extremely helps. I also have taken 10 mg of Sonata when I go to bed for sometime now, it doesn't stop the breathing episodes as strong as that medication is. These started happening to me within days following a flare up of sinus type trouble, otitis media & a sore throat. I repeadedly have this problem while asleep, most of the time, not waking me up. It is a problem for me because it is causing me to just overall feel bad, have bouts of extreme fatigue and have some really bad mood swings. But I should not let myself get concerned? I didn't ask for this to start happening to me. If I sedate myself too much while I'm asleep, I'd say there'd be a big chance that I would stop breathing as I did in the hospital. That is not an option for me. Nor is this depression/anxiety related. Though I apprieciate your thoughts on it. I know that I have the right to be able to find out what is wrong. And my doctors shouldn't treat me like it's nothing just because I have depression issues. I went over a year up until I met my new GYN months ago not knowing why I had so much pain and pressure in my urinary tract including hydronephrosis. They absolutely treated me like there wasn't a thing wrong. It just took having a doctor that could actually believe me when I told him all of the problems that I was having. An IVP showed my uterus impinging and pressing on the upper part of my bladder causing a parcel blockage. After the surgury, I found out that all my organs was prolapsed including my bladder, uterus and cervix. My uterus was inflammed as my bladder is and my cervix was inches from coming out of me. Both organs had to be removed as both was really messing up my bladder function. I also had a sling put in my bladder. I had to go to the bathroom sometimes over 100 times a day and was diagnosed as having a very severe case of intersistial cystitis. This surgery took away all of that pressure and pain and has extremely helped me. What was so severe is not so bad anymore. I had several doctors acting like this was nothing, and being told I'd just have to learn to deal with the severity of my problems. My gyn told me that he was definitey sure that my uterus was causing problems to my bladder and another doctor told me it was an obstruction as on the IVP, my bladder filled very slow, and said it could get so bad, without treatment, that my kidneys could shut down and quit working. I was treated like this was nothing for over a year and it seems as if history is going to just repeat itself. And quite frankly, I am tired of it. I do not or would not manifest health problems just because I get depressed. And it just really bothers me knowing that people treat me that way. The past bleeding from my nose, repeaded upper respiratory problems, and the continuous pain/pressure & numbness in my nose may even be signaling the problem here. A health clinic that's been treating these problems for me wants me going to a ENT doctor because of this but my doctor needs to give me the referral. And I have reason to think he's just not going to do anything else. I don't think my age is a factor here as my brother is only 37 with a severe form of apnea. But he does have high blood pressure unlike me. I have however developed a rapid and pounding pulse that even skips beats at times. Not really sure as to why. The only question I really need answered though is whether it is normal or not to stop breathing while under sedation and what type of condition may actually cause such a thing if it's not apnea (or depression related). I think my doctor should at least do a sleep study before ruling out apnea, especially since the symptoms are there. Am I really so wrong in thinking that?\n\n",

However since you expressed technical difficulties doing so I offered my clinical judgement.   Secondly when the levels of serotonin and dopamin are low in the brain, for any reason whatsoever, a person tends to be sad, melacholic and even small bodily problems appear magnified in intensity and one cannot divert the mind into some constructive activities. This is why I advised you to get on to a course of fluoxetine which increases the level of dopamin in the brain.   Even so the best course of action is to rule out any organic pathology before starting fluoxtine.  A. Madia\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you Dr Madia. I really do apprieciate your opinion even if I strongly disagree. I was really upset that day and scared. It had nothing to do with you but was over my doctor, knowing that he wasn't going to do anything further for me than that oximeter reading. It's just the one person I thought would never treat me that way and it really hurt that he did. I have taken Cymbalta for the depression and the mood swings since it got so bad. I've tried to stay away from such meds because I have side effects of suicidal thoughts but realized I really needed something. I have clinical depression but I extremely recovered from the severity of it after I quit taking antidepressants. I was mentally and sexually abused by my ex-husband and that's what caused me to get so depressed the begin with and after I finally got away from him, my children decided they wanted to live with him instead of me. That was so hard to go through. And I am under the care of both a therapist and a psychiatrist now. I have heard that people who have depression manifest physical symptoms that are not real but seem real to them but that someone is just not me. But I have been getting treated that way by some of my doctors. Back to the sleeping problem. I taped myself sleeping on my video camera and very shortly after I take this forceful breath, I stop moving completely, am completely silent and obviously I've stopped breathing, and when I finally resume breathing again, all I do is take a deep breath upon doing so, which is nothing like the forceful breath. I have heard myself on a cassette tape during some of these episodes go to moaning like I had been sufficating to death. I know with apnea, you quit breathing and then take the forceful breath or gasp but it appears that I am still breathing during that part. So do you think that could be apnea or something else similar to it? With the frequent sinus problems, sore throat and otitis media, if I was gonna take a guess at this, I'd say I got a deviated septum like my brother did. Or a tumor or something considering the blood that came out of my nose for a month straight. How abnormal of a shape will your nose take with a deviated septum? Mine is actually somewhat larger on one side but nothing extreme. If I infact do have apnea, why did the oximeter reading not show it? Could the fact that I smoke and have gas stoves for heat cause the oxygen level to stay higher than it might have actually been? A health clinic I've been going to is sending me to an ENT specialist due to the frequency with my upper respiratory problems. That should help. If this is apnea, am I unsafe by taking sonata, amitriptyline and any other medications that promote or cause drowsiness? I really don't feel like I could make it from one day to the next without taking sonota to help me sleep.\n\n",

This pain comes and goes and I notice it the most when I am laying down, or sitting- a sharp pain and a throbbing sometimes below my heart, on it or above it. My left arm is also hurting (ive had a prior problem with it so I don't know if its related) I notice that if I lay flat on my back when sleeping the pain seem to go away, howerver if I lay on my sides(pillow under stomach) I feel my back swell up and the pain starts, my heart will seem to race and I feel winded a slight bit.  As I sit here now typing, the stabbing pains have happend about 5 times :(  I went to the er last week *I have no insurance* they did a ekg that came up inconclusive, they said they wanted another one but never did it, they also gave me a stress test, I reach 90% and the report said I was fine, also the sonicgram was fine. blood pressure was a little high. They sent me on my way with the pains still happening.  I've been walking about 1 to 2 miles a day, watching my diiet, ive lost about 15 pounds. I've smoked pot and have since stopped thinking this was the problem, but I am really concerend since I don't qualify for any help and I can't afford to visit the Er again.  also i'm not suffering form any stress, I'm laid back.

He then prescribed Darvocet and that hasn't helped either. My question is, could there have been some nerve damage done during the surgery? Should she consult her Cardiologist or try to see some sort of specialist?  ...thanks\n\n",

    "title": "Chest tightness, Palpitations, Stong Heartbeat - 22 Female",
    "content": "Well here it is, 345 am and I'm like a vigilante.  I am 22 years old female, just graduated in december and am in the crazy job search mode so a lot of anxiety.  I am healthy, do not drink caffeine (anymore, quite a month ago), eat very healthy, no smoking, rare drinking. I am writing this post because I am having strange chest problems that have been accumulating over the last few weeks.  For the last month and a half I have been having heart palpitations--meaning my heart will start to race when I'm just sitting or even sleeping.  I began to take magnesium tablets and drink more electrolytes (pedialyte even!) and they slowed down.  However, I have noticed over the last several months that my heart rate in general is up.  At the gym, when I check my heart rate on the machine during workout, it shows a rate 10 or even 20 beats per minute higher than say last year.  I feel as though I can feel my heart beat all over my body and the chest beat seems very loud 24 hours a day.    I have grown very concerned over the last week because I've been having major chest tightness around the breastbone.  It is NEVER sharp, just constant, dull and centered.  I feel as though my hands are shaky sometimes although they never look to be shaking.  This tightness is driving me crazy!  I have also developed a cough that originates within my chest, low in the throat.  I do have to mention that I had laryngitis last week relapsing from a cold the week before after yelling too much at a sports meet. I also should mention that I think my esophageal sphincter is not working perfectly as I burp up food and liquid quite often.  I do eat small portions, never overeat.  Especially not lately with this tightness in my chest.  Very slight tingling has just started today in my upper back and chest, but I did lift weights today and sometimes it happens right after (althought that was 15 hours ago).  I almost don't notice it at all.  My temperature is normal.  Since graduation, I have had a lot of anxiety.  I stopped taking yoga classes but I work out 5-6 days a week (1 hour cardio, 30-45 min weights 4xs per week), my boyfriend of 3 years just left for 6 months and the job search is so incredibly frustrating.  I think I freaked out tonight because I just got rejected for individual health insurance (school insurance ran out) so I need to wait until a job comes through to get back on insurance.  My \"pre-existing condition\" that I was rejected for is a knee problem, go figure.  I have to stress that I don't think that this is anxiety-induced discomfort.  I have been under more stress in the past and have never felt any of these conditions. in fact, this is the only night i've been up like this for a month and it's because i'm stressed about the insurance and so i worry about my condition even more which makes it worse!  the constant increased heart rate is what is really bothering me although this chest discomfort is quickly becoming a contender.  My mother says she'll pay out of pocket for me to go talk to a doctor but it's way too expensive to get a million tests done without insurance.    Before I forget, after and during workout I feel better than normal.  the palpitations are not workout induced either.    So to recap---chest tightness, heart palpitations (reduced with magnesium), overall increased heart rate, cough (worsening), acid reflux, excessively cold hands and feet (more than normal for my already cold extremities).  I also had a lot of jaw pain before any of this began from bruxism--that has totally gone away.  I don't know if this is heart failure, a MVP, GERD or a chest infection.  or a combo or none.  It is NOT anxiety, my anxiety is only making my symptoms worse, not causing them.  Thanks in advance for your help.  I really do hope someone else has experienced this sort of thing because I feel like I'm losing my mind or dying sometimes!  Mel\n\n",

Everything you explained I have too although I'm male and I'm 41.  I do suffer mild anxiety but what is causing my smptoms (shortness of breath, palipations, chest tightness etc) are due to my reflux which I think is caused by my anxiety.  I worried so much I had so many tests, angiograms etc and I still live with the symptoms and  some times they are bad but I know now they are reflux or digestive related.  It's scarey I know.  Anyway don't replace my experience with propoer professional help.  You are not alone!\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for your insight Norby-  I just went and paid out of pocket for a checkup.  She listened to my heart and performed an EKG (she felt so bad about the insurance co. rejecting me about my knee that she did not charge me for the EKG, what a great person!).  Diagnosis: normal.  no murmur, no strange clicking, no enlarged heart or fluid in the lungs.  I was so scared that my blood pressure went up to 150/80 but when she checked again at the end of the appointment it was 110/67 (low bp runs in the family).  I think anxiety is causing these problems but I have been noticing that reflux after eating aggravates my chest pain.  She gave me some beta blocker samples which are helping immensely to keep my heartbeat under control.  I'm gonna take those for two weeks then phase them out.  I do need to get me acid reflux looked at thoough.  Norby, thank you again for calming me down.  If anyone else is having this same experience please let me know.  Best, Melissa\n\n",

Beta blockers! That seems a bit dramatic.  That'll slow your heart rate and drop your blood pressure so watch out for symptoms.  I took them for Hypertension some time back and I needed to get of them because they made me so drowsy.  Anyay, best of luck.  Great to hear you are OK.  I turned to natural remedy's to help with my Anxiety.  Check out \"St John's Wort\" and some Bach Flower Remedies.  They work for me.  Just Google both of them  Cheers.\n\n",

    "content": "Mel -  You are describing something which I have had for about a year now. It is very disconcerting. I am a guy, 24.  I have put a post up earlier with more details but around Feb/March last year I had the same symptoms as you with occasional shortness of breath and an ache accross my chest. Then in April I had one night when it became very painful, not really acute but a strong pain accross my chest and difficulty breathing. I nearly called an ambulance but toughed it out with some painkillers and went to doctor next day (a tip I got was to keep you head raised, particulaly in bed - I now use three pillows!).   Anyway, I was referred to a cardiologist and I had a trace which showed up okay apart from one little bit. So I had a ECG (Echo) and it shoed my Paracardium was enflamed (Paracardium is a muscle with protects the heart) and it had been pressing on my heart stopping it beating properly. This was caused by a viral infection.   As you say you have had a couple of infections it may be this has spread. My doc just said rest for a few weeks and then I went back and he told me to get back exercising, slowly at first. So I now walk a couple of miles every night and I feel better for it. (I am not overweight)   I suggest you see your doctor and get an ecg and echo - it could be something similar.   Hope this is of some help,  Gareth, UK\n\n",

This does my anxiety no good at all! lol I have tried to find out what is wrong with me and in three of four different searches, Mel, your post came up. Lately I have had wicked chest pain just behind my breastbone, shortness of breath my hands and feet are cold.Seems that my heart is going to beat out of my chest and it seems I am gulping for air at times. It almost feels like my arms are going numb. That could be stress though.  Went to the walk in clinic yesterday because I could take it no more. I swore I was on the verge of a heart attack and the anxiety was making everything worse. He asked me all kinds of questions and seemed stumped. My bp was perfect, as always 120/80 but he decided to do a ekg which came up perfect too.  Finally he had me chew and swallow (ugh) 8 Galvascon. I seemed to be a bit better after that.  We are still not sure what's wrong with me. Woke up this morning not feeling much different. He said that if it keeps up I will have to take a stress test and an xray. I find that scarey! Your post was from ages ago, have you found out anything more?\n\n",

Doctors say not to worry but I feel like my heart is literally going to pop. If it isn't racing, it is skipping beats very heavily and ofcoarse I run short of breath. Daytime, night time, makes no difference.  I have no insurance so I can't see a doctor and am wondering if there is any over the counter treatment or some kindof therapy I can try that anyone knows of. I am 24, female and have been having these harsh palptations for about 3-4 years, everyday, no matter food and excercise habits. I smoke 6-10 cigarettes a day and drink once in a blue moon. When these occur, I get so freaked out even after all this time and I cry which I'm sure makes them worse as they happen. I just always wonder, \"Is this it this time? Is my heart going to finally explode? What if I have a heart attack and no one is around to help me?\" Any thoughts, advice, or comfort is tremendously appreciated.\n\n",

It could possibly be PSVT, a condition where your heart just starts beating really fast all of a sudden, even at rest.  If that is what's going on, it is not fatal.  The next time this happens, try putting your lips around the tip of your thumb and blowing really hard like you were blowing a trumpet for a few seconds.  Do this a couple of times, many times this will put the heart back in a normal beating rate.  If that doesn't work, try putting your face in ice water.    Of course, we cannot diagnose your problem over the internet, so you need to tell your parents now about this problem; you need to be seen to find out exactly what is going on, OK?\n\n",

Also once after eating a very greasy meal of fish and chips I observed a tightness in left side of  my chest for around 20 minutes after having eaten, and also after eating a veggy burger and chips in a room once full of smokers I observed the same feeling. Also by  just standing in the room full of people smoking I initially felt this tightness in my left chest side, but it went away after a while , even though I was still in the room of people smoking. Also another time after I few sips of wine I felt my heart beating strongly, but this only happened once and after this consumption of alcoholic beverages produce no noticable effects ( I don't drink often at all, and only moderate amounts).  I havent felt the chest tightness since  these occasions.  before the battery incident I observe that sometimes when I stand up I feel light headed for a few seconds  and sometimes when I drink when I am very thirsty I get a sudden rush of blood to my head.  all help is appreciated  -EP\n\n",

    "content": "I have been having some problems over the past month that are concerning to me and are frankly stumping my doctor.  I have an anxiety disorder as well as panic attacks.  I have come to recognize the symptoms of these and how to control them over the years. The symptoms below are NOT from these as they do not feel the same at all.  In the last month I have had extreme nausea, a feeling of someone sitting on my chest, and numbness and tingling only down the left side of my body (it starts at the shoulder area and goes all the way down to my toes, but only on the left side).  I have NO pain associated with this at all.  I do have a very mild headache that comes and goes on the left side of my head from time to time, but nothing severe.  I also have a fluttering feeling in my chest, which i associate with the anxiety/panic problems but I could be wrong.  The doctors checked my thyroid, did a blood test to rule out clots (as well as a Cat scan of my chest), Chest and Neck X-Rays.  They did other blood tests .  I have NOT had an EKG and no other tests have been ordered( I did have one years ago when I was pregnant with my son and it was normal).  My blood pressure is 118/70 and my cholesterol is 153.  I am overweight but am working on getting my weight down by excercising 5 times a week ( I have done this gradually over the past 6 months).  The doctor has told me that basically all the tests done this far show me to be a very healthy 28 year old female.  Told me to take some IBprofin and come back in a week if the symptoms have not gone away to get further testing done (which he said is very expensive and he does not think it is warranted at this point).  Any suggestions?\n\n",

Well i thought it would go away , just something like inflamation from the IV and fluids, but after about a week it was still there so went to family doc and he X-rayed it and nothing showed up on the x-ray, but there is something about an inch long and its solid in the vein . It does not move much but my father is scared about it deciding to move andlike block a valve or something, so now in the morning I'm goin in for out patient surgery to get it removed.....A friend who is a head nurse at this hospial told me that it was possible for part of the (catheter?) flexible tube to be sheared of by the needle when moving the needle back and forth lookin' for the vein... is this possible?....\n\n",

    "content": "For nearly a year now,  off and on, I've had shortness of breathe symtoms.  They come on very sudden, and do not last but about a second.  When it happends, I often feel what might be described as fluttering in my chest, like I can feel heart beats.  NO pain, no disomfort, no sweating, no swelling, no coughing.  Happends sitting up, standing, or laying down.  Sometimes I get them in interervals of once very several minuites, sometimes once a day, or spread from days at a time.  My blood pressure is good (120 ish / high 70s), I'm in good heath, weight is good.  I excersise, but I think being 'active' is a better word.  I'm a 35 year old male.  I do have a bit of stress in my life, but I wouldn't say I'm the 'panic attack' type at all.  These symtoms', come at anytime... night or day.  I think they are mild enough that I think I don't feel some of them occur.  I've had an EKG, chest X-Ray, and have had blood work done.  Nothing has been shown.  I'll see my doctor again soon, but he's not figured it out yet.  He seems to think it's not life threatning though, I passed the 'big' tests to screen out major issues... though maybe something was missed.  Any ideas?  HELP\n\n",

    "content": "I too experience shortness of breath combined with an increase of blood pressure with mimimal activity.  From a sitting to standing position I will experience a bounding heart, shortness of breath, and a b/p increase on avg. of 135/95. With 20  min of aerobic activity 174/95.  I have had numerous tests: A year ago a EKG, Echo,  King of Hearts, and CT done to find the cause; nothing remarkable and was placed on Toporol 25 mg daily for the Hypertension - this month a 24 hr urine test, the only remarkable result was that of a slightly elevated T3  and small thyroid nodule; which was ruled out with Nuc Med and Ultasound .  Anxiety was diagnosed and I was placed on Xanax XR 1mg daily, this lowered the pressure to an avg of 110/65, so they discontinued the Toporol. Still unanswered is the  the shortness of breath and increase in pressure during minimal activity.  Are  these symptoms the result of anxiety or is there something more medically I/we are overlooking? I am 32, non smoker, non drinker and within appropriate weight. The Dr is satisfied with Anxiety and that I am otherwise healthy.  Is  pressure of 135/95 while walking across the street or rising from a sitting position normal? Would the gap of a year warrant retesting? I don't dare call the Dr. again with questions as my credibility seems to be crumbling with each normal findings exam. Frustrated and growing hopeless for answers...\n\n",

Within a few minutes my entire body had a very distince tingling feeling. The numbness was most noticable in my hands, arms, and face. I was afraid of passing out because I started having trouble seeing. My hands were completely useless, as I was unable to unclench them for at least an hour. After leaving the party the numbness slowly subsided, but even the next day my hands are still sore. Although this has happened to me before, it has never happened to such a degree or for such a long amount of time. I'm concerned because I have never heard of anything like this.\n\n",

    "title": "Unusual high pressure heart beats and inner chest feels hot",
    "content": "I have been emotionally bothered by something, which may have contributed to the problem if it frayed my nerves, but I don't think it's the direct cause of the problem.   5 and 6 nights ago while lying down to sleep, probably for a short period, I felt my heart beat may have been too soft, and I mentally induced it to beat somewhat harder.  I realize this sounds silly of me and that there was probably no significant problem with the pressure at that time.  I think the part of the nervous system regulating the heart beat may have adjusted to this and has been trying to maintain a harder pulse.    4 and 3 nights ago when I was lying down to sleep, my heart felt like it was beating too hard. This rate of occurrence wasn't constant but occurred many time periods through the nights, and more so on 3 nights ago. The temperature in my chest felt too high. The elevated pressure mainly occurred when I was lying down to sleep. When my body is vertical the problem of the elevated pressure seems to be much less.   In the upper left and more towards the front of the inside of my chest, aside from the increased pressure and temperature, at first felt like inside there was a \"boney\" texture, perhaps from the heart hitting actual bone or just a similar feeling caused by the heat and pressure, or by fatigue from beating too hard over a long period. I could feel an area of heat on my upper left back as well. My chest area has felt unusually hot.  I'm not making this up, when I breathed sometimes my breath tasted like smoked meat.   During the day I can still feel my heart area and it feels hot and there is a feeling in the upper left area in my chest, perhaps caused by fatigue.   I have been trying to relax in order to stop the problem. I thought that I could relax enough and I could get switched back to the 'gear' of regular heart regulation by the nervous system, and get rid of the problem in a few days.   To be safe, two days ago I went to medical practice. My temperature and blood pressure measured fine. The doctor said that a chest x-ray probably wouldn't reveal any more information, and that if the it didn't get better in a week, then a chest x-ray should be done. The doctor advised me to relax.   A blood sample was taken as well.  2 nights ago my heart still felt unusual but the pressure problem had decreased.   In the last 24 hours or so I have felt a crusty feeling on the left side of my heart.  I hope it's just fatigue and not overheated tissue.  The pressure problem seems to have gotten slightly better but I still feel heat in my chest and an un normal crusty or burnt texture feeling in my chest.  I want to get better as soon as possible and avoid permanent damage.\n\n",

Just in case, a few days after I had started  taking a couple Gas-xs a night for about 3 nights, then I dropped down to 1 per night for about a week more.  I don't know if they helped any but they didn't hurt.    During the doctor visit a nurse took a blood sample.  A few days later the results showed my bilirubin count was a bit high.  I believe it was like 1.6 and a upper normal count is 1.3.  The doctor said that count wasn't that high.  About a week later a got another blood test to check if the bilirubin was conjugated or not, as the last sample was too old to re test.  The results were reported to me a week after.  I think it was unconjugated, and my count had gone down to 1.4.  No ultra sound or x ray has been taken as the doctor said it wasn't necessary right away unless something shows that it's called for.  The doctor wanted me to come in next month to get another blood test to check the same thing.  I don't think the heart rate and the odd feeling and heat were related unless it's just that I could've used some cardiovascular exorcize.  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "If you started new medications roughly around the time the symptoms started, the drugs could be at fault. My doctor gave me benicar for hypertension and my heart did not stop pounding until some time after I got off the drug. Turns out that all the years of NSAIDS for my arthritis may have damaged my kidneys just enough to affect how I metabolized the medication. It was fairly easy to figure out when I went over which medicines make me sick ACE Inhibitors, ARB's, nitroglycerin, metformin (which gave me constant diarrhea for over a year), diuretics, some NSAIDs; anyway, what they all had in common that I could find was kidney involvement and dehydration.  So when I had an angiogram right after that, I made sure to mention that I had been having kidney problems and they gave me many extra fluids, which flushed out some of my problems. I am still trying to get my system cleaned out; I was already taking all the medicines I could tolerate for various chronic conditions, then the cardiologist adds 5 more in a week and I got a whole lot sicker than before I saw him really fast.

    "content": "Hi JennyC, If your roomate was advised to take aspirin for a history of blood clots then I would strongly suggest that she do as she was instructed. When blood clots form, dislodge and travel to other areas of the body they can cause serious complications including death. Aspirin can be purchased over the counter and is relatively inexpensive for a month supply or more.  Hi candice98802, Generally speaking, blood clots of the extremeties cause pain, redness, swelling and warmth. If you are not experiencing these additional symptoms then I would more inclined to consider another cause.  Lymph nodes are also located in that particular area. Have you experienced any recent injuries etc. to your arm or hand? Regardless of the cause you should have the area evaluated by your physician.  Hi Momma, DVT's in children are an uncommon finding. Where was your son's DVT located and what was the diagnosed cause? If his current physician is unfamiliar with treatment of this condition I would strongly suggest that you inquire about a referral to a pediatric specialist..... Benefits of certain medications usually outweigh the consequences of not using particular drugs. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, my wife is in the midst of an ordeal and I could really use some advice.  Shortly after seeing her obgyn for an endometrial biopsy she developed a uteran/pelvic infection which led to bacteremia.  After an e.r. visit with a temp of 102.7 she was  treated with iv zosyn for 5 days and released from hospital.  A few days later the infection returned.  She was then treated with oral antibiotics(levaquin and clindomycin). She developed a rash so the levaquin was stopped and replaced by doxicyclene.  She had a worse reaction a day after the switch and all oral meds were stopped and she was put back in the hospital for further i.v. antibiotics.  All during this process she was having severe abdominal pain associated with the infection.  She was given i.v. Ertapenim to treat the infection with the plan to continue for 14 days.  Also a hysterectomy was decided to be the best way to insure capturing all the infected tissue with removal of the uterus and cervix to be the plan.  A midline catheter was inserted in her arm but had to be removed due to excessive pain.  A doppler scan was performed and diagnosed a 4 inch clot in her cephalic vein.  She was immediately placed on a continuous heparing drip for 2 days with the Ertapenim continuing.  Her surgery has been postponed for 9 days after her clot was diagnosed. She is now on Lovenox 90 mg once per day and continued her Ertapenim.  My concern is her risk factor for undergoing surgery so soon.  Should we delay the surgery longer and risk the infection returning or is it safe to have the hysterectomy.  Please note that she is taking Yasmin pills to control abnormal bleeding which initiated the need for her biopsy.  Hematology specialists at her hospital approved the Yasmin and Lovenox concurrently.  Thank you in advance and I anxiously await a reply becuase her surgery is now only 4 days away.......\n\n",

I take Avalide 300/12.5, crestor and zetia. Also, Androgel for low testesterone.  My chol is very good: the last labs showed total chol at 129, HDL at 54 (I exercise frequently) and LDL at 52. Triglycerides were 115.   I usually have an NMR lipo profile which is why I take the two chol drugs even though it is low - we are trying to fine tune the particle size, etc.  My BP is generally 110/71 but when I check it when I wake up in the morning it is sometimes 99/60. Resting heart rate is 54 and when waking up sometimes 49. I wonder if either the BP or HR is too low. I bring in a list of my readings from my BP machine which he accepts but I have serious white coat hypertension going to the nurse when I get my physical every year and it is like 140/95 when she takes it. I begin to freak out a week before I have to go in.  He tells me don't worry about it because by the time we spend an hour together at my physical it is down. I get an EKG and chest X-ray every year as well and both have been ok.  Regardless, does anyone have any thoughts on my labs that I can discuss with my doc?  thanks,  Capt. Delta\n\n",

    "content": "I know how you feel.  And let me reassure you that there are things that can be done.  I am 25yrs old and also have had palpitations my whole life.  I was on a holster monitor in high school which found nothing.  I went through a series of tests, EKGs, Echocardiograms, etc. which also found nothing so it was deemed to be anxiety then.  Well, about a year ago I went into the ER with a heart rate of over 200bpm (after 45 minutes) thinking I was having a panic attack - they did an EKG then and I was diagnosed with a disease called SVT - Supra Ventricular Tachachardia.  Usually SVT will be caused by abnormalities of the heart's electrical conduction system.  This can be controlled by beta blockers, but for me to take a pill every day for the rest of my life was out of the question.  The doctor in the ER told me that being it happened so infrequently, that I would not need to be on meds.  But having the anxiety of this happening at any time or any place was too much for me.  I was scared to go anywhere too far from a hospital.  So, I spoke with a cardiologist and an electro physiologist and decided to have an ablation done.  Catheter ablation is used to eliminate alternate pathways present in the heart that interfere with the normal conduction and cause arrhythmias (abnormal heartbeats/palpitations).  The procedure took about 4 hrs and I stayed in the hospital over night.  I since have not had an attack.  I'm not saying this is right for everyone, but having anxiety sucks, and this disorder just fueled the fire for me.  Please please please speak with a cardiologist to go over your options.  There are answers out there and you're not going crazy.\n\n",

Some times it feels as though there is a flutter in my chest, but this is NOT located on the side my heart is on.  It is very annoying, to the point of keeping me awake at night.  Sometimes taking a deep breath and holding it will stop it momentarily, but it quickly returns.  It is really bad in the early morning hours, but is persistent throughout the day.  I am diabetic, but have no new medications.  However, I was given samples of Lunesta and Rozerem to aid in sleeping.  Could this be a side effect.  They certainly have not been any help in sleeping! about (5) hours is as good asit gets.  This feeling is very disturbing, help!\n\n",

    "content": "It is very common for people who experience any sort of chest pain / discomfort to automatically think \u201cOh my god \u2013 it\u2019s my heart\u201d.  Well in your case, it is very unlikely to be a cardiac related problem.  You mentioned that you are 14 and exercise and this with the way you describe you symptoms leads to me think it\u2019s chest wall pain.  What\u2019s chest wall pain?  When something (i.e. inflammation from an infection, some sort of trauma like a pulled muscle or fracture) happens to the lining of your lungs, the muscles that aid in your breathing i.e. the intercostal muscles between your ribs, the ribs themselves, etc, pain develops.  This pain typically will increase with deep breaths, moving, etc. and is usually referred to as being chest wall pain.  Perhaps being a 14 year old guy and being physically active you have managed to strain a muscle in your chest (\u201cbruised a rib\u201d), you could have sustained a \u201chair-line\u201d (small) fracture of a rib, and so on.  It\u2019s always advisable that if it concerns you, to make you parent(s) aware and to see your family doctor.\n\n",

I think mine is related to stress or anxiety more than anything physically wrong.  it maybe the same as mine, Inflamation of the chest wall which I have found has a name of Costachrondritis.  Only thing I know to take is anti-inflamatory pain tablets (please consulat an adult if under age). Unfortunately for me my Doctor was less than helpful after an ECG and blood test was cleared he said 'some people just get pains' and didn't subscribe me any pain tablets (thank you very much!) and didn't tell me what I had got, had to find out myself via the net. I would definately recommend to see the Doctor though even if to discount any more seriuos possiblities (doubtful because of your age) which might make you feel a little better.  Good Luck\n\n",

The pain does not \u201cradiate\u201d to the shoulders, arms, or jaw. The pain is not described as tightness, squeezing, heaviness, or crushing. The pain is not accompanied by weakness, nausea, sweating, dizziness or fainting.  I do have gallbladder disease but I have had no syptoms in 3-4 years.

    "content": "I am currently serving active duty in Fallujah Iraq in the Naval Seabees.  I am 20 years old and work out often.  For the past two months every couple of days when i'm sitting down i will feel a sharp stabbing pain in my chest out of nowhere.  It causes me to cease what i'm doing, cringe, and wait for it to go away.  It takes a couple of minutes and then the majority of the pain goes away within 1 second and i can get back to work for about another minute. After that minute it comes back harder but 3/4ths as long as the first attack .  Then the pain will dramatically decrease within 1 second but not fully go away until i no longer notice the pain.  It doesn't hurt any more or less to stand or to breathe normally so i don't think it is chest wall pain.  If i do stand up i get very light headed and dizzy.  I don't get sweaty or natious.  I don't want to bother the base medics but i would really like to know if it is a sign of a heart attack in the near future or if i'm just being a big wuss and it is really not a big deal.   Before i joined the navy i was about 90 pounds overweight for about 5 years of my life before i got my butt in shape and lost 85 pounds within 5 months.  I gained about 20 pounds back during the course of two years.  If that helps anyone diagnose what i have.\n\n",

In addition to fatality, pulmonary embolism can lead to several serious complications, including:  High blood pressure in your lungs (pulmonary hypertension).  Heart damage.

    "content": "I went to the doctor about a week ago to see why my right knee had dislocated twice in the last couple of months. When I went there I also found that my blood pressure was very high which worried the nurses and the doctor. I had several blood tests done to see if I had hyperthyroidism and to make sure that all the chemicals in my body were in check. I have always been very thin but lately I've just kept losing weight and this was also a reason for seeing the doctor anyways, most of the tests have come back normal but now the doctor wants me to come in for a Diagnostic Imagining test, Echo Cardiogram, and to see an Optomologist for my eyes. When I talked to him last he said that he was concerned that I might have Marfan's Syndrome a very rare genetic disorder which would explain almost every symptom I've had, even the reason why I'm the only person in my family that is near sighted. My question is should I be worried about this at all and could it just be weird coincidences and that nothing is wrong? Neither one of my parents remember anyone in my family have Marfan's but 2 out of 100,000 people isnt exactly a high number. Is there anyway that this genetic mutation could stay dorment and not show up until generations later? I'm really worried about this being 18 and almost started college. Thanks for any help and answers.\n\n",

    "title": "Left Arm Pain on Blood Pressure Meds",
    "content": "Can Blood Pressure Medicine Cause Arm Pain?    Thanks in advance for your help.  My husband was admitted to ICU a few weeks ago with malignant hypertension.  At the time his blood pressure read 236/136.  The renal speciailist has been very thorough and as of this time there is no indicators of permanent damage to organs or eyes.  He was released from the hospital and has been adjusting to the medications he is now taking.  Here's the dilemma.  For some reason his left arm is hurting excessively.  The renal specialist hasn't found any clear reason why.  My husband believes it's related to the high blood pressure, as it hurts most when his blood pressure spikes in the evening.  The pain started a couple of weeks after taking the meds, beginning as a \"tingly\" feeling as if the arm was asleep.  He's been alternating heat and cold to try and get relief.  Tylenol does no good.  The pain is so strong he cannot sleep at night, and as can be expected the pain also causes (I think) the blood pressure to rise.  He is on 20 mg. Lisinopril twice daily, 200 mg. Labatolol twice daily, and now 0.2 mg. Clonodine at night to try and lower his blood pressure so he can sleep.  He quit smoking two days before being admitted to the hospital, is not drinking, and we have done our best to reduce the sodium in his diet.  Before we are driven to pay for yet another specialist, my question is Can this arm pain be related to the medicine he's taking?  His heart rate tends to be in the low 60's when we check his blood pressure.  Any information or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!    My apologies for adding this to an old thread (and I hope it gets noticed) but new topics are no longer able to be posted here.  THANKS.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello!   Well, lymph nodes can get swollen from an infection...have you ever had Mono infection? because you said they've been with you for years? Have you ever been diagnosed or got in contact with a patient who had tuberculosis|(TB)?  A chest X-ray is very important and that plain X-ray on the places affected can be very helpful, we can see if your joint spaces are normal...if you have any pathology there, etc...It's a basic thing to do...and if somtheing was query about them . we can ask for more advanced investigations.  I am concerned about your lymph nodes though...so if you can tell me when did they start,how ,if u ever got a bad throat infection,infectious mononucleosis,TB, anything that can be related to them.  If all of these came inconclusive...then we can think of autoimmune disease...like rhematoid arthritis .because you said it affected most of your joints(i know you are young) or SLE....but you don't complain of anything but your joiunts.  How did  your joints get affected previously...and has it affected big joints only before...like the knees or elbows...and they became hot ,red, tender and just go away by aspirin?  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Doc. Sorry for the long delay.I went outstation and couldn't find access to internet there. Its been raining here in Mumbai and such weather makes my condition worse. I have noticed few more things recently.Firstly when I twist my wrists ( mostly left) I  can always  hear noise as if its coming from an entangled bunch of nerves, its not painful though.The nerves on my head seems tensed and give me a feeling of unwellness. Even my ears seem to be affected and when I pull them I can hear crackling noise. Its like the tensed nerves get to relax when I stretch them.Pressing the palm of my hands against my table edge also produces a crackling sound. Regarding your questions I have never known a TB patient or had knowingly got in contact with one. I had got my chest x-ray done a couple of times many years ago and they were  normal. My lymph nodes started around the time I started getting joint pains i.e. when I was around 16.I remember I used to have frequent sore throats with cold then but never after that.It all started with my neck and slowly spread to my shoulders, hands, back, legs. The joints has swelling when it all started but now there is no swelling , only stiffness.\n\n",

    "content": "I had a single bypass surgery done almost 2 years ago.  I am overweight and really need to lose.  I tried the typical cardiac diet - low fat, low cholesterol, NAS, etc.  I did lose a little weight but my cholesterol was still higher than my MD wanted it to be.  I was not able to take the statin drugs because it interfered with my concentration and memory (not a good thing for a nurse), and so I started the Atkins diet after doing much research on my own from studies and hearing the results of many other people.  I did lose weight at first, but more exciting was that my lipids decreased dramatically and my HDL was greatly increased.  I was very excited about it, but my cardiologist is not.  He told my parents (who also see him) that he did not want me on the diet because in a couple years my cholesterol would shoot up very high. What I am wondering is if there are any studies or research that prove this is true, or maybe it's his own opinion because it is hard to be compliant with the diet after a long time.  Thanks for any input!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello... over the past couple of weeks I have been experiencing strange symptoms dealing with headaches and dizziness.  The dizziness started by itself about two weeks ago for no particular reason, unsure of where it came from I just blew it off.  Now, over the past couple of days, I have been experiancing a splitting pain just above my right eye close to the temple area.  As soon as the sudden onset of pain dissipates I become very dizzy almost to the point of blacking out.  This worries me due to having two very young children and the last episode happening while I was driving with them in the car.  Do you have any suggestions as to what this may be?  I do not have insurance so cannot afford to see a doctor and am hoping that this is something that will subside.  Any suggestions that you can give me will greatly appreciated.  Thank you for your time!!!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello.   I am a 23 yr old female and I have been experiencing sharp chest pains above my left breast. The first night I had them I went to the ER (I am a military wife in Germany so I had to go to a German hospital) After doing an EKG and running bloodwork the Dr said that everything looked fine. He said it might be the muscles or bones. But he said just to be sure I should stay the night in the hospital so he can run my blood again in them morning. That bloodwork was also fine. So then he sent me on my way with no real explanation.Also, my blood pressure had been slightly high over the past few months but my regular Dr said it was probably due to being overweight. I started an exercise program and I have brought my once high cholesterol down to normal numbers. Now I am working on my weight. I just started a strenuous workout program called \"Boot Camp\" and during my workouts I feel no discomfort or pain. But when I am doing nothing such as watching TV I feel slight discomfort on the left side of my chest. Also, my blood pressure was 143/93 that day.  It has been about 3 weeks since then. After going to the ER I was fine. Every once in a while I would get a feeling of discomfort in on the left side of my chest, but no pain. But about a week ago the discomfort was more frequent. It mostly came at night when I tried to go to bed. I tried to go to sleep but I couldn't due to the discomfort. It kept me up all night long. This didn't happen again until 2 days ago. All night I tried to sleep but the feeling would not go away. It is hard to explain. It just feels really uncomfortable. Tonight it was worse. I have been trying to sleep for the past 6 hours and I cannot. When I lie down it feels uncomfortable and then as I think I might be dozing off, I get a huge feeling of anxiety or something. Kinda like someone just walked in and scared me. I don't know what is going on.   Can anyone help?\n\n",

She prescribed medication but I am afraid to take it because I am not comfortable with her diagnosis. When this happens to me, I check my pulse and I can feel my heart stopping/ skipping a beat.  Should I call her back and tell her?  I don't know what to do anymore but I cannot live with this feeling anymore.  Is that what a panic attack is? Are skipped beats something to worry about?  One of the medications she prescribed said NOT to take if you have heart rythem problems.  My friends tell me to go to ER but I am no longer insuured and don't know what to do.\n\n",

    "title": "I've had the same sensation",
    "content": "Hi, When you say that you have the feeling of bubbles in you chest.  Would you also describe it as a small fish flopping or a quick flub followed by a momentary lightheaded feeling ?  If so,  it sounds like you have PVC's  (preventricular contractions).   The doctor should not dismiss your symptoms for panic attacks.  The only reason you may feel panicked is because you don't know what is happening and that's a scarey feeling. See someone else.  I've been having the same problem for about 3 1/2 years now.   The 1st and 2nd time I wore the holter monitor, it recorded a few PVC's.  I didn't feel any the last time I wore it but it did show 2 PVC's  in 48 hours.   I'm going to see a cardiac electrophysiologist in Sept to see what is going on with my heart, because on 3 occasions the PVC's seemed to have triggered ventricular tachycardia and I came close to passing out.   I felt the flub, and became lightheaded, which doesn't make me concerned, but then my heart just started beating real fast with no real rythm and my hearing started to go, so I called 911.  But then everything went back to normal and my EKG was normal by the time they got there. If you ever have something like that happen, call 911 and they can at least stay on the line with you incase you pass out.  My cardiologist said that a lot of people get PVCs and that the sensation you feel when you feel lightheaded for a couple seconds is your heart resetting itself. They really don't treat PVC's if you only get them occasionally.   I would call the doctors office and tell her that you are feeling skipped beats when it happens, but if you don't feel that your doctor is going to do any further investigating, and going to chalk it up to panic attacks, find someone else.  Good luck!     I know it's very frustrating!  I'm still frustrated too.  Write Back if you'd like.   It's nice to have support.\n\n",

I just got back from a wedding reception where this happened many times and now it's hard to breathe and there is a hollow feeling in that area of my chest.  The pains start as a sharp sudden pain in my upper right chest just on top of/behind my breast. They immeadiately become a sharp, peircing pain in the area just above my right elbow. If this happens a few times, it will move from chest to elbow to become a numbness in my right hand. This happened a few times tonight, and my right arm feels not quite numb, but almost, and the fingers on my right hand feel tingly.  I did not eat any unusual foods, and doing physical activity is not abnormal for me, but I noticed that the pain happened most with excessive movement of my arms.  Any ideas?\n\n",

    "content": "My 21-year-old son has this problem where his heart rate increases when he sits or lays down, making him short of breath.  He's actually better on a treadmill, heart rate decreases and he can breathe better.  He has some structural problem.  Have you heard of anything like this?  He also has low magnesium which he has to get IVs to replace.  When his Mg is really low, he has terrible chest wall spasms where it hurts so bad he feels like he's having a heart attack.  When his Mg is not so low, it's still debilitating but not the knock you to your knees kind.  The breathing problem is hard to handle and he is extremely chronically fatigued.  He's in his first year of college and just to manage the pain, etc., he takes 3 naproxen and 4 ativan per day.  Any ideas?  Does this condition have a name and is it treatable and by what type of specialist?  Thanks for any info.\n\n",

    "title": "enlarged heart valve",
    "content": "First of all I have to explain I lost my spleen when I was 6 years old and have been septic and hospitalized for infections or high white count 20-30 times.  I lost count.  One time I had a pic line for 6 weeks at home for an infection in my sinuses that was lingering for months.  They did look at my heart in an EKG at that time and it was fine.  Last year I was sick for 6 month strait.  I was hospitalized for infections a couple times, June and Aug., and had two surgeries, Aug. and Sept. One surgery was for a swollen lymphnode that had a lump for months and then showed a hot spot on a CT scan.  The other surgery was for a tooth that was suppose to be dead after a root canal, but was thought to be the cause of the lingering infection.  I did not have cancer and the the test of the removed node showed a deformity.  The doc said to me during the 6 month fallowup that maybe the node had a infection festered in it.  After the tooth was removed the symptoms lightened up and  I got sick about every month or two.  Ok, the heart!  I started getting sick around March last year and by May I started having an irregular heart beat and shortness of breath.  They did some tests in the ER and said I was fine.  By July I was still complaining about my heart along with various other symptoms and the doc sent me for an EKG.  The EKG said I had an enlarged heart valve and should check it in 5 years or so.  By Oct, 1 month after the tooth was removed my heart symptoms got better.  They come and go now.  In March and April of this year I had the problems with the fluttering of my heart after a infection that raised my white count to 30,000.  It was an unknown infection and they treated me in the ER with IV antibiotics and did a spinal tap for the stiff neck, which I get frequently when I am really sick. I have had four or more spinal taps, again I lost count.   Now I have been sick for two months and am on my second perscription of antibiotics.  To add to the complication I have a problem with yeast all over.  My lymphnodes are swollen all over and especially on the right side.  I do have a tooth that is bothering me a lot, and it is sore under the right cheek bone where I the last extraction.  My heart is bothering me again.  It seems to bother me at night the most.  I can feel it skip a beat and it seems like it is laboring.  The docs have done blood cultures since then, and I do believe that I was not on antibiotics for one of them.  I read that there is a test that can be done that is done by drawing blood over a period of time and kept at a certain temp.  I know the doctors have not done that test.  Also, I was on Vioxx for two months last year when I was sick.  Should I do anything?\n\n",

    "title": "brief but consistant chest pains",
    "content": "Hi,  I'm a 31, non-smoker, healthy female that has been experiencing consistant chest pains for 6 months.  Back in Oct, I had a chest x-ray, blood work, ECG and stress test with thallium all which came back normal.  While most people would be relieved by that, I'm not 100% convinced.  I continue to experience chest pains daily.  These pains are accompanied with shortness of breath and lightheadedness.  These pains are often dull aches mainly on the left portion of my chest however at times they change to sharp pains.  The pain often spreads to my left shoulder.  These pains generally last only seconds but reoccur throughout the day.    I have gone to the ER in Jan because the pains got really bad but the Dr took one look at me and told me to \"stop reading so many medical books\".  Needless to say, I took great offence to that.  As if I wanted to spend 6 hours waiting to be seen if I didn't think my symptoms could be serious.  I feel that I'm often overlooked because I don't look like a typical candidate for heart disease.  I'm a young female, not overweight so how could I have heart disease.  Desite the fact that my risk factors may be low, that doesn't mean that nothing is wrong.  We've all heard stories from friends that this could happend to anyone.  Anyways, my main concern is about what can be causing my symptoms.  I don't believe there are any other tests that can be performed so I'm stuck with no answers.  Anyone's help would be greatly appreciated.  Sorry for the long history but I feel that it's best to get the whole picture.  Ltunes\n\n",

But don't stop there , I am now seeing  an intestinal specialist to do invasive tests there , because chest pain could also be from something wrong intestinally, or stomach wise.  If you have any signs of stomach or intestinal issues, all the way down to just frequent simple heart burn or reflux. Any sign at all, i would get some test done. Your gallbladder or colon , or something of that nature can cause pain in the chest, or even joint pain in your rib to sternum area. I would try that route before just giving up. My chest pains are on the middle to left side also. I am not giving up on this. I can't something isn't right. You shouldn't either. Don't listen to the guy who said stop reading medical books! Thats terrible!! You know your own body, he does not!!  Good luck! Jen\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for your reply, Jen.  It's so frustrating to be going through this but it's conforting to have people like you who can relate.  Sometimes I feel that no one understands what I'm going through and that they think I'm exaggerating because having heart problems at 32 is very rare.  To top it off, it's discouraging when doctors don't take my concerns seriously.  Anyways, I'm going to persist and make another app't next week.  By the way, when you go back to your doctor to discuss your symptoms do they offer any other suggestions.  I too feel the sharp pains when breathing but I notice mine to be more when I exhale.  They are very brief pains only lasting a 5 seconds but they happen throughout the day.  Are yours similar?    I too have been told anxiety and inflammation of the rib cage but would that last for 7 months? I will definitely ask my doc about the gallbladder and colon as possible causes and see what he says.       Keep me posted.\n\n",

    "content": "Yes mine were like that when they started every now and again for 5 seconds, it would stop me on a dime! But then it esculated into an abrupt dull pain that has the periodic sharp ones. It came on like it was going to be that same 5 second pain out of nowhere, and hasn't stopped yet. This is the first time I have had it along time its been 6 weeks now. Usually its only a few seconds and then stops. This one is sticking around, and scaring me to death. It is very hard to function. The doctors offer anxiety, or costo chondritis, things of that nature. I am persistant , and keep going back until they send me to specailist. This time is different because it won't stop. I am 32. my best friend had this same type of issue, and got no diagnosis, and she died in her sleep from a supposed virus in her heart, at age 31. Don't let that scare you, but doctors have to realize if you under 40 and complaining of chest pain they need to take it seriously, and for some reason they don't. I don't get it. But my intestinal doctor seems to think it could be definately from intestinal issues. I am getting an endoscopy, and colonoscopy, and stomach and chest ultra sound. Then I am going back to the cardiologist, and he is giving me another heart ultrasound, and a strees test. All of these are in the next month. You just have to make them. Its better to do these test than not. Giving you a little more piece of mind. each day sems to be getting worse for me. its starting to wake me out of a dead sleep. I beg you to keep pushing, so u don't get to this point . Jen\n\n",

    "content": "Sue! It sure is scary, and I am in exactly the same situation!  I want testing done, and things checked out, want to gte an echo cardiogram done, ECG (24 hours) and perhaps more blood testing done... It just gets to me that I am getting these pains, It could well be nothing! and just me worrying... But... the symptoms seem to match that of a heart problem! I mean I guess once I am dead I am dead... But I would like to live longer than 18 years!! I hope age is sort of on my side, although it doesn't feel like it!  I hope all goes well for you, the current doctor I am under is a complete waste of time, Doesn't seem to think that I have anything wrong other than anxiety, and that! They just don't want to know about my problems it seems, only when I am actually well they don't mind treating you it seems. I have concidered deatha lot recently which is pretty depressing.. I really don't want that to happen! But people just don't seem to want to listen to me, and people don't want to test me either... So not sure what I can do... Other than keep on at him and seeing what he does...  My parents are trying to get another familly doctor who seems very efficient and knows her stuff. That is what I want. A doctor that actually knows his / her stuff and actually wants to make you feel better, rather than putting it down to something in your head, test to see if it isn't something else FIRST! It makes sence to check for things that are physically wrong rather than mentally wrong, although saves resources to say \"it is all in you're head\" Still I just hope it is nothing serious, really I do, for you and anyone else, and mytself also! I would really like to get to the bottom of things, I know something isn't right, otherwise I would not be worrying what so ever... Tomorrow (if I am still about) I will make an opiontment to see the doctor locally and tell him what I have been getting, the pains and sensations, See if he can arrange me a 24 hour ECG atleast and then perhaps an echo cardiogram, and perhaps some other tests and refer me to a specialist at some point just to get things checked out further, would be nice to be told by people who know what they are actually doing that things seem to be ok... which is what ECGs before not 24 hour ones, and blood tests show, think my Cholestoral was something like 4.1 and blood sugar about 4.7 I think So not too high or low... on either.. Still doesn't mean that I am imune at all... could be a number of things going on! which is what worries me. I know worry is not the answer... But the entire thing does scare me really, and sometimes I just feel like I want to dissapear painlessley sometimes just to avoid anything else... But at the same time I want to keep at things and see what happens, but what could appen just does my head in.\n\n",

I know firsthand what it's like for people to think you're imagining these pains but don't let them get to you.  I do believe that they are real because I live with them everyday.

    "title": "Re: Brief but consistent chest pains",
    "content": "Dear Laura,  Please, review the reply to your other post for further details.  Chest pain has so many causes and it is sometimes difficult to find out a reason.  From your description (shortness of breath and lightheadedness), these episodes can be related to anxiety or panic attacks. Personally, i don't like to say that any symptom is caused by panic or such psychiatric reasons before making sure that there is no organic cause behind the symptoms.   i have a bias (especially that you mentioned left shoudler pain), if a patient complains of chest pain that turns out to be not due to coronary disease, i always suspect neck problems. So, i would recommend having a neck x-ray/ct scan of the neck to rule out neck spine problems.  Mitral valve prolapse is another reason, but your echocardiogram was negative as well.  If when you have this chest pain press on your chest where the pain is and you find that you have tenderness, this is most probably a chest wall problem, muscle problem, rib problem, cartilage problem and the like.  The chest pain that you are describing is not consistent with the pain typical of reflux disease but it can still be a possibility. Sometimes, treatment can be a diagnostic tool, if a patient has a symptom and the doctor has a suspicion but not 100% sure, the doctor can give the patient the treatment of this condition and if the symptoms go away then the doctor was right about the suspicion and the treatment was used to diagnose the disease, so i would suggest that your try over the counter anti-acids if you have not tried them yet and see whether or not they make a difference.  Jen is correct about her suggestion, i would recommend that you talk to your doctor about such possibilities.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.  Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: High blood pressure at young age",
    "content": "Dear Redfence,  Young persons can develop high blood pressure espeically if their parents have high blood pressure or if they are of a certain ethnic background like natives or african americans.  High blood pressure is diagnosed when the lower figure (called diastolic blood pressure) is higher than 90 and the higher figure (called systolic blood pressure) is higher than 140 on 3 different occasions (on three different days of the week) in the same week.  If a person develops high blood pressure at a young age, it is always wise in my personal opinion to check for causes of secondary hypertension before the person is labelled primary hypertension.  If you are diagnosed with hypertension, you have to loose weight if you are overweight, exercise on regular basis and don't use salt in your food. If your physician prescribes medications for high blood pressure, you have to be very faithful in taking those to make sure that your blood pressure is always within normal range to avoid the long term effects of high blood pressure on the heart, brain and kidneys.

    "title": "Chest pain and metformin",
    "content": "I was recently diagnosed with PCOS / insulin-resistance.  I have very high levels of blood sugar, but am not diabetic (yet).  I am an overweight, 38-year-old female, but I at least try to keep in relatively good cardiovascular shape by kickboxing 2-3 times a week and other exercise.  My problem is the medications I am prescribed to help with this problem.  I have tried Glucophage (metformin) 3 times now, and every time it is the same - I start feeling like someone is sitting on my chest, like it is difficult to breathe, and my chest literally almost hurts.  When I am taking metformin, when I exercise, I do very little before my heart-rate is just pounding - up in the 175 range - and it just feels like I am so tired and like I can't do anything, and like I just can't catch my breath.  (Normally, I have no trouble exercising... my heart rate can go that high, but it doesn't feel that bad and I usually just take it down a notch, and usually work in the 150-165 range).  When I climb the stairs in my house, which is usually no problem, I have to literally stop and catch my breath again.  Three times, with 3 different doctors, when I have told them about the chest pain/ heaviness/ trouble breathing, they just say, \"Huh, that's not really a normal side-effect.\"  The symptoms stop within 2-3 days of stopping the metformin.  I have been on it now for 2 weeks (3rd time around), and today the pain is so bad I am very worried it could be causing problems with my heart.  But no one seems to know anything about this, or connects it with the metformin.    I would just stop taking it, but the problem is I really need treatment for this.  I am on a low-carb diet, but I really do NOT want to get diabetes!  I want to take care of this problem!    If you could give me ANY advice to try, I would really appreciate it.  Thank you so much.  Amy\n\n",

It doesn't feel like indegestion though.  I did stop taking it for a few days and it did seem to ease off.  I also didn't drink coffee those days so perhaps its coffee??  Very interested to see if you get any more advise.  I also am insulin resistant PCOS not yet diabetic, on metromin to try and avoid it.\n\n",

Women present differently than men often; I have known since I was 32 that I was having heart problems because they run so strongly in my family and I have seen the same symptoms in others. I suffered for years being told things like \"your estrogen will protect you,\" and \"take some prilosec\" and finally got an aggressive cardiologist who tested me and had a stent put in for the %70 blockage last week. If you know the drug is causing the problem, get off it and raise cain till you get answers. It is not very satisfying to say \"I told you so\" when lying in the cardiac ward.\n\n",

    "title": "heart fluttering while sleeping",
    "content": "Lately I've been waking up with a fluttering in my chest that doesn't match my heart rate.  The fluttering is very rapid -- so rapid that I cannot count the flutters -- but when they are stronger, they are much slower in rate.  I'm not sure when they started, but I think they started when I was 27.  I recall waking up sweating while dreaming with a very fast pounding in my chest.  It lasted a few days, then I don't recall it happening until a few years ago.  I just thought I was thirsty.  I noticed it again about a year ago.  Initially they were stronger, almost like something was pounding from within.  The rate of the pounding was faster than my measured heart beat, as I would check my pulse during these episodes.  After about a week, the poundings died down to flutters, which are much more rapid, and impossible to count.    I've continued to have the flutters until now.  I went to see a cardiologist and used an event monitor for a few weeks.  He said that the results were negative for an arrhythmia.  I decided to ignore the flutters for a while, but lately they've been getting worse.  I saw another cardiologist and got set up with a holter monitor.  The monitor had four leads rather than two.  The results were negative as well.  I also had a sleep study done.  I thought perhaps it was related to some sort of sleep apnea, as my family has a history of sleep apnea.  Apparently I don't have sleep apnea, although I must admit that I don't fully understand how to read the results.  I've developed a few theories about what is causing this problem.  I'll describe my theories.  1) Recently I found a website that listed anxiety/panic attacks with similar symptoms to what I've been feeling.  I have palpitations.  I often wake up sweaty.  Sometimes I have a hard time breathing.  And, sometimes I feel that I have something in my throat.  These are classic anxiety symptoms.  So, you would think that perhaps I'm having anxiety attacks while I'm sleeping.  I'm doubtful that I'm having this problem, however, as I don't have any symptoms during the day.  On the other hand, I did notice that my symptoms have lessoned in severity since I've received the holter monitor results.  I believe that I was in some sort of positive feedback loop where the anxiety or stress of thinking that I had serious heart problems was actually making the problem worse.  Since receiving the holter monitor results (which were negative), I've been disrespecting my flutters, and consequently, I've been waking up less and they are less noticeable.  2) The sleep study did indicate that I had a minimum O2 level of 89 while awake, and 91 while in REM.  I do notice that when I get tired, my breathing tends to slow to a crawl.  I take short breaths, very slowly.  It's almost as if my body is shutting down to go to sleep.  I sometimes think I'm a bear going into hibernation.  Could the flutters be related to low oxygen?  I read that higher than normal CO2 levels could cause your body to go into panic mode.  Could this be the reason?  3) I'm leaning toward my third theory.  Could the flutters be due to my slow heart beat?  My resting heart rate is 50.  *pause to determine my heart rate right now*  Okay, my heart rate is exactly 50.  When I get tired, it can slow to 43 or so.  I'm still waiting to speak with my doctor about the holter results (he told me that it was negative, but nothing more yet).  I'm curious what my heart rate is before I enter into the fluttering mode.  It could be lower than 43.  So, anyway, my theory is that my slow heart beat is somehow linked to this fluttering (and perhaps to my slow breathing, and consequently to my lower than normal O2).  One reason why I'm leaning in this direction is that last night I didn't have any fluttering.  It was the first night in a month or even several months where I didn't notice any fluttering at all.  And, before I went to bed last night I ate a bunch of dark chocolates.  (More than a fair share of them.)  I'm wondering if perhaps the dark chocolates increased my heart rate, which then caused me to breath a little faster, and that somehow the breathing or the increased heart rate, or both together, kept me from having those flutters.  Okay, let me give you a little more information.  I'm in great shape.  I can run five miles no problem.  I can run at a rate of about an 8 minute mile.  I can probably run a mile in 7 minutes or faster.  I'm a fairly good sprinter.  I used to play a lot of ultimate frisbee.  I'm not overweight.  I'm 6'2\" and 196 lbs, which is high on the BMI scale, but I'm mostly muscle.  I work out every day with weights.  I don't have any other symptoms, except perhaps (and I forgot to mention this), that one night I got strange cramps in my veins.  When I was having those flutters, my right calf vein sort of jumped out of my leg.  It swelled up.  I'm not entirely sure what happened, as it was in the middle of the night and the lights were off, but in the morning a still felt pain from the cramp.  The pain seemed to come from within the vein on the inner backside of my calf.  Another night (during the sleep study),  I got a cramp in my left arm vein, but it wasn't so serious.    What more, the night I got a cramp in my calf I drank a lot of alcohol.  It also caused me massive anxiety, as I had convinced myself that I was experiencing a stroke.  It wasn't a blood clot, as it died down quickly once I woke up.  (I felt the cramp relax quickly after I awakened.)  That's about everything that I have right now on this fluttering.  If any of you have any ideas, please let me know.  I'm considering taking caffeine before bed and seeing if that stops the fluttering.  I'm also considering using O2 at night, but I don't currently have an O2 machine, and I'm still trying to work with my doctor on this issue.  Oh, one more thing, I had blood tests done.  Everything is normal.  My potasium is normal.  My magnesium is normal.  So is my thyroid.  (My family has a history of low thyroid.)  The only thing that was abnormal was my creatinine (1.3), but later I saw a liver specialist and the blood tests came out normal.   JJ0001  -x-\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 41 yr old female. Until the past 3 years or so, I have always suffered from low blood pressure, then I noticed my bp creeping up into the normal range and recently it has became high. (120/100) I had a kidney stone that went misdiagnosed for almost a year as \"trigger points\".  and was given several shots of depo-medral, then switched Dr.s and it was quickly found I had a large stone which was successfully removed with shock therapy in April. When I switched Dr.s in January, a blood test revealed I had high white blood cells and at the time the Dr. associated this with the steroid injections as I also experianced heavy hair loss due to the steroids. However, since that time my white cells have remained high and in the latest test it shows this is not from allergies but rather some kind of infection.I also had a chest xray that revealed an enlarged heart, during this time, so I just had an echogram done which shows one side of my heart to be enlarged. I am being told this is due to high blood pressure (120/100) My concern is could I have some kind of infection causing the enlarged heart/high blood pressure rather than the high blood pressure causing the enlarged heart. I have always suffered from low blood pressure most my life until the past 3 years or so in which I have noticed it crept up to the normal range until now. I have always been over weight and my weight has not fluctuated for several years so I would not think the high blood pressure is from that. I thank you for any thoughts you may have on this situation and also any questions I should ask my Dr. Currently I am not taking any medication for this condition. I must return for a recheck on my bp in 2 weeks and go from there. Sincerely, Demetria Tipling PS: Dr. is thinking my white cells may be up because I need a couple fillings in my teeth. However, I have no abcesses, pain or anything like that.\n\n",

    "content": "I already have a call in to my Ob/Gyn regarding this issue (and am awaiting her return call), so this inquiry is sort of a second opinion, just information collecting, etc......  I was on birth control pills for 9+ years with no problems.  I have used Loestrin, Ortho TriCyclen, Nordette, and possibly others that I cannot recall the names of right now.  I took myself off of them a little over a year ago just to give my body a break.  I resumed taking the pill two and a half months ago.  This time I was prescribed Microgestin 1.5/30, a brand that I had never used before.  I have noticed that I am having heart flutters now - probably at least 2 times per hour.  I don't know if there is a difference between a \"flutter\" and a \"palpitation\" but bottom line is that my heart feels like it races for just a second, like a shot of adrenaline or nervousness, then goes back to normal.  I do not feel this effect at all while I am exercising, and in fact it doesn't even in the slightest affect my ability to exercise vigorously.  I don't believe my issue to be an actual heart problem, as I did have a full Ultrasound Study of my heart done a few months ago because my doctor thought he saw something on a routine EKG - it all turned out to be nothing and perfectly normal.  I have also been checking my resting heart rate myself over the past few days, and it too it totally normal at 76-80 beats per minute.  So, could the birth control pills be the contibuting factor?  If so, what exactly is it about them that would cause this?  I have heard some women say that some brands have a diuretic in them (which could cause flutters for sure), and others say it could be a purely hormonal effect.  Any thoughts?  -MACtools_2\n\n",

There seems to be little info out there on bcp's causing heart problems.  But, I have heard of so many women with the same problem.  Yasmin (what I was on) does contain a direutic.

A pharmicist may be of help since that's what they do for a living... work with the actual medicines.  My friend swears that my problem very well may have been from my bcp.

    "title": "dizziness when exercising",
    "content": "Hi, I\u2019m a 39 year old male who has been exercising regularly for about 25 years.  I lift weights about 5 times a week and do 20-30 min. of cardio 2 times a week.  I eat healthy, don\u2019t smoke and drink a glass of wine a day.  I have never experienced any problems, other than normal fatigue, while exercising, regardless of intensity.  I\u2019ve been taking supplements such as vitamins and protein powder for years.  I have on occasion taken ephedrine (16 mg/day) and DHEA (50 mg/day).  I am not on any medications.  Overall, my health/fitness is quite good.  In January 2005, I injured my knee and stopped doing leg exercises until after my surgery in March 2005.  I started doing light exercises and progressively increased the weight/intensity.  One day in May, I completed an intense leg workout (leg presses and squats).  Shortly afterwards (5-10 min.) I felt a tingling in both my hands, forearms and feet.  I then felt dizzy and felt tingling in my ears and mouth.  I collapsed to the floor and was taken to the hospital.  A variety of tests were done (ECG, blood, BP, O2, glucose) but everything came back normal.  No cause could be found.  The dizziness slowly clears on its own after about 2-3 hours.  I returned to the gym, reducing my leg intensity and was able to do several workouts without incident.  On June 11, I tried another intense leg workout and once again experienced the same symptoms and collapsed about 5-10 min. after my workout.  The same tests were done again at the hospital and nothing was found.    Training other body parts (back, chest, etc.) does not cause this dizziness.  Doing cardio, I keep my heart rate between 145-150 bpm without problems.  Once I pushed myself to 155-160 bpm and after about 10-15 minutes I felt a little light headed.  I slowed down a bit, felt better and no dizziness set in.  Are you able to suggest any possible causes for this?  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Your target heart rate is  144.  Pushing it to 155-160 is not a good idea unless you do it very gradually.   You probably overdid it for your fitness level and didn't get enough oxygen AT THAT TIME.  By the time you got it tested by the paramedics, it was normal.  Since you are fit, your body resolves quicker.  It is also normal for the dizziness to take some time to completely wear off.  You said your body functions normally at your normal heart rate, so you more than likely were just working too hard.  Rule # 1 in working out:  Don't push yourself beyond your limits; it actually burns muscle at that point.  Don't forget to have protein and a small amount of good carbs before a workout or your body will turn to glycogen in the muscles again for energy.  If this starts happening at your normal pace, see a doctor.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for the reply.  This leaves me with some questions though.  During my workout I rest a couple of minutes between sets, until my breathing has returned to normal.  If I was O2 deprived during a set, wouldn\u2019t this rest allow my body to recuperate?  When I start to feel dizzy after my workout my breathing has already returned to normal.  Prior to my knee injury last January, I could train my legs has hard as I wanted to without feeling dizzy.  At that time, I would only become exhausted during the set, I would rest as usual, and then do another set.  At the end of those leg workouts, I never felt dizzy and collapsed like I do now.  I\u2019ve read articles in muscle magazines where bodybuilders have trained so hard that they\u2019ve either thrown up or passed out immediately after an intense set but then seem to recuperate.  There was no mention of them feeling ill for hours after their workouts.  I have never felt nauseous during my leg workouts.   Is it possible that not training my legs (still trained my upper body) for several months has caused my body to lose some fitness; enough to make me feel dizzy for several hours after my workout?  I don\u2019t know what my heart rate is like during a set but I imagine it is high for a brief moment during each set.  Both my parents have had heart attacks and I just want to make sure that I don\u2019t have some type health problem too.  Thanks again.\n\n",

    "content": "This dizziness now comes on quicker, even when I lift weights at a moderate pace.  After my last episode of dizziness two days ago I still have not fully recovered from its effects.  Any moderate physical exertion now such as lifting a 10 litre (4 gallon) water bottle will make me feel somewhat dizzy and I have to lay down.  Currently I still feel some slight tingling in my hands and forearms.  I've had numerous tests done since my last posting.  They are: -treadmill stress test -heart echogram -chest x-ray -CT scan of my head -MRI scan of my head -neck echogram -blood and urine tests -O2 All tests have come back normal so far.  I am scheduled to have an EEG test done as well as have a 24 hr monitor attached to me.  I recently purchased a fitness heart rate monitor (chest strap and watch) and had it on during my cycling and last weight training.  During the cycling, I averaged 145 bpm for 30 min. without any problems.  I later lifted some weights with my heart rate not going above 120 bpm and after about 20 min. I collapsed with dizziness.  Prior to the ambulance arriving I noticed that twice (about 5 min. apart) that this heart rate monitor dropped to 0 (zero) beats for a fraction of a second and then jumped back up to about 115.  At this same time the dizziness became very intense.  If there is nothing physically wrong with me could a virus or bacteria do this?  I also eat about 2-3 cans of tuna a day, which is known to sometimes have traces of mercury in it, but other than the dizziness, I don't think I have any of the other symptoms of mercury poisoning.  On July 8 after eating breakfast and not doing anything physical, I had another episode.  My chest area felt different (no pain), my hands and forearms tingled and cramped up a bit and I felt dizzy again.  I am now hooked up to a 24 hr heart monitor.  My family doctor as well as the doctors that I've seen at the hospital are all baffled by my condition.    Do you have any further suggestions?  Thank you very much.\n\n",

This may happen if there is some interference around (other HRM, cell phones, electric equipments, static electricity etc).  Sometimes when the chest belt is not well adjusted it can slip and cause a false reading on your HRM (0 or irregular heart beat).  Try not to worry to much as this can cause stress and weird feelings during exercises.\n\n",

    "title": "Dizziness,Short breath etc. while working out or in Humidity",
    "content": "Thank you for reading this. Please offer me some insights.  Hello,   I am 30 years old 5\u201910 222 lbs.  I have recently begun a strict workout and eating routine. I have done a similar routine twice before once in 2002 and once 6 months ago. The strict routine both times lasted about 7 weeks.   Each time the results were phenomenal. A body transformation, and mentally feeling great.  I basically follow Bill Phillips \u201cbody for life \u201c Program.  It involves 3 days of Cardio and 3 days of weight. The Cardio days are only 20 minutes and consists of 1-minute intervals going from 60% exhaustion to 90 % exhaustion, and then climaxing at 100% exhaustion.  So the idea is pretty much to push yourself toward exhaustion.  The weight training is a 45 minute work out where you weight train at a some-what  rapid pace to keep your heart rate up.   Anyway in these types of routines I have always gotten somewhat shortness of breath, minor chest pains and   a bit of dizziness. But as the weeks went on working out became more natural and those symptoms would subside.  Other pertinent facts I never have smoked, I used to drink alcohol a couple times a week but when I did it was more than a few drinks sometimes 3-11 drinks in a night sometimes   I have had some episode a few months ago and 5 years ago, that were typical panic attack symptoms (shortness, sweats, dizziness, feeling of heart attack, chest pains, numbness, skewed reality thought process etc\u2026) both times hospital said vitals were fine. My doctor both times prescribed Anti-Depressants to treat anxiety.  I would take them in low dosage for about six weeks and then go off them because they make me lazy and sometime depressed.  The first episode, 5 years ago I had the EKG test, it can back fine.  This last episode, a few months ago, I had want to get some tests done to relieve my worries but my doctor talked me out of it.  He said he would order them if I really wanted them. But he felt very confident after his examination they would come back fine.  He said it was anxiety.  Although I did have blood work done and no problems showed up.  Anyway those are of the preliminary facts,  so now to the issue, I recently began this strict eating and work out program again. I try to eat 5-6 times a day. A good protein and carb with each serving (so lots of canned tuna, cottage cheese, fruit, and MYPLEX shake meal replacements)    I have also switched the work out routine to a circuit-training program. For 30 minutes I alternate in 30 seconds intervals between cardio and weights, with a 15 second rest between them. I plan on doing this 3 \u20134 days a weeks and then 1 or 2 other days I will do a 20-minute cardio work out. Overall I will probably get 5 days a week in.  I am switching to this circuit program because on 3 days of weighs and 3 days of cardio, I get pretty muscley and although I feel great and look great I don\u2019t really lose that much weight.  It \u2018s like my fat is replaced by lean muscle mass. Anyway I think I need to reduce my overall weight, so I am trying a program that will not put so-much muscle on me.    Anyway as I was doing my 30 minute circuit training work out, I got a feeling of fatigue sometimes, some dizziness, then I will get pretty hot and sometimes sweat quite profusely, I will get small little chest pains, I used to just work through these cause the doctors always told me I had nothing to worry about.  Anyway now I am more concerned because on more than a few occasions I had stop and calm my self down.  The fatigue, dizziness or sudden overheating would cause me concern so I would settle down.    During these circuit training sessions this usually happen in the Cardio intervals.  Also when I was doing 3 days of weights and 3 days of cardio. I would sometime get the sudden overheating, and the dizziness on the cardio days, especially when running on the treadmill.  But I would not really get them on the weight training days also I would not get them on lower impact cardio machines like the bike.  The last few nights I have felt quite bad at the end of my work out. It\u2019s like I have to sit before I can walk out of the club and sit even longer before I can feel comfortable driving home. Then for about 1 to 2 hours,  once I\u2019m home I feel like I need to be cautious with my activity (i.e. walking upstairs). I still don\u2019t feel right .  But after this period, I feel very fit and mentally good. The next morning I always wake up feeling very fit. Hence, why I am so reluctant to abandon my commitment to this strict regimen.     Other facts I do try to get my heart rate going to burn calories. I noticed I got it up to 185 for a few minutes.  Is that bad????? The machine even said 205 for a couple minutes but I\u2019m  not certain that was accurate because I was not holding the metal handles. It seem to be using a formula of based my weight, age, and resistance level.  But even using that formula, a machine saying 205 BPM is that bad????  Mediation and supplements: When I workout on my routine I use Creatine.  I use less than the recommended dosage.  I am currently weaning myself off Lexipro, which I was taking to control my anxiety issues.  I took it for about 2 months. But like I said earlier it makes me lazy and kind of depressed. When I am on my work out routine I drink about 80 to 130 ounces of water a day.  I go back forth with caffeine at some point I drink 2 diet mountain dews or 2 coffees a day. Other times I will cut caffeine out completely or use it in small doses.  I do feel I should mention at certain phase of my life in the past I used caffeine in excess of 2 drinks a day greater than 3 time a week.     Other pertinent facts  I feel like I\u2018m in bad shape, hence why getting back on my strict routine. Any moderately exercise outside in Carolina humidity brings on the same symptoms.  For instance I took a \u00bc mile walk from one office to another on a hot humid day in professional dress attire. Anyway on the way back, I had to squat down on the sidewalk to rest for a minute then I had to get into the closest business sit in the a/c, and drink water for 10 minutes.    I am only 30 years old I don\u2019t feel these problems are normal.  What do U think is wrong with me????   Do u think I may have some type of heart condition.  A similar post on this turn out to mercury poisoning from to much tuna fish.  Could something like that be possible?  I really need to continue my work out regimen to get back to feeling good.   I know there is a lot in this post, but I just want to give you all the facts.  To sum up I am really concerned with my dizziness during and slightly after my workouts. Also concerned with the other symptoms such sudden overheating, generous sweating, shortness of breath and slight chest pains (although they don\u2019t worry me as much cause I have these when I ran for the past 10 years, doc would say it must be a pulled muscle or something because my test would come back ok, and when I elevated my heart rate in other activity there was never a chest pain) but now I get those chest pains in other activities such as swimming or surfing on a hot humid day.    Although a month ago I went mountain biking for six hours and was fine, although the girl I was with did say I sweating really bad.   That was also in the mountains, which is much less humid climate.  That brings to light another issue, it seems to be  less noticeable in less humid climates like when I lived in Colorado or when I run here in the winter.    I mentioned surfing earlier I have surfed for 15 years and now I don\u2019t much anymore because I don\u2019t feel I have the energy or that I am not in the shape to do it. I have gone out a few times but sometimes  I get the symptoms I describe above, so I get scared and feel I have to stop.  Anyway what do think this???????? Please help I feel handcuff.    Thank you so much for your time, energy and efforts Mpow\n\n",

Eventually she underwent surgery for hypoglossal carotid entrapment. The study indicated that upon surgery she had \u201cmarked fibrosis [\u2026of] the neck, along with hyperplastic lymph nodes (1).\u201d Not exactly occipital lymph node region.

There are some disease, that can affect the lymph nodes all over the body (not specifically the occipital lymph nodes) and at the same time affect the brain and the patient may have seizures which could be diagnosed as syncope because patients lose consciousness and may be on top the group of lymph nodes that starts to be enlarged first is the occipital lymph nodes group.

    "title": "Occipital Lymph / Syncope",
    "content": "My wife went into a swimming pool for the first time last week.  After excersizing, she got out and had trouble seeing.  The pool temp was about 75F, and the outside temp was about 100F. She could not see for about ten minutes and felt light headed, difficultly walking.  She blacked out in the shower room for a few minutes while sitting down.  The next day, she came down with a bump in the occipital lymph area.  It has been painful for three days now.   She is also allergic to cold- several times every day since moving to California from her home in the Tropics two years ago, she gets a brief red bumpy non-itchy rash all over her body when she is cold or chilly from a breeze. Do you think it could be serious if anything?\n\n",

    "content": "hi  I am  a 30 year old mother to 5 kids.11 years ago I fainted with seizure like activity and had loads upon loads of anxiety like symptoms afterwards .I had an MRI,CAT SCAN,EEG. All normal and I was then disagnosed with anxiety disorder the symptoms went on for about a year.I thought it was all over 5 years went by I never fainted after that one time and the anxiety seemd gone.Well after about 6 years I fainted again after having stomach cramps.Went to the ER was discharged doctor there said i seemed fine maybe virus related.The axiety started up again because of course I was scared.Well I fainted 3 more time in a 2 year period.After each of the last 3 times I was horrible feeling when I came to id have sweat all over,pounding heart beat,weak,lose my bowels or vomit.I also have had palpiations and fluttering beats here and there through the years.I continued to go to my doctor who believes it all to be anxiety/stress which is what any doctor I speak with seems to think.I don't understand that I have read so much about anxiety I have no doubt that I have this disorder,but I doubt the fainting being part of it and the irregular skipping beats.I have always read and heard that it is EXTREMLY rare to actualy faint from anxiety and stress or panic.Well anyway, here I am again scared to death that I have some bad heart problem and I may die suddenly because it is left un treated.I have been having heart palpitations,irregular rythm when trying to sleep at night,lightheadedness,pains in left arm,and just anxious and scared.I havent fainted since the last time 3 years ago...............PLEASE any idea???????? does this sound like anxiety/and or stress????  ps there is no doubt I do deffinitly go totaly unconcious when I have fainted my hubby has been there to witness them,I only say this because it seems like maybe doctors are not believeing that i actualy fainted? I can assure that i do and it is absolutely awful! .............thanks for reading this long post and thanks for your responce in advance\n\n",

    "title": "Mitral valve prolapse and PVCs",
    "content": "I'm a 30-year-old Caucasian female, slightly overweight, but relatively healthy otherwise.  I have always had an irregular heart rate and have a family history of mitral valve prolapse.  (I've never been formally diagnosed with MVP).   I recently had dental surgery (3 weeks ago) and had 2 wisdom teeth extracted.  I had problems coming out of anesthesia with PVCs and hypotension.  I was out at the time and not sure what all occured.  I was advised to follow up with PCP and the oral surgeon spoke with him on the phone following my surgery.  Since that time, I have had a 24-hour Holter monitor.  I'm not sure of the results except for frequent PVCs and my heart rhythm ranges from  trigeminy to bigeminy.  I was placed on Toprol XL 25 mg daily by my family practitioner.  (I have not seen a cardiologist).  I'm on day 3 of Toprol and still having shortness of breath, dizziness, fatigue, and constant headaches (headaches going on 2 weeks now).  Heart rate ranging from 45 to 85 per minute in a 30 minute time period.  Blood pressure still ranging from 117/70 -- 95/50.  I am concerned.  I've almost blacked out twice now in the last two weeks.  Once during church while I was singing and another time tonight just standing up.  Should I give the Toprol some time to work or seek a cardiologist's advice?  Could damage have occured to my heart during the dental procedure or worsened my heart rhythm causing more symptoms?  I have always had an irregular heartbeat, but it has never bothered me before now and I've never been this symptomatic.    Thanks for your advice   Michelle\n\n",

    "title": "Hi Rick.......regarding your low cholesterol",
    "content": "Hi Rick. Some of your symptoms sound like mine used to be.   I am replying again so that you will be sure to see this.   When I first replied, this thread was locked and my reply was created as a new message.  For two years prior to November 2004, I complained of the following:   1. Severe depression that meds were not controlling. By November when I saw the doctor, I complained again, more vigorously, that I was even having suicidal thoughts, but thought that I was too much of a coward to carry it out. She changed my med from Wellbutrin to Zoloft.   2. I continually complained of a loss of memory. In November, I could not remember being at my daughter\u2019s home the previous Christmas. A carotid sonagram was done and showed good blood flow.   3. I complained of other cognitive problems, such as getting frustrated because I could not concentrate, couldn\u2019t find things and got lost driving the same routes I use to go.   4. My blood pressure, even though I was taking meds, was high.   5. I was having severe muscle pain in my lower back and thighs. I thought this might be due to my post polio syndrome or low potassium. Potassium was checked and was okay. I was also having incontinence, flu-like fever and dark urine and it smelled foul. I was getting weaker and weaker, spending more time in bed. I really thought I was dying. I was given a script for Detrol, but never filled it.   Tests Done in November 2004   I had a LDL subparticle test done which showed that I had a high level of small, dense particles (Pattern B particles) that were 3.3 times above the norm.   My total cholesterol was 120, HDL was 41, triglycerides were 132 and the trig/HDL ratio was 3.2. My doctor was happy about the low cholesterol reading, but did lower my prescripion. I noticed that the lab report put the cholesterol reading and the HDL reading in the low range. This is what started me on my search for medical information. And it was the medical information that I found that made me make changes.   What Has Changed Since November   Within a couple months, I was free of the above symptoms. I no longer even take a depression med. In fact, I haven\u2019t taken one since early November. The depression lifted within 2 weeks after I made some changes. I now remember being at my daughter\u2019s on Christmas. I no longer get lost while driving. And most importantly, I no longer have severe pains in my muscles and my muscles are gaining strength. My incontinence has gone away and I never filled the script for Detrol. My urine is now clear and without odor. In fact, I feel in general so much better that I cannot describe it in words. People are noticing that I am walking better and longer without using my power wheelchair. I am able to do more and do more longer.   I had not changed my diet, as I had been eating healthy, moderate protein, low glycemic veggies, moderate fats in 4 small meals a day. The only changes I made was to discontinue the statin drug, Lipitor, completely, begin to take 1 T of cod liver oil a day, take 3 T of virgin coconut oil a day and added supplements to my daily regime. Most of these are helpful for muscle regeneration, brain function, cardio-vascular function and improving insulin sensitivity. I also discontinued using Zestril for blood pressure, Prevacid and all the other tray full of medications, except for diabetes meds and allergy meds.   I feel that the statin caused muscle breakdown, called rhabdomyolysis since I had most of the symptoms. And those symptoms have disappeared since I discontinued the statin drug. It is known that this is a side effect of statins. A consumer watchdog group, called Public Citizen, published in Aug 2001 their report of what they found in their analysis of the FDA\u2019s side-effect registry over a 3 year period ending December 2000. They found 72 fatal and 772 non-fatal cases of rhabdomyolysis that was attributed to all the 6 statins sold during this period. When John Jenkins at the FDA was presented with this report, he did not challenge it, but said the agency is considering revising warnings for the drugs. I don\u2019t believe that even after over 4 yrs later that this has happened.   My July 6, 2005 blood tests showed improvement in key areas. My HbgA1c improved from 7.2 to 6.3. Triglycerides went down to 121 and the ratio of trig to HDL decreased to 2.4 which is a good thing. My HDL has increased to 50 and I hope to continue to increase it to over 60. My blood pressure is now normal WITHOUT medication. I had the Lp(a) done and the result is good, a 10 ( anything over 30 is a risk factor). However, we still don\u2019t know how the LDL subparticle percentages have changed. I think this test is a key one to do again to see what changes have occurred if any. We have a base test result that was done over 8 mos ago. Why not compare to it? But I have yet to convince my dr to do so. I may have to switch doctors to get one that is more competant and knowledgable. The most convincing evidence is how I feel and what I can physically do now. The statin drug was killing me....literally. All this was done without any exercise as exercise would further progress denervation of my motor neurons.   If you are interested in what I found in my research, I can share it; most comes right from the medical journals which few doctors have the time to read. The medical research articles describe how low cholesterol is even more dangerous than high cholesterol. In fact, there are many health professionals, including Dr. Mary Enig, a lipid expert, who have found through their research that high cholesterol is not a problem at all. Your cholesterol is WAY too low........that is what is causing your depression. Our brains are made up of over 50% cholesterol. Cholesterol is not our enemy. We would die without it. It is vital to many functions in our body. If you are taking a statin drug, consider discontinuing it. And please, please take cod liver oil each day. It must be liquid, not capsules, have some vitamin E in it to keep it from oxidizing, should not smell fishy or it has oxidized. I would recommend 2 T for the first 3 weeks because your cholesterol is too low and you are depressed.\n\n",

    "title": "PVC's",
    "content": "Hello Friend, As long as you do not have a pre-existing CHD (congenital heart disease- diagnosed in infancy),or current major heart defects and are able to function with your PVC's w/o undue hardships (shortness of breath, chest pain, profuse perspiration, etc..), you can assume that the premature ventricular contractions may be stress or anxiety related. This is actually quite common, it may feel as though your heart \"skipped a beat\". I'm sure you have had an EKG at some point and if any severe or incapacitating heart defect was detected, your dr. would have referred you to cardiologist. Main thing is, just be aware of what triggers the PVCs, make sure you \"take a breather\" if prolonged and feel dizzy or nauseated. sit and rest for a few minutes ( if severe and you feel faint,  lie down and elevate your legs and take slow deep breaths until help arrives)   If it is prolonged, any dizziness, or chest pain, go to the nearest clinic and nasal oxygen and possibly IV Lidocaine should remedy the situation.  Familiarize yourself with taking your pulse and if you feel the \"skip\" more than 6-8 in a minute, you should seek follow up care. In the meantime, kudos to you for attempting to function w/o the benzodiazepines (ativan, xanax, valium, etc..) as they have addicting qualities. Also, consider a Med-Alert bracelet if attacks are recurrent and emergency help has ever been required. LMK if you require additional info. Good luck and also, might want to decrease caffeine intake if more than 1 or 2 cups a day.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I don\u2019t want to downplay the pain you are having with your palpitations and the anxiety it\u2019s causing not to have it diagnosed. I would like to try to look at other possibilities while you wait for cardiac tests and give you other avenues to search down. I have given the below answer under your other post as well.  I hope you have found some relief since your posting and I hope all is going well for you.   If your cardiac tests came out well but you are still feeling the palpitations you may be possibly experiencing discomfort from a hiatal hernia or some other type of GASTRIC problem. As I was reading your post I see under #25 you state you have worse palpitations after large meals, you may be onto something there.   ATIVAN is in a class of drugs called BENZODIAZEPINES, and so is VALIUM.  Benzodiazepines affect the chemicals in the brain that may become unbalanced causing anxiety, nervousness and tension disorders.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Here are another couple of thoughts \u2013 first, can you wear contact lenses to relieve your face of glasses touching it? Secondly, has an aortic aneurysm been ruled out?  Have they checked you for an AORTIC ANEURYSM? This is caused from a weakness in the wall of the aorta where it comes off the heart, it can be from birth or caused from an injury.   Often the ECG results will read normal in an uncomplicated aortic aneurysm. The best tests to begin with for diagnosing would be a Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest.   The symptoms are light-headedness, weakness, shortness of breath, rapid heart beat, sweating, numbness or tingling in the arm, chest pain or pressure and loss of consciousness (fainting).\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I hope you have found some relief since your posting and I hope all is going well for you. ATIVAN is in a class of drugs called BENZODIAZEPINES, and so is VALIUM.  Benzodiazepines affect the chemicals in the brain that may become unbalanced causing anxiety, nervousness and tension disorders.   If you cardiac tests came out well but you are still feeling the palpitations you may be possibly experiencing discomfort from a hiatal hernia or some other type of GASTRIC problem. As I read your post I saw under #25 that you stated you have worse palpitations after large meals, you may be onto something there. I would encourage you to follow your feelings and have it checked out.\n\n",

    "title": "problems breathing?????",
    "content": "I am a 37 year old diagnosed with Menier's disease, GERD, history of Asthma in which I took medicine up until I was 12 years old.  I take Potassium, Water pill, Diazepam and Protonix all for Menier's except for the Protonix.  I was off the Protonix for 3 weeks in the beginning of May and got syptoms of GERD back and started taking again.  3 weeks into taking the Protonix I had the chest pressure, shortness of breath and lump feeling in throat which 90% of the time went away when I ate.  Called the doctor and was told to not stop taking the Protonix and take another form of o-t-c antacid in between.  The syptoms have been gone now for 2 weeks.  Recently I have noticed that I feel short of breath.  I am not wheezing but feel like I can't get enough air in at times.  This happens alot when I lay down at night for bed.  I sleep all night with no problems, wake up with no problems and it usually starts back up again intermittently throughout the day.  I don't have it constantly.  I just went for a walk and did not feel short of breath while walking but had that feeling that I needed to take a deep breath a couple of times after I sat down.  No chest pain or discomfort with any of this.  I was wondering if this could all of a sudden be my asthma acting up or is this something cardiac?  I have been told this is a symptom of GERD.   I do not like to take my inhaler unless I absolutely have to take it (wheezing) which I get when I am around animals I am allergic to, but I do avoid that).  The inhaler makes me shakey feeling and I get enough of that with my inner ear problem. The fluttering feeling in my throat has gone since back on the Protonix.  I had Holtor monitor 1 year ago this July, no problems.  Had EKG;s in the past - several for ER trips for dizziness, etc before being diagnosis with Menier's disease.  I was just looking for some advice as to what this could be?????? Could this still be the GERD bothing me and not fully back in control with the Protonix, Asthma??? I do suffer from anxiety and panic attacks and worry that there is something cardiac going on but my doctor says that GERD can give me all those symtpoms.  Please help???????\n\n",

    "title": "WPW syndrome",
    "content": "Hello,  People with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome are born with a normal pathway for these electrical pulses but also have an abnormal one too. If the impulses go down both pathways the heart is stimulated to pump irregularly and too often. When this happens people feel their heart racing and pounding having what are called palpitations.   It is possible to remove the abnormal pathway by burning it away and a heart specialist does this under anesthesia. Many people find that certain things trigger their palpitations such as caffeine, tiredness, or stress.  Ablation cures the WPW syndrome roughly 90 percent of the time. However, some patients have multiple accessory pathways. In these patients, one of the pathways may not be detected and ablated during the initial procedure and the arrhythmia may reoccur. When this happens, the ablation procedure is repeated, generally with very good results.  If you feel palpitations still I would recommend not consuming caffeine, alcohol or any other stimulant until you talk to your cardiologist. You may have another pathway you don\u2019t know about.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm 25 yrs old and recently was diagnosed with Supraventricular Tachacarda.  I have had heart palpitations most of my life.  I was on a holster monitor when I was in high school, but had no symptoms, so no action was taken at that time.  In September of this last year I was admitted into the emergency room with a heart beat of over 200 bpm, which I though at the time was an anxiety attack.  I was given a shot to lower my heart rate and was told I have SVT.  I was told at the time that there was nothing I could do to cause this to happen, it's just a disorder that can happen at any given time.  I'm still having palpitations periodically, but nothing that has lasted over a few seconds.  I've had EKGs and also had an Echocardiogram that came back normal.  I have a history of anxiety and have been to counsiling to aleviate stress related issues.  I'm worried that I may need to be on medication, but being my symptoms are infrequent (5-6 times a month), I'm being told that I need no sort of treatment.  I really don't want to be on medication for the rest of my life for this, but it's a scary thing, and it's causing me to have anxiety as I have no idea when or where I may have these \"attacks\".  Please help.\n\n",

I used to smoke, but recently quite about a week ago.. I am over weight and do need to loose weight. I went to the about 2 weeks ago to get put back on my paxil and get more thyroid meds and my blood pressure was 120/93,  then went to my gyn for my yearly pap and my BP was 140/100.. went back a week later to get the results and it was 140/95.. Ok so here is my problem.. and i told this to my dr also it didnt seem to bother him.. Anyway, i have this constint discomfort in my chest, it don't hurt nor don't hurt when i breath, when i jump on the trampolie with the kids it seems to go away, then comes back after i relax.. i notice alot that my whole upper body is always tense like if i think about it and take a deep breath and relax i feel better, but notice it tenses right back up.. Also notice lately that i seem to grind my teeth alot.. I do once in a while feel my heart thump or flutter, its kind of hard to explain.. I feel like sometimes i need to reach in my chest and scratch my heart and it will feel better...lol...But what concerns me is the chest discomfort sometimes its in the left side above my breast sometimes it feels like its at the bottom of my throat, sometimes in my back, but for like 3 days sometimes more sometimes less, sometimes i go a few days with nothing.. i notice it more when im ready to get my period also..I worry constantly, like everyday that its my heart and im gonna die.. Im really scared.. about 8 months ago i had an EKG done and it came back fine, all my blood tests have come back fine, my hemoglobin levels were off, but the dr said its because i was smoking at the time and to quit..So i have quit.. I guess all i want is to feel normal, and get rid of this discomfort, stiffness, whatever it is.. I don't like it and tired of feeling this, i have felt this for about 2 years, and all the dr's ignore it, what is it and what can i do.. Please help!!!!\n\n",

    "content": "Your problems are stress/anxiety related, including the palpitations.  Chest pain and palps are common in anxious, tense people.  The Paxil is obviously not getting it, you do need to talk to a good psychiatrist, because they are specialists in this area, and no two people are alike in their symptoms and response to medications.  Too often the family doctor just throws whatever antidepressant and considers it good, when the fact is it rarely does as good a job as needs to be done.  Many times patients need a couple of meds that work together.  Paxil and SSRIs are not for anxiety; they are antidepressants.  Psychiatrists know many other meds (non narcotic, some of them) that work well with the antidepressants.  It's a trial and error, but you would go to a specialist if you had a real heart problem, wouldn't you?  Seeing a psychiatrist does not mean you are crazy.  Everyone needs help at some point.  Welbutrin is an antidepresant that helps curb the withdrawls and cravings when you quit smoking, and doesn't have the sexual side effects that SSRIs do.  Just a little example of what can be done, once you get those problems under control, your physical symptoms will improve dramatically if not disappear.  Natural tips:  Sleep at least 8 hours per night (make time!), no coffee, tea, tobacco, sodas or alcohol, avoid sugar, get regular excercise, eat well, don't let yourself get too hungry.  All these things will help your anxiety and lessen your physical complaints.  It's important to MAKE time to take care of yourself.  You will be a better wife/mother if you are relaxed and don't have these problems worrying you.\n\n",

    "content": "I was just wondering if I could get some input on this:  Over the last few months I have been getting frequent headaches, and until now I have been attributing them to the fact that I am 'supposed' to wear glasses but I don't usually wear them when I go out.  However a recent trip to the base hospital has made me rethink what may be causing them.  Last week, I caught some kind of stomach bug and went to the base hospital to get checked out (and sent home), and they always triage everyone who shows up for sick parade.  When they took my BP it was 156/98 so they took it again to double check.  The second reading was 183/112!! Also, my heart rate was 140 resting. I also could feel my heart pounding in my chest (It was not irregular...they asked me).  Since I was sick, they told me that being dehydrated can cause these things to happen.... (I read on the net after that dehydration causes low BP not high) Anyway, they hooked me up for IV fluids, which did make me feel somewhat better.  My BP did return to close to normal, and my heart rate, though still high was dropping back as well. I should mention they also did an ecg and it was normal.  It's been a few days now, and I am over the stomach bug, though I am still getting pretty bad headaches.  I am starting to wonder if I have a problem with high BP and if that could cause the headaches.  And also, I've noticed the last few weeks I have had a dull pain on my chest below my left shoulder.  It does not get worse with use and also does not dissapear with no use.  It's just kind of 'there'  It comes and goes.  It does kind of feel like muscle pain though... I am wondering if this could be related though.    I am a female... only 30 years old, I didn't think I was old enough to be susecptible to high BP yet, though it does run in my family.  Also, a few years back, I was taking ephedrine (before it was found to be dangerous)  I am concerned now that maybe I did some damage, or that somehow it could cause high BP.  (I am scared to mention this to the base doc because any 'self inflicted' injuries etc are considered a 'chargable offense' in the military)  I am not so confident in what the military doctor told me (especially when I read that being dehydrated causes low BP... not high) and every time we go to the base hosp, we get whoever is available... I most concerned with the fact that they did not tell me to come back to get the BP checked again since it was so high.    Was just wondering if someone could give me some input....  Thanks  Syn\n\n",

Do you think it could have been something caused by taking ephedra products on a regular basis (not continually, but often... during a several month period before they were found to be dangerous)?? I've read that Mitral Valve Prolapse can be caused by ephedrine use.  Would MVP have shown up on an ecg?\n\n",

    "content": "To: Doctor  Posted: Tue Jun 07, 2005 5:28 am  Subject: PSVT - Could there be more going on? Please help!   Hello,   I am a 35 year old female, moderately active, not obese, in generally healthy condition. I do not have any heart disease in the immediate family (though I do on my father's side distant family - all of my grandfather's brothers, seven of them, died from 'heart attacks' before the age of 50, including my grandfather. My father is in his late sixties - no sign of heart disease.) In March, I went to the ER with a heart rate over 250, and came home with the diagnosis of PSVT. I am on Cartia - but I still have a horrible time sleeping, as this is when my heart has raced in the past (only once has this happened before my first trip to the ER). All bloodwork normal - thyroid normal - cholesterol normal - Echocardiogram normal. . . I can sleep about four nights a week now, which is real progress. Though my heart hasn't sped up since that evening, it still feels funny, and beats sometimes hard. My Cardiologist has somewhat written this off, as my heart has not sped up since I've been on medication, but it still bothers me, as my heart wakes me up during the night thumping hard - as it has tonight. Tonight on top of the occasional thumping (it is not steady - kind of comes and goes), I feel like I have heartburn - not horrible, just enough to bother me. I had a bowl of fiber cereal for dinner - with soymilk - about two hours before I felt like I might have a little heartburn.   Also, just last month, I had a gallbladder attack - never had any problems in the past - they had suspected stones, thought they saw stones on the ultrasound, but turns out I had a 'diseased gallbladder' - the plyps were so large, they appeared to be stones on the ultrasound. I am not a fan of fried foods - though two Dr's and one nurse asked me what fried foods I had had for dinner (none).   I am emotionally trying to hold it together, not wanting to add any other medication to the Cartia 240 (which is all I'm taking), but I am wondering if there is a medication for anxiety that works well with Cartia? The last thing I want to do is add something else, but I am beginning to wonder - as a mother of three kids - would it be better to take something, or continue to be sleepy and stressed when they are awake?   Also, I feel like maybe there is a piece of the puzzle missing - could the PSVT and the gallbladder ordeal be related?   Could there be more going on than what I am being treated for? Or maybe something I should be tested for? Is there another specialist you would recommend?   Thank you for your time,   Noelle\n\n",

It usually only happens when I quickly bend over, e.g. taking a shower and bending over to wash my feet. I usually have them a couple of time a week. Sometimes I won't have it for over a month.   I have had this problem for years, and I have found over time that when I lay down on my back the heartbeat returns to normal usually instantly. This usually stops it everytime. If it doesn't stop it, then the episode lasts for a few minutes sometimes more.   I haven't really ever felt faint from it, and when I have I just related it to anxiety from having the episode.   I am in my late 20's and noticed this problem when I was around 19 or 20. I am in good shape and exercise regularly. I am wondering if it is imperative I see someone or should I continue the way I have.

    "content": "Hi I was diagnosed with diabetes about 5 months ago when I started loosing my vision,having extreme thirst and hunger ect... of course they thought that i had been diabetic for some time before I was diagnosed. When they checked my sugar at the ER it was over 500!  Well  at first i was on Glucophage (850 mg) 3 times a day  and Novalin R on a sliding scale when needed before meals and 10 units of lantus every day to try to control this.  Within two months I had it under control with diet alone I quit taking any of the above and kept a sugar level of around 120-130. Good right? Well I was not working then. I got a new job about three weeks ago very physcal and since I am over wieght  I thought it would do me good. I walk about 10 miles a day in this factory, at first my legs and feet hurt and I knew that anybodys would , I got past that. Now I am getting Dizzy spells pretty often and my sugar went  down to 75 . So i then went and started using regular sugar again I thought with my activity it would even out now I just cant get a steady level. My levels are going crazy from 70 on up to 300 again.  My questions are: What is too low of a sugar level? And is it dangerous for my levels to go up and down like that with in a few hours? Is there something else I can do?\n\n",

    "content": "Yes it is dangerous.  Firstly, do NOT use sugar as a way of regulating blood sugar!!!!!  Sugar causes HUGE spikes in blood sugar and repeats the process.  Keep orange juice in a can handy for the drops, and have a bit of cheese, nuts or some kind of protein with it, because even juice is sugar, but natural sugar which is good for you, but in diabetics can cause another drop if you don't get some protein and eat your snacks every 3-4 hours.  It is also important to test your sugar 4 times throughout the day, at least until you get it under control, then you can go to 2-3 times.  Stress and prolonged physical activity ( I am not saying sit around more!!) lower blood sugar.  Get back on the Glucophage and make it a point, no, a strict routine of eating some protein and a SMALL carb, like half a slice of whole wheat bread with a good amount of peanut butter (all natural, no sugar added).  Or 3/4 cup of cottage cheese and 5-6 Triscuit crackers they are also whole wheat and good for you.  Learn what foods are protein like any meat, fish, poultry, etc., nuts and dairy.  \"Good\" carbs are WHOLE wheat bread (not just wheat), oatmeal is the best and whole grain cereals. It is very important that you learn how to control it, even with outside stressors.\n\n",

I take Tylenol to dull the pain, but doesnt take it away, just makes it almost tolerable. i have been using a heating pad which helps a little as well. My dr doesnt know whats wrong with me. I am at a loss. I do take protonix for my stomach and that has reduced the pain very little. I don't know if it has anything to do with my stomach.  Could you help me? maybe lead me into the right direction of what this possibly could be.   Thanks, Tammy L\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Tammy,  Thank you very much for using our website.  i don't think that this pain could be of heart origin because of its location and characteristics.  The pain that you are having might very well be related to the hiatal hernia that you have. The best thing to do is to have a barium x-ray on your stomach to see if you ahve reflux and if yes how severe. You can also discuss with your doctor about being referred to a gasteroenterologist to have something called a ph measurement of the lower end of the esophagus done to see how low does the ph of your esophagus go if you have severe reflux and whether treatment makes any difference (since you are already on protonix.  Another possibility is that the reason your gall bladder was removed originally was this pain and since many people have gall stones (the reason for removal of most of gall bladders), the symptoms are attributed to the gall stones and the gall bladder is removed and after the gall bladder is removed, symptoms persist. A condition sometimes referred to as post-cholecystectomy syndrome.  There are quite a few organs in the right side of the body. i am not sure whether the pain is high in the chest or rather towards your abdomen. If it rather towards your abdomen then there are lots of possibilities for the pain, starting from the skin on the outside till the internal organs including lung, liver, kidney and colon.  Another possibility is that you might be having the pre-rash phase of shingles. Against that though is the fact that the pain is usually continuous and localized to a specific area of the skin supplied by one nerve from the back to the front of the chest.  Once more, thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "title": "PSVT",
    "content": "(I am a healthy 25 year old woman.)  Three months ago I ended up in the emergency room with a heart rate of 200bpm.  My heart had been racing for about 5 hours and I decided to go to the ER.  After 4 hours in the ER, they got me down to 120 bpm.  Long story short, after an EKG, blood tests, echocardiogram, etc... they diagnosed me with PSVT.  I spent a week in the hospital stablizing and getting adjsuted to my new meds.  I only had one episode prior to my hospital visit of an elevated heart rate.  It went away after a half hour.  After that first episode, I called my gynocologist and told her what happened.  I had been put on a new birth control, Yasmin two weeks prior to the attack.  The gyno saw no corrolation and told me it wasn't related.  After being in the hospital, I shared my question with the doctors about possibly the Yasmin causing my PSVT.  They were doubtful but didn't say no.  They said I could go off the Yasmin if I was worried.  So, I did.  I was put back on another birth control with no problem (and now my gyno is worried to change the pill around because my hospital visit).  After talking to my pharmicist (a personal friend), she informed me that there is a diuretic in the Yasmin.  She said that diuretics can upset postassium levels, leading to heart problems.  She said that she wouldn't doubt that the Yasmin caused my palpitations.  I am now on Cardizem CD (360mg. once a day) and Lopressory  (50mg. twice a day).  I had one attack since the hospital and it was the week I was let out and they day I had a wisdom tooth pulled (it happened 5 min. after taking Codine which I later found out is filled with caffine).  I'm on slim to no caffine and my heart rate is now barely 60 while resting.  I have had no heart problems recently.  After this epic story, I want to know if it could have been the Yasmin that caused my heart problems.  I want to know if it's possible that the problem is gone for good.  My cardiologist said that maybe after 2 years of no attack, we can discuss changing my medication.  I don't mind the medication (especially if it keeps me from attacks) but I'm rather young to be on so many meds.  I just wanted to hear opinions on this.  Thanks.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: psvt",
    "content": "Dear lucidity03,  Yasmin does not have a diuretic in its listed active ingredients.  One of its side effects though is high potassium which in very rare cases can cause psvt but low potassium is the condition that is very notorious for causing it.  Most probably, yasmin was not the cause of the psvt that you had.  Since you stayed in the hospital for a week, i would assume that you were tested for lots of things to make sure that the psvt was not caused by any of them.  Being young and healthy otherwise makes it difficult sometimes for some people to take medications on chronic basis for an unknwon periods of times.  Stay away from all the things that can stimulate your heart like caffeinated beverages, alcohol, smoking, working long hours without rest and not getting enough sleep.  i can not answer the question of whether or not and when you should go off of your medications. There is another alternative of course is that you see a cardiologist specialized in arrhythmias called an electrophysiologist unless your cardiologist is already an electrophysiologist.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped and if you still have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to post them.

    "content": "Thank you for the response.  They ran countless tests, but did not inform me of what may be or may not be causing the problem.  I do know it's not my thyroid, and they didn't alarm me to anything else.  One thing that was very frustrating at the hospital (and in my follow-up appointments) was that no one explained anything to me.  I just had to lay there, get tests done, and go home when they gave the ok.  The nurse is the one who explained PSVT to me (and I thank her for that!)  So, it's very frustrating trying to sort out everything that happened and know how to get better (or, rather, stay better).  I don't mind being on the medication if it's helping.  But, if it was the Yasmin, I'm on all this medicine for no reason at this point.  But, I guess it's better safe than sorry.  I do not drink caffinated beverages, I don't smoke, and I don't drink.  BUT... I cut way back on the chocolate (because it has caffiene).  However, I do occasionally indulge in the rare chocolate treat.  Do you happen to know how much caffiene is in chocolate?  I would assume it's not nearly as bad as coffee?  (I did get the ok from the cardiologist's nurse to allow myself to indluge once in awhile.)\n\n",

    "content": "Dear lucidity03,   Thank you very much for the update.  i don't think that yasmin was the culprit behind your psvt.  Arrhythmias might be a one time thing and you might never have a problem with them after this one time whether or not you are taking medications.  If you don't have any problem taking the medications, i would recommend that you follow your doctor's advice and continue to take them. The problem with medications is side effects and as i said sometimes, it is hard on some people to take them if they don't know for how long.   If you start having side effects or you have recurrent arrhythmias while on the medication, i would recommend going to an electrophysiologist (cardiologist specialized in arrhythmias) to have a test known as an electrophysiological study or for adjustment of medication.

    "title": "PSVT and now Gallbladder",
    "content": "Hello Dr,  I read a post where you answered one lady who had PSVT and had been on Yasmin birth control.  I am (or was?) a healthy 35 year old woman, who had not been on birth control pills for over 6 years.  After a visit to the Obgyn, she thought that Yasmin would be good for my adult onset acne and heavy periods.  I took yasmin for three months - it cleared up the acne, but when I had my heart racing and skipping (over 250 beats per min), diagnosed with PSVT, I quit taking the yasmin, thinking there might be a connection.  I have never had any kind of heart problem in the past.  All other tests given during and after event were in 'normal' range. . . no explaination for the racing and skipping, nothing unusual in the echocardiogram at the cardiologist, no immediate family heart problem history.  I have been on cartia for the last couple of months, and have not had my heart go out of control on me since.  I have also, about three weeks ago - out of the blue, had a gallbladder attack.  Since my new heart condition, I have been horribly careful with my diet - and have never really enjoyed fried food.  (The surgeon and Dr in the ER kept asking what fried foods I had been eating.) The polyps on the ultrasound looked like 'multiple stones', and so out came my gallbladder - about a week and a half ago now.  The Surgeon called it a \"diseased gallbladder\" and said it would have had to have come out even if they had known what the ultrasound was showing was polyps instead of stones.  Again, totally caught by surprise, no family history of gallbladder problem, no previous attacks.  My question is this:  If these two things are linked to something else besides a side effect to this specific medication - Yasmin, what could it be?  I feel like my cardiologist is taking care of my heart, my surgeon is taking care of my gallbladder. . . but could I be missing something else in the big picture?  If so, do you know where else I can turn to get some answers?  I am now anxious a lot - especially at night - and am fighting the constant question in my head - \"What could be next\"?  Thank you in advance for your time and answer,  Noelle\n\n",

I've talked to my doctor about it, but wanted a second opinion, so I'm trying this out.  The pains I have are usually under my left pectoralis, and are quic, sometimes throbbing. Lately it's extended to general discomfort in my entire chest and feel more like tightness. These have been going on for about two months. The weird thing about these pains, is that they don't appear during physical activity (heavy running etc), it doesn't hurt to breathe, and it doesn't come because of one certain thing; it seems kind of random.  I don't think that it is cardiovascular or lung related, but Im not sure. It could be heartburn, but would that cause a feeling of tightness and pain so far away from the esophagus, and long after (or before) I've eaten? Like I said, I did see my doctor about this and he wasn't sure what it could be. I got blood work done and two chest x-rays, though the results havent gotten back from the lab (just got that done four days ago). I've also read that chest pains can come along with panic attacks, and I have gotten uneasy anxious feelings, but always the chest pain comes first and then I start to worry about it. So what causes these pains?[/i]\n\n",

    "content": "I figure I should update since I got my results back.  Both chest X-rays (front and side) came up negative, nothing wrong there.  The bloodwork came  back and said that my cholesterol was too high. I already knew this from bloodwork last year, and I know that I'm genetically predisposed to my liver making too much lipoprotein a. My dad has the same thing, and my grandfather had a quadruple bypass 18 years ago. So anyways, my lipoprotein a levels are really high, 111 mg/dL, and the \"healthy\" level is under 30 mg/dL. I don't know what my other levels are, but my doctor wrote that all my other LDL levels were to goal, and that there weren't any studies that would help reduce my lp(a) levels. I know that my dad taks Niaspan to lower his levels, and I did take it for a couple months two years ago (when I had the same doctor as my father), but quit taking it after my mom protested and I switched doctors.  So I guess now I have three questions:  1. Still wondering on the chest pains. I'm almost certain that they're muscular, but I'm not a doctor.  2. Was wondering how much lp(a) makes up of your LDL (like how many more LDL types are there that make up the whole, I want to know how bad just having my lp(a) this high is)  3. Is Niaspan healthy for people under 21 (I'm 18 in a month)? I've read that it hasn't been tested in my age range. Also, I've heard it isn't good for people with weakened livers. Would it be very bad to drink (alcohol) while taking it? I know that I'm underaged, but since I'm going into college the pressure will be there to drink, and I want to know for sure so I don't end up saying \"Eh, It probably doesn't matter\". If I can't/shouldn't take Niaspan are there any alternatives?\n\n",

    "content": "A friend of a friend of mine claims to have recently been involved in an accident in which she was riding a crotch rocket and was then hit by a car, knocking her into a tree.  She was then rushed to hospital and was said to be in bad shape... later, in an update we received, she had gone into Cardiac Arrest.  Moments later, she was said to be fine and today she's already supposedly up and about and is going to be coming home tomorrow.  The accident took place yesterday.  This is not a person I see regularily, nor does my friend, but we feel like we may be being lied to.  Can a person phycailly be fit to go home after being launched off a crotch rocket, into a tree, then go into Cardiac Arrest ... all within two days?  Is this possible?  I figured there'd be a process involved after something like cardiac arrest... tests, monitoring their condition, etc.  Any answers would be much appreciated.  thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Cardiac arrest that occurs secondary to trauma has a very low resuscitation rate; somewhere in the neighbor hood of less than 5% chance of survival but depending on the injures, the patients pre-existing health, time to surgery, etc it is possible to survive.    Just to clarify a \u2018cardiac arrest\u2019 is when you have no vital signs (pulse, blood pressure, etc) - your heart is not moving any blood, your lungs are not moving any air, etc.  Is it possible to be well enough to be discharged home two days a traumatic arrest?  No.  \u201cMoments\u201d after a cardiac arrest of any cause no one is ever fine \u2013 they just died!    There is either an intentional (although I fail to see why she would lie) or unintentional breakdown in communication somewhere.  Perhaps someone mistook a loss of consciousness for a cardiac arrest?  (Even then I would suspect she would be kept for more than two days).  A lot of people think if you have chest pain it is a heart attack when in reality it may have been only a pulled muscle \u2013 people make assumptions, jump to conclusions, stretch the truth, etc all the time.  After an accident like that CT scans (CAT scans), MRI\u2019s, X-rays, surgery, lots of physio, and so on are the norm.     Hope this helps\n\n",

    "content": "Recently I have had a pain in my neck where you would normally take a pulse.  This has lasted for 2-3 days without getting better and slightly worse.  It is sore to the touch and hurts when I look up or to the right.  The pain also increases when I bend over or strain in some fashion.  The pain is on the right side of my neck.  It doesn't feel abnormally swollen and does not hurt to swallow but the pain is still there nonetheless.  My question is what could be causing this and should I be greatly concerned?  Thank you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Neck pain where pulse is",
    "content": "Dear rew1970,  The possibilities of such a pain are: 1. Musculoskeletal pain. 2. Pain caused by a herniated disc especially that it increases with straining. i am not sure exactly which area of the neck you are referring to when you say where we take a pulse, but, if it fairly high in the neck (near to the mandible) and localized to one spot, this is the distribution of the second cervical vertebra. If it is low in the neck and still is localized to one area, most probably this pain is not related to disc disease. 3. Eventhough you say that there is no swelling, the muscles of the neck can sometime hide a mildly swollen mass, such as a small abscess. 4. Pain originating from the thyroid gland secondary to its inflammation. 5. A small lymph node. 6. Referred pain from somewhere else like a bad tooth.  At any rate, this pain has been there for 3 days and is getting worse, so, i would recommend that you call your doctor to be seen.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

The increase in my heart rate started about three years ago and has been an off and on problem. Lately, within the past 6 months, my heart has been beating like crazy all the time. When I go to sleep at night and wake up in the morning it is pounding. I can't even sit down to watch TV with out my heart going crazy. I don't know if it is stress or what, but I will do anything to help it stop. My diet is normal and I excercise regularly. I am not a smoker or drinker. I am only 17. Im too young for this. I have tried everything to stop it but nothing ever works. There are few moments of relaxation in my life because everytime I sit to unwind the pounding continues. It feels like a strong push of blood from my upper chest to my lower stomach. At night I can even feel the blood pulsating in my left leg. About a month ago, my left arm began to ache and I am begining to be worried about my situation. Is there any hope for me out there?\n\n",

    "content": "Michael,  I have the same problem as yourself and have been experiencing it for roughly for 6 months, I have had most cardio related tests that can be carried out in order to try and find the problem, every test I have has come back fine. The symptoms you are describing are exactly what I experience, although I have also have chest pain and am often short of breath. I am older than you at the age of 21 but I don't think it is an age related problem, i am still going through the problem although i have been prescribed some pretty powerfull pain killers to combat the chest pain. I often get the sensation of extreme pulse in my legs and arms, also pins and needles in my lower arms.   I am a financial advisor and the job i do is reasonably stressful which dosent help my situation, my advice to you would be to try and relax properly, because even though you amy think you are resting you are probably not shutting down the most powerful tool of the body, the brain. Just because your body is relaxed it dosent mean you have let your brain rest. so you may be dwelling on the fact you have a fast heart rate, which in turn would make you hyper aware, which would make you more consious of your pulse and the rate at which your heart is beating. Please try and take some comfort in knowing that it is more than likly nothing serious and is probably something that will go away in time. If you are still worried and it is playing on your mind, consult you GP and see what advice he/she amy be able to offer. They may put you through some tests which may help to shed some light on what is causing your feeling of a fast heart rate.  I hope this has been some help to you. Please feel free to reply.  Regards  Sean\n\n",

I have a follow up question: Since posting my question I have done a bit of research regarding the jugular vein and in fact discovered that that is what I have been feeling. I am very worried, however, because I can feel my jugular pulse is very pronounced when I am lying down (I can feel it very distinctly when I am taking my \"regular\" pulse, and it also becomes more palpable and pronounced when I inhale. I have read about \"kussmaul sign\" and am very concerned that that is what I am feeling.   I have been dizzy for a few weeks and have for the past couple of days have been having difficulty breathing. I have been to a number of doctors, none of whom have found anything wrong (haven't been to cardiologist yet) and I have had normal blood tests (no anemia). I am a generally healthy 32 year old woman (except for asthma), but I started taking prednisone yesterday because of the breathing difficulty - I thought it might be asthma, but it does not seem to be responding to the medicine.   I am very very worried, and would appreciate your help!  If my jugular pulse is much more palpable during inhalation and is felt together with my regular pulse, is that a sign of heart disease?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi my name is David I am 22 male from Houston, Texas.  Since March 13th I have had many wierd symptoms. I can give a good timeline of how things progressed.  March 13th - After eating dinner I experience a painfull tightness in my chest just left of the center of my chest under my breast whenever I took in a deep breath.  March 14th-16th - The tightness/pain in my chest seemed to come and go. It was not always in the same spot. It was sometimes on the center/left of my chest, sometimes on the lower right almost into my abdomen. Occasionaly my left ear would ache and be so sensative to the touch it was extremly painful to touch it or rub it at all.  March 17th - I go to the emergency room because while sitting in a chair I found myself taking very deep breath's and the uncomfortable tightness/pain in my chest came back. I went thru Blood Pressure Test, EKG, A X-Ray of my chest from 3 different angles and a oxygen level test. Nothing abnormal returned and the doctor subscribed me some motorin IB and vicoden and sent me home saying it could be inflamation.  March 17th- April 10th - The symptoms remain the same nothing extremly painful though.  April 11-13th - Along with the normal pains and discomfort ive been feeling for the last 3 weeks suddenly while sitting at my office desk a pain shoots thru my armpit down to my wrist on my Right side. Its extremly uncomforttable but only lasts a minute. The next day a simular pain shoots down my left arm and this continues to happen on and off. Also at one point a sudden pain shot up to my head and was extremly intense but went away in under 30 seconds.  Im worried and I will be making another trip to the doctor tommrow but does anyone have any idea what could be going on? Any help, advice or tips would be greatly appreciated. thank you.

    "content": "History: Pleurodynia is characterized by an acute onset of chest pain. Attacks of intense, excruciating pain typically last for seconds to a minute and occur in episodes separated by minutes to hours. If the attacks are severe, the patients may complain of difficulty breathing. The thoracic pain is usually over the lower ribs, laterally, but they can also occur over the front, back, or substernal areas. Between attacks, patients usually have persistent, dull pleuritic chest pain. The attacks usually last for 3-5 days, rarely for more than a month, and a patient may experience phases of remission and exacerbation.  Associated symptoms related to the viral infection may include the following: Upper respiratory tract symptoms, including sore throat, rhinitis, and dry cough Constitutional symptoms, including headaches (50%), fever, and malaise GI symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea (50%), and in children, abdominal pain (usually in the epigastric area) Testicular pain (ie, orchitis) in 10% of males  This might be it\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Jessye25,  You are the smartest person amongst your friends!! What they are doing is shutting off the oxygen to their brain and building pressure up in the blood vessels inside the skull.   Our brains fit perfectly inside our skull, it doesn\u2019t have any room to swell up from increased pressure caused from blood. THEY COULD DIE FROM THIS OR BECOME CRIPPLED FOR LIFE!   Please tell your friends this - Blood brings oxygen to your brain which it needs to stay alive. Brain cells are extremely sensitive to oxygen and can become permanently damaged or die from the lack of it. The other thing you can do is cause a blood clot to form and you will have a stroke, the kind you see elderly people with when they don\u2019t have control over half of their body. Their mouth droops, they can\u2019t close one eye and they can\u2019t move their arm and leg. This can be a permanent thing, something you may have to live with for the rest of your life. WORSE YET, you could DIE from causing your brain to start bleeding because of pressure build-up! Brain injuries are VERY SERIOUS; people die from them every single day. It can cause a severe headaches, numbness or weakness in your face, paralysis on one whole side of your body, loss of your ability to speak, sudden confusion, trouble understanding, trouble seeing in one or both eyes, trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination, seizures, loss of bladder and bowels, unconsciousness, coma, stroke, bleeding within your brain, and death. Please tell your friends not to do this, it seems fun but your brain is a very delicate organ and it can\u2019t handle being without oxygen.\n\n",

I just want to tell you, it's not an eating disorder rather than something called phsycosomatic manifestation....it's a way to run away from facing reality when you are depressed...some people sleep alot...some people eat alot...some people drink,etc.  It's a wrong way to face our problems. What has happened to you is in the past now. You seem very lovely ,now you have a wonderful partner as you say and a very cute son... If you don't work...find your self a job...even a temporary job not a permenant one... you will mingle with people... and your mind will be focused on other stuff than food.  try to exercise from time to time... it's excellent when you are depressed or feeling down... and you will keep fit....  when you eat ...try to eat healthy food...there is this \"weightwatcher\"\" products in Teso and all big supermarkets...they serve very delicious dessert with low calories whenever you feel like eating something sweet.  learn to saw/ tailor, to make Halloween costumes for your son....there are million things to do...always be occupied...you'll feel different...confident and that will change the way you feel about life...keep intouch with your father.

It started when I was 19, and I'm now 27. There have been a couple of years during that time when I successfully quit purging, but I always returned to bulimia again. I have recently stopped all bulimic behaviors because I learned about the Terri Schaivo case and that her brain damage was caused when the effects of an eating disorder stopped her heart. I know that I will never do this again.    Several of my teeth are partially dissolved now, and I've been having pains in the left side of my chest very frequently for a long time.      Do you think it is likely that I have damaged my heart, and if so, is there anything that can be done to help the situation, such as medication?     I know that I must see a doctor, but I'm afraid that the doctor will be disgusted and not help because I did this to myself.\n\n",

    "content": "I know you don't need the lecture and you don't deserve it, I put this information in here for the person who may not realize what they are doing to their body. You, on the other hand have realized the danger you have put yourself in. GOOD DOCTOR'S DON'T TREAT YOU LIKE YOU'RE STUPID!! A good Doctor will work with you and make sure everything is working as well as possible. You may need to be put on supplements, go get bloodwork done, a check-up and whatever else is recommended. Now, here's the lecture...  Not only does our body need vitamins to build and repair itself, it needs minerals. Minerals are used in the body not as source of food but rather as an aid to other body nutrients. They increase the ability of a nutrient to function and strengthen its effectiveness.   With the decrease in food and energy from food, a fluid electrolyte disorder called hyponatremia develops where there is not enough sodium in the body. Made worse by laxatives (diuretics) and excessive sweating through the compulsive exercise, low sodium levels trigger the adrenal cortex to release aldosterone, targeting the kidney tubules. When stimulated, the kidneys raise the absorption rate of Na+ (sodium) in the proximal convoluted tubules and the loops of Henle in the kidneys. It is important to understand that while the sodium content of the body may change, its concentration in the extracellular fluid remains stabile because of adjustments in water volume. Hyponatremia, when not corrected, causes a neurologic dysfunction due to brain swelling, systemic edemia, decreased water loss which leads to decreased blood pressure and volume, as well as cardiac arrhythmia and circulatory shock. Physical signs of this electrolyte disorder are headaches, muscle cramps, thirst, lethargy, and weakness. Relating very closely to sodium's role in the body is that of potassium.   \"Potassium, the chief intracellular cation, is required for normal neuromuscular functioning, as well as for several essential metabolic activities, including protein synthesis.\" Although potassium can be toxic at high levels, eating disorders cause the level of potassium to fall dramatically lower than normal causing the same drastic effects. A deficit of potassium can cause hyperpolarization and nonresponsiveness of the neurons controlling our body, a condition called hypokalemia. The heart, being the most sensitive to K+(potassium), may develop cardiac arrhythmia and possible arrest also. Muscular weaknesses, alkalosis of the blood, and hypovenilation may accompany low levels of potassium.   The effects of hyponatremia and hypokalemia may not be prevalent at the onset of an eating disorder and may not even show up for quite some time due to the low levels of other chemicals that hinder, compensate, or account for the difference. For example, not enough magnesium (hypomagnesemia) can cause tremors and increase neuromuscular excitability. .   Other than all of that, here are a FEW things you can expect from excessive vomiting:  Damaged teeth (Acid from stomach may cause tooth damage)   Throat Irritation (The throat has no protection against acid and may lead to permanent scaring)   Esophageal Damage   Swollen Salivary Glands   Broken Blood Vessel in your face, eyes, nose, brain (Vomiting puts strains on your facial muscles resulting in broken vessels from excessive vomiting)   Cracked damaged Lips (also a result of acid from the stomach)   Rectal Bleeding (Excessive laxative use leads to damage of the large intestines)   Heart damage (When you vomit excessively you put excess strain on your heart, which may lead to permanent damage)   Dehydration (excessive vomiting results in fluid loss)   and, lets not forget DEATH\n\n",

Seen my doc and he says this is a very good b.p. reading, but has recommended I see my heart specialist again (app.in May) because of the chest pains, but I am wondering if this very low b.p. is a sign of something else wrong with my heart. Many thanks for any advice/help.\n\n",

    "content": "Helena First, it\u2019s good to hear that are watching your BP especially with you having a cardiac history.  However, and this is very common so you\u2019re not alone, no one\u2019s BP fluctuates and will never always be 120/80 (or whatever).  If you do get the exact same reading when you check it, even twice right in a row, it basically, is a coincidence.  Many variables can affect you BP, your position, activity level, how many coffees, or cigarettes you had that day (which, for you, is none right?).  My guess is that you have had a heart attack in the past or myocardial infarction (\u2018myo\u2019 means muscle, \u2018cardial\u2019 means heart and \u2018infarction\u2019 means death of tissue \u2013 a heart attack), and now have stable angina.  Stable angina is chest pains that occurs at fairly predictable times i.e. walking up stairs, and is a brief decrease of oxygenated blood flow to the heart muscle which gives you the signs and symptoms associated with \u201cheart problems\u201d i.e. chest pains, etc.  To answer your question, I think your MD is reacting appropriately given your history.  Is there something else wrong with your heart \u2013 that\u2019s a tough question to answer in this forum, but it sounds as if everything you describe is related to ischemic heart disease and it sounds like your BP is fine right now.  Keep taking care of yourself that way you are!\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you so much Kylie for all this information. I have not had a \"heart attack\" as far as I am aware? But a month ago, I did get some very strong pain in the middle of my chest which lasted on and off for around half hour and then again the next day, but touch wood it hasn't come back. I really ought to take my tablets or spray when I get my main chest aches (which happen every morning when on my bike if I've started going uphill), but because I haven't had to take these for 9 yrs. now I am almost frightened to use the spray or pills in case something happens and I'm stuck in the middle of nowhere on my bike with two big dogs! Does very low b.p. like this ralate to a damaged heart then please? I only had angioplasty done on my left heart artery with no stent as it was too small to fit one, but was told my heart was ok by my original doctor when he listened to it. These pains are now different than those experiences 9 yrs. ago as they seem to radiate into my back, but once I stop and wait a couple of minutes they completely disappear and I can carry on without any pains at all. Hopefully my heart specialist will sort me out when I see him in May (now got my appointment) and hopefully put me on the treadmill again which is linked to a big machine and they can see exactly what may be wrong. Took my b.p. this week again and it was 114/54. I just don't like that low figure of 54 all the time, and it's worrying me I could have heart failure. I suppose I've been reading too much on he web about it, but I can do so much during my day, especially riding a bike, as I don't think I would be able to do that if I had heart failure! Lol! Thanks very much indeed for your input. Helen\n\n",

    "content": "Helena, I\u2019m only to glad to help.  Three things stood out to me in your last post.   The first is that you ride your bike every morning \u2013 that\u2019s excellent (and I bet the two big dogs are an exercise program all their own!). The second is that you get \u201cchest aches\u201d every morning when ever you\u2019re going up hill.  I\u2019ll come back to this one in a moment. The third is that you think it\u2019s a possibility that you\u2019ve been reading too much on the internet.  The internet is a truly wonderful tool; however, it should never replace your physician.  The credibility and accuracy of information on the internet can not always be guaranteed.   Now back to your \u201cchest aches\u201d.  When you\u2019re riding your bike up a hill, the muscles in your legs are forced to work harder, so your heart must work harder (pump faster and with more force) to keep them supplied with oxygen and \u2018energy\u2019.  If the supply of \u2018fresh\u2019 (oxygen rich) blood cannot increase to meet the hearts now increased workload, chest pain can develop.  There can be several reasons why the supply may not be able to meet the demand.  What your tablets / spray (nitroglycerin I assume) principally do is; dilate (enlarge) the coronary arteries that supply the heart muscle itself with blood (this increases the supply), and it dilates veins throughout your body decreasing the return of blood to your heart and in doing so, decreasing the hearts workload (decreased demand for oxygen).  It\u2019s all about supply and demand.  Make sense? I would repeat my last guess that you may have stable angina \u2013 that is chest pain that comes at fairly predictable times.  So ... talk to your Dr (family doctor or specialist), about these pains as soon as you can.  It\u2019s not really appropriate for me to advise you to take prescription medications or not on this forum.  However, nitroglycerine can help restore the supply and demand balance that may be upset in your heart by walking / cycling up hill.  If you get chest pains while exercising again, stop and rest (think about your spray!), if it goes away I would recommend continuing at a slower more cautious pace.  If the pain does not go away, is stronger than normal, or is different enough to concern you, call 911 from a cell phone, neighbors house etc.   It sounds like you take good care of your self - keep it up!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi again Kyle.  Many thanks again for your very informative reply which I understand completely!  Luckily I have an appointment with my cardiac specialist (he is the actual surgeon who carried out my ballooning 9 yrs. ago) on the 19th May, so hopefully he will put me on the treadmill machine and will see what's going on with me.  Took my bp again this morning and the higher reading had jumped to 154 but the systolic was only 50, which I think is very low, even though my heart nurse tells me they are trying to bring that figure down too, I feel it is trying to tell me something is wrong.  Anyway, I am taking your advice about my nitro and although this morning I didn't get any pains at all (I took it a bit easy when I started off!) I will be taking a pill under my tongue maybe before I even set off on the bike in the morning. I'm only out of bed for half an hour before I set off on that bike as my dogs are pestering the life out of me to go out! Maybe I would be better to go later on in the morning, rather than so soon after getting out of bed.  I always take my mobile phone with me just in case, but I am in the UK so wouldn't have a very good response from 911! Hopefully if anything did happen they would be able to find me in the middle of nowhere out in the countryside, but obviously I do worry about anything happening to me when I am out with my dogs, if not for me, for the poor dogs!  I am currently taking Fenofibrate cholesterol lowering drugs and I am actually wondering whether these may be the cause of my low b.p. as it is since starting these that the b.p. has gone down dramatically. The nurse told me these should actually stop any chest pains, but they haven't.   I was also told 9 yrs. ago when I was in hospital for my angioplasty, by the nurse, that I would be back again within10 yrs. as nobody went without having it done again longer than 10 ys. so I think I must be doing something right to have lasted 9 yrs. withno pain whatsoever, only in the last six months has ithappened.  Anyway, I cannot thank you enough for taking the time and trouble to put my mind at rest, or at least explain what is going on with me, and I am looking forward to seeing that Heart Specialist again in May. What a pity I can't see him sooner, but that's our NHS for you, I expect it's a lot different in America. I wish I had private health insurance which I used to have, but cancelled it, and now of course they wouldn't touch me with a barge pole would they! Lol.! Take Care and thanks again. X Helen\n\n",

If not, have your doctor order complete blood workup for those plus organ function tests and than go to a Neurologist or a Rheumatologist with your results.   They can test and rule out so many thing in blood work, that is the place you should start if you haven't done so. Make the appntmnt first so that you can get it, they usually have quite a waiting list to get in to see them. They will be happy that you thought ahead, ask your general physician what other tests you can get done ahead of time to bring in for your appointment.\n\n",

    "title": "What is happening with my heart?",
    "content": "Hi all,  I'm sorry if I posted this on the wrong board, I wasn't sure where this belonged.  If you could point me in the right direction it would be much appreciated.  I hope that someone will read this message and be able to help diagnose what may be  happening with me.  I am currently unemployed and don't have health insurance at the  moment, and would like to make some sense out of what I'm experiencing before I go to a doctor.  I'm a 36 year old male with no history of heart problems, I'm vegan (strict  vegetarian, no dairy or eggs), and am generally in pretty good health I think, except for what has been  happening lately.  I also haven't been getting much exercise during the past year, and  I wonder if that has something to do with it.  Symptoms part 1: I have always been in the habit of sleeping on my stomach during the night, and a  month ago or so I noticed something odd when I would flip over onto my back when I  first woke up in the morning.  About every 7 or 8 heartbeats or so, I would feel an  odd single 'pulse' (difficult to describe, actually) that seemed to eminate from my  heart and which I could also feel in my head, that would bring with it momentary  lightheadedness for a second.  This would happen a few times and then stop.  At first  I didn't understand what I was feeling, and I kept sleeping on my stomach, but after  experiencing this for the next few nights, followed by short \"hot flashes\" afterwards,  I started to suspect that I might be having some sort of heart problem.  I started to  force myself to sleep on my back during the night and the symptoms lessened, although  I did feel that odd \"lightheaded pulse\" a few times after I accidentally flipped onto  my stomach during the night, and a couple of times while laying on my back.  Symptoms part 2: During the next couple of weeks, I started paying closer attention to my heart during  the day, and at times I thought I noticed an occasional out of place heartbeat, but I didn't know if it was because I was focusing too much on it and making myself nervous.  I checked my heart rate and it was normal (72).  But then I did start to notice that something else definitely wasn't right, and this is the part that is really concerning me now.  Several times during the day, but more noticeably as night approached, unexpected sounds (like a sudden cough from my wife, an  unexpected meow from the cat, or the upstairs neighbors banging around) would cause my heart (or something in that region) to feel as if it \"jumped,\" it was like it was reacting to a scare.  I don't think the heart rhythm actually changed though, but I'm not sure.  As the days progressed, it seemed to get worse, and  a couple of times for practically no reason (minor unexpected sounds) it felt like my heart was going to jump out of my skin, figuratively speaking.  In the past, I would only get this sensation when really getting a good scare, now it is happening with any minor unexpected sound.  It's most noticeable when  the upstairs neighbors are walking around above me, making their floorboards/my ceiling creak unexpectedly, with each sharp crack of the ceiling I get a corresponding \"jumpy\" sensation in my chest.  I tried writing it off as just being jumpy and nervous because I was worrying that I might have a heart problem, but it seems to be happening more frequently now and at times of relaxation.  Last night was the worst episode actually, and it is what is inspiring me to write now.  Laying in bed, as the upstairs neighbors were walking around above me creaking the ceiling, with each creak it was like I was receiving uncomfortable jolts to the chest, it was almost unbearable.  Imagine some of the scares you've had in your life that caused you to jump, and imagine about 30 of them in a row, this is what I was experiencing.  It was absolutely terrifying.  This was not accompanied by any pain or any other symptoms at the time.  A short time later everything was quiet again and I fell asleep, only to waken 4 hours later to being similarly startled by sounds that the cat and wife were making.  Some additional background/symptoms that may or may not factor into this somehow: We just got a cat about 8 months ago, and she started regularly sleeping on the bed a few months ago, and I think that I am allergic to her dander because I occasionally wheeze and get sinus congestion.  I wonder if my body is reacting to being regularly bombarded with allergens, and if so, could that manifest itself in the symptoms I have described?  Also, for the past couple of years I have had daily pain/pressure/pinching (which I usually attribute to gas, but who knows) right below my ribcage on my left side, which I have wanted to see a doctor about but kept putting off.  And finally, during the day I otherwise feel pretty good (except for my heart occasionally jumping at sounds), but I notice that I don't feel as alert as I used to years ago, and at times feel sort of light-headed, particularly if I shake my head or bend over.  I think that my lack of exercise is causing me some circulation problems, as I frequently get a vibrating/pulsing sensation in my left foot when I sit at the computer for extended periods of time, which seems to be alleviated when I get up and walk around.  Well, I'm sure that I have provided more info than anyone wanted to know, but I wanted to mention anything that could be relevant to what I'm experiencing.  I have been putting off calling a doctor because I moved to a new state last year and still haven't found a family doctor, mostly because money is very tight and I don't have health insurance as I mentioned.  Fortunately it has been quite a while since I had to see a doctor about anything.  I don't know where to even begin in terms of finding the right kind of doctor for the kinds of symptoms I am having.  Do I go to a doctor of internal medicine/general practitioner first, or do I go right for a heart specialist?  Does what I'm describing even sound like a heart problem, or something else?  Do my symptoms sound like classic symptoms of heart problems?  Any advice would be appreciated.  I have been searching for similar symptoms to mine on the net and have come up with nothing so far.  Thank you so much in advance!\n\n",

    "content": "Qunn, you're the first doctor that has mentioned ANY possible connection between BCPs and palps.  My situation sounds similar to MACtools.  I'm in my 20's, I exercise, and I was on nothing but Yasmin.  Two weeks after I started to take Yasmin, I got the palps.  I was hospilitized for a week and then diagnosed with PSVT.  The whole time in the hospital I asked, should I stop the pill?  They said it wasn't connected.  It took me five days to stablize.  I stopped taking the Yasmin after day four in the hospital.  My pharmicist believes that Yasmin could be part of the culprit.  It has a direutic in it and I guess that can affect the heart (by screwing with potassium levels).  I don't think that myself, MACtools, and all the other women I've heard from about BCPs and heart palpitations are crazy and it's all in our heads.  I wish I could find a study out there that says, yes, some medications can cause Palpitations (or PSVT) - but I still haven't found it.\n\n",

    "content": "I went to my Doctor yesterday to get a prescription of Allegra, well, when they took my blood pressure, it was 143/94.  They took it again and it was the same.  Now, I don't drink or smoke.  I do drink coffee and I did have a cub of coffee before I saw my doctor.  He said the coffee would have raised my heart rate, it was 96 beats a minute.  I am really freaked about this because I am 34 years old, in good shape, I run about 15 to 20 miles a week.  I eat pretty well.  THough, I am under a huge amount of stress at the home front. Currently I am having to take care of my children and my wife.  I am trying  to switch professions.  I am a police officer currently (yes, stressful) Can Stress elevate your BP that high.  I don't know if I have a family history.  I have not spoken to my Father in almost ten years.  My mother does not have a heart condition.  I was looking at the Body Mass Index, according to that, it had me as over weight.  Last time I checked my actual body fat (we do semi-anual stress test with the police department) I came in at 11%, isn't that pretty good?  I am 5'9\" 170 lbs.  How can I have high blood pressure.  Freaked out in Texas...\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Anthony,  143/94 mm Hg is not a perfectly normal blood pressure reading, I agree. At the same time, I think you are excited much more than you are supposed to be! I have seen many patients whose baseline BP itself is 140/90 mm Hg. Just don't worry too much. Your doctor was right when he said coffee could have increased your heart rate. 96 per minute is also not a very high rate. It can occur to anybody who has just finished running a 100 metres dash or one who has just faced a terrorizing situation. Coffee can momentarily increase BP also.  If you were my patient, I would advise you just to check your BP a few days later when you would be in a cool mood. If it is 130/90 mm Hg or below (upto 110/70 mm Hg), you can feel reassured. If it is otherwise, check BP twice daily at specific timings for a week. If the value still persists, you can go for an Electrocardiogram and to further investigations if it is abnormal in any way. I suggest these measures for screening only and I don't mean to say that you are not normal now. My impression is that there is a fair chance of you having no abnormality and the BP would have been a momentary one, due to stress. Even if all values are normal, keep checking your BP now and then - at least once in 6 months, so that we can detect hypertension when it first manifests itself.  Take care! My colleagues here can add whatever they want to suggest you. What I have given you is just a gist!  Yours Always Musically,\n\n",

    "content": "I am 32 years old and I have had periodic chest pains since age 18. I have been to the ER, numerous times for it. I have always been given inflammatory pills , pain pills, and a shot of something.  Each and every time I have been told its something different. From costo chrondritis, to anxiety . Each  episode is different. Some last just seconds, then maybe a couple days, now presently , I am going on my 3rd week.  I have been diagnosed with MVP ( valve prolapse) . I do not believe this to be the cause of the pain , I am exeriencing. It is a very dull constant pain, with periodic exremely sharp stabbing pains in the left side of my chest. In the breast-lung area. This causes difficulty in breathing, and or moving. My concern is I have never seen a specialist for this condition. My family practioner always just guesses it and treats it with pills. Presently, I am taking Cataflam, Soma, with a touch of Xanax. ( for the anxety part of it) None of which are ending the episode. This one inparticular feels as though It will never end. Its constant dull pain , as if something is swollen behind my rib cage. Then all of a sudden I will take a breath, or move, and what feels like a Stabbing shooting pain happens( What I would think A heart attack feels like.) I have never had an episode last this long. But they have definately been alot more frequent this past 6 months.  It has been 3 weeks , with a vist to the ER, and a trip to my practioner.  I finally have a referral to see a Cardiologist at my insistance. My problem is I need to know what is happening to me. This is a nightmare to live with. What test should I be asking for? What questions should I be asking? Do people really have  chest pains like mine, That are not a serious condition? Just something they have to live with? Please tell me what to do..... Thankyou , Jenny.[/b]\n\n",

    "content": "If you have not had one recently, and electrocardiogram would be a given.  Additionally, if you have never had any of the following, you should probably have an exercise stress test, 24-hour Holter monitor (if you have been noticing unusual palpitations or rate variances), and an echocardiogram to check on the status of your MVP.   I have been suffering very similar symptoms for the past 7 months constantly (see my previous post from Dec. 04').  Sometimes I even have a mild lightheadedness that goes along with the same chest pain you have described.  My doctor has given me the same run-around you are getting with the anxiety and the chostochondritis.  They never seem to give too much heed to cardiac warning signals if you are under 45.  I am a former medical student who didn't complete his MD due to a great opportunity at the height of the internet bubble and with my limited medical knowledge, I knew my family doctor wasn't taking apporpriate measures b/c of my age of 27.  His immediate diagnosis was anxiety, but none of the traditional anxiety remedies have ever done anything for my chest pains.   My question for you is how long after you initially started experiencing chest pain symptoms at 18 did it take your doctor to diagnose MVP, and did it take an echocardiogram to do so ?\n\n",

Gradually build up to the higher part of your target zone (75 percent). After six months or more of regular exercise, you may be able to exercise comfortably at up to 85 percent of your maximum heart rate. However, you don't have to exercise that hard to stay in shape.  Again, these figures are averages, so use them as general guidelines.   160 would be your 85%. Easy as it may seem a sustained heart rate that high will exhaust the heart.\n\n",

Ten days prior to her death she had laproscopic gallbladder surgery in a out patient clinic. She got deathly ill with vomiting and had to spend the night. She wasn't the same after that surgery, her whole body was puffy and she was tired all the time. Five days after the surgery she was admitted to the hospital overnight due to hypoglycemia. Two days later she waws released from her doctor to return to work. Two days later she passed away. The autopsy report stated that she had a massive heart attack 4-8 days prior to her death. She also had fluid in her lungs. Shouldn't someone have picked up on her heart problems. I would think they would have done a through work up on her prior to her surgery. I am just looking for some answers and would appreciate any help someone can give me. I am still working through her death and have many questions.\n\n",

    "content": "Yes I can here is what it said was a 32 year old female with a long history of diabetes mellitus since age 5 who died suddenly and unexpectedly. She was status post cholecystectomy approximately one and a half weeks ago at Allan Memorial Hospital in Waterloo. The family consented to an autopsy to determine the cause of death. The family also consented to tissue donation. The autopsy is performed at 9:10 a.m. on 10/27/2003 with Tina Friday assisting. CAUSE OF DEATH:  IMMEDIATE: LARGE ANTERIOR ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.  BASIC: SEVERE CORONARY ARTERY ATHEROSCLEROSIS WITH ACUTEL Y RUPTURED PLAQUE AND STENOSIS OF THE LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING CQRONARY ARTERY  MANNER OF DEATH: NATURAL.   FINDINGS:  1. LONG HISTORY OF DIABETES MELLITUS.  2. STATUS-POST RECENT CHOLECYSTECTOMY.  3. BILATERAL PULMONARY CONGESTION AND EDEMA 4. BILATERAL RENAL CORTICAL INFARCTS, REMOTE. 5. STATUS POST TISSUE DONATION. 6. RIGHT OVARIAN ADENOFIBROMA. 7. ABDOMINAL ADHESIONS.  8. CENTRILOBULAR LIVER CONGESl11ON, MILD. 9. AGONAL ASPIRATION, LUNGS.  10. UTERINE SEROSAL ADHESIONS. 11. L YMPHOCYTIC THYROIDITIS.  CORONARY ARTERY (Block 1A)\" Sections of the left anterior descending coronary artery reveal severe atherosclerosis with stenosis of the lumen. There is a ruptured plaque with adherent fibrin thrombus which correlates with the myocardial infarct. The ruptured plaque has exposed aggregates of fibrin and cholesterol crystals. Cardiovascular system: The heart weighs 340 grams and the epicardium is note to be congested. THe origin and insertion of coronary arteries is normal. Cut sections of the vessel show severe athrosclerosis, especially in the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery which is nearly completely occluded and heavily calcified. Cut sections through the heart reveal an acute myocardial infarct involving the anterior left ventricle and anterior septum.  There is softening of the myocardium with a hemorragic appearance. No perforation is identified. The valves are found normally and no pumlonary emboli are seen. The descending aorta shows moderate athrosclerosis. Clinical Summary   was a 33 year old female with a history of diabetes melitis and status post cholecystectomy who died suddenly and unexpectedly. The immediate cause of death in this case is a myocardial infarction (heart attack) which appears to be approximately 4-8 days old. This is.associated with a ruptured atherosclerotic plaque and partial thrombosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Clearly her diabetes would have been a significant risk factor for development of the atherosclerotic lesion and subsequent infarct. The size and location of this infarct would explain the death in this patient. Other findings in this autopsy included arteriolonephrosclerosis and small infarcts of the kidneys also related to her diabetes and atherosclerosis, agonal aspiration of gastric contents in the lungs, an incidental serous adenofibrosis of the right ovary, lymphocytic thyroiditis and an absent gallbladder. The body was status post tissue donation which was accomplished successfully.  Thanks for your prompt reply to my question.\n\n",

    "content": "Lady_shark, I think what the report means is 4-8 days since the date of the forencic examination. When is this report dated? Was it done within a week of the death? As the report says her diabetes predisposes her to atherosclerosis. This is a process which takes years to form. Its ofcourse the main cause of her infarction. Acute massive myocardial infarction is a process the kills right away (suddenly). The point we can also note here is that her diabetes may predispose her to have a silent myocardial infarction where she wont even feel the pain that normally accompanies a heart attack because the nerves conveying pain have been damaged by diabetes. The massive infarct leads to sudden failure of the heart which means that blood accumulates behind the heart and is not driven forwards to the rest of the body. Hence, the fluids in her lungs which again would have happened suddenly as a result of the sudden as a result of the sudden heart failure.\n\n",

On revising your message i noticed that you said her whole body was puffy, she was tired all the time (symptoms that could be attributed to heart failure). Those seem to be just around the time her silent infarction happened. I do find it rather strange that she went through all of this unnoticed. Her ability to endure the massive infarction, heart failure were rather incredible. Maybe you should have a talk with her doctor and tell me what his explanation was. The picture here is rather sketchy I'm afraid.  How was her breathing during the days after the surgery?\n\n",

    "content": "All hospitals, and most doctors' offices, have a release form that you can use to request the medical records. In most cases you can request the medical information directly from the doctor's office or medical records department at a hospital. You may also need to attach forms indicating your legal right to the medical records. Each medical facility has slightly different regulations about the paperwork required for obtaining a relative's medical records. It is best to contact the medical facility before submitting a request.   Often there is no charge to request medical records if the medical records are sent directly to a health professional. If you request that the medical records be sent to you, there may be a fee. The cost can be surprisingly expensive if there are lots of medical records because there are per page copying charges and sometimes additional charges for the time of the person making the copies.\n\n",

Does this happen only in the winter cold? Dear Dr., Thank you for answering so promtly.  The pain is in my fingers when I try to do up buttons, twist off a cap or sometimes when I don't do anything that strenuous.  I forgot to mention that very often the bottoms of my feet burn and sometimes I feel a traveling burning on different parts of my body i.e.: my back, my thigh, my hip.  I spoke w/ my Dad today and he is not a doctor, just a Dad , and he thinks it might be circulation or arthritis-based or perhaps a touch of diabetes.  Sometimes my fingers will hurt if I touch them with my fingernail.  I hope that all that I have told you will help you with a diagnosis.  By the way, this all started about 2 weeks ago & it is cold here.  Please be in touch and thank you again for your interest.  Good night from the U.S.A.  #- Rachel\n\n",

Dear Dr.,  Thank you again for your prompt response.  My answer is both.  The pain was so bad last night that I woke up from it at 3 A.M.  Looking forward to hearing from you. #Rachel\n\n",
