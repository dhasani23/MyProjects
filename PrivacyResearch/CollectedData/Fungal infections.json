    "content": "My mother who is 66 years old was fine until she underwent spinal surgery to remove pressure on a pinched nerve at L3/L4. She had a fall and was vomiting and in severe pain.  After surgery, there is no pain. The post-surgery MRI was checked by a neurologist who said that the spine shows prolapsed discs in several places. There is no pain but she complains of extreme tiredness and weakness as well as hardening of abdominal muscles and internal shaking or tremours which are not visible to others. For the past 6 months she has a white sticky layer on her tongue as well as on the upper palate of her mouth. She says its bitter and she has lost her sense of taste as well as appetite. She has been taking Nizoral but it is not working. She is also having constipation. She is also being treated for urine retention in her urinary bladder for the past one month.  What action should we take?\n\n",

Topical antifungal agents are quite effective.Denture cleansing is essential for prevention.Vitamin Bcomplex are essential part of treatment.Some patients who have resistant yeast infections like fluconazole resistant C.albicans may need newer antifungal antibiotics.

    "content": "Hello, It is not uncommon to have this reaction to hormonal changes that occur with your cycle.  However, douches, topical sprays, etc. are not recommended.  They can disturb the natural balance that keeps infection down.    You may try eating yogurt every day - the kind with active cultures.  Some women find it helps.  Wear only cotton underwear and avoid perfumes, bath oils, etc.    I would discuss this with your doctor.  If you know it is yeast, treating it with antifungal creams or suppositories will help you get rid of it but some women must use these often.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, fungal infections between the toes otherwise known as tinea pedis has got different types like Moccasin type, Bullus type and Interdigital type. This Interdigital type is notorious to cause secondary bacterial cellulitis. The common site for infection is between the fourth and Fifth toes. Cellulitis is caused by staph or steptococal organisms. The bacteria gains entery through the cut and causes fever, swelling, redness and pain. Treatment is with antimicrobials and pain relieving analgesics. Severe types with abscesses may need surgical intervention.  Penicillins or cephalosporins are the drugs of choice. Allergy to these groups may need erithromycine as the treatment for cellulitis. The above two are bactericidal while erithromycine is bacteriostatic, thus, less effective. Ideal would be to get a culture and sensitivity test to get the appropriate antibiotic. It would be best if you could consult with your family doctor instead of self treatment.  Best Wishes.\n\n",

I'm running out of options with this one, I'm changing underwear up to 3 times a day (I sweat easily), I have taken to sleeping naked, I'm using gold bond powder to help keep things dry in between treatments.  Would an OTC one day female yeast infection treatment be more effective (stronger dose)?  Short of wearing mesh shorts with no underwear I'm running out of ideas.

    "content": "Hello,  Sorry for the delay in replying and hope your problem has resolved. It is difficult to tell what these bumps could be without direct clinical examination. However, based on your description these bumps could be due to causes like:  -Herpes simplex, which is one of the sexually transmitted disease. Genital herpes is a very common disease caused by Herpes virus type2. It spreads by direct contact and results in small, very painful blisters (fluid is inside the lesion) on the penis and other genital areas, causing irritation, itching, and discharge. The sores turns into crust, that scab and heal in about 3 weeks. Being under stress, long antibiotic course, or any cause of imunnosupresion would reactivate the virsus. Exclusion of other STDs is essential if it is proved to be due to herpes infection.   -Friction and fungus (especially after a long antibiotic course) are also possible. It results in redness and painful itchy patches of scaly skin with ring-like borders.  -These bumps could also be due to dermatitis. There are many causes that result in contact dermatitis like exposure to certain soap, creams and some may be due to allergy. Avoiding the causing substance is the mainstay of prevention in addition to medications prescribed by your doctor.  Direct clinical examination is essential. So, I advise you to follow up with your doctor. Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

Although I have been on a soft food diet like yogurt and chicken broth, it hurts alot and becomes painful when I swallow. Tonight was the first time I have been able to open my mouth wide enough and see behind my tongue. I've found two big white spots; one being on the on the soft plate, the other is on the uluva. I'm certain there is something at the back of my throat as well which causes the most pain and burning sensation. There is no bleeding or infection in the nose. It is just in the mouth. And I'm not sure why exactly I've gotten this because I have taken the 2 day pre-op and 3 day post-op antibiotics that were prescribed to me by the surgeon. I've also seemed to have gotten the coughs since the night the prescriptions ended. Is it thrush or an oral ulcer developing? (I had blood work done prior to the surgery and according to my family physician everything the surgeon wanted to be tested looked fine. I mean I have been fairly healthy. I don't have a weak immune system or diabetes.)  Please do help me and let me know what you might think it is and how I can treat it. I'm afraid of using Listerine and applying glycerin. I won't be seeing my surgeon till the cast removal appointment on Tuesday.  Regards, Abby\n\n",

    "content": "I have had a chunky whitish/ yellow vaginal discharge for about a year now.  It has a fishy foul odor.  I have gone to the doctor multiple times for it, they either claim it is a yeast infection or say that is just my normal vaginal flow.  I've used many over the counter yeast infection treatments, and also a prescription pill. Ive been taking acidophilus supplements for about three months now and the discharge and odor still haven't gone away.  Could I possibly have a gardnerella vaginalis infection? Could it be around for that long? Doctors have never suggested it, but I've been reading about it and the symptoms seem to match up correctly.  I just don't think my \"normal\" vaginal flow could be that chunky and that odorous all the time. Please help!\n\n",

But once in awhile ill feel an itch on the tip of my foreskin. other than the itching subsiding, there are still reddish areas on the head of my penis as well as the meatus. I don't know what else to do, and im kind of reluctant to go to the doctor but will go in any case. However any ideas as to whats plaguing my poor friend?\n\n",

But then with you history of eczemas in past one has to think of nummular eczemas which are coin shaped and might be mistaken for fungus.A scraping for fungus may be indicated or a wood's lamp test to diagnose it as fungus. So it is best to get a dermatologic consultation. Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I am having a very difficult time overcoming Mycotoxicosis, even though I've been taking Sporanox 200mg twice daily for the last 4 months and will have to continue taking it for several more months. Proper diagnosis took more than a decade and I'm wondering how long before I feel like my old self? My lungs are no longer full of fluid, my kidneys are no longer bleeding and the inflamation in my muscles and joints has gone down dramatically, but I am still exhausted most of the time. How long is the recovery process when you've suffered from something like this for so long? Are there any better treatments than what I'm using now? (I was told that mycotoxin can only be killed off with synthetic antifungals such as, Sporanox or Lamisil). I'm at my wits end; I thought once they finally figured out what was wrong, that I would take the meds and be back to normal in no time....I do feel better on the meds, no question, but normal still seems a long way off. Any insight, advice or assistance in this matter is very appreciated.\n\n",

In your case it is worthwhile to get your B12 vitamin levels tested.Some works indicate that there may be a combination of both since the mold toxicity leads to the vitamin deficiency. Nanotoxicology is an emerging subject but it would be unwise to relate every symptom to mould toxicity in the house and workplace. Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "All symptoms began at the same time, upon moving into a home that was later discovered to have water damage and black mold in and around the central air conditioning return (causing the dry spores to become airborne and sent throughout the house). All the symptoms began clearing upon starting the Sporanox; within days I looked and felt like a different person. I think it's a shame that people are suffering for such long periods of time because doctors don't take black mold seriously and patients have to do all there own research and then go in and beg for proper treatment. My doctor is a believer now; he could see an obvious reduction in swelling (after 2 weeks on med) and my hands looked normal (you could see and feel the bones), before they were swollen, pink sausages with no definition. So please, tell me again how all my symptoms probably aren't related?!! Spend more time listening to your patients and researching things you know little about rather than assuming they don't exist or that there's not sufficient data to go on; doing something to help a suffering patient is a hell of a lot better than doing nothing.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I am very ill and posted here as a last hope.  I'm 35 been ill on and off with the same issues since 16. Had many diagnosis like Candida and Allergies etc but never sure if I had one. Was also diagnosed with Leaky Gut but nothing helped.  Well three weeks ago it all flared up again.  The first symptom I always get is in my neck, shoulders and jaw (sometimes face) a build up of very thick crystal like deposits that crush if I move my jaw or neck. However, they are back thicker than ever in a matter of seconds.  Then I got out of breath the next day but it's more like panting / blowing. I wake up and I'm panting, limbs jerking, body conorting. Facial muscles also contorting.  Sugar makes it really bad as  can feel my stomach get hot and sick feeling. Have ton of rectal crawling since I was 16.   When ever the deposits are thick I have this thick thick gritty feeling in my mouth. Feel so clogged right now and with the deposits it's like I'm suffocating. I can't bear this - I remember being like this years ago and the hospitals just treated me like I was mad.  Spent 18 months just panting and trying alternative medicines. I took some Astragalus herb and think that helped.  I have an impacted wisdom tooth and a gland between it and my neck (just under the ear beside jaw bone) gives me pain and swells now and then. Dentist always says it's not infected so don't worry about it - so I haven't.  The face and head pressure with facial muscle contorting is very bad right now as is the panting and clogged feeling and thacky tongue.   Crushed the deposits two minutes ago by moving by neck and jaw - the were so thick - but now they are back thicker than ever.  I would appreciate any help anyone can be. I hope to God someone can help me.  Declan (Dublin, Ireland)\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  Your symptoms seem to cross over several different sorts of possible disease processes, so the best I can do here is to make some suggestions which might help steer you toward a proper diagnosis. First come the thick, crystal-like deposits which crush under pressure then recur, followed by breathlessness the next day. Have you ever been tested, earlier in life, for cystic fibrosis? While it is improbable you could have this for 19 years, starting at age 16, there are some similarities and, early on, someone may have suspected it. I'm thinking perhaps some disorder of mucous production which may resemble CF in a number of ways. These are generally obscure diseases/disorders, and I am by no means qualified to discuss them, but based upon your primary symptoms. The  \"contorting\" of certain muscle groups doesn't have a connection that is clear to me, but again, I'm far from conversant in these obscure, often autoimmune diseases.  What I can and will do is bring this to the  staff here and see if any of it sounds consistent with anything outside the bounds of my training and experience. Please check back here in a day or two and see if we've been able to come up with any better theories. You've put up with this for 19 years, and you deserve some sort of direction at the very least.   I wish I could name something consistent with these symptoms other than what I've already suggested. Please do follow up with us here and hopefully one of the doctors on staff here may have some more useful insights. Best of luck to you. Hang in there.\n\n",

A few days ago I thought I had the symptoms of a UTI (no pain just itching and burning and mild discomfort and I had the constant feeling like I had to pee but every time I tried, little to none came out). I'm out of town for the next 2 weeks so I called my GYN and described symptoms and was prescribed both Pyridium and Macrobid via the phone. The feeling like I had to pee is gone and am having normal urination, but the itching/burning is still there and it feels more vaginal than in the urethra area.   Could this be a yeast infection in conjunction with a UTI? Could the UTI have caused it? Could it have been a yeast infection all along? Or is is not a yeast infection at all?  I want to try OTC cream/suppository because I can't get to the doctor till the end of the month. Should I wait until I'm finished the antibiotics? And I'm also on NuvaRing. Will that be affected by the suppository?  Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Your symptoms seem quite compatible with a yeast infection.  Often yeast infections will also produce a white vaginal discharge.  If you do have a yeast infection, you may have some peri-urethral inflammation that can be causing some UTI type symptoms, or possibly you have both.  It is safe to try using one of the over-the-counter yeast infection medications to see if it helps.  If it does not, I would recommend that you see your doctor as soon as you are able.  The yeast infection medications should not interfere with your contraceptive.  Best wishes.\n\n",

After a certain medication which I do not remember, it went away. It came back in May and I was prescribed Lotrisone. It went away shortly. Keep in mind that sometimes I forgot to apply in the nights. It started coming back for about 3 weeks now. At first I tried the lotrisone while forgetting to apply on some nights. The progression slowed but did not stop. I gave up on the lotrisone 5 days ago and the infection increased rapidly to the level that I am use to before I go to the doctor. Is it possible that it has become resistant to the lotrisone, if so what else can I try?\n\n",

When it was finally diagnosed, I got on Itraconazole, have been on it consistently since Jan. of this year. The lung problems have gone away, but I continue to have severe muscle pain. At times it will be in my left leg/knee, then go to my left arm. Another key point I have it in is the muscles in my shoulder and upper back (i.e. the muscle that runs behind the shoulder blade). What exactly causes this pain, and what can be done to alleviate/stop it? I am seeing a pulmonary doctor, at first he didn't believe me about it, now he does, but isn't really a help. Should I be seeing an infectious disease specialist?    I am hoping I don't have to continue with this terrible pain everyday. Thank you for your time and help!\n\n",

    "title": "Rash around Genitals spreading to other parts of body",
    "content": "Hello, I'm in Cambodia at the moment I've been traveling and working in Asia for 7 months but in the past four days I've start to develop a rash in various places in my body.  Insect/mosquito bites are fairly standard but about four nights ago I ended up going to bed one night (quite drunk admittedly) with exceptionally itchy testicles. The next morning both my balls and penis were bright red and since then small spots have begun to develop along the shaft of my penis starting on the underside and working their way around. As well as this I started to get spots along my inner thighs.   I don't believe this to be an STD because I've not had sex since I've been out here in asia (7 months) so I would presume an std is low probability.  Some additional info, spots have started to develop in other areas but only 4-5 in each general area and with no great concentration in one place they just seem to appear randomly, other than my penis and thighs where the greatest concentration is I've got 4-5 on each of my hands a small number on my upper chest below my neck and a scattering around my torso also quite a few more on my back. The ones on my front and hands have only really come in the last few days.  At present I'm staying in a fan room, no air con, as you can imagine it's quite hot here and due to work I spend more than a few hours per day lying down in bed working on my laptop, I suspect I may have developed something fungal from being in such conditions but that's pure guesswork on my part.  I bought some Anti-bacterial/Anti-fungal/Anti puritic cream from the local pharmacy and applied that to my testicles and thighs, it had an immediate effect of making them alot less itchy but there is still some discomfort, also my balls are significantly less inflamed but perhaps this is down to less scratching. I did this yesterday could you recommend how long to apply the cream (doing so twice per day) before I get some kind of indication it's helping?  Anyway I hope I've given enough information here, one final thing the spots themselves on my hands seem to be around 1-2mm in size and some have a small clear like bubble of liquid which doesn't seem to be puss. It's possible the ones on my hands and genitals arn't related but that seems unlikely.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Rash around Genitals spreading to other parts of body",
    "content": "Hello, The typical body fungus or groin fungus is caused by a dermatophyte (a parasitic fungus) and presents with a flat, red, itchy rash.  The patches of rash may have a central clearing with raised red borders and may have flaking. Jock itch usually spares the penis.    There is a variant fungal infection on the body in which the fungi invade the hair follicles.  The diagnosis is pitryosporum folliculitis (caused by Malassezia furfur).  However this usually does not affect the hands.    Other considerations in the differential diagnosis are: body lice or scabies viral infection (e.g. coxsackie) molluscum contagiosum lichen planus  As with many dermatological cases, we try a topical cream to treat the working diagnosis and watch for efficacy.    Controlling the itch is important as this provide relief but also prevents bacterial secondary infection.  Oral anti-histamines and topical steroids may help.    Fungal infections of course are treated with anti - fungal creams like clotrimazole for 2 weeks.  If wide spread rash, then use an oral anti-fungal.  Diflucan may be a good option (controls yeast and fungi).    Nevertheless, see a physician for definite diagnosis and treatment.  Let us know how it goes.\n\n",

The rash can become raised and coalesced and quite irritating.  Fungi thrive in moist wet environments. So treatment includes keeping the area dry and treating with an antifungal cream like clotrimazole for 2 weeks.    If no resolution in 2 weeks, see your family physician for further evaluation.  All the best to you.  Keep us posted.\n\n",

I was given oral pill to treat it, then it went away in a couple of weeks. Then in jan/feb 2009 I started getting it again but it was mild. The itchiness was milder and more bearable. But since then my vagina always looked weird, not healthy like it used to before the yeast infection.  anyways i left it hoping it would go away because it was mild but it did not, so in april i went to see the doctors and she gave me the pill again along with anti-biotics because she thought it might be an infection too.  however, I am still mildly itchy at times, and my vulva area always smells...and white buildup is always there in the fold of my labia. I am also hygenic, and clean so that should not be the problem...  and i do not was a doctor to inspect it by putting something in my vagina, because it will hurt, as i am sexually inactive.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I'm not sure this is a fungal infection but here's my history.  This summer, I lived in Brazil for the entire month of July. While there, I had the worst strep A infection of my life. I also developed a concurrent skin rash over the legs, knees, arms, and hands. I saw a local doctor who told me (through my friend who was translating) that I had contact dermitidis (which he did not treat believing it would resolve) and Strep A, for which he administered an IM antibiotic. It was either shortly just before or just after treatment that I noticed what seemed to be a new scar on my leg. It was firm to palpation and felt fibrous as if it were deep but still superficial. It was comosed of four, round nodules each about 2/3 the size of an eraser at the end of a pencil. I ignored it. When I got back to the US in September, I began to notice small papules on my penis that a doctor on here said may be molluscum contagiosum. One of the papules was rather larger than the others, and so I attempted to squeeze it to elicidate puss. I either removed a small about of pus or a thin layer of skin.   Recently, I believe I had a case of poison ivy on the same leg that has the \"strange scar\". While the rash itched, I also developed a few non-pruritic small blisters on my inner thigh that bled profusely when popped. Today, I noticed that my strange scar was still present and I palpated it again. I decided to squeeze one of the small nodules, and to my astonishment it popped, producing a bloody-water appearance and possibly, though I am not entirely sure, pus as well.   I'm wondeirng if the blisters on my penis, thigh, and left calf could all be 1.) related to any of the previous infections, 2.) related to the fact that I was out of the country 3.) related to the fact, I received oral sex while overseas 4.) or a completely unrelated bacterial, fungal (sporulation?), or viral infection?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,      About 9 months ago I was diagnosed with chronic lyme disease after going to doctor after doctor, with my myriad of symptoms.  After being on a rigorous regimen of antibiotics for many months now, I have not gotten much better.  My body is still retaining an enormous amount of fluid and I can feel it moving upwards in the body, towards the chest, and I can physically see bubbles of it accumulating.      As a result, I have continued to search my symptoms online, and have found that I have many if not all of the symptoms associated with an invasive mold infection.  In my garage I do have an entire wall covered with black mold, which at one time I did try myself to clean up, as well as white mold growing through the floor; this comes as a result of a roof leak, and has been this way for years.  Until my recent searches I had not realized the dangers of this mold, and as such have been living in this house in this condition for years.  I now have mold growing through the siding as well.  I have read that antibiotics can only fix infections, but if the problem is fungal in nature, the problems will persist.     I am having an awful time trying to find a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating this type of illness, and my question is what kind of doctor should I be looking for, and more importantly, what kind of tests can be done to diagnose such a problem?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  Invasive mold  infection and Lyme disease are two of the more frustrating medical problems  because of the difficulty in diagnosing in many cases and the fact that they can both share many symptoms. It does sound now as though you may, in fact, have an invasive mold infection,  and  of course you have an exposure in your history to help bolster that suspicion, so you should be tested. You may need to see an  infectious disease specialist, and doctors at the National Institutes of Health have developed a fairly specific test for this, a quantitative real-time PCR assay to detect the 5.8S ribosomal RNA gene of Aspergillus and other molds in the blood. I would strongly suggest you request both a referral to an infectious disease specialist and that you note the name of the PCR essay test to request specifically (it may well be a send-out test, depending on where you live). This should help make the differential diagnosis between  Lyme and invasive mold.   I hope this is helpful to you. Best of luck and please do follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there,  I wanted to add to John's excellent response that invasive aspergillosis usually does not occur unless the person has severe immunosuppression. This includes advanced stages of AIDS, prolonged and severe neutropenia, glucocorticoid therapy, transplantation, and granulomatous diseases. Mold infection can affect a person with normal immunity but the infection and the symptoms are mild and the infection is not of the invasive variety.  A test that is commonly used in the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis is called Galactomannan. This may precede appearance invasive aspergillosis by CT scan.  Galactomannan used in combination with the PCR test which John alluded to has been reported to have a superior sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of this disease.  Again, as John has expertly suggested, an infectious disease specialist is the one you want. How was Lyme disease diagnosed? What tests were used and what were the results?  Oh and you obviously need to find a way to get rid of that mold exposure!  Best regards,\n\n",

I have recently been to a see a couple of doctors, at what are considered to be some of New York City's top hospitals, and they have told me that they are unable to do a Galactomannan test with PCR.  Do you have any knowledge of a lab in the U.S that is capable of doing such a test?  The seem to know nothing about it here in New York.  I was only given a Galactomannan test and was told that the results will be back in a week.  However, I worry that this test is not enough and that what I really need is the PCR or the PCR in combination with the Galactomannan.    Thank You For All of Your Help!\n\n",

Anyway my doctor suggested it would be Scabies (I think largely due to the small sores on my wrists and in between my fingers) and prescribed the topical lotion Benzyl Benzoate.  The lotion suggests applying from the next down, however avoiding mucous menbranes (however amongst the usualy such as..mouth etc, it says genitals)/  However my penis has small sores on it and is perhaps the most uncomfortably itchy part of my body affected - espeically behind the foreskin/head of the penis.  Therefore I was wondering, it seems like I couldnt beat the infection without applying to my genitals, however is it safe to do so?  Thank you in advance.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  It is highly unlikely that a vaginal yeast infection could become systemic. They do, however, recur in some people, and can be a real aggravation requiring multiple therapies at times. You don't seem to have any of the more prominent strains.  As far as candida krusei, it is relatively rare, but becoming more common (as opposed to formerly extremly unusual, since it is mainly an industrial organism used in the production of chocolate). It is almost always seen in those who are immunocompromised either due to cancers of the bood (leukemias) and bone marrow diseases, as well as chemotherapy or HIV. It is also quite treatable by a number of antifungals but is resistant to the most popular one (fluconazole). CK is known to occasionally get into the bloodstream of immunocompromised patients with blood disease as mentioned above, and for those it can be extremely dangerous. Otherwise it's treated as other fungal diseases, but not with fluconazole.  If you don't have leukemia or some other blood-related cancer then you're at no additional risk from CK, should it turn out to be the fungus responsible for your infections.   I hope this is helpful to you. Please follow  up with us as needed and keep us updated. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It is hard to determine what is causing the skin peeling and the initial rash.    It is important to know if there is or was any illness: fever, chills, sore throat, headache, cough.    Was the rash on the palm or the back of the hand (dorsum)?  The differential diagnosis includes: scabies tinea (fungal infection) hand, foot and mouth disease   Kawasaki disease seems unlikely. It occurs in young children - Hand and foot swelling, redness and cracked peeling skin; high fever; conjunctivitis; and cracked lips are some presenting signs.   A visit to your family physician would be good for evaluation and appropriate treatment.   Let us know how it goes.\n\n",

Keeping the area dry and use of topical anti fungal medicine like clotrimazole for at least 2 weeks is the standard care.

    "content": "I contracted a fungal infection roughly 6 months ago and was prescribed ketoconazole 2% topical cream. Original infected area has cleared up but infection spread. Used ketoconazole as frequently as possible (however once per day), but was and still am, concerned about its interaction with contraceptives.   When consulting a website (DrugDigest) to check interactions, I put in the marketed name of the contraceptive and no interactions come up. But when I put in the chemical names that the contraceptive consisted of, interactions came up:   CONTRACEPTIVES, ORAL (in Ethinyl Estradiol and Levonorgestrel Tablets)  may interact with KETOCONAZOLE (in Ketoconazole Cream)  Although the cause of this potential drug interaction is unknown, ketoconazole may increase the risk of oral contraceptive failure. When ketoconazole is taken along with oral contraceptives an alternative method of birth control should be considered.Ask your healthcare provider about these drugs and this potential interaction as soon as possible.  This interaction is poorly documented and is considered moderate in severity.  1) Does ketoconazole 2% cream interact with Levora tablets (which contain ethinyl estradiol & levonorgestrel) which may decrease the efficacy of the contraceptive, increasing risk of pregnancy? Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, To my knowledge, there is no drug to drug interaction between ketoconazole and Levora.   However,they are both metabolized by the same liver enzyme... so theoretically it is possible for one drug to inhibit the other based on their common metabolism.   Given the topical application of ketoconazole, there will be less systemic absorbtion and thus less demand on the liver's enzyme so it should be ok to use both without worry of decreased efficacy.  If in doubt, use a second birth control measure until the infection subsides.    Incidentally, if the infection is spreading and is indeed a fungal infection, you may consult your physician about an oral antifungal (rather than a topical).  The length of infection time may shorten with a systemic drug versus a topical cream.    Let us  know how it goes.\n\n",

    "content": "I've had this infection occur in my left foot for several years. It appears, I \"cure it\" and then it comes back, maybe months or even years later. The interesting part is that I have never had this problem in my right foot.  This infection occurs in the sole of my left foot and it consists of tiny itchy bubbles containing liquid. They are about 0.25 cm in diameter.  I am careful cleaning my foot after I burst the bubbles, because I have learned from experience that if I am not careful the infection will spread and more bubbles will pop up.  After I burst a bubble, I \"cure it\" with rubbing alcohol and iodine. That hurts a bit, but I'd change a burning sensation for itchiness any time.  Iodine and rubbing alcohol  usually does the trick, but the part that I find interesting is that this problem occurs every now and then.  If it's lack of hygiene, how come I have never had this problem in my right foot? What can I do to get rid of these infections in my left foot once and for all?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear TDM, Sounds like you have developed a localized infection that is recurring because the culprit organism is still alive and active in your body.  This wound needs to be cultured and ithe organism dentified so that you can get the proper antibiotic.  There is a nasty germ called MRSA that is responsible for many non-healing wounds (skin wounds). MRSA is Methacillin resistant staph aureus and is on the rampage these days. We are planets and we have many inhabitants that are supposed to be there - in balance with other inhabitants.  Staph aureus is a normal body bacteria that when it gets out of control is \"whipped back\" into its proper place by certain antibiotics in the \"cillin\" family - in particular methicillin.  However it can mutate into a strain that is resistant to normal antibiotics and it becomes \"methicillin resistant staph aureus\".  This requires the use of strong intravenous antibiotics to protect the rest of the planet from infection.  In order to find out if your wound is harboring MRSA - or any of a slew of other nasty germs, a culture needs to be sent.  It would be well worth your time, and health, to get a culture done as soon as possible.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I'm not sure what to do next.  Early December I was treated to a massage by a good friend and that turned to sex.  She used the massage gel to masturbate me which turned the entire top legnth of my penis bright red and it hurt like you wouldn't believe.  I used some Excema cream on it, kept it dry, switched to boxers and used Gold Bond powder.  It went away.  Then during the week of New Years I started feeling stinging pains on my penis only when I got hard and while masturbating.  Also, after climax, I developed a few patches of dry skin on the underside that turned into red, sore patches.  I've been to my primary care doctor.  He's tested me for herpies 1 and 2, HIV (my previous STD tests were in August 2004 - also had a full physical, bone scan and CAT scan - all were negative or \"within normal range\"), and told me it can't be scabies or crabs because he sees nothing there other than redness.  I also have a stinging feeling around my anus and the skin from the anus to the bottom of my testicles.  Doc said I do not have hemroids either.  The week I saw my doctor, I developed raised bumps on my cheeks inside my mouth.  Doc tells me it looks like jock itch, which is odd because I thought jock itch didn't affect the penis.  He told me to start using jock itch cream.  I've been doing so for the past 2 weeks now with little improvement.  On my mouth, he told me it looked like an allergic reaction, so I got a new toothbrush, new toothpaste and mouthwash.  It has gone down a little, but has not disappeared.  I also began therapy and was placed on Wellbutrin XL 300mg daily in mid-November.  There is no side effect like these listed anywhere and my therapist doesn't seem concerned.  I have been to an allergist, did a whole slue of testing and started allergy shots this month.  I have an appointment with a Dermitologist at the end of March.  I am still wearing boxers and using jock itch cream (Lotramin Ultra).  I am also on 180mg of Allegra, which I've been on for five years now.  Well, if you've stayed with me this long, would you happen to have some suggestions or any ideas?  I have not gained any weight recently, no changes in activity levels, laundry detergents, deoderants, etc.  I am puzzled and confused.  My sex life has come to a grinding hault because of this.  I don't even want to masturbate anymore because of the uncomfortable pain I have while doing it.  Sorry for the long message, but I wanted to put it all on the table.  Thanks...\n\n",

You may have a \"vicious circle\" going here - lets say (not that I know) for instance, that you have a viral infection and you scratch it causing an open wound for bacterial invasion and maybe fungal growth because of the environment which allows the rash to grow even more...   Viral infections cannot be eradicated by medications but can be controlled with antiviral medications which can reduce the severity of the infection and speed the healing process. Antibiotics can treat bacterial and anitfungal creams for fungal infections and a culture can let the Doctor treat it more specifically. I would start with a Dermatologist and go from there.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Doc.  Hope you are doing well.  I visited with my dermatologist on the 30th.  He did a complete once over of my entire body.  He first checked inside my mouth and said since the \"rash\" is only in a line where my top and bottom teeth meet, it has to be from grinding my teeth or biting the inside of my cheeks.  He was 100% it was nothing else, he also said it was not a rash.  He then looked in my pubic and anal areas and told me it looked like irritation and a reaction to either food I am eating, fabric, laundry detergent or some other chemical.  The burning, itchy redness, which I thought was a rash, evidently is not.  I was given Protopic for my eczema (the Doc also mentioned because I have eczema, he is not shocked that I seem to have other reactions like this).  I also have Desonven ointment (I think, his handwriting isn't too clear and I haven't filled the RX yet) and Betavol cream.  I also visited my Psychiatrist on the 31st, shared the Doc's findings with her and my symptoms.  She feels the reaction maybe from the Wellbutrin 300 since what I am experiencing both in my mouth, groin and anal region has been documented in other cases, although rare, it has occured and due to my history of breaking out in hives from other \"brain candy\" meds, she feels it'll get better by dropping my dose to 150 and adding another med to see how I do.  My symptoms really flaired up when I jumped to the 300mg dose.  I'm told I will see results in a week's time.  I will let you know what I find in a week.  Thanks again for your help and all the help you give to everyone on these boards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Friction and fungus are likely to be the causes of these symptoms but direct clinical examination is essential.  Skin rubbing against skin generates heat and sweat; they in turn lead to redness and painful itchy patches.  Obese and active people are more susceptible.   In such cases, there are defined patches of scaly skin with ring-like borders hence the medical name Tinea cruris, or ringworm of the groin. Fungus infection predominates in the summer.   Treatment of fungal infection may require about 4 weeks of local antifungal measures to clean these lesions. Keeping the skin dry and clean is very important. If secondary bacterial infection occurs local antibiotic ointment will be needed.  Direct clinical examination is essential to exclude other causes like herpes virus infection, folliculitits, or dermatitis. So, I advise you to follow up with your doctor, he will prescribe the appropriate therapy based on the examination results.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I asked a question about Thrush already in a new post but it hasn't been responded to yet and I really want answers soon.  I don't know if I have Thrush or not but I do have white stuff on my tongue.  It doesn't look like the pictures I've seen though.  I also have a kind of fuzzy tongue and the little white things are attatched to each 'hair'.  I've been brushing my teeth probably about 2-3 times a night because I tend to get hungry after I have brushed my teeth.  I use Arm and Hammer Advanced White toothpast.  I've heard that you can get Thrush from using mouthwash too often but can you get it from brushing your teeth too often?  Another question:  I've heard that if you wear dentures you are more suseptable to Thrush.  Is it the same for people who wear a retainer?  I get lazy and don't clean it very often.  Could my yucky retainer be part of my problem?  Another question, if you can answer it:  I'm uninsured and would like to get a check up because I haven't seen a doctor for about 8-10 years.  How much would a check up cost me being uninsured?  Just give me an average, if you will.  Thanks,  Natalie\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Thrush",
    "content": "Hello -  From  the description provided it sounds as though you might have candidiasis or, more likely, a lesser yeast infection, which actually usually dwells in the intestinal tract, but can migrate to the mouth (especially the tongue) and seems to thrive there because it \"likes\" sugars. I don't think your Arm and Hammer toothpaste contains a lot of sugar, but it probably does have some in it. Probably not the cause, though.  A certain amount of whitish fuzz on the tongue can be normal, especially if there are no other bothersome symptoms. I don't think your retainer is contributing much to this, unless, of course,  it winds up harboring some sugars, which of course is possible.   There's not too much to work with in terms of your whitish, fuzzy tongue. You might try being a little more thorough and frequent in cleaning your retainer,  as this could be harboring small amounts of sugar. That's about all I can come up with based on  what we have so far.  As for the estimate of the cost of an exam,  assuming it would be a very cursory, basic checkup (vital signs, some signal questions, a listen to heart and lungs and overal visual evaluation) probably would run  you between  $60 and $100 depending upon where you go to have it done. A lot can actually be derived from one of these exams, so you actually would be getting a lot for your money, even if everything appears to be normal.   I hope this all is at least a little helpful. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

The problem gets worse when I use lotion to masturbate.  The itching will go away..I'll use the lotion again...then the itching will come back.  Last time I used the lotion a red dot appeared on the head of my penis.  I used lotion for many years without a problem, but now it seems I have some type of reaction to it.  I've also noticed the red skin appears to be in areas where I have callisises on my hand.  I'm assuming it's acting like sandpaper and irritating my skin.  I'm just wondering if you think these issues could be caused by the lotion or if you think it's something more serious.  Even though I'm a virgin, I'm worried that it's herpes.  I have no other pain other than the itchy feeling.  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  Based on your reported cause-and-effect observation it would seem that you have developed a sensitivity to the lotion you're using. This is hardly unusual, as both sensitivities and actual allergies can take sometimes many years to develop. On the other hand, there could have been a change of some ingredient in the lotion and the new component may be something you would have been sensitive to anyway, but that it wasn't present before (this is also a very common problem with lotions, soaps, etc.). You might try using some different lubricant to see if the same thing happens. At any rate, it seems fairly certain the irritation has something to do with the lotion you are currently using, plus probably some additonal invasion of the skin's surface due to callousing of your hand or hands.   I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "I've had ingrown toenails for five years",
    "content": "I met a man the other day who had his big toe amputated on his left foot, and until I had seen the reality of amputation I didn't feel as much between a rock and a hard place as I do now. I've been running from the problem since I was 15 and I think its finally time to face it.   I'm more scared than ever now though because of the man's foot. He said it was because of staff or something to that effect, I don't remember exactly but he I asked if its possible to get it from an ingrown toenail, to which he seemed very sure of himself.  The obvious answer is to go and get it checked out by a doctor. I know this. I've just now got health insurance after a year of not having it, preceeding by me just being too much of a panzy to do anything about it when I had insurance in the past.   Anyway, I'm not worried so much about the nail itself as much as I am about the infected area surrounding. I'd actually prefer to never see the nails again. So when it first started it was just a bit of inflamation on the ridges of the toes. As the first year came and went it got more swollen and leaked a smelly liquid into my socks. I've always been careful not to let it get seen. It got progressively worse over time but kind of came to a standstill at about 2 and a half years in. The sides of the nail are swollen and look like skin is trying to overlap itself. I have feeling in the sides of my toe but not on the growths. I grow fungus on it regularly as well.   It actually comes and goes in two or three month cycles. At one point the area around the nail became too sensitive to clip using toenail clippers so I just started bending the nail backward until it broke off about 1/4 of the way into the toe, leaving 3/4 to cover. Its shorter than I ever clipped them when the nails were normal. There would be an immense feeling of relief where the nail was no longer digging and I could see the redness and swelling of the area go down a bit every time I break it off, but the leaking gets worse. Over two or three months the nail grows back and the leaking stops. Fungus grows out the sides too. Once it becomes a crust like formation I clean it off.   I always soak my feet every day but for the last five years no one has seen them bare. I realize in this height of desperation the minimum I could leave the doctors office with is a total removal of the nail. I'm just scared to death of having to get the amputation. I know its all my own doing but I'd like to have an idea of what I'm going to get myself into when I go to the doctor.  The toes themselves aren't really discolored or anything aside from some red which is deeper closer to the nail, but they look inflated.   I can provide pictures tommorow when I've got a camera handy.  But from what I've written could you please tell me what I've gotten myself into? How does the procedure to amputation and the recovery from that go about? Based on what I've told you what are the odds of amputation? How long does it take before gangrene forms in the toe? What are some symptoms so I can know if I have gangrene or toe terminal infection?  Thanks for reading, and I'm sorry for the novel of a post. This is really just about the scariest thing I've had to face in my life.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Of course we can all relate to procrastinating healthcare that we worry will be worse than the condition itself.  When you add lack of coverage, it makes it easy to wait. But, it sounds like you are now ready to get some help.  I would suggest you see a podiatrist.  They are very proficient at dealing with ingrown toenails.  If treatment for infection is needed first this doctor will be able to do that; if it is determined you are a good candidate to have a repair, the doctor will be able to do this.  I have seen excellent results from the work of podiatrists since feet are their full-time concern.    They remove the part of the nail that embeds itself, then they treat the root so it won't continue to grow that way.  Results are impressive and you will be surprised how little pain you are likely to experience compared to the pain you have been enduring with the ingrown nails and infection.   Most likely you will have some aftercare including soaks in a solution to reduce inflammation and guard against infection.    Good luck - I'm sure you will find much relief. Best wishes.\n\n",

The first time was on my left big toe and I went to a normal doctor who removed the entire toenail but didn't deaden the root.  It grew back and became infected again.  This time I went to a podiatrist who simply trimmed the left and right side of the toenail and deadened that area so it wouldn't grow back again.  I had to have that same procedure done by the podiatrist on my right foot as well.  It's been about 2 years since the left toe was fixed and about a year for the right and I haven't had any problems since.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Oilcan,  Your description certainly sounds like this may be a fungal infection.  Occasionally the infections get set in well enough that the topical products are not very effective.  In these cases there is a prescription oral medication that can help.  Your doctor can determine if this is needed.  Also, topical creams for fungal infections typically need to be used for a long time (often two weeks or more) to fully cure the infection.  Even though all the signs of an infection may resolve, the fungus may still be around and if treatment is stopped too soon it may allow the fungus to reemerge.    Seeing your doctor is a good idea.

    "content": "Hi, I went to a clinic to get checked out because of what is a- Red irritated  (rash ?) that itches, it does not really burn. It is located under the penis \"head\" on the side of the shaft. (I am circumscized) And gets irritated after masturbation, and the skin will crack and break after words also. The skin will become inflamed and red in an area the size of a nickel or dime. Also around the same area in kind of patches the skin has become a brownish color which is much darker then the other skin on the penis. The clinic said that it was Jock itch and gave me some anti fungal cream which I have used for a day and a half (no results yet but not much time). Would you agree with that assessment from the information I have written? and or do you need more info. Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "About a year and a half ago i dropped a dumb bell on both of my big toes at the same time. The toenails died and eventually just fell off but now they have \"grown\" back very awkwardly. It looks like there is a lot of dead fungus or skin of some type under the naail so the nail doesn't lay flat in the bed of my toes. They are starting to grow upward and outward. They are also yellow now.  I wanted to know what course of action (if any) i can take towards fixing this problem. Could I possibly get the toenails removed? Will they grow back normally?   It's really embarassing and making trips to waterparks, pools, the beach or lakes very unsettling.  Im sorry for my horrible description but that's why you guys are the md's right? :P  Thanks a million!  PS: Sorry for the quality of the pictures.\n\n",

    "content": "I had a one night stand about 3 1/2 months ago and for about 60-90 seconds the sex was unprotected.  Anyways I learned a great lesson in the following months about condoms and safe sex.  However, there are still many things to me that are unclear.  The first thing is the smell or odor residing in my genital area, it smells fishy or similar to the smell of a vagina.  I read on some other forums that doctors know exactly what causes this and a simple antibiotic is the remedy...  I don't know how true this is, although I'm hoping it is, but here's my concern.  Since having sex with this partner, which it's been 3 months or so, I've been diagnosed with Prostatitis.  There's not much known for the causes of Prostatitis, but I think it might have some relation to sexually transmitted bacteria or viruses.  I guess that's beside the point.  My urologist prescribed me Cipro and I've been using that for awhile now for the Prostatitis.  Cipro is an antibiotic... so shouldn't that of cleared up the fishy smell?  I'm just unclear on so many things... Thanks for taking your time to help.\n\n",

    "content": "1. Age = 28 2. Sex = M 3. Past diagnoses = None 4. Past surgeries = Broken Nose when I was 8 5. Family history = Nothing 6. Current Medications = None  I had an infected tooth (the fang one) and it needed to be pulled.  It smelled really bad before i had it pulled and I had costant nasil drain out of the side of the infected tooth.  After my tooth was pulled the smell went away but now my one nasil cavity is contantly clogged and has a slow thick drain.  It feels like there is something living in my sinus kind of like if a small maggot is burrowing there moving real slow and digging.  I hope this is not the case but that's what it feels like in a nutshell.  But for the last 4 months I have not been able to clear up what ever is loddged in there.  After I had my tooth pulled I injured my back and then came down sick imediatly the next day.  this was a bad sore throte and 103 feaver for about 1 week then I would go about 3 days feelin fine then I was sick again for a week with the same symptoms.  this went on for about 2 1/2 months.  I have not gotten sick now for about 1 1/2 months but I still have this clogged sinus.  I have never in my life had a sinus infection or any nasil allergies.  You would think with all the antibiotics that I was on for my tooth infection and for being sick that if it were bacterial it would have been gone along with my illness.  They gave me a throte culture and nothing came back.    I am definatly going to go to see the doctor but I have no idea on what tests they could run.  I just don't want to go and for them to tell me oh its prolly nothin just take these and come back after if you still have problems.  I know antibiotics will not work because I was on a ton durring this time.  I need to know what to ask the doctor for test wise or any ideas on what it could be.  I am sure if I had some sort of look thru at my nasil cavities that they would find something wrong.  It just doesn't feel right anymore its just wierd.  This brings me to my second ?  What is that scan called and does insurance normally cover that sort of thing.  If Insurance doesn't than I will need to go the antibiotic route but I dread it.  Me and antibiotics don't mix well.    Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Wolwil,  From your description it sounds like you may have a case of chronic sinusitis.  This may have developed on its own or have been due to extension of the tooth infection into the maxillary sinus just above it.  If imaging is necessary, a sinus CT scan is typically the test of choice but often the testing is not needed.  Treatment for chronic sinusitis is typically with 3 weeks of an appropriate antibiotic.  Seeing your doctor is important.  Best wishes.\n\n",

My GP and specialists have no answers. I understand that there is a disseminated form of histoplasmosis but is a serious, and most commonly, deadly form. My question is this: If histo can be found in the lungs and eyes, then is it possible that it be found in joints and muscles and other areas of the body to cause aches and pains?  If so, how can one test for it?  I can't find any answers; most GP's have not dealt with it and specialists in my area don't know (BC). Your assistance is greatly appreciated.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Histoplasmosis",
    "content": "Hi OrcaBC,  Histoplasmosis is caused by a fungus that is very common, especially in the Ohio River Valley area of the US.  It typically produces an acute, self limited lung infection and then clears but it can become chronic or disseminate throughout the body.  Disseminated histoplasmosis tends to be a severe disease that makes people quite ill.  It can spread to essentially any organ of the body.  Symptoms of dissemination can include fever, chills, cough, skin rashes, muscle and joint aches, nausea and vomiting, and headaches among other things.  It can also affect the eyes, as you know.  Diagnosis of dissemination is based upon findings of infection in other parts of the body.  This can include a biopsy of an enlarged lymph node or spot in an organ such as a liver and finding the fungus, a blood culture that grows the fungus, or isolating an antigen of the fungus in the urine.  Treatment of dissemination is with strong antifungal medications, often IV for a period of time.  Treatment really should involve the advice of an infectious disease specialist.  Follow up with your doctor about this is important.  Disseminated histoplasmosis is possible, although to the degree you are describing I would expect you to feel quite sick.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I understand that blue lumps are often a symptom of Hemorrhoids, however, I've never had Hemorrhoids in my life before. I'm just 20 and I've had two sex partners in my life. The last time I have sex was about 45 days ago and have noticed changes in my genital region and my anus. Immediately I feared an STD, however, I've been fully tested (blood, urine) twice and both times I recieved negative results. I've had 4 or 5 physical exams by different doctors whom all told me my changes were NOT STD related. My dermatologist examined my genital region and diagnosed my problem as a possible infection, fungal infection, pinworm or ringworm... we did a biopsy and I'll have results in a few days. Just recently I've noticed these lumps around my anus and immediately I went to the internet to find what it could be. I came up with HIV infection/fungal infection/hemorrhoids/ or just a regular infection of some sort. I'm pretty concerned and scared. I'm experiencing a lot of changes physically and would just like to know what exactly I'm dealing with. There are four blue lumps around my anal lining. I haven't been examined by my doctor yet, but will do so on Monday. I already know he's gonna tell me they're Hemorrhoids, but I think the penis infection and the anus infection are related and most liekly the same thing. The lumps are soft at times and practically not there and at other times are firm and hard. I was going to cut one of the lumps to see if it was filled with puss or blood, but I chickened out. Any ideas on what I could be dealing with? Thanks in advance for any help you can give.\n\n",

    "content": "Ok I got my results back and the actual rash on my genital area was just dermatitis apparently.  I didn't go in for an evaluation, we just talked on the phone.  I'm sure there's more going on then just dermatitis.  Internally I can feel some changes and the dermatologist reccomended I see a urologist for that.  I'm scared that every doctor I go to is going to say I'm perfectly healthy.  I don't think I'm being psychosomatic or a hypochondriac.  I have a foul odor since my last partner, 45 days ago, a rash developed and now I have blue lumps on my rectum.  When I open the lips of my penis there's a blue discoloration and a few very small bumps  that go down as far as I can see into the urethra.  The same discoloration pattern is on the inside lining of my anus.  What so I have hemorrhoids on the inner lining of my penis too?!  There's something going on here more then just dermatitis and I'm sure of it.  I'm going to see my urologist next week on Wednesday.  Based off these symptoms is there diagnosis you may *think* I have without seeing it?  Any help at all is very much appreciated, I'm going through a very difficult time.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 25 year old male.  I have been having these red spots appearing initially on the base of the shaft of my penis.  They initially appear as just a little red dot, then they grow.  I now have 3 big ones on my penis, 1 big one on my right hip bone, 3 medium sized ones on my left hip bone, 1 big one on the right side of my scrotum and 1 medium sized on the left side of my scrotum.  Plus a BUNCH more of the little red dots on my inner thighs.    I have had ringworm before, and I figured that is what it is, but I wasn't sure because they didn't have a clearing in the middle until I just had another spot pop up on my lower abdomen as a big ringworm (obvious due to the shape and the clearing in the center).  I think it may have started because I have only 1 pair of boxers that I wear to the gym 4 days a week and wash on weekends.  I started to get a head cold last weekend, but stayed inside all weekend to get better.  I have been applying over the counter ringworm cream, horse-raddish, and now monistat 7.  Some spots seem to be fading, but it appears to still be spreading.  I had skin cancer 2.5 years ago.  Please help!\n\n",

I went to my then current doctor who had no clue what they were or what to do about them.  I suffered from them maybe a month.  then, on a hunch I stopped eating cheese and all other milk products.  Within a week they dried up and were gone!  Since then I have resumed eating cheese and other milk products but have not had these symptoms at all since.  I know this sounds strange, but I thought I'd mention it.  There are many many reasons for various skin disorders.  Allergic reactions can certainly be one of them.  So, in case no one can figure out what is happenning, try a change of diet.\n\n",

They are a tan color. From what I can feel, they're not raised at all.  And they don't itch at all.  So if i didn't see them, I wouldn't know they were there.  Somebody told me that it was a ringworm, but I didn't think they would last that lond.  And it doesn't itch.  I'm just started to put Lamisil on it.

    "title": "STD or skin condition (not safe for work)",
    "content": "My History: I am a 23-year-old heterosexual white male.  I have had 5 sexual partners.  I have had unprotected sex with 2 of them.  The first was a one-night stand and the condom broke.  So I got a comprehensive sexual STD check up.  Negative on all. I have had unprotected 3 times with the second one (whom is monogamous and a virgin - so I am 99% sure she\u2019s clean.)  My Question: Ever since I can remember (even prior to being sexually active with partners) I have had two blemishes on my foreskin. Here is a photo of my condition:    They are slightly scaly, painless, itch less and they some times get really dry and form a white dead skin look. They are not contagious \u2013 if I touch them and then touch other skin it does not transfer.  The dead skin look (and my condition) looks like this dermatitis:  Some times it almost looks scarred.  I have a very high libido so I masturbate daily and it seems to exacerbate the problem. If I masturbate heavily they get inflamed (red) but not sore.  They don\u2019t bleed.  As I said they are just blemishes. When I went to the STD test clinic, I said nothing about them and the doctors (I saw about 3-4 on various occasions) said nothing about it either. I don't know if they just DIDN\u2019T notice or they DID notice and though nothing of them - ie just blemishes.  However they look a bit ugly so I wanted to find out what they are and how to get rid of them.  I did a search of STD pictures on the web and couldn't match any of pictures to what mine looks like. So I don't think it\u2019s an STD \u2013 this is also consistent with my sexual history.  So I then went to a dermatology website and searched for  \"penis.\"  From the entire selection of images that came up the ones that very very closely resembled what I have where eczema and contact dermatitis. There two images are almost identical to my condition:      Although this last one says vulva eczema, the skin really closely resemble to what mine looks like after I masturbate, a day after though, it settles down. If I don\u2019t masturbate for a week then it is almost unnoticeable but still there.  I have had acne on my face and back for about 10 years and recently I have had a light a bout of dermatitis on my back and chest \u2013 it was diagnosed as \u201cpityriasis rosea\u201d \u2013 a fungal infection. I was successfully able to treat with: \"Ketoconazole.\"  I shower 2 times a day with soap to keep my acne and skin clean. I have tried the same \"Ketoconazole\" and it has no visible effect on my penis.  So my conclusion is that I have some kind of non-std skin condition, that is exacerbated by (or originally started by) washing too much with the wrong soap aor exacerbated by friction when I masturbate.    Please help.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a highschool student and i have had seborrhea dermatits for about 3 years. (I had cradle cap as a baby).   I always thought that it was dandruff, and i used a dandruff shampoo, but it didn't help. Awhile ago it got really bad, thick yellow cracking scales all over my scalp, and i went to the doctor around last december. He said it was seborrhea dermatitis and  he gave me a perscription for ectosone (sp?),  a steroid lotion.  I have been using it for 5 months.  Initially it stopped the skin from \"cracking\" and it got rid of the thick scales. Now I just have thinner flakes.  I have had these thinner flakes for about 4 months (first month cleared up thick ones) and not seen any improvement.  And there are LOTS of flakes.  It is really embarassing.  I am having to hide my hair with headscarves.  Also, it is a real pain to apply the lotion - I have dreadlocks, and although they are not tight to my scalp, it takes me about an hour to go under each one with the lotion. It's a lot of pain to go through for something that isn't helping anymore.    I finally decided that it was time to go back and see my doctor.  I was hoping for a refferal to a dermatologist.  My regular doctor was on vacation, so I went to see somebody else.  This new doctor didn't refer me, but gave me an antifungal shampoo to use.  It is called Stieprox and has 1.5% ciclopirox olamine.  He seemed to dismiss the ectosone lotion as useless, saying that seborrhea dermatitis is a \"fungal problem.\"  I am really getting sick and tired of these gross scalp flakes.  They have become one of the more prevailling daily issues and I just want to see them gone!! I know that seborrhea is not curable, but I want to make sure that I am getting the most effective treatment to control it, and reduce it's intrusion on my life! I can't imagine my summer with this problem.  It's no fun to be hanging out with friends on the beach and having everyone think you have poor hygeine because of extreme dandruff.  SO - here's my questions:  Why are these two doctors taking such different approaches? What are the benefits/purpose of an antifungal shampoo vs. a steroid lotion? Which is stronger, or more effective? And, lastly, is there any kind of oral medication that a family doctor or dermatologistcould perscribe for this?  please help. thanks.\n\n",

The only med that has taken the patches completely away is Diflucan (an anti-fungal med). Maybe you could ask your doctor to prescribe a short duration of the med. I doubt he/she would prescribe much of it as it can be toxic to the liver if used over a long period of time.  Good luck, Ladysmith52\n\n",

It is quite possible that this is a fungus infection.  Not all fungus infections spread quickly or itch.  It would be best to see a doctor.  If that is a financial problem and you cannot find a clinic that offers reduced rates, you might look up \"Tinea versicolor\" on the web to find some pictures to see if it looks like yours.  It might be possible to treat it with an lotion from a pharmacy that you find recommended in such an article.\n\n",

I receive monthly IVIG infusions.    I have today had a positive culture in my mouth of Candida Abicans. In addition, I have been sweating profusely and been feverish for about a week, been extremely fatigued and have had major gastrointestinal issues. My immunologist is on vacation and my primary care physician wants to treat the candida as if it's limited to my mouth. Based on the symptoms and what I have read on the web, it sounds as if it is a systemic infection and could be dangerous. Any opinion? Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "It sounds as if your medical history is quite complicated.  There are several possibilities for your symptoms.  These include the histoplasmosis spreading (although this is less likely if you are on a correct dose of sporanox).  One thing to keep in mind about sporanox is that many things can affect its absorption.  It is important to take the medicine exactly as your pharmacist recommends due to the risk of decreased levels of medication getting into the blood stream.  When one has cancer the concern is always that it may spread.  I am not familiar enough with cancer of the vulva to know its patterns of spread and if it quickly or broadly spreads.  However, it seems unlikely to cause cysts.  All these factors are likely being contributed to by your immunodeficiency.  Not having insurance is difficult.  With your complex medical needs it is really important that you have a primary care doctor to coordinate your care and make sure the right specialists are seeing you (in particular an infectious disease specialist).  There may be local programs that can help with obtaining insurance.  I am not familiar with Illinois plans but often there are state programs that can help.  Your local health department can help in connecting you with the right doctors.  Please feel free to post any other questions you have and we'll try our best to answer them.  As a reminder to all our readers, though, our site cannot replace a direct medical examination and simply does not compare to having a primary care doctor that can help ensure you are receiving quality care.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Thank you so much for listening to me. Sincerely, Beth in Illinois\n\n",

    "content": "It really depends on how experienced your internal medicine doctor is with severe cases of histoplasmosis.  If your IM doctor is comfortable following this and recognizing when things don't line up then there may not be any benefit to seeing an ID specialist.  The ID specialists really are most helpful when the infection is not following  a typical course.  They can help with knowing which medicines are best for specific cases, which tests to draw to look for worsening disease, etc.  Sometimes, the primary doctor can simply discuss the case over the phone with the ID doc rather than having to have you see the specialist.  This is sometimes done in cases such as yours when seeing the ID specialist would be difficult.  Most of this would depend on the comfort level of the primary care doctor and the ID doctor with this approach.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "The thymus is a very normal tissue to have.  It is most prominent as an infant and child then shrinks down as one ages.  The thymus can be thought of as a training center for the immune system.  It helps certain cells in the immune system mature to fight of infections.  The mass may be related to the histoplasmosis or may not be.  It is possible/likely that they will want to run some more tests and ultimately may want to do a small biopsy of the mass to be certain what it is.  Cancer is possible but there are other possibilities.  My best advice to you is to see the oncologist as a precaution to make sure you know what is going on and try not to get to overly concerned at this point.  (I know that is a lot easier to say than do.)  Best wishes.\n\n",

These first results often can answer most of the questions (i.e. is it cancer, not cancer, or infection).  If it turns out to be a tumor of some type there may be some further special testing that needs to be done.  These tests will often take longer to return (sometimes a week or so).  Depending on the location and what the mass actually is, it may not be particularly safe to simply remove the entire lump.  This is why they often will first just do a small biopsy.

Granted though, the infection was just beginning (like 3 or 4 bubbles) and it wasn't as developed as it is in the pictures shown above. He said the liquid inside the bubbles was sweat and suggested I visited a dermatologist if I felt unsatisfied with his answer.  I haven't tried any antifungal agents yet. Normally, I just treat this problem with rubbing alcohol and iodine. The infection eventually heals but then at some point it comes back.  I have itching associated with this infection. My left foot also hurts when I walk and I've been limping lately.  As far as I know, I am not a diabetic. I had a blood test done less than two months ago and as far as blood tests can tell, I am healthy. (I'm a 25 yo male.)  I'm not sure exactly how long it takes the infection to heal. I went to see my doctor 10 days ago regarding this problem and those pictures were taken last night. I'd say it takes anywhere between 1 and 3 weeks for the infection to heal.  I haven't noticed any oozing pus coming from this infection, just liquid from the bubbles, which sometimes gets mixed up with very small amounts of blood.  I hope that gives you a better idea of what my problem could be. Please let me know what you think.\n\n",

    "content": "This certainly sounds suspicious for nail fungus, very common in toes because fungi love warm, dark, moist (sweaty) environments.  Smoking also increases your risk for fungus of this type.    There are over-the-counter anti-fungal products for this but it can be difficult to treat, may require repeat treatments and would most effectively be cured with a prescription medication.  Don't be afraid to see your doctor as this is very common and should not require anything painful such as surgery.  Good luck\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I am 42, and out of nowhere I developed what looked like either Impetigo or Angular Cheilitis, and within 24 hours my penis developed  red rash-like symptoms.  Two days later and there are sores on my face, and my penis looks like an elephant's trunk.  It is literally swollen two to three times it's normal thickness and is actually starting to constrict my urine so that i can't finish properly and it drips in my pants after urination.  I had something similar two years ago when i had a massive attack of poison oak from head to toe.  three doctors have seen it and i've been given yeast treatment, antibiotics and told my face looks like herpes, but they are stumped by my swollen penis.  Whatever the cause, i actually punctured it with a pin several places to drain it and squeezed a large amount of yellowish clear fluid, which works for a while but then it just fills up again.  This is the third day of swelling.  My face is healing, but the penis seems either worse or static.  HELP!!! What type of doctor would specialize in this type of thing?\n\n",

    "content": "Generally fluid build up such as you are describing is a sign that there is a problem with the lymphatic system.  Either, there is too much fluid leaching into the soft tissue (such as from a low albumin level) or there is a problem with the lymphatic system picking the fluid up.  I would strongly advise you to see a urologist.  You should also have your urine checked for protein and a chemistry panel done to look at your protein and albumin levels.  Swelling such as you are describing can be quite severe.  I would recommend against puncturing the skin to drain the fluid since this increases the risk of severe infections.  Medical evaluation is important.  If your primary doctors are stumped it's time to see a specialist.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Fungal infections present with red and usually painful itchy patches of scaly skin.  They have defined, ring-like borders.   Topical antifungal creams are useful in the treatment and the lesions usually take long time to resolve completely (from weeks to months in some cases) on treatment.   Direct clinical examination is essential to exclude other causes like dermatitis which is treated mainly by avoiding the exposure to any skin irritant or allergic.   Keep us updated.

They seem to be worse when it is hot.  A couple summers ago I believe I had tinea versicolor on my back as after the red spots disappeared I had white spots for a quite a few months.  Could this be tinea versicolor as well or maybe some other form of tinea?  Is this something to be worried about or can I treat with over the counter fungal creams?  Thanks for your help.\n\n",

I used to use lotions when i masturbate, but have discontinued that for 6 months. INfact, I rarely masturbate at all now. Sometimes when my wife rubs my penis, the skin gets irritated and these white painful bumbs show up. they are painful. I tried an anti fungal in case it is a yeast infection as my wife was recently told she had one at her last yearly exam. Before this kind of outbreak, i feel tingly on my leg and thigh. The outbreak only happens when there is some kind of rubbing on te penis. My skin feels very sensitive almost all the time however. The bumbs have occured just under the head and on each side of the penis, always same place. I thought it was from masturbating too hard, but i have given that up.  THis last time, i was on levaguin for epididimitis. Which is my second try in 3 months and the pain is still there.  What on earth is going on?\n\n",

I know my couple of weeks of research can never stand close to many yearsss long studies by qualified practitioners like you.   I just have a quick question - I have have been exposed to an unhygenic environment of Fungi, Mold and many bacterias and viruses were there too, I am sure.  I researched on the internet very much and found that i have all the symptoms arising from living in an environment of fungi and mold.  I also did a lot of reasearch online and found that I have Candida and forms of it. This all started when I was looking for chest pain and found that I have Candida Esophigitis.    The reason I am sure about all these symptoms is because I have went through at least 200 different webpages in the last one week. And all of them seem to be saying the same thing that these are the symptoms of different fungi and mold allergies/infections etc.   Now sir, since I have been exposed to different kinds of fungi and bacteria. I want to know is there any ONE single test that could look for how deep rooted that problem is now, I mean if it is Aspergillosis or invasive candidiasis or in general how much damage is there?     All the symptoms for all different kinds of molds and fungi are the same, but the treatment is different as all antifungals like Fluconazole etc. don't seem to be effective for all kinds of fungi problems etc.  I want to know is there a test which could help me find out how bad is the fungi in my body - like invasive in different organs?   Or if nothing is severe then should I take Fluconazole 100 mg for 14 to 21 days and see if all symptoms go away?   Please please please help in detail. Would Fluconazole treatment help me? or shud I try it even? and then wait to see if I still have symptoms left?  Kindly forgive me for any mistake.  Please help. Kind regards, Rav\n\n",

Before taking any medications you have to be evaluated by a physician.  If you suspect that you have candidal esophagitis, in addition to the chest pain that you might have, you should have real difficulty swallowing and consequently eating and then losing weight.

    "title": "Red rash on thigh and in the groin area",
    "content": "Hi  I'm a 44 year old male and here is my problem. In August, I had oral sex with a women. After a couple of days, my penis started feeling itchy and had red spots on it. I took an appointment for STD verification that was scheduled for the end of September. By the time I got to my appointment, the symptoms were gone except for small red spots on the thigh. The doctor said it was nothing and gave me Zithromax just for prevention. One week after, I ended up with a red rash on the thigh. One month ago, I saw a physician who told me it was fungus and gave me Loprox. It didn't help so I tried Nizoral and Lotrimin and it's still not working. It's progressing pretty fast in the groin area and nothing seems to work. Can Micatin or Nystatin make the difference ? Is it Tinea or Candida infection ? When should I consider systemic treatments ?   Thanks,  Jack Real.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Direct clinical examination is essential for the diagnosis in cases like yours.  These lesions could be due to one of the following causes:  - Friction and fungus are very likely to be the causes of these symptoms since it occurs in an area where skin rubbing against skin is highly frequent.  Skin rubbing against skin generates heat and sweat, they in turn lead to , redness and , painful Itchy patches.  Obese and active people are more susceptible.  The Itch may progress into inflammation and becomes more complicated.  If caused by fungus, the Itch and redness will be more gradually. In such cases, the patches of scaly skin will have defined, ring-like borders\u2014hence the medical name Tinea cruris, or ringworm of the groin. Fungus-caused jock Itch predominates in the summer.   These lesions give also similar picture but less likely to be the cause according to your description.  - Genital candidiasis another type of fugal infection that causes itchy rash on the penis. They are normal pathogens in our bodies and are activated when the immune system is lowered e.g. during stress, when on antibiotics, DM etc. and rarely through sexual intercourse. Microscopic examination of tissue scrap from lesions help in the diagnosis for these types of fungal infections.  Treatment of fungal infection may require about 4 weeks of regular local anti fungal measures to clean these lesions. Oral -systemic- therapy is indicated by dermatologists for resistant disseminated cases( immunocompromised also)  under close observation for side effects.  - Less likely your symptoms to be due to Herpes simplex, which  is one of the sexually transmitted disease. Genital herpes is a very common disease caused by Herpes virus type2. It spread by direct contact. It results in small, very painful blisters (fluid is inside the lesion)on the penis and anus in men, genital irritation, itching, and discharge, swelling, reddening, or a feeling of pressure in the groin. The sores turns into crust, that scab and heal in about 3 weeks\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Safaa  Thanks for the answer. I also thought about Herpes at the beginning but It is unlikely. Is it possible that I had a mild case of genital candidiasis in August, got rid of it while waiting for the STD examination and then, when I took Zithromax, it lowered my immune system and the infection got back to the thigh as cadidiasis fungus ? I don't understand why after 4 weeks of anti fungal treatment, the situation has not improved and even got worst. Maybe it's not fungus or maybe I have problems with my immune system. I have an appointment with the dermatologist on Dec 10th, I will keep you informed.  Thanks again for the answer.  /Jack Real\n\n",

I've been using that for 2 days and things are improving again. He said it should be gone in 4-5 weeks and if not to see him again.   I used a 1% Loprox cream in November and it didn't work but I guess now I'm using a 100% Loprox lotion with a bit of hydro-cortizone.

    "content": "Dear Crisp082002,  Regarding the labs that were mentioned, if this is the percentage of eosinophils (and not the absolute number), then this is very high. High eosinophilic count usually points to either an active allergy or a fungal or a parasitic infection but unfortunately it does not say where the infection is.  i think at this point, your daugther either needs a pediatric infectious diseases specialist or an allergy specialist if this turns out to be not of infectious origin. Remeber that the mold could cause both problems meaning that your daughter could have been infected by the mold, she could be allergic to the mold and the problem that she has is an allergic reaction to it (but not be infected by it), or could have both. Any and all of these possibilities can cause the eosinophilic count to be elevated.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.

    "content": "Hi, I am a 23 year old female and I've recently noticed something that I'm not sure is quite right... A few months ago, after intercourse, my partner pointed out some white flecks on the condom. I was very weirded out after investigating and have \"checked\" to see if it will come back with my finger. It has happened frequently since then, usually around the time I suspect I'm ovulating. (a week or two after my period) The discharge is the same consistency as semen, or thinner...except it has white chunks. I was thinking it could be a yeast infection, except there is no burning or itching along with it. Also, it's not thick like cottage cheese, it is fairly thin. I've heard it's common to find white flecks in discharge. The \"chunks\" however, are bigger than I think is normal.  There is no odor or weird color. The whole thing is very perplexing, but I feel like there might be something wrong with me!  I had been diagnosed with the \"bad\" kind of hpv a few years ago, and never did what the doctor told me, which was to increase my intake of folic acid and vitamin c. For the last week I have been taking supplements of these two vitamins as well as a multi-vitamin, but I'm sure this is to just make me feel better.  Another thing, not sure if it's related...but when I am menstruating I noticed my right leg cramps up, but not my left. I always thought this was normal, but shouldn't it be both? My periods also rotate in severity every other month. For instance, this month I had barely any cramps, but next month I'll have a lot. I know that ovaries take turns producing eggs, so could there be something wrong with one of them?  Any help would be appreciated....I've been very nervous about this for a long time. I plan on going to the doctor as soon as I get some money. (No insurance) but I'm hoping you can give me an idea of what it could be.   Thank you!\n\n",

White flecks would most likely not be an abnormal variation but \"white chunks as in cottage cheese\" would indicate an infection. If you have not had a gynecological exam recently I would suggest that you do so. Menstrual cramping that differs as in the way you describe (one month worse than the next) is also relatively normal. In most areas, there are programs designed to provide access to healthcare for free or at a reduced cost for people whom are uninsured/underinsured. There are many free women's clinics that offer screening as well. If you need assistance in locating such services I would be glad to do my best to help. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

I had no more itching and burning when I stopped the medication. About four days later I noticed  a creamy white discharge coming from my vagina, I did not pay it any attention, I thought it was normal so I douched for three days. We had intercorse again with a condom and I on birth control 3 days ago. It is 3 days later and I still have the white creamy foul smelling discharge. I was wondering could it be leucorrhoea or would i need to take the Monistat 7 day cream for a full week now?. I have had no past surguries. My family has a past of diabetes and high blood pressure.

Yeast infection usually have a musty smell.  Your doctor can take a sample of your discharge and look at it under the microscope to deterime the proper treatment.  You may need a perscription medicine rather than the over the counter medicine.  Hope this answers your question.  MaryAnnRN\n\n",

    "content": "For years now I have had extensive vaginal itching, and it's only getting worse. I would say I've had itching for around 4 years, but in the past year or two it's become much worse. I've been having regular paps for 6 years, and have only once had an abnormal result. Two or thre years ago I was diagnosed with bacterial vaginosis and was told it would go away on it's own. My next pap was normal. I have not had a pap in about 16 months now though because I have moved, and do not have a family doctor, and have been trying for months to find one. It is impossible to get in to see someone around here!  I am so frustrated with my itching, as I can not figure out what is causing it. The is all along the outside of my vaginal area, extending down to the ridge between my groin and my thigh, but it is worst just along the outside of my vagina (I'm sorry, I don't know any medical terms for this area!) outside the large lip. It is only on my left side though. The right side is not itchy at all. From time to time I will find a small bump, but I suspect this is because I scratch myself so hard that I sometimes bleed, so these may just be cuts from my fingernails. Has anyone else experienced symptoms like this, or does anyone know what may be causing my discomfort? I do not have any STDs and I do not have any discharge.\n\n",

    "content": "It's interesting to find someone who has exactly the same problem I have.  I've also had my itch for around 4 years and it's on the left side and in the exact same area is yours!   My itching is so much worse at night in bed and when I am in the shower or bath.  It really does drvie me insane at times.    I've been to the doctor and she is not certain what the problem is but she said that it appears to be some kind of skin condition.  My smear tests have come back clear.  My doctor  prescribed me some steriod cream called Dermovate ointment and I get great relief from it.  You have to use it very sparingly but In the last six months I've only had a few flare ups and I now use the ointment less frequently - I can go for weeks without using it!   The ointment hasn't cured my problem but it has helped.   Next step for me is to get an appointment with a gynacologist.  I'll let you know how I get on.\n\n",

I have noticed that it happens regularly right before my periods and less intensly in the middle of the month. Sounds hormonal to me. Has anyone else noticed anything like this. I cant stand this it is awful, and definately worse in evenings and in tubs and showers. Ice does help keep the itch away better than the creams but not real convient.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm joining this site for the first time in hopes that someone will be able to give me insight to what could be going on with me. For the past several years I have been having symptoms of what would appear to be a yeast infection however without the \"cottage-cheese\" like discharge. Although I have always had an increased amout of discharge it does not appear to be abnormal (however I could be wrong). Everytime I have been to the dr. about these symptoms I am always told that it is not a yeast infection but that the ph is \"off\" or there is a small presence of something abnormal but never anything major. Most recently my gyn treated me with Flagyl in hopes that I would have improvement but it did nothing. The odd thing about these symptoms is this...they appear to be related to where I'm at in my menstrual cycle. I also had a baby 18 months ago and the whole time I was pregnant and breastfeeding I did not have ANY of these symptoms. A month or two after I stopped breastfeeding my son I noticed that the symptoms reappeared.  The symptoms begin a few days after the end of my period and last for about two weeks. The week prior to my period I am for the most part usually symptom- free. Recently, in addition to these \"yeast-like\" symptoms I've noticed a rash which seems to be localized on the left side of my vaginal opening. The rash does itch and I'm able to find some reliief with hydocortisone cream.  I am hoping that someone will take the time to read and reply to this post as I'm at my wits end with experiencing these symptoms every month! Each and every reply is GREATLY appreciated. Thank you!\n\n",

    "content": "Vaginal discharge is a frequent complaint usually used to describe an alteration of secretion which may be regarded as excessive or abnormal by the patient. Discharge may originate in the vulva, vagina or cervix and the cause may be physiological (normal) or pathological (abnormal). It is important to note the amount, colour, and consistency of the discharge, the presence of abnormal odour, the presence of associated symptoms such as vulvar rash or vulvar irritation, pain during intercourse and relationship to the menstrual cycle.  There are numerous causes of discharge, but in practice, most patients are found to have candidiasis, trichomoniasis, bacterial vaginosis, herpes, gonorrhoea or chlamydia.  Irritant discharge  is particularly associated with candidiasis of the vulva or vagina. Discharge with a foul odour  is most often caused by vaginal trichomoniasis (TV) or bacterial vaginosis (BV).  Personal habits such as vaginal douching and antiseptic usage may also cause vaginal discharge.   Discharge from the cervix may be caused by gonorrhoea, chlamydia, herpes, non-specific bacteria, erosions, polyps, IUCD and lesions in the uterus.  Physiological discharge may be due to menstrual cycle variation and you seem to infer that the discharge you experience is related to the timing of your menstrual cycle. Just for information, as it is not applicable to your case, other causes of physiological discharge are pregnancy, sexual stimulation and smegma.  On the occasions when you have been to your doctors, is a speculum examination done to view the vagina and cervix and are any samples taken for tests? Troublesome and persisting discharges must be investigated in this way, as examination is always necessary to determine aetiology. If you had BV or TV, you would have shown a good response to the course of \u201cFlagyl\u201d prescribed by your doctor.    It would have been helpful to mention if you have an IUCD fitted and if you are sexually active. I note from your profile that you have a history of HSV since 1999. You have not stated if this is genital HSV and if so, whether you have been suffering from recurrent exacerbations. HSV can cause vulval or cervical discharge.  It is advisable to undergo further examination in a genitourinary clinic where tests to exclude the various causes of vaginal discharge can be conducted. Please be examined at the time you are experiencing symptoms. If you practise vaginal douching, it is advisable to stop the practice.  I hope this information has been helpful. Thank you for contacting our website. Although two days late, on behalf of the crew at this website, I wish you a happy birthday!

He said that the bumps/rash was just from chronic irritation and from the yeast being left untreated.  He put me on Diflucan, I think it was 1 pill per week for 4 weeks, and the symptoms cleared up completely and have never returned, after just 3 weeks of treatment (I believe it cleared up before the 3 weeks though). Now I'm 5 months pregnant and haven't experienced any symptoms at all for quite sometime...we'll see what happens again after the baby comes!

Recently, the skin around my vagina has gotten very tender, and last night I developed a rash on that skin. It doesn't hurt to pee, but when I go to wipe it definitely stings. I am really worried that I might have genital herpes. Also, when I touch the back swollen parts of my vagina, they are extremely sore and hurt a lot.

    "content": "Hello, I've been searching for a forum like this for quite some time and have been trying to figure out what's going on with me downstairs.  I'm a 27 year old male.  For some reason or another, my genetalia really smells.  It's more or less a BO smell and it's constant.  I've done just about everything I can think of in order to get rid of this smell.  I wash myself very very well and take multiple showers.  It seems as if as soon as I get out of the shower once washed, the smell is right there.  It's been very frustrating and embarrasing to me because my girlfriend complains about it.  I think it's been this way for a few years, but I didn't know what to do about it.  One thing I can remember is that one of my ex girlfriends from about 2 or 3 years ago smelled really bad.  We did have sex, do you think this has had something to do with it?  Do I have some sort of an infrection? If so, what type of doctor do I go to to check this out?  Family Practicioner? Planned Parenthood?  I'm just not sure where to go, or what to do.  I would greatly appreciate any type of help I can get on this.  I swear that I can even smell this smell slightly through wearing some of my clothes.  What' I'm hoping hasn't been happening, is that other can smell it through my clothes as well.    Thanks again in advance for your help!!!!!\n\n",

I took a shower and found that the area just below the head of the penis was tender and itched a lot! I thought that this might be a yeast infection so I tried using miconazole cream on it. This helped with the itchiness for awhile. About six days later the dry skin that would peel off started to go away and I thought it would be o.k to masterbate again. After masterbating my penis started to burn like fire so I took a shower immediately. Later that day my penis itched so bad that I had to scratch it.

    "title": "Differences between mastitis and candida infection?",
    "content": "Hello,  I would like some clarification between symptoms of mastitis and yeast-type infections of the breast.  I have been dealing with what I believe is a yeast infection in my right breast, for several weeks now.  My symptoms were white spot on nipple (milk blister), radiating/shooting pain from nipple to throughout the breast, slight temperature (100 deg).  Symptoms were only in one breast.  My doctor prescribed a 10-day run of Cephalexin.  While on the Cephalexin, the symptoms got worse, and toward the end, spread to both breasts.  I began taking probiotics (combined Lactobacillus and other beneficial bacteria) and eating yogurt a few days prior to the end of the antibiotic, mostly to combat the diarrhea side-effect.  I returned to the doctor with a couple of days left on the Cephalexin and he prescribed Augmentin, if symptoms persisted after the other antibiotic ran out.  I spoke with my son's pediatrician at the time, as my son is asymptomatic for thrush/candida.  She suggested that, after taking the Cephalexin, to take the probiotics religiously and see if that started to clear things up a little bit for a couple of days before taking the stronger antibiotic.  If so, it's probably a yeast infection.  I followed her advice.  The pain disappeared from the breast that showed symptoms later.  Unfortunately, I am experiencing more severe pain in the original breast.  Should I fill the Augmentin prescription or consult with my doctor about trying an antifungal, such as Nystatin or Diflucan?  Also, what would be the main difference in symptom presentation between a bacterial and fungal infection of the breast?  I thank you sincerely for your time and efforts.  What a neat site!  Melissa\n\n",

    "content": "Hi misspudding, Nonbacterial related mastitis generally presents with tenderness/pain, reddened, hardness of the affected breast. Bacterial associated mastitis may present with not only reddened, painful breasts, but usually a feeling of generalized illness (flu-like symptoms) will be present as well as an elevated temperature. If the mastits is bacterial associated it should clear with a course of antibiotics. Yeast infections of the breast may also cause reddness and tenderness and if it extends into the milk ducts there may be a burning type of pain as well. In my opinion if a yeast infection was present and you are nursing then your baby would also have thrush as this condition, if left untreated, is passed back and forth from mother to baby, and vise versa. I would suggest that since your symptoms have not improved with your current treatment that you inquire with your physician about a referral to a breast specialist to identify if an underlying disorder is present. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "title": "Test results are In!",
    "content": "Hi Doc and Theresa:  So my test results came back today from my new doctor. According to the lab tests, he is indicating that I am diabetic, and it is why I am continuing on having yeast problems.  I guess my question is according to my test results, would I be considered prediabetic or diabetic. He said his normal range for the A1C Hemoglobin test is anything less than 6.0. He also considers 6.0 pre-diabetic and anything over diabetic. My range was 6.1, so does this signify diabetes?  Also, my CBC came back as 406 and he has written down 400 as a high normal, what does this mean? He said it is my platelets. Also high eosinophil (sp?) cells? I am confused as to what all this means. I am making an appt to meet with him, but it will be hard to wait to talk to him without an understanding now.   Also, surprisingly, my sed rate level and arthritis testing was normal. That shocked the daylights out of me. I am still following up with the infectious disease doctor Monday and keeping my Rheumy appt. I just do not believe I don't have some horrible form of inflammation going on. I have stated all the problems I have with joint swelling, pain and so forth and not being able to walk, I just wonder if it is Fibromyalgia or something. I would think the Rheumy Doc might be able to tell? I sure hope so.  Lately, I have had terrible headaches, I am not sure what that is being caused by? Okay, please if you can let me know about the diabetes I would greatly appreciate it.  Oh and lastly, my liver function came back abnormal too. He indicates 126 being within normal range and mine was 135. Is that the alkaline phospate test? If so, I do know that this always comes back slightly high. Does anyone know why?  Sorry again for all the questions...I just need to understand!  Take care\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Hopeful I would consider 6.1 to be borderline. An A1C reflects the average blood glucose for the previous 2-3 months. That particular  test would give an over all picture but in my opinion the test that would indicate actual diabetes is a glucose tolerance test. Where your levels tested while you were fasting? Now for Fibromyalgia, this causes muscular pain, not usually joint pain in particular. I still feel that the joint pain is caused by the long standing yeast infection. Elevated platelets are also borderline and I am not too concerned about this count at this time. Eosinophils are part of your WBC's - the cells on your blood that elevate in response to infection. Eosinophils can elevate for any number of reasons from allergic disorders, parasitic infections to malignancies. Neither of these counts have any significant use as far as determining diabetes. As for the elevation in alkaline phosphatase, was this the only liver enzyme that came back elevated, because if so it would indicate a possible elevation being caused from the steroids, or from the bone and not from specifically liver dysfunction. I hope this answers at least some of your questions. You should most definitely keep your appointments with the other specialists indeed. Sincerely, Theresa (Rntdj)\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Theresa:  Thank you for the response. As far at the liver enzymes this is the 3rd test I have had done. All of them have been elevated. My old doctor had also done the isoenzyme test after the intiial elevation and it linked back to my liver instead of my bones. The second time it came back elevated after 3 months they did the isoenzyme and nothing was significant. She stated I must just have elevated enzymes. Now this is the 3rd test and it is still elevated.  Now the GTT, that is where I fast and go in and drink the glucose drink? Now this is the test I had when i was pregnant and I crashed on. My understanding is that I was considered hypoglycemic. Now I am showing elevated blood hemoglobins. How is this possible?  I agree that I need to keep my appts. I still am very frustrated and do not understand what is going on. I seriously hope my new doctor will not just send me on my way to these specialist and forget about everything I have told him. I am just so worried that I will not get an answer from the Rheumy or Infectious Disease docs to verify my complaints.  I have so many symptoms and it is so unconclusive. I also have started noticing when I don't feel good I get naseuated easily and real bad headaches, at times I even shake.  Once I eat something, I normally feel better with those symtpons. I pretty much have to eat something every few hours to feel balanced out.  Well thank you again Theresa...\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Ali, The reason I asked about fasting was so I would know if the blood glucose was done prior to a meal. As for fasting and the A1C it makes no difference whether or not you were fasting because the measurement is over the preceeding couple of months. Now for the liver enzymes, what I meant was is the alkaline phosphatase the only liver enzyme that came back elevated or did other liver functions studies (ALT -SGPT, AST- SGOT, bilirubin etc.) come back elevated as well? If you become nauseated, shaky, have headaches etc. but feel better after you eat and the sypmtoms dissapate then it sounds as though your blood sugar levels may be dropping and thats why you feel better. Keep in mind someone with diabetes can have high blood sugar levels as well as low blood sugar levels.  Sincerely, Theresa\n\n",

    "content": "Good Morning Theresa:  I am not too sure what tests he has run on me as far as my liver goes. I know my old doctor was always referring to my liver enzymes, this is all I know.  As far as the blood glucose test, I was not fasting ahead of time prior to the blood being drawn. Would this effect the test results. I believe it was marked as normal range being 65 to 110 and mine was 95. So I was within the normal limits.  I told my husband I did not understand how I could have low blood sugar as well as high. I assume I should be brining this up to my physician and have further testing done. Also, he has not given me the glucose tolerance test. In your opinion should I be requesting one?  I have not been feeling very good again this morning. All my aches and pains, burning sensation and numbness is back. I stopped taking my new meds for a few days and it all has decided to come visit me again...Ugghhh  I am very concerned as well with my breathing at this point. I believe that he needs to look into how my lungs are functioning. At times I feel that I cannot get a breathe. I know that my old doctor put that oxygen reader on my finger one time and my reading was normal, however my Mom asked if they had me walk around and I said no. She stated this would not be an accurate reading?  I am very very concerned with my chest pain and lung situation and am not content with just the chest xray I had done. There has to be other tests out their to check and see if your breathing is okay, because one thing I do know and am certain about is mine is not.  Well thanks Theresa and have a great day!\n\n",

Until diabetes is under control, blood sugar levels can alternate from high to low back to high again. It is very important that you eat a balanced diet to keep from having extreme alterations in levels. In my opinion the way you continue to feel is related to the uncontrolled yeast growth and until this problem has been eliminated you will continue having good and bad days.

    "content": "HELP!!!  I noticed some weird bumps in the back of my mouth, also my throat is sore and swollen a little.  I have not noticed any other side effects along with these bumps. I am 20 yrs old, and have never , at all , had sexual contact or oral sex of any kind!!!!! So I am very stumped on what these might be.  Also, my sister has them in the back of her mouth to.... and she is like me - done nothing with no body...not even kissed!!!!  These bumps do come out of my throat, but some how grow back again..... this is very strange to me!!! That I know of , its been going on for the past couple months.... but it goes and comes.     If you can help at all, We are very concerned on what these might be!!!!!! Especially after not doing anything with any one!!!!!!! We do not want to go to the doctor right now, since we do not have any insurance and are poor college students, so we wanted to ask for help and see if we really should fork out the money and go!!!!  Thank you so much!!!!! and have a great day!!!!!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi!  From your description, I feel this could be pharyngitis. Have you tried frequent warm saline gargle? And I don't think that has anything to do with sex, of any kind. If one finds white patches or plaques that can be wiped off, then it could be fungal. In which case, a decreased immunity or diabetes or use of steroids may be the reasons.  If fever and pain on swallowing set in, it would be prudent to consult with a doctor on antibiotics. Meanwhile, Tylenol or Advil may be used for the pain.  I hope this helps.  Warm regards,  bill\n\n",

She told me that the tonsils have crypts (or holes) in them. When you eat sometimes your food can get into the crypts and your tonsils produce these \"white smelly things\". If it begins to bother you, start gargleing after eating and keep good oral heath after meals. Thats pretty much all the advice i have, so take care and don't worry too much.                                              Sugar\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I have had a similar problem for about 7 months now. My taste buds seem to stand out at the back of my mouth and have had a whiteish coating on my tongue. I went to the doc about 5 months ago now who gave me nyastatin which didnt really work. I was then told it probably wasnt thrush and to see a dentist who just told me to brush my tongue at the back. After this my results for a swab came back which showd a case of mild thrush, and was told it was nothing to worry about. As i still seem to have this prob on and off for a while should i see the doc again?  Brushing my tongue appears to get most of the white stuff off however it leaves me with a rough feeling at the back of my throat.what could it be? Should i be worried? thanks so much for your help\n\n",

I saw a small white lumpish thing near a flap in my tonsils on the left. I got a flash light and picked it out easily. it did not hurt but it bled a bit. the small lump looked kind of \"cottage cheesy\" but was rubbery and crumbled. It smelt really bad and I kind of figured it was some food that had got caught in my saliva gland or something. For the last week I had the same feeling(this is three months later) and found anouther one in the same place. same look and smell. I have been trying to find some indication on all the internet MD sites but none really fit untill I read  this site. I am leaning towards some bacteria infection like strep which comes closest to the symptoms I have found. I am going to see a doc in a few days because none of the leads lead to anything good as far as I can see.\n\n",

I usually get sick of the taste it leaves in my mouth, etc so if I can't see them I cough them out. I am pregnant now, but after I have the baby I am going to try to get my tonsils out, it is well worth it just to feel better about myself. I went to the doctor once, she told me it is food that sits there in the holes/crypts  of your tonsils that decays. It is so nasty! I am so glad that I am not alone though, I just hope insurance will cover the surgery.\n\n",

    "content": "Please help me!  I have been to several specialist but no one has found the problem yet.  I think I am being treated for each symptom separately.  I have been having problems for about a year.  It started with a skin infection, which at first I thought to be an allergic reaction to possibly new laundry detergent, or bath soap.  It started out small with an area on my chest, and has since moved to my arms, back, and neck.  The dermatologist says it is folloculitis, (spelling), and is treating it with a sulpher drug.  But it is not clearing up.  The dermatologist took a biopsy the other day to send it off to be tested for yeast.  I get the results in two weeks.  I am also being treated by a cardiologist for heart palpations.  These are daily and started about three months ago.  The cardio doc has me on Toprol.  I am also suffering from extreme fatigue.  Which I have been told by the rheumatologist that I have fibromaylga.  I can hardy lift my arms somedays, and I feel like there is a fifty pound weight on both arms, and legs.   I am being treated by a psychiatist for major depression with Zoloft and Wellbutrin. Along with all this, I have been having a problem with my throat, and tongue.  When I swallow, my throat hurts, and it feels like something is in the right side.  My tongue is sore and feels like I burned it.  It also feels like I bite it.  The throat and tongue problem has been going on about two and a half to three months.   I have had a series of blood test.  But nothing shows up. Oh, I forgot the Endocrinologist.  I saw him yesterday, and he says I have all the symptoms of Thryoid disease, except the blood test doesn't indicate that.  My TSH is normal.  Could the blood test be wrong?  I have been tested several times, and it is the same. Did I also mention, I am feeling clammy and sweaty most days?  I can be sitting still, in a cold room, and still be hot.  It is not menopause, since I had all the major parts taken out in 1990. I feel like all these problems are related.  What is wrong with me?  Please help!!!! CH\n\n",

    "title": "Odor From Groin Area....",
    "content": "I have had a severe problem now for several months and have been looking for some type of answer.  This first started in mid January when I went to the doctors for an infection on my face (yellow/crusty/pimple-like).  My doctor said it was a strep bacteria or something and that I had caught it from the gym.  I was then prescribed an antibiotic (cephalexin) and a cream (bactroban).  The infection went away on my face but not for long.  When it came back they prescribed the same medication for me.  I then started getting other symptoms such as itching, burning, and an extreme foul odor from the groin area (rotten eggs).  I then saw several doctors and dermatologist and have recently been diagnosed with Candida yeast infection (I think caused by the repeated use of the antibiotic).  My dermatologist says I have 3 things; 1) Yeast infection Candida in the groin area, 2) Extreme case of eczema, and 3) the thing on my face that started it all.  For the past few weeks I have now been using Loprox Tropical Suspension with zinc oxide ointment over it, protopic ointment for the eczema, and benz clin for my face.  Also, I did a home test I saw online for candida.  It said to spit some saliva in the morning before drinking or eating anything into a clear glass of water.  Then it said if your saliva strings down to the bottom you have candida, healthy saliva floats at the top.  My stringed down to the bottom.  Does this mean I have candida internally or in the mouth?  I have never had severe health problems so I am not sure it all of this is interrelated.  My eczema and face infection seem to be going away but the major groin problem with the odor is still there.  It seems as though when I describe this to a doctor they don\u2019t seem to know how bad it can smell and think Im crazy or something.  This is definitely not normal and I can assure you it is not a hygiene or body odor problem.  The smell is not constant and comes in waves almost like passing gas.  This is extremely embarrassing and is effecting my life and my job.  Is this odor from the candida or is it something else?  If so, how can I limit the odor (if you can) and how long will it take to eliminate the problem.  Thanks for you help.....\n\n",

    "content": "The full name of your condition is a fistula-in-ano which is an abnormal communication between the anal canal and the skin surrounding the anus. It usually arises as a complication of an infection in one of the anal glands. The diagnosis is based on a history of continuous or intermittent faecal-smelling discharge on the skin around the anal margin, followed by the finding of an external opening on the skin and an internal opening in the anal canal.   The condition can only be treated surgically. It is important to determine the condition giving rise to a fistula because an association with ulcerative colitis, Crohn\u2019s disease and tuberculosis is sometimes established.

    "content": "I feel like I have this problem to just by reading your post..I started having this odor problem after a major surgery 9 yrs ago.  I went to doctor after doctor, at first they said it was a bacterial infection and just treat it with meds.  But it would just come back.  I kept going back to the doctors and they said it basically was all in my head, kinda like you said they thought you were crazy.  So finally I just gave up and have been living with it ever since.  Yes this has ruened my life and not to mention sex life.  This is somthing horrible to live with.  But what concerns me the most is the history of diagnoses which included ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease and tuberculosis.  I had a lower colinoscopy 2yrs ago that didn't show anything.  And I don't have tuberculosis and I don't think I have Crohn's.  So what could be the cause of this problem how do you get it and how does this get diagnosed.  I have had my gynacologist check me down there and she doesn't see anything.  I had her check because thats exacally what I thought that there had to be a tear between my vagina and anus due to the surgery.  Because that is exacually what is smells like fesis.  And yes I am an extremely clean person. So are there more accurate test to diagnosed this if there is please let me know ASAP.  I am so desparate to get this taken care so I can lead a normal life.  I woudn't wish this on my worse enemy.  By the way I am 35 and had 2 children with this problem as well.   Thank you.\n\n",

If it's a similar condition to jock itch,(but not fungal in origin)  dermatits or seborrheic dermatitis (sort of like scalp dandruff) is a consideration. A medicated shampoo (for seborrheic dermatitis) containing selenium sulfide etc. is used as treatment along with hydrocortisone creme for itching. Regardless of the cause if you have not had the area evaluated I would certainly suggest you do so for the appropriate treatment. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

Lesions in uncircumcised males are moist but in circumcised patients they are often dry with scaling (peeling) of the skin. Candidiasis of the penis is usually caused by vaginal thrush in a sexually active male who is not diabetic. Vaginal thrush is not a sexually transmitted disease, but can be, but is not always, passed on to a partner during sex.  Take your partner for a check-up and get treated if the diagnosis is confirmed.

    "content": "This is very suggestive of vaginal thrush, also known as yeast infection or candidiasis.  The most common signs of thrush are itching and burning, but soreness, swelling of the vagina and vulva, and whitish discharge may occur. You may have one symptom or several, and symptoms can range from mild to severe.  Vaginal thrush is not a sexually transmitted infection. If you have never had sex, you can still get thrush - but sex may play a role in the development of thrush. Penetrative sex can irritate the vagina, particularly when there is little lubrication.  Get examined for confirmation.    Dr Anthony Solomon Consultant Physician, Tropical & Genitourinary Medicine\n\n",

    "title": "Rash, Itching, Abnormal Growth",
    "content": "I have reddness and itching in both armpits, the left side being more severe.  Started more than five years ago.  I have tried to prvent myself from itching but it gets so botersome that I just start itching, and tend not to stop until the itching is replaced by pain due to the destruction of the surface of the skin. As a result of this condition the skin under my left arm has actually raised as if it were welted.  I have not consulted a physician regarding this or the other matters that will be mentioned below.  I have not been able to find a deodorant / anitperspirant that I do not have an allergic reaction to, therefore I do not use them.  Attempts to try different soaps (e.g. bath, laundry) have proven to be unfruitful.    I also have very intense itching on the left side and above the genitilia.  Started about the same time as the underarm itching did.  I am thinking that both might perhaps be related.  I do not know.  One last ailment.  The toenails of the big toe on each foot have abnormal color.  Left is an off white/pale yellow.  The right is considerably disfigured and has odd coloration (black/brown/touches of yellow).  It is growing to the right and has become quite thick.  It has grown passed the edge of the toe.  Clippers have proven ineffective due to the thickness.  I have attempted to break the edge off with needle nose pliers.  The end result was bleeding around both sides of the nail and a lot of pain.  The nail is actually damaging nearly every sock that adorn my feet.  I have been in the hospital for other illnesses or problems (celulitus) and a few Doctors have mentioned that I have a nail fungus which can be treated with medication.  I have not received any perscriptions for the fungus, because that was not something I addressed when checking in/registering with Triage.  What suggestions do you have for me regarding the underarm, genitilia problems?  Can I take anything over-the-counter?\n\n",

I read everything i could find online but didn't see anything that quit matched. The bumps are pinsized and they don't hurt. I can use my fingernails to squeeze out a hard little white core inside of these bumps, after that it bleeds.  Then again what i read suggested possibly an ingrown hair or something simular but the bumps are not sore and a new bump appeared on the (former inner foreskin layer?) the area right under my gland. And as far as i know a hair should never grow there so i don't think that's the cause of these bumps. I'm circumsized, I'm gay and have been enjoying a monogamose relationship for over 6 months and he has been tested clean so i don't think its an std. We have anal intercourse a few times a week.

Later, when the spots enlarge, they often have a waxy, pinkish look with a small central pit. Sometimes there are as many as a hundred spots on one individual.  The lesions usually go away in 9-12 months and in many cases no specific treatment is necessary.   Molluscum is caused by a Pox Virus and commonly effects children.  It is usually spread from person to person by direct skin contact and often effects the genital area in adults.  It is not usually considered an STD (although it can be transmitted sexually) and can even be spread through sharing bath towels or equipment in a gym, etc.  If you would like to look at some diagnostic photos you should check out http://www.molluscum.com/diagnosticphotos.htm\n\n",

Wear socks made of a cotton material and if your feet sweat change them. Wash socks in hot water becauses the kills the fungus. Use powder (that doesn't contain cornstarch) to help keep feet dry. I have read a couple of studies using a creme (tea tree oil and butenafine) which is suppose to be effective for nail fungus. Ask your physician or dermatologist about this particular creme and keep in mind that they may be able to give you additional insight on treatment options availabe aside from oral medications.

    "content": "My son is a resident of the Phoenix metro area and had a sore toe. It progressed to the point of his going to the emergency room (day 1). While there, it was diagnosed that he had severe osteomyelitis. They drew a sample of the infected area and sent it to the lab. He was admitted to the hospital and given high levels of antibiotics. They appeared to contain the infection to the site. After amputating the toe on day 5, he was sent home to recuperate. At the hospital, he had an orthopedic surgeon, an infectious disease doctor, and an internist. On day 11, while at home, he received a call from the lab which had drawn the initial sample, they stated that the culture showed that he had Valley Fever which is a fungal infection and very common to that part of the US. Valley Fever is oftentimes appears as a respiratory illness. In this case, he didn't remember really feeling ill at any other time. None of the doctors at the hospital even mentioned this as a possibility. What type of follow-up should he have?\n\n",

A lot of persistent phone calls and copies of everything to ensure nothing got lost in the 'system.' My son is now on the standard 400 mg. a day of flucanazole (sp.?) with the goal of his not contracting meningitis from this nasty little spore.

    "title": "fluconazole (Diflucan)",
    "content": "Thank you for letting me know about your son, I hope he is doing well.  Just a quick note here for anyone taking fluconazole  Fluconazole (Diflucan)is an antifungal medication. It is used to treat fungal infections. . Do not take fluconazole if you are taking cisapride (Propulsid), this could cause serious, even fatal heart proplems. Talk to your Physician prior to stopping any medications.  Notify your doctor immediately if you develop nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, unusual fatigue, loss of appetite, yellow skin or eyes, itching, dark urine, or clay colored stools. These symptoms may be early signs of liver damage.In rare cases, fluconazole has also caused severe skin rash, sometimes resulting in death from anaphylaxis.  Symptoms of a fluconazole overdose include confusion, hallucinations, paranoia, decreased movement, decreased breathing, tearing eyes, drooling, urinary incontinence, seizures, and may cause death.  Avoid alcohol or use it in moderation while taking fluconazole. Alcohol and fluconazole can both affect the liver.  Use caution when driving or performing other hazardous activities. Fluconazole may cause dizziness. If you experience dizziness, avoid these activities.  Before taking fluconazole, tell your doctor if you are taking any other medicines, especially any of the following:  an oral diabetes medicine such as glipizide (Glucotrol), glyburide (Diabeta, Micronase, Glynase), tolbutamide (Orinase), tolazamide (Tolinase), chlorpropamide (Diabinese), and others; warfarin (Coumadin); phenytoin (Dilantin, others); cyclosporine (Sandimmune, Neoral); tacrolimus ((Prograf); rifabutin (Mycobutin) or rifampin (Rifadin, Rimactane); or theophylline (Theo-Dur, Theolair, Theochron, Elixophyllin, Slo-Phyllin, others); or astemizole (Hismanal).  You may not be able to take fluconazole, or you may require a dosage adjustment or special monitoring during treatment if you are taking any of the medicines listed above.\n\n",

    "title": "Horrible throat pain and Sore Tongue",
    "content": "Hello:  I really need help regarding a potential thrush problem. First let me tell you a little history. Around 8 months ago I gave birth my a beautiful son. I soon discovered after giving birth that my son had oral thrush, which I inturn from breast feedlng contracted it on my nipples and eventually on my tongue (oral). Went through the Nystatin swishes and diflucan treatment and seemed to contain it for awhile.  Since this time, my health has completely detoriated, I have had swollen inflammed joints in my arms, wrists, hands, knees, ankles, hips and every other joint in my body. I have seen a orthopedic surgeon due to a knee injury about a month after I had my son and after 2 MRI's he believes my joint pain is being caused by a form of arthritis.  I do agree that I may have developed some type of arthritis, I have ALL the classic signs and have a Rheumy appt set up for Feb. My family physician has put me on 10 mg of Prednisone and it truly has helped me.  Well now back to my current problem, since all this has been going on, I noticed that my thrush has come back, at least that is what I want to believe it is. I have the classic white patchy film on my tongue and it is extremely red underneath. It actually bleeds when i brush it. The problem I am having a hard time understanding is my throat is completely raw and it is beginning to get hard to swallow. It almost feels like their is something stuck in my throat. Also my ears have been completely painful for the last two months, I went to my family physician and she said I had an ear infection in both ears (which i have not had since I was child) and gave me antibiotics. However, after taking these, the infection has still not cleared up.   I realize that taking a variety of medicanes can cause yeast build up and could enhance the thrush problem, as well as the steroid usage, but I cannot seem to get rid of this ongoing battle of it. Besides the two main antifungal medications is there any other recommended treatment for thrush? I know having a yeast free diet can help too, and I have been doing that, but it still will not go away.  Also, do you think possibly my throat problems could be directly correlated to the thrush on my tongue and could it affect my ears as well? I also have continued to have profuse sweating issues since my son was born, is this also a symptoms of thrush? Tingling in mouth, tongue and lips, thrush related? Cough and all over achiness?  I really just need answers and would LOVE to be able to feel like myself again. Any help is greatly appreciated on this issue!\n\n",

If you have thrush in your mouth it's is quite possible you could also have thrush in you throat and that is what's causing the soreness there, so yes, in my opinion they are directly related.

    "content": "Hello Rntdj:  Thank you so much for responding to me. To answer your first question, yes I have been tested for diabetes, as well as a sleuth of other tests including Lupus, CBC, thryoid, parathryoid, liver function, kidney function tests and so forth. Everything came back normal besides my alkaline phosphate test where it showed my enzymes being slightly elevated. I was tested 3 months later as well and they were still slightly elevated. My doctor proceeded to do a isoenyzme breakdown and it showed no significant outcome to my bone or liver as being the culprit for the elevated enzymes.  I have had two cat scans done, on my pelvis and abdomen region for severe back pain and all over aches and the only outcome of these is a small cyst on my right ovary and a benign cyst on my liver which I have been assured can come from woman of child bearing years which I am.  The sweating just seems to happen when I start moving too much, if I exert myself at all is when it occurs. At first I thought it was just hormone related because I was breastfeeding for several months, however it has not disappeared and the thrush has only gotten worse.  You mentioned you believe their could be a link between the thrush and my throat? Do you believe it has gone down my throat possibly? I have been on Nystatin swishes for months now and cannot get rid of it. As well as rounds of diflucan. I have had reoccuring yeast infections, where it has gotten so bad I was referred to a urologist. After speaking with that specialist and cultures and ultrasounds, again I am left with no answers.  I just do not feel at all like myself, I am EXTREMELY tired all the time, I have no energy what so ever, The tingling in my lips and soreness on my tongue and throat have drove me crazy. I just cannot seem to get rid of all these problems. I notice too when i sweat I seem to have an odor that comes along with it...not like a body odor but a different type of odor (I guess I would have a hard time describing it)  As I mentioned, I may also have some form of arthrits as well. I do not know if this is all connected somehow but I really do not believe the thrush and arthritis is. I also have noticed a harder time breathing lately, and I have been coughing up more phlegm as well as having a tickle in my throat. I am not sick, as in strep or bronchitis or the common cold, I just have these symptoms.   Again, any help would be appreciated. I am truly at my wits end, I just really want to feel better. I am only 34 years old and at times I feel like I am 80.\n\n",

I guess I just really do not understand how all this yeast stuff could cause so many ailments? I am just wondering if it actually is something other than thrush? I am also thinking about going to any ENT for an evaluation. The other DX's I can think of correlating to this would be Mono, Lyme Disease, or some sort of cancer. I noticed I have a swelling (lump) on or slightly above my right side of my collar bone. I did some research to see that it could also be a lymph node located there....\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Hopeful110670, I wouldn't think that yeast overgrowth would cause an earache. However, in regards to most of your other symptoms including the joint pain, in my opinion, sounds yeast related. Immune compromised systems caused by any reason from excessive stress, hormone imbalance, underactive thyroid, immune deficiency can create an evironment for overwhelming growth of yeast. It also sounds like since you have been being treated for months with your current therapy and  the yeast may be somewhat resistant/resilient. You also mentioned that you have changed your diet. Have you ever been prescribed to take Acidophillus? Acidophillus controls candida (yeast) by making the intestinal tract more acidic to discourage the growth of candida, and by producing hydrogen peroxide, which directly kills candida. As for your question regarding a lymph node in the area of your collar bone, yes, there are lymph nodes in that region. Among your other symptoms do you have skin symptoms as well? You mentioned some of the blood work that has been done but has an immune assay ever been completed? Have you been referred to a specialist (hematologist, oncologist etc.) by your family physician? If you have not been, I would certainly keep this as in consideration. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

To answer some of your questions, I have not been put on Acidophillus, my doctor has never suggested it. I will make sure to mention this to her. Also as far as an immune assay goes, I am not quite sure what this is, could you please elaborate more on this subject. The only thing besides the previous tests I had mentioned I was test for was AIDS/HIV and that came back normal. I do not believe any other \"immune\" tests were done. I have not been referred to a hematologist, oncologist ither. I know what a oncologist is. Is the hematologist a blood specialist? I am wondering if the lymph node in my collar bone could be swelled due to my immune system being down from the meds and the thrush?  You had mentioned the joint pain could be associated as well to the yeast, is this a common symptoms of yeast overgrowth? I can tell you that their is definately inflammation going on because when I do not take the prednisone, I ache so bad that I can barely walk. I have burning all over my body, especially in my hands and legs. I can barely move my fingers.  I did notice the other day that I have skin irritation, almost a scaley, dry area that has formed on the underside of my forearms. I have never had this before and it should up about a week ago. The only reason I noticed it was due that it started itching and I could feel it.  It almost seems like every other day my throat is sore, it will even feel fine throughout the day somedays and then it hits me and it becomes sore. Sometimes on one side and sometimes on the other. It is hard to swallow and their is a burning feeling, almost like if you had acid in your throat. I notice after the Nystatin treatment the symptoms seem to disappait for awhile.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Hopeful, An immune assay or immunoassay is a specific test performed on blood and other body fluids as well to check for certain substances of the immune system. Some of the things it tests for is HIV, Lyme disease, autoimmune disorders, systemic lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, tests for certain cancers including leukemia and multiple myeloma etc. Yeast overgrowth causes a multitude of problems and if the immune system stays weakened long enough it can spread to all parts of the body. Some of these as  follows - fatigue, headaches, coughing, wheezing, joint swelling, arthritis, muscle aches, hives and rashes, eczema, etc. etc. In answer to your question, a hematologist is a blood specialist.  I am quite concerned especially since this is such a long standing unresolved problem. Since the HIV test came back negative I would hope your family doctor will send you to a specialist for some investigation to rule out the cause.I have also forwarded this to one of the doctors on the forum so that you may have a more definitative opinion.

However that does not mean that it is not positive still. My grandmother also has RA and hers did not show up until it had progressed very far along and something to do with her sed rate. This is why I am going to see a Rheumy doctor.  However, as you said, I have not been tested for the other things that I am aware of, and I have not been referred out. I agree that this thrush problem as gone on for way too long. It has been non stop for around 8 months ever since my baby was born. It has only gotten worse. Matter of fact when I went to my FP she did not believe I had thrush in my mouth, I made her do a culture and of course it came back positive. But at this point it is very obvious in my mouth, she would have not denying it. I had saw my urologist and told her about my problems with the thrush coming back and she said, Oh let me take a quick look in your mouth. I opened up my mouth and right away she was like, Oh my...yes, you have it, their is quite a considerable amount of white film on our tongue and gave me another round of Nystatin....

I am not doing anything besides sitting and walking from room to room in my house. Absolutely NO exerction. Could someone please explain the reasons I could be sweating for no apparent reason? This has been going on for around 8 months now, on and off. It seems to get worse at times and then other times it is not as noticeable.  Also, I noticed when I coughed this morning that their was much more drainage (phlegm) coughed up then usual. I also noticed it had a few streaks (tiny) spots of blood mixed in. Should I be concerned? Could it possibly be from my nose? I have noticed too when I blow my nose there can be blood in it and I just assume it is from my house being so dry and my nasal passages being dry as well.  Lastly, I did mention to the nurse that I did have a chest xray done (wherein contrast had been injected in me due to a cat scan the same day...not for my chest though) anyways, I am curious to know if a chest xray would notice any masses no matter how small they are? Or do I need to request a low dose cat from my family physician? I am not sure if I should feel comfortable with just the results of the chest xray. I also had an abdomen ct done and I wondered if that would show any part of my lungs?  Okay, sorry for all the questions, I just need to know what direction to head in.\n\n",

After giving this much consideration, when I mentioned before about you being referred to an oncologist or hematologist, maybe the best place to start would be an Infectious disease specialist who deals specifically with chronic (long term) infections. Would your family physician be agreeable to referring you to someone in your area? I still think that infections that aren't responding to current treatment and all treatment methods have failed, taking into consideration that your symptoms appear to be worsening, your family physician needs to refer you to someone that can identify the and treat the problem.

Drenching night sweats also are a hallmark of chronic toxemia (reaction to the infection or whatever that is that is producing those toxins in the body).  i totally agree with Theresa that you should evaluated by an infectious disease specialist as soon as possible.  What could cause this problem? You could have a chronic sinus infection or urinary tract infection caused by yeasts that is causing all these problems.   Regarding the joint problem, this could be a reaction to the infection that you have and this is called reactive arthritis. i think you have most of its symptoms, the pain in the joints all over the body, back pain and it is also known to cause skin and eye problems.  Regarding the prednisone, the yeast will not go away, i think, till the prednisone is stopped. i am also not a fan of using prednisone until a definitive diagnosis is established as it sometimes counfounds the clinical picture and makes things more confusing than they already are.  i am not though in a position to tell you whether or not to stop to stop the prednisone because prednisone is like magic to patients who have inflammation but we have to look at the bigger picture.  You never said what happened to the oral thrush that was affecting your son and whether or not the nipple thrush was successfully treated.  You sound chronically ill to me and this has to be taken care of and i think the only way is to be seen by an infectious disease specialist and let's wait for the rheumatology appointment.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped and please, don't hesitate to post your concerns.  Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you Doc, I am going to make an appt with an infectious disease specialist as you have mentioned. As far as the nipple yeast, that is gone as well as my sons. I stopped breastfeeding around a month ago due to the medicanes I was taking.  I do not necessarily have night sweats, it is just constant sweating for no apparent reason throughout the day. I can just be sitting there and I sweat. Of course it gets worse if I start working on something in the house or walk. I am as you stated very ill and extremely lethargic. That is the worst part of it besides the joint pain. I could sleep all day long...I have NO energy whatsoever and it takes literally all of my strength to do things, like clean the house.  I am so tired of being sick and not having any answers, I will immediately try and get in to see a doc. Also, I have heard that diabetes could be another indication of a chronic yeast infection. My husband is convinced this is what it is...but I did have some blood test and she said I did not have it. Although I read that you can take the glucose serum test and that could diagnose it too. I wanted to let you know with my son I had hypoglcemia which i still believe I do. It is just so funny that ALL of these symptoms started after my son was born. I never had any of them prior to him being born. Including the yeast infections, which i just got another one today, and the thrush or the joint pain. I believe it is all connected and is a result of me giving birth somehow?  Well thank you and I again appreciate your help on this subject!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Ali, Two of the tests used to diagnose Diabetes are a fasting blood glucose level after an overnight fast. Blood is drawn first thing in the morning to check blood sugar levels. An oral glucose tolerance test, one is given a very sweet tasting drink and having their blood drawn at increments of 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours and 3 hours after consuming the substance. Generally the result of a person that does not have Diabetes, their blood sugar rises quickly and then by the end of the test returns to normal range because of insulin produced by the pancreas. As for giving birth being connected to your other ailments, the event alone causes many changes in the body and in my opinion it could have\" triggered\" (Not caused) something that compromised your immune system.  Sincerely, Theresa (Rntdj)\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you Theresa for your explanation. I guess that leads me to my next question. When my doctor supposedly did a diabetes test I did not fast at all prior to the test for the blood glucose level test. I really am not 100% sure she even did a test to check me. I was in the ER with pain when I was awaiting \"general blood work\" results from my family doc when the ER doctor told me I would have probably been tested. (I am not sure if that just made any sense or not?) What I can tell you is that I have only had the blood work done for the other things I had mentioned earlier.  Now as far as the oral glucose tolerance test, I did have a test like this when I was pregnant and I did the one hour test. Well that came back signficantly high and so they had me preform the 3 hour test and what ended up happening is that by the time those three hours where up, and I was about to leave, they told me to make sure I eat something. Well my husband and I barely made it to the resturaunt and I started feeling extremely weak and naseau's. I told him I could not eat anything and I felt I was going to pass out. To make a long story short, I almost did pass out...to find out I actually \"crashed\" according to my doctor and that my levels agreed with how I felt.  It was my understanding I was hypoglycemic....however, my husband all along has been thinking I am diabetic. Should I request a specific test to check for diabetes? It is my understanding that a long lasting \"chronic\" yeast infection could be caused by diabetes.  Thank you again and by the way, I am awaiting a phone call from my doctors so that they will refer me to an infectious disease specialist practice I have found. Keeping my fingers crossed........\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Ali,  Thank you very much for the update.  Incorrect assumptions are one's worst enemies. Unless you are sure of what was and was not, say i think that this was done or was not because diagnosis is totally dependant on what the patient tells the doctor, it directs the thought process towards a certain path and along the path, ceratin possibilities are dropped and this is dependant once more on the patient's history and physical examination and tests. However, please make sure what did your obstetrician think about the results of your oral glucose tolerance test.   Please, test your blood sugar not only to check for diabetes but because prednisone causes increase in the blood sugar as well.  The diagnosis of diabetes depends on finding one of the following:  1. Symptoms of diabetes (drinking a lot, urinating a lot and weight loss) plus random (without regard to time since last meal) glucose concentration >200 mg/dl. 2. Fasting glucose >126 mg/dl/ 3. Abnormal oral glucose tolerance test.  There is also a test that has nothing to do with the diagnosis of diabetes i.e. whether it is normal or abnormal is not a crieterion for the diagnosis of diabetes. This test is called hemoglobin a1c. It shows how well your body controlled blood sugar over the last 3 months, it might be useful.

    "content": "Thank you Doctor and Theresa for the explanation of diabetes, it is very helpful. I will make sure to find out the correct diagnoses with my doctors on this subject and be retested if need be.  Just an update, I have called my doctors office and they are avoiding helping me. I called the last 2 days to try and get to see if the doctor would refer me to an infectious disease specialist I found locally.  Each time I call they assure me they are working on it. Well unfortunately there is nothing to be working on. Since my insurance changed I do not need a \"referral\" persae...but according to the specialist that I called directly, I do need the doctor to request I go there and give them my medical records.  It truly has been a nightmare these last 8 months dealing with my doctors office. As of Monday, I am having my husband pick up a copy of all my medical records and am taking them elsewhere. I am very very sick and cannot get a diagnoses. It just keeps getting worse. I have been shaking more lately, and my joints and sweating are getting worse. I literally feel like a \"Mack\" truck ran me over 2 days ago. I had done some very simple tasks around the house, laundry and putting away Christmas items\" and woke up yesterday and could barely move. My left knee was so bad I could not put any weight on it. I feel I am getting sicker and sicker and feel like my life could literally be taken away from me at any given moment.  Sorry to be so graphic, it is I just have reached my breaking point. I am so frustrated and am getting more depressed as each day goes by. I finally lost it and cried last night to my husband....I try and be so strong everyday and I just do not have the strength anymore...it is so sad to feel this way and feel so helpless.  Alright, again thank you for listening, this board has been so helpful and so compassionate to me and has really gotten me through alot of tough times the last few weeks. You all should be commended for your helpfulness...!\n\n",

Even though every thing points out to an organic disease process, i still can feel that there is an element of depression and you have all the right to be depressed because of your suffering over the last 8 months, in addition to the resonsibilities of the new born. May be you should take it easier on yourself and stop blaming yourself for your suffering. There is no need to whip yourself.  Please, don't try to overwhelm yourself with work if you can not do it. i think your husband is going to be very understanding. If any of your family members is living around and can help, don't hesitate to contact them.  i don't think you even have to wait for an appointment to go to a doctor if you feel so sick, you can just go to the hospital and see whether or not they would consider admitting you.

    "content": "Hi Doctor:  Thank you for the concern of depression, however like you mentioned, the depression is from the frustration of 8 months of dealing with these symptoms and getting nowhere.   I agree I am very depressed over my situation but am not depressed as in the sense of manic depression or any of the other categories....   As far as going to the hospital, when I was there a month or so ago in extreme pain, they sent me right back to my doctors and said that she needed to do the follow up work for referrals or specialists. So unfortunately the hospital scenerio will not work. I am not sure if you misunderstood my earlier post, but I did not in anyway mean that I would take my own life or anything. I reread my post and thought perhaps this is how you might of understood it...I meant that this infection has taken over my daily life and it is almost impossible for me to be myself anymore. I used to jog and workout almost everyday and now I can barely make it out of bed and function at times.  I am very fortunate that my husband works and I am self employed that I can work my own hours, I could not imagine going to my previous job as a Paralegal on a daily basis.  Well again, thank you for your concern and I will keep you up to date on the transition of doctors...  Take care\n\n",

    "content": "Hello:  I just wanted to give you all an update on what is going on with me. Well, I was smart and decided to switch doctors. I find a local doctor that I am impressed with so far. I had my initial consultation yesterday and made sure to bring all my test results and paperwork I had been keeping concerning my condition.  We had a very long talk and we decided to go in the direction of more blood work taken, including diabetes test and sed rate level test and a few other common tests. After he gets the results back of those, I will be referred out to a infectious disease specialist, if nothing comes back significant    He decided to switch me from prednisone to Naproxen. He stated that me taking prednisone would only worsen my symptoms of yeast and if I had diabetes would only worsen that condition as well.  So far the Naproxen is helping, but I do have a question, I noticed on the pamphlet that was given to me that stomach pain could be a side effect of the drug. He put me on 500mg and I have made sure to eat when taking the medicane. However, I have noticed I have been extremely naseaus since taking it. I am not 100% sure it is being caused by the drug or not. I guess I would need to take it longer to realize that the naseau is from the meds, I am just curious to know if this is a common side effect and if so, is this something I should report to my doctor and discontinue use? I thought for sure I was going to throw up last night before bed and this morning I am still feeling the same way. I had taken a total of 1000mg yesterday. Lastly, I have noticed, when I take these anti inflammatory drugs at first, I always seem to have a burning sensation at the areas of joint pain and inflammation, is this common as well? It eventually goes away, but it is quite uncomfortable at the beginning. I told my husband it almost feels like the drug is attacking the bad areas.  Thank you again for all of your help and support and I look forward to hearing from you soon.  Take care\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Ali,  Thank you very much for the update.  It is very important to have a doctor in which you have confidence and with which you can have a rapport and to whom you can ask any question at any time. A fruitful and productive doctor/patient relationship is the first step to pinning down the patient's problems and then treating them hopefully successfully.  i believe that stopping the prednisone is a step in the right direction. And i think that you should be referred to an infectious disease specialist regardless of the tests' results but i will leave this to you and your doctor to discuss and decide.  Naproxen can cause nausea. Take the naproxen always on a full stomach and never on an empty stomach because naproxen and the group of medications to which it belongs can harm your stomach real bad.  If the nausea still occurs when you take it on a full stomach, i think you should call your doctor so that he can decide according to your symptoms whether you need to be treated with just over the counter medications or a prescription medication to make the nausea go away.  Regarding the feeling that you feel in your joints, i don't have an answer for this one.   Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.

I have still not been feeling good and have been nauseas with pretty bad headaches as well.  Honestly, I just started noticing these symptoms after the new meds so I believe this may be what is causing them. I am going to try and wait a few days and see if symptoms disappate and if so, I will assume it is the meds and will call my doctor to discuss new treatment options.  Well, the good news is I received a phone call this morning from a certain doctor to reschedule an appt for this coming Monday. I had never heard of the doctor so I look up on my notes the name of the infectious disease doctors I had listed and sure enough it is one of them on my list! I was really happy. My new doctors went ahead with the referral and I received my appt. I am extremely happy!  Again, thank you both for your helpfulness and wonderful advice.

    "content": "Hi Hopeful110670,  I recognize some of the symptoms you've described because I've been struggling with some of the same things for about the last eight months. You may have the same thing I do. I went through several months of doctors telling me what I didn't have, but not being able to say what I did have. Extremely frustrating! Finally, through many hours of internet exploring and comparing lists of symptoms, I'm pretty sure I have a systemic Candida yeast overgrowth, and have found relief. Apparently, MDs are trained mainly to identify very specific sets of symptoms, but Candidiasis has a very wide variability of symptoms. And since Candida is normally present in everyone's digestive tract, it's hard to test for too. I had a lot of strange and seemingly unrelated symptoms. I especially identified with your description of the extreme fatigue. It was like nothing I'd ever felt before-- a very strong 'near death' feeling.   The most useful thing I've found so far is drastic change in my diet. And of those changes, absolutely THE MOST EFFECTIVE thing I've done is to eliminate sugars from my diet (because yeast loves sugar). All sugars-- including honey, corn sweeteners, even fruit. Check the nutrition labels on everything you buy and try to stay below 8 grams of sugar per day. I also reduced other carbs too. I've eliminated all dairy too, but some people may not need to do that. After just a few days of this I felt tremendous relief of symptoms, and as the yeast died off I kept feeling better and better. There are other dietary things and supplements you should do too, so if you need more info, let me know, or websurf-- there's lots out there.  I'm not completely cured though, because if I'm not very careful about what I eat, the symptoms come back (and I do want to eat sweets again someday!).  But I AM feeling much better and pretty much back to normal most of the time. Some websites say if you're very careful about staying on an anti-Candida diet for about 3 to 6 months, you can kick it completely. Others say just go ahead and kill all the yeast with some drug like Diflucan. I still haven't decided which of those two options I'm going to do.  I also tried a product called ParaGone. It is effective at killing off the yeast and relieving symptoms, but it wasn't a complete cure for me either, and during its one month treatment period, it caused some unpleasant side effects.  Good Luck!\n\n",

    "content": "I have PM'd many people on this issue.... thanks Cooljazz for pointing out what is clearly to me Intestinal candidiasis for a start.... I too have it.  I also control mine by eliminating all the obvious sugars I can (don't forget sodas, and ANYTHING that comes in a package, you would be surprised).  Substitute sweetness with Splenda, not the other crap like aspartame.  I also take 5 Yeast Fighters by Twinlab every day, and NSI Olive Leaf Extract (cheapest price for both is vitacost.com) and this helps no end with the yeast battle.  Eat fresh garlic with everything you can.  Ditch the Pill, antibiotics, prednisone/steroids and if you can alcohol and dairy.  Hard isn't it?  But worth it for your life back??  I think so     After suffereing this for 10+ years I feel a hundred times better, that does not mean I am cured but it's under control.  Candidiasis can also present such symptoms as  depression muscle aches chronic fatigue general decreased energy levels/lethargy poor memory  I was wrongly diagnosed with depression for FOUR YEARS and medicated for it.   Purchase ANY book on yeast by Willam G Crook - try amazon, 2nd hand copies start at $1.50  Hope this helps all you yeast sufferers who don't realise they have it.  The books have a good diagnostic questionnaire.\n\n",

    "content": "Try treating it like an open skin abrasion at first and see if that helps. Get some Desitin diaper rash cream (its white and thick) unattractive but affective and apply to the dried off, raw area as often as needed during the day. Wear underwear to cut down on the sweat that is allowed to accumulate and wear loose pants or shorts for a few days. If the rash is open or oozing you should see a Physician about it as soon as you can before you put ointment on it, you don't want anything IN your body. Another thought is, it might be a fungus infection, they can grow in moist, dark areas and  are really hard to care for. Lastly, you may be contagious, be careful until you find out whats going on. Sorry I'm not much help, those type of rashes are so hard to figure out unless you see them and sometimes they need to be cultured to treat, the Doctor would know for sure.  Who knows, by now you've probably figured it out, let me know\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  If the rash is in the groin folds and also involves the inner thighs and genital area, it is suggestive of various dermatological conditions which affect skin folds such as erythrasma, candidiasis, tinea cruris, atopic or seborrheoic dermatitis, and psoriasis.   Visual examination and simple tests by a dermatologist or experienced general physician will exclude or confirm any of them. The fact that the rash has not responded to corticosteroids (which I assume is what you refer to as Cortizone 10) possibly excludes atopic dermatitis, seborrhoeic dermatitis and psoriasis.  The description you give of the lesion and its chronicity is very suggestive that the rash you have had on and off for two years is erythrasma.  Erythrasma is a chronic bacterial infection caused by Corynebacterium minutissimum, part of a normal skin flora which, under certain conditions, infects the skin.  These predisposing conditions are increased moisture and humidity of skin folds, obesity, occlusive clothing and diabetes. Usual symptoms are itching and a burning sensation which may last for weeks to months to years. The rash is red or brownish red. Itching may cause secondary skin changes which is probably what you are experiencing in the affected area. Because it is easily misdiagnosed as a fungal infection, the doctor can perform simple laboratory tests to exclude fungal dermatitis. The disease itself can be confirmed by a dermatologist using an instrument known as a Wood\u2019s lamp.   The condition is easy to treat and will respond to a two week course of topical and systemic antibiotics. A dermatologist  will prescribe the medications after examination and confirmation of diagnosis.  Prevention is by excluding the causes. Wear less occlusive clothing, maintain good standards of hygiene, eat a healthy diet and keep your body weight within the expected body mass index range. Check your fasting blood sugar if the condition persists.   I am not aware that semen can cause a skin rash, but lack of hygiene (which you admit) can predispose to various skin and health problems.  I hope this information has helped.   Thank you for contacting this website, and also for your patience.

    "content": "Hello . I have had a slight case of eczema for some time now.. I'm in my early 20's and pretty much am only affected during the winter months when my skin becomes eceptionally dry. I get very dry, red, rashes on my legs - mostly affecting the calves, and also a bit on my arms and hands. Just recently my face started getting itchy and, although it hasn't gotten red circular, eczema-esque rashes, the skin is very scaley and irritated, so I believe this is the first year it has spread to my face. I have been on \"Elidel\" for a few years now, and it seems to work ok, but I was wondering what else I can do to prevent these breakouts? My main concern is that I've started to loose skin pigment in areas where I have been affected by the rashes... my right arm has white areas that doesn't look like scarring... it just looks like loss of pigment. And my legs and calves also show signs of scarring and pigment loss from what I can only assume are my eczema break outs. Any help would be MUCH appreciated.!!\n\n",

I at first thought it was just irritated hemoroids, but after putting Prep H on as I have done in the past it did not get any better. Over the last day or so it has worsened a little. I am wondering if this is possibly a yeast infection and if so what I can do? If not, should I try something else or go to my doctor?\n\n",

    "content": "I have a bad habit of picking at the hard, rough skin around my nails. (I'm working hard to stop.) I recently noticed my 2-yr.-old daughter picking at her nails, and thought, \"Oh no, she's imitating me.\"  However, upon inspection of her fingers and toes, I can see patches of dead skin. The skin on her fingertips looks there's been a blister and the top layer of skin has separated from the rest, not hard and rough like mine.  I don't think she caused it by picking, but is picking at it because it's there.  She hasn't had any trauma like a burn, and she doesn't handle any substances that could cause this.  She also has a place around the side edge of one her nails that is red and inflammed, like I frequently get.  Now, I'm wondering if I have a fungus that she has caught.  The fingernails and toenails themselves look just fine - it's just the skin that is the issue. Should we seek treatment for this? Or is it possible that the dead skin on her fingers and toes is just normal sloughing?  She doesn't have this anywhere else. We have a checkup on 10/4 - if this needs treatment, can it wait 'til then?\n\n",

I do not sleep in this bed, but my roomate from last year did. Last year, we both and allergy issues, and she had cronic nose bleeds. This year, I have had allergy issues since moving back into the dorm. I notified my RA (residnet assistant), my RD (resident director), and the cleanign staff. They replaced the bed, and cleaned the vents of the air conditioner. I have washed all articles of clothing and bedding in my room, and lceaned all of my appliances with disinfectants. I did not swab a sample before the bed was replaced, but I did take pictures. Is there anything else that needs to be done? Is there someone who I need to contact concerning this issue? My former room mate is an RA on another floor on this building. Upon viewing what I found, she told ne that the residents on her floor have been coming to her with allergy syptoms and respitory issues. Is this a bigger problem than I thought?\n\n",

    "content": "I was recently diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome and was given various medications to treat my symptoms.  I haven't found these overly effective, and more importantly I feel like I am getting worse every week- my symptoms are becoming seriously disruptive in my work and home life.  I recently read online about Candida albicans overgrowth and that this could account for gastrointestinal issues such as the ones I have, as well as my general fatigue, headaches, post-nasal drip, and other symptoms.  I tried the spit test that they suggested on the website I looked at and I failed it- indicating that I do suffer from this.  My question is, what is the medical community's opinion on Candida overgrowth- is this a valid, real problem?  If so, how accurate is this \"spit test\"?  And if I do in fact have a Candida overgrowth, can you recommend a relatively uncomplicated supplement program to take, or are dietary restrictions my only option?  Finally, if Candida overgrowth is not a potential cause of my problesm, can you recommend a book or website for IBS sufferers that can teach me how to effectively deal with my symptoms?  Thanks, Debbie\n\n",

Symptoms include discomfort with swallowing and occasional production of foul smelling, whitish chunks of material which arise from the crypts or pockets in the tonsil. This problem can cause bad breath and should be treated by attempting to keep the tonsils clean by mouth rinses with salt water or by massage with a water pik. If these methods are unsuccessful, then a tonsillectomy may be considered.  Ok I hope my answer helped u    Take Care,   Laura\n\n",

Nightsweats are associated with a TB. Have you had a rectal examination done?   I think these would be some of the questions I would explore for you.  Warm regards,  Bill\n\n",

Intestinal flora are part of the intestinal microbes in all of us, and are in fact helpful in our digestion, and absorption of certain vitamins.   Perhaps you have not had a complete understanding of what your doctor explained, or perhaps I am unaware of the possibilities. In any case, it would be a fine idea to consult the doctor again and find out what exactly caused the rectal incontinence. Was a digital rectal examination done for you?

    "content": "Hi!  When you mentioned oral thrush, have you come to know the name of the micro-organism causing the problem?   If the problem is due to the fungus Candida albicans, the term thrush is used. The causes of this include immune dysfunction, polyendocrine disorders, and drugs like steroids or antibiotics used long-term.  Night sweats can occur with various infections including tuberculosis, brucellosis, blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, and HIV infections. Cancer sometimes causes night sweats, like chronic lymphocytic leukemia, Hodgkin lymphoma, and rarely benign right-sided heart tumors. Cholangitis or inflammation of the bile ducts can cause night sweats, but what was the reason you had your gall bladder surgery for?  Stool seepage that produces soilage of undergarments may result from hemorrhoids, enlarged skin tags, poor hygiene, fistula-in-ano, and rectal mucosal prolapse. Other conditions that result in poor bowel control are inflammatory bowel disease, laxative abuse, parasitic infection, and toxins. Anal fissures can be seen in patients with syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases, tuberculosis, leukemia, inflammatory bowel disease, HIV, and other conditions or diseases. Approximately 30% of patients with HIV develop anorectal abscesses and fistulas.  People with AIDS develop many diseases and \u201copportunistic\u201d infections (such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, cancer, and skin infections). Since you have already been tested for HIV twice, the probability decreases. BUT, there is a pitfall in the routine tests used for HIV in that it doesn't take into consideration the window period during which a patient with HIV infection can go undetected. There are more accurate tests like viral load test used in directing antiviral therapy to patients. But such tests need the doctor's specific instruction to get done.  While people with leukemias can have both night sweats and anal fistulas, these blood cancers can also have its decremental effect on the immunity to bring about thrush.  All in all, I will tend to look into your blood counts to rule out any leukemias, while excluding infectious causes (including STD by way of a VDRL test) that could have been the reason why your spouse 'caught' the cough and nightsweats, not forgetting HIV from the background.  I hope this helps. Please do not hesitate to clear any more doubts you might have.  Warm regards,  Bill\n\n",

    "content": "Recently, I noticed that the fingernail on the forefinger on my right hand has an odor of rotting flesh coming from underneath it, and the nail is starting to separate from the nailbed on the left side.  The odor grows stronger the longer my nails get.  The skin around the left side of the nail is also red and flaky, and has cracked open and bled.  To make matters worse, the same thing is beginning to happen on the middle finger's fingernail, making me believe that the condition is spreading.  As horrible as all of this sounds, there is absolutely no pain.  Regardless, it is a rather frightening thing to see nonetheless.  Can someone please help me, and let me know if this a condition for which I need medical attention, or if there is a home remedy I can use to cure it?  Also, if this is a condition, the name of it would be wonderful to know.  Thanks in advance.\n\n",

    "title": "Onycholysis, onychomycosis...",
    "content": "Hi!  ****Onycholysis is characterized by a spontaneous separation of the nail plate starting at the distal free margin and progressing proximally. The nail plate is separated from the underlying and/or lateral supporting structures. Less often, separation of the nail plate begins at the proximal nail and extends to the free edge, which is seen most often in psoriasis of the nails (termed onychomadesis). Rare cases are confined to the nail's lateral borders. Males are more affected.  Nails with onycholysis usually are smooth, firm, and without inflammatory reaction. It is not a disease of the nail matrix, but nail discoloration may appear underneath the nail as a result of secondary infection. When onycholysis occurs, a coexistent yeast infection is suggested. Treating primary and secondary factors that exacerbate the condition is important. Left untreated, severe cases of onycholysis may result in nail bed scarring.  Treatment for onycholysis varies and depends on its cause. Eliminating the predisposing cause is the best treatment.  Patients should avoid trauma to the affected nail, and keep the nail bed dry. Patients should avoid exposure to contact irritants and moisture (important). Patients should clip the affected portion of the nail, and keep the nails short. Patients should wear light cotton gloves under vinyl gloves for wet work.  ****Onychomycosis (OM), on the other hand, refers to a fungal infection that affects the toenails or the fingernails. It may involve any component of the nail unit, including the nail matrix, the nail bed, or the nail plate. OM is not life threatening, but it can cause inconvenience, pain, discomfort, and often serious physical and occupational limitations. Psychosocial and emotional effects resulting from OM are widespread and have a significant impact on the quality of life. Females are more affected.  Medical and surgical treatment modalities exist. If it's on the toes, the fungal infection has favorable prognosis.  **** I guess I have been able to provide you with some nomenclature at least to grope. All said and done, neither onycholysis nor onychomycosis is sexually transmitted, and neither of them is as fatal as life!  Bye!  -Bill\n\n",

    "title": "Molds",
    "content": "Lorena, Molds are a class of fungi that prefer to grow in a moist environment. Molds can have an impact on human health, depending on the nature of the species involved, the metabolic products being produced by these species, the amount and duration of individual\u2019s exposure to mold parts or products, and the specific susceptibility of those exposed.  Health effects generally fall into four categories. These four categories are allergy (which may explain the runny nose), infection, irritation (mucous membrane and sensory), and toxicity.  If you are going to handle the mold yourself then bear in mind that molds and their spores can contaminate humans through inhalation (breathing) or through skin contact. So wear a protective mask and protective clothes.  I am not an expert in cleaning molds but here is some info i found on a website that talks about the cleaning up process in detail. This should give you some insight:  CLEANING UP MOLDS To clean up and remove indoor mold growth, follow steps 1-6 as they apply to your home.   Identify and Fix the Moisture Problem - the most important step in solving a mold problem is to identify and correct the moisture sources that allowed the growth in the first place. Common indoor moisture sources include: Flooding, Condensation (caused by indoor humidity that is too high or surfaces that are too cold), Movement through basement walls and slab, Roof leaks, Plumbing leaks, Overflow from tubs, sinks, or toilets, Firewood stored indoors, Humidifier use, Inadequate venting of kitchen and bath humidity, Improper venting of combustion appliances, Failure to vent clothes dryer exhaust outdoors (including electric dryers), Line drying laundry indoors, House plants - watering them can generate large amounts of moisture. To keep indoor surfaces as dry as possible, try to maintain the home's relative humidity between 20-40 percent in the winter and less than 60 percent the rest of the year. You can purchase devices to measure relative humidity. Ventilation, air circulation near cold surfaces, dehumidification, and efforts to minimize the production of moisture in the home are all very important in controlling high humidity that frequently causes mold growth in our cold climate.    Begin Drying All Wet Materials - as soon as possible, begin drying any materials that are wet. For severe moisture problems, use fans and dehumidifiers and move wet items away from walls and off floors. Check with equipment rental companies or restoration firms to see if you can rent fans and dehumidifiers.    Remove and Dispose of Mold Contaminated Materials - Items which have absorbed moisture (porous materials) and which have mold growing on them need to be removed, bagged and thrown out. Such materials may include sheet rock, insulation, plaster, carpet/carpet pad, ceiling tiles, wood products (other than solid wood), and paper products. Likewise, any such porous materials that have contacted sewage should also be bagged and thrown away. Non-porous materials with surface mold growth may be saved if they are cleaned well and kept dry. Take Steps to Protect Yourself - the amount of mold particles in air can increase greatly when mold is disturbed. Consider using protective equipment when handling or working around mold contaminated materials. The following equipment can help minimize exposure to mold: Rubber gloves, Eye goggles,Outer protective clothing,filter dust mask. Take steps to protect others. Enclose all moldy materials in plastic bags, Hang plastic sheeting to separate the work area from the rest of the home, Damp clean the entire work area to pick up settled contaminants.    Clean Surfaces - surface mold growing on non-porous materials such as hard plastic, concrete, glass, metal, and solid wood can usually be cleaned. Cleaning must remove and capture the mold contamination, because dead spores and mold particles still cause health problems if they are left in place. Thoroughly scrub all contaminated surfaces, Collect excess cleaning liquid with a wet/dry vacuum, mop or sponge, n Rinse area with clean water and collect excess rinse water.    Disinfect Surfaces (if desired) - after cleaning has removed all visible mold and other soiling from contaminated surfaces, a disinfectant may be used to kill mold missed by the cleaning. In the case of sewage contamination, disinfection must be performed.   Mix 1/4 to 1/2 cup bleach per gallon of water and apply to surfaces where mold growth was visible before cleaning. The solution can be applied with a spray bottle, garden sprayer, it can be sponged on, or applied by other methods.   Collect any run-off of bleach solution with a wet/ dry vacuum, sponge or mop. However, do not rinse or wipe the bleach solution off the areas being treated. Allow it to dry on the surface.    Remain on Mold Alert - Continue looking for signs of moisture problems or return of mold growth. Be particularly alert to moisture in areas of past growth. If mold returns, repeat cleaning steps and consider using a stronger solution to disinfect the area again. Regrowth may signal that the material should be removed or that moisture is not yet controlled.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Guest,   Thank you very much for using our website.  The pictures that you sent are helpful.  Though you have not mentionned whether you took any medications for these spots between your toes and/or for the spots on the ankles or not?  i am not a dermatologist but i can tell you that the spot that you have between your toes does not look like athletes foot, athletes foot is a fungal infection that usually affects the area in between the toes. If acute, it starts as very itchy usually red vesicles and can be associated with a bacterial infection. If chronic is usually white and you will find that the skin between the toes is usually macerated and sometimes with fissures between the toes and still it is mildly itchy.  The patch that you have on your foot looks more to me like one of 2 lesions: 1. Atopic dermatitis. 2. Eczema.  The lesions on your ankles do not really bring anything to mind.  i think that you should a dermatologist for the proper diagnosis and hence management.  Once more, thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you. Excuse my spelling, but a search conducted on my own seems to point to \"varicose eczema\" as a good possibility for the spotting on my ankles. Seems a good possibility that the blood flow in my legs may not be right. I smoke three packs a day, drink heavy, and since I was fired from my longtime job six months ago.......I sit and play on the computer constantly while collecting unemployment. Do you have any thoughts about this? I have gained about twenty pounds from my newfound lazy lifestyle, and sitting in this chair all day, with nowhere to go, does leave my \"backside numb\".....could the smoking, drinking beer, laziness, and sitting in a chair all day be the cause? which ones? This is frightening enough to make me go for a quit smoking day tomorrow, but as I sit in this chair now, I can feel my feet are kind of tingling like the chair and sitting is restrciting blood flow....always does this, and only in this computer chair.....any thoughts.......thank you so much.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for using our website.  The lesions that are caused by blood stagnation (varicose eczema) are usually around the ankle (and not on the surface of the foot) and the begining is usually general change in the color of the area not discrete lesions like the ones you have. And i guess the question is do you have varicose veins or have you have blood clots in the legs in the past?  If you sit for a long time with your feet hanging down you might have some swelling of your ankles and if you are really predisposed you could get varicose veins but standing is the sure thing, meaning if you were standing on your feet 8 hours a day i would say sure.  About sitting all the day on a chair, of course it could cause you some back problems. About the tingling sensation that you have any body who sits for a long time on the same spot will feel thiss feeling. This is some kind of a defensive mechanism telling you that you have sit on the same spot for a long time and that this spot is not getting enough blood (because it has been compressed by your weight) and that you need to assume another position to let the area get enough blood.
