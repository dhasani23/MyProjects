    "content": "I'm a 58 year old woman who went to see my doctor about a problem I developed after having a mild cold.  I found that I would run out of air when I spoke which would cause me to cough (dry cough).  I can exercise with no problem; it's only when I talk that I run out of air.  I also feel some tightness in my upper chest and throat.  My doctor gave me an EKG and sent me for a chest X-Ray and both were normal.  She prescribed Singulair which I started taking about 5 days ago.  I began to feel better, however, I woke up today with the problem returning.  Air conditioning seems to aggravate it.  I've never had asthma and only mild seasonal allergies that would only cause sneezing and runny nose.  Can you give me some insight as to what can be causing this?  I'm not overweight (5'3\", 115 lbs), exercise regularly, have never smoked and have have been on Lotrel & Zocor for years.\"\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Ruthiejb,  There is an entity called adult onset asthma.  This is a possibility.  Other possible etiologies would include vocal cord dysfunction and (less likely with a normal EKG and chest x-ray) heart dysfunction.    If you continue to have these symptoms you may want to consider seeing a pulmonologist (a lung specialist).  They can do lung testing to get a better idea of what your airways look like.  Your doctor may also consider a trial of a drug called albuterol that treats spasms of the airway (associated most commonly with asthma).    If this is asthma or a related illness there are several medications that can help control and improve symptoms (of which singulair is one).  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi I am 21 years old, and a smoker for 3 years.  I recently started coughing up mucus every morning, or if I lay down for a while.  It usually starts out yellowish-green and thick kindof chuncky, then turns clear.  I understand this is probably directly related to smoking.  I am trying to cut back, and eventually quit.  But whats worring me is that my glands in my neck and armpits have been swollen for about two months now.  They havent gone down one bit, and are painfull in the armpits. I don't particularly feel any symptoms of being \"sick\".  No sore throat or anything. I am more tired than usual, but I have been working more.  My younger sister had strep throat the time my glands started to swell, but I never got it.  Im not sure whats wrong, or how serious it may be.  I would have gone to a doctor by now, but my health insurance ran out when I turned 21.  I did have some sort of a test done in the winter, and it said I had normal lung function, but that was before this all started.\n\n",

    "title": "Lung Fluttering?",
    "content": "Greetings,\\  2 years ago, I was feeling what I thought was rapid and irregular heart beats and thought my congenital heart murmer was acting up.  I felt fluttering in my heart.  My very great heart murmer specialist doc had all the tests done and I wore a monitor for a few days.  The monitor reading was not clear, so the doc could not make a sure diagnosis.  The tests all came back good.  He did say that what I was feeling was not my heart murmer acting up, but a new arythmia (sp?).   After another month, I again strapped on another monitor, this time for 5 days or so; it was a more sensitive piece of equipment. However, by that time, I was no longer feeling any fluttering symptons and felt better and the doc said if the murmer was still there, he could barely hear it.  (Just prior to this I had gone through a traumatic family experience.... I thought perhaps, the symptoms were due to  serious anxiety that had eventually calmed down.)  Now I am feeling these fluttering sensations again.  I feel them while laying in bed. I am listening to my heart beat while feeling the fluttering; the heart is beating fine and steady even while \"something\" is fluttering.  Can you help me figure out what could be causing this and if it is a dangerous situation?  The fluttering is located right around my heart.  Could it be my right lung?    Thanks for your help on this. Cheers.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Lung Fluttering?",
    "content": "Hi, Whatever may be the cause of your symptoms, it appears highly likely that you have become conscious of the heart beats(which we are normally unaware of). If your heart is beating regularly (according to your description) and yet you are feeling some fluttering, it is less likely to be an arrhythmia. However, certain cardiac dysrhythmias can only be identified by monitoring devices such as the Holter monitoring.  Lungs do not cause fluttering sensations. If no cardiac cause is found and If these aforementioned diagnoses are excluded, then this fluttering can be attributed to \"benign fasiculation syndrome\" (although fasiculations are uncommon in pectoral muscles).This neurologic entity is charecterized by intermittent twitching due to involuntary contraction of a very small group of muscle cells.  Fasiculations can be due to many causes including, Lyme Disease, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal trauma as well as many others.Certain stimulants and medications such as, caffeine, some bronchodilators, medications used in treatment of attention deficit disorder, pseudoephedrine hydrochloride as well as others can result in fasiculations. Stress and anxiety are often seen in persons with fasiculations. Deficiency of magnesium should be excluded. Good luck!\n\n",

    "title": "Lung removal operation, what to expect",
    "content": "I hope someone can give me advice on this as my consultant was pretty vague. I was diagnosed with Bronchectisis in 2000 and Emphysema in 2007. This week I saw my consultant and he was very concerned at how much my lung volume has deteriorated in the past year. To cut a long story short, I am 38 years old and have been in and out of hospital all my life with different chest complaints. The main problem now however is that my right lung is hardly working, keeps getting infected and he is worried that if the infection spreads to the left side ( which it has started ) then my outlook is not good to say the least. He said to me yesterday that he wants to refer me to a specialist in Bristol to talk about a last ditch effort. He wants me to have an operation to remove the right lung and try to save the other. However he was not too clear with the details, what was said was that obviously my lung capcity will be reduced even further than what it is now but if they can get rid of all the infected areas then my life will be easier. Thing is though, if that means being on oxygen for the rest of my life then I will have to seriously consider if it will be worth it. I asked him about that, but he says everyone is different and some compensate while others do not. As for the operation side of it, I would like to know what to expect when I come round as I have not seen the surgeon yet, but its been worrying me. Yesterday, I had the usual c.t. scan with contrast, lung function, x-rays and blood tests. As I have stated, I have been in hospital numerous times for I.V. treatments with anti-biotics, but the problem they have is that they cannot identify the bugs that are causing the infections. So for the last few years it has been trial and error to see what works. So far though, nothing has which is why he has suggested this operation. Any information would be appreciated, and if you need more details I will try my best to answer. Thanks in advance - James\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Pneumonectomy has perhaps,one of the highest in-hospital mortality rates (5-15%) among common elective surgical procedures.   It is not possible for me to specifically predict how your existing physiology would respond to a pneumonectomy. However, i will let you have some general information about how cases are selected for a pneumonectomy (i have chosen the British Thoracic Society (BTS) and the Society of Cardiothoracic Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland (SCTS) recommendations for the selection and management of patients with potentially operable lung cancer, as an example).  Basic spirometry: No further respiratory function tests are required for a pneumonectomy if the post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) is >2.0 litres, provided that there is no evidence of interstitial lung disease or unexpected disability due to shortness of breath.  Step 1: All patients not clearly operable on the basis of spirometry should have: (a) full pulmonary function tests including estimation of Transfer Factor of the Lung for Carbon Monoxide (TLCO) (b) measurement of oxygen saturation on air at rest; and (c) a quantitative isotope perfusion scan if a pneumonectomy is being considered.These data are used to calculate estimated postoperative FEV1 expressed as % predicted and the estimated postoperative TLCO expressed as % predicted, using either the lung scan  Step 2: (a) Estimated postoperative FEV1 >40% predicted and estimated postoperative TLCO >40% predicted and oxygen saturation (SaO2) >90% on air: considered average risk. (b) Estimated postoperative FEV1 <40% predicted and estimated postoperative TLCO <40% predicted: considered high risk.  (c) All other combinations: consider exercise testing.  Patients for whom the risk of resection is still unclear after step 2 tests, should be referred for exercise testing.  Step 3: (a) A best distance on two shuttle walk tests of <25 shuttles (250 m) or desaturation during the test of more than 4% SaO2: is a high risk for surgery. (b) Other patients should be referred for a formal cardiopulmonary exercise test.   On cardiopulmonary exercise testing, a peak oxygen consumption (V~O2peak) of more than 15 ml/kg/min indicates an average risk for surgery. (c) A V~O2peak of <15 ml/kg/min indicates a high risk for surgery.  I will leave out detailed discussion on assessment of cardiac risk  except to say that as a rough estimate, patients who have an exercise tolerance > 4 metabolic equivalents (METS) (can climb 1 flight of stairs) do not need further cardiac investigation(the exceptions are the elderly). I hope this information may be helpful. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Is it possible that a lung granuloma could be a lipoma?",
    "content": "Hi, Multiple subcuteneous lipomas are only extremely rarely described in association with lipomas within the body cavities. In one case report, a corpus callosal-choroid plexus lipoma was associated with a subcutaneous lipoma and one other case report a laryngeal lipoma  was found associated with diffuse systemic lipomatosis.    Lipomas are one of the most frequently encountered benign neoplasms, but intrathoracic lipomas are very rare. Intrathoracic lipomas may occur in the following sites. - medistinal and - intra pulmonary.   A majority of the intra pulmonary lipomas are centrally placed within the lung, arising mostly from proximal lobar or segmental bronchi(mostly seen in endobronchial localization).   The first case of peripheral intrapulmonary lipoma was reported way back in 1911. Only a handful of cases (perhaps < 10) have been reported since then. These tumors are presumed to originate from fatty tissue in the wall of peripheral, subsegmental bronchi. Almost all occurrences were in adult males(age range 44\u201371 years).   Treatment for endobronchial lipoma is usually a bronchoscopic resection.   Centrally located lipomas have been reported very rarely in the trachea as well. These tumors can be difficult to diagnose due to their ability to mimic other obstructive lung diseases, such as COPD and asthma.Treatment is usually endoscopic resection.  Although radiological imaging techniques have high sensitivity detecting solitary pulmonary nodules, their ability to give information about their nature is limited. CT attenuation values of 100 to -110 Hounsfield units, indicates the presence of fat in such tumors.  These tumors are generally unsuitable for bronchoscopic biopsy or resection. So far, almost all the peripherally located intrapulmonary lipomas had been diagnosed following surgery (wedge resection).  Although extremely rare, intrapulmonary lipomas should be considered in the differential diagnosis of solitary pulmonary nodules.  Although you have had mutiple subcuteneous lipomas, to the best of my knowledge, they have not been reported in association with intrapulmonary lipomas. However, the lesion in your lung (as advised by your doctor) needs to be carefully followed up. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Here is my background history: I am military. When I was in training I came down with the nastiest chest cold I've ever had. I was givin every medicine under the sun to help my cough but many did not work or merely just suppressed it. At that time I was located in Mississippi.  About four years ago my upper teeth started hurting really bad. I saw a dentist and after getting checked out and finding nothing wrong with my teeth, he said that it may be a sinus issue and the pressure in my sinuses was causing the pain. To this day I occasionally still have that pain in my upper teeth. This was when I was stationed in Idaho.  The next time I remember having cold problems was while being deployed to balad Iraq both times I had breathing and coughing issues. It wasnt so severe to the point that I couldn't run but it was still there. Again I was givin allergy medicine and couch drops which did very little. I was also subjected to poor air because of all the trash burning in my area on base.  While stationed in Korea I was misdiagnosed with the common cold which lasted nearly 3 months. I was finally was diagnosed with both bronchitis and sinusitis. It was the sickest I'd ever been for that amount of time and I was very miserable. My nickname in Korea was Outbreak Monkey because it seemed if there was a cold or flu to be caught, I was going to catch it.  If I get on planes, I'm almost guaranteed to catch something. To this day I have a random cough and if I laugh to hard I go into a deep old man sounding coughing fit. It's very painful. Also, I now live in NM.  Is this all circumstantial? Is it because I move around so much? Or should I be concerned and press my military doctors to really look at me? My mother onced said that ever since I joined it seems like I'm always catching something. I was hardly ever sick as a kid. Also, I am not a smoker. I really appreciate any help. Thank you\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Coughingand sinus issues lasting for years",
    "content": "Hi, It has been noted that many chronic cough patients complain of an induced cough by cold air contact.   One study observed that In Lapland, the northernmost province of Finland, 10-19% of healthy subjects experience shortness of breath (SOB) during exercise in cold weather, with smoking being an important risk factor.Shortness of breath was also  noted in a fairly large percentage (78-82%) of asthmatic subjects and 27-59% of subjects with chronic bronchitis.  Normally, by the time the cold air passes to the airways, its temperature is raised to near-body temperature by contact with the mucosa of the nasal cavity, nasopharynx, and the para-nasal sinuses.  This temperature exchange, however, is compromised under certain conditions such as, - allergy, - flu, - exercise, and  - other respiratory diseases.   Exercise in cold weather can also result in the rapid inhalation of cold air into the trachea and bronchi, due to an insufficient warming resulting from too rapid flow of air.   Breathing of cold air without proper temperature exchange induces strong respiratory autonomic responses including  - cough,and  - airway narrowing, and    - increased mucosal secretions.  - derangement of mucociliary function.  The airway is lined by a thin layer of liquid, the airway surface fluid (ASL). Hyperpnea of cold air may cause the ASL to evaporate more rapidly than it can be replaced.The effect of cold air on the skin is mainly cooling, while the effect on the airways is cooling + drying.This is believed to be one of the major factors in the causation of Cold air-provoked airway responses. (Kotaniemi JT, Latvala J, Lundback B, Sovijarvi A, Hassi J, Larsson K. Does living in a cold climate or recreational skiing increase the risk for obstructive respiratory diseases or symptoms? Int J Circumpolar Health 2003;62:142-157).  You indicate that when you get into a plane's cabin, your cough tends to aggravate. Your overall history makes \"Cold air-provoked airway responses\" a strong possibility. It appears  highly likely that you have an underlying airway hypersensitivity or a chronic lung disorder that is probably getting aggravated by inhalation of cold air +/- exercise.

    "content": "Hello mewgirl -  Most heavy smokers eventually will  develop cronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and these people's lungs and bronchi are then damaged pretty much permanently. If  the process is arrested and smoking absolutely stopped before too  much damage is done, sometimes  they can remain stable and live out fairly normal lifespans (but with greatly diminished pulmonary function of course). There are a few hospitals  in the US which have pulmonary rehab programs, similar to cardiac rehab programs  (but much longer lasting) and they have yielded some improvement in lung function in some patients.  As for marijuana smoking, all normal situations aside (including  medical  use), it  is still smoking and contains the by-products of combustion, even if not the exact same ones as tobacco, and it will  irritate the respiratory tract and worsen the COPD. There can be no disputing this fact.   While it is impossible to say in precise terms how long a  person with a serious illness will survive, it  can be less time as well as more than the prediction, but it is certain your friend's normal lifespan will be shortened by COPD unless it is treated aggressively and all smoking is stopped.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I am a 23 year old female who smokes 1 pack of cigarettes per day since about the age of 16.  I'm not very physically active and my diet isn't very good, and I am overweight.  I started having chest pains back in October 2008 when I tried to quit smoking and was on the nicotine patch. (not sure if that has anything to do with it, or just coincedence)  The pain is a sharp shooting pain right under my left breast it almost feels like it is right behind the breast.  The pain comes when I am literally doing nothing such as sitting on the couch watching television.  My heart seems to flutter and race and my breathing becomes very irregular.  The pain often comes if I take a deep breath in or out.  The entire left side chest and back area are sore and achy all the time.  I have problems breathing but I suspect its because it hurts when I breathe sometimes so I have trained myself to breathe irregularily to prevent pain.  I also have dizziness and light headedness (possibly due to anxiety from pain so close to my heart? The following is a chronicle of the medical tests and medications prescribed:  October 2008 -Started having chest pains after being on patch for  1 \u00bd weeks, started smoking again. -Went to ER , had ECG and bloodwork, all fine.  Diagnosed me with Panic Attack/Anxiety.  Prescribed Ativan. -Went to family doctor , Said it is most likely Anxiety.  Prescribed more Ativan. -Ativan did not work, saw doctor again prescribed Prevacid for GERD. -Prevacid did not work.  Saw doctor she said Chest Wall Pain (costochondritis).  Prescribed Naproxen. -Chest X-Ray done.  Fine. -Naproxen did not work.   prescribed Indomethacin. -Found lump on breasts.  Had breast ultrasound.  Came back fine.   -Indomethacin did not work.   -Had ECG done in January.  Fine. -Went to ER again.  Has ECG done and Chest X Ray.  Came back negative.  Gave Heartburn meds.  Did not work.  Gave Toradol IV-seemed to work.  Prescribed Tylenol 3. -Tylenol 3 made me vomit.  Went back to doctor who prescribed Tramacet. -Went to another doctor and told it was Costochondritis.  Prescribed Zytram.  Zytram made me vomit. -Went to doctor again, prescribed Elavil and Extra Strength Tylenol. -Went to chest disease specialist.  He performed a breathing test and said my lungs were good. -Sent for a bone scan, still waiting for results. All blood and urine came back fine.  I am still having these pains and I suspect that the bone scan shows nothing as I have not heard from the specialist in a few weeks.  I am still very concerned because if this truly is costochondrtis, it seems to be going on too long especially considering I did not have an injury to cause this.  I am still quite concerned that it may be my heart or possibly lungs.  Are there anymore tests I should request?  Any medications I should suggest to my doctor?  Anything?  I am currently off of work and have been for the past 2 months due to this.  Thank you for your attention to this matter.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Chronic Stabbing Pain Under Left Breast",
    "content": "Hi there -  The sort of chest  pain you describe is extremely unlikely to be cardiac related, but one test you don't appear to have had, which could utterly rule out at least structural heart disease (usually it would be something bening like mitral valve prolapse -- MVP) would be an echocardiogram. While I don't believe this pain is heart-related, it seems reasonable to want to eliminate every more potentially serious thing first in order to help reduce your anxiety as related to the symptoms. (Anxiety can be a disorder or it can be situational -- caused by a real or perceived danger; remove the perception of danger and the anxiety should subside).   Unfortunately this sort of pain is also often part of a clinical anxiety picture. The good news is that once serious concerns are ruled out, anxiety has less traction and starts to become better as a rule, even if it is a separate disorder. You may or may not have such a problem. Either way, ruling out the really troublesome stuff should reduce your anxiety level, maybe even eliminate it.  It's interesting Ativan didn't help. Sometimes it doesn't, since it isn't going to remove the source of your concern (pain) and anxiety can often override this particular drug. The pain meds may not have been appropriate either, since only toradol seems to have helped at all (a pretty strong non-steroidal anti-inflammatory related to other NSAIDs like Advil and Aleve).   The fact that you feel your heart flutter at times during this as well as some faulty breathing patterns (even you have noted this, which is very insightful) suggests the possibility of mitral valve prolapse, which is a benign abnormality, usually mild and difficult to visualize, which for unknown reasons is often accompanied by a syndrome consisting of chest pain (usually sharp and stabbing in nature), fatigue, dizziness, anxiety, etc.   Since you've had numerous tests to rule out a lot of the more serious potential causes, we're left with either MVP syndrome or a chest wall irritation, which could be costochondritis or, perhaps, pleurisy, which is more common n smokers than others, and causes increased pain (often radiating to the shoulder or neck) on deep breathing.   It's clear you don't tolerate opiates and opiods well, which is just as well, since NSAIDs are probably more appropriate for whatever is causing this,  since it seems like an inflammatory problem rather than orthopedc, like costochonditis or pleurisy. Either one can become chronic, so six months really isn't too long to be having the symptoms  if this is what's causing your pain.  The good news is you know a lot of things are not wrong, so those can be dismissed. MVP should be ruled out, since if present  it would not only explain a lot but can be managed medically with different sorts of drugs.   You may also have a chronic anxiety problem  or panic disorder. Again, there are certain more appropriate drugs that can  help with this, along with cognitive behavioral therapy, whch is a short-term process that can be very helpful. Alll these things should be ruled out/in.  I very much hope this has been helpful. You'll notice I haven't dwelt much on your smoking. You know what you need to do regarding that and I don't need to browbeat you about it. Stopping could very well help eliminate the problem. That's all I'm saying about that. :)  Good luck to you and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

Most recently on mothers day when I was just standing around talking. It uccurs for me when I take a deep breath in or out and it doesn't allow me to finish the full breath because the pain can't be endured. I usually only get it for a few minutes and somehow it just disappears. I also get the pain when I lean back.       Most recently it lasted for over 10 minutes. I was getting annoyed because it's never lasted this long before. So after I was getting shortness of breath I tried to endure the pain. I took a deep breath in, slowly, as deep as I could, then I felt a sort of clicking, as if my lung was unhooking from something. It felt as if my lung was caught on my rib. It's odd how no doctor ever seems to find an explanation for this. Very interesting...      Best of luck! ..Tim\n\n",

    "title": "Why did my CXR show hyperinflation of my lungs?",
    "content": "(28 y/o male) I recently saw my primary care MD regarding \"waking up at night gasping for air.\" This has gone one for many years, and I have never been seen for it previously. I wake up when trying to go to initially fall sleep  gasping for air about 1 - 15 times before I actually fall asleep. This comes and goes. One week I'm fine, the next I have the gasping for a few nights in a row. I figured I could get an OSA work-up done. My doctor ordered CXR, overnight pulse ox, (and maybe a sleep study too). The CXR was 2 weeks ago, my doctor's nurse called me the next day and said the CXR showed \"hyperinflation\" in my lungs. The office scheduled me in 3 months with a Pulmonologist (I guess for PFT's etc...). I have the overnight pulse ox (at home) scheduled next week. Not sure if they actually ordered a sleep study.   I sometimes feel like I have difficulty swallowing. I MAY have some minor chest tightness or may just be over-aware of my respiratory system in light of all this. I do not have SOB at rest or with activity. I swim, bike, run, and am very active. I smoked on and off for about 11 years but quit 7-11 months ago completely. I was sick with a ST/cough/malaise/etc \"probably a cold\" the ARNP said, for about 2 weeks right before the CXR was taken. I'm wanting to know #1) Why are my lungs \"hyperinflated\" on the CXR??? 2) What's up with the gasping??? and 3) Am I on the right track to getting to the bottom of this??? I'm worried I have early COPD. Could my recent flu/coughing spell have caused the hyperinflation? Could I have mild asthma and not know it? I can recall having an IS done when I had a cold 2 years ago, and was wheezing and felt like my throat was nearly closed up, I remember the doctor said my IS was \"slightly below normal\" for me. They did a CXR at that time, but I never heard anything about it. Should I get those records for my Pulmonoligist to compare at my appointment. I want to be thorough about this and get to the bottom of everything so I can continue an active healthy lifestyle. The only other information I can think of that might be relevant is that when I had a Hep B vaccine a few years ago I may have had an undiagnosed GBS type reaction. The day after vaccination I had left arm tingling and weakness and noticed my limbs fell asleep VERY easily. I DO have anxiety history which is largely controlled in the absence of binge drinking and exhaustion. I remember feeling like it was hard to breath when all this GBS type stuff was going on, but everything kind of went away after a couple or few weeks. Lastly, Since I was a kid I can remember getting sudden weakness in my hand for example, like when grasping a pencil then it would go away after a minute or so. SInce January I have that weakness everyday, which seems to come and go through the day- mostly in the morning. It's hard to squeeze my fists (like when you're laughing so hard you get weak). So I guess I was wondering could the possible GBS could have anything to do with my CXR/gasping like s/t something with my diaphragm. And I was also concerned the hand weakness since January might be early MS, could this have anything to do with my respiratory situation? This is everything I can think of, please let me know if I can provide more information or f/u. Thanks!!!!!!!!!!! -Steve-\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Why did my CXR show hyperinflation of my lungs?",
    "content": "Hi there -- First, let's establish a couple understandings: first, hyperinflation of the lungs may or may not mean something -- anything or nothing. It usually is seen with certain chronic pulmonary problems, but you do not sound, based on your exercise tolerance, as though you have any of these. Second, you have pretty well identified yourself as an anxious person. There is nothing innately wrong with that, except that it makes life less pleasant and it also often prejudices medical people, so it really needs to be dealt with, separately, for both those reasons.   Now then: given you tolerate exercise really well, that you suffer from anxiety issues largely played out via somatic awareness (what your body is doing or what it may be doing -- see? already anxiety begins to cloud the issue), the hyperinflation may well be due to chronic sighing and hyperventilation, both of which are part of a faulty breathing habit associated with -- you guessed it -- anxiety. This does not mean you can not have something else going on, only that it's less than likely. It certainly doesn't mean you shouldn't have any real physical issues ruled out first, but if this is accomplished you will then have to work hard on managing the anxiety -- and likely will have to in any case.   Further: those nocturnal episodes of waking up gasping are quite common in the anxious person, either because of nocturnal panic attacks (a very real and well- recognized phenomenon) and/or sleep paralysis, an equally common but not-as-well understood phenomenon, quite benign but extremely disturbing to the sufferer, although over time most people tend to adapt to it til it doesn't \"work\" anymore and goes away. This, however, can take years, so again, real pulmonary problems, unlikely as they are, should be ruled out, not only for your physical well being but for your reassurance and peace of mind.  As for the GBS question, you could possibly have had a very, very mild episode, but of course it was too long ago and too short-lived to have any bearning on anything going on now, and again, being an axious person (who knows just enough medical stuff to get himself into trouble), you may well have been anticipating such a thing, so felt what otherwise might have passed unnoticed, normal physiologic sensations of the moment. At any rate, GBS does not lie dormant for years. It's an acute illness and slowly gets better. It won't show up suddenly months or years later. So you can turn that one loose.  Again, you could very well have some (minor) pulmonary problem such as asthma, but again your ability to tolerat exercise makes this very unlikely. Still the PFT and nocturnal O2 sat tests should be done. The latter is fairly unreliable, but would of course expose anything grossly wrong, like possible sleep apnea. And again, I'm betting heavily against that. I strongly suspect nocturnal panic attacks and/or sleep paralysis.   If all physical causes for your concerns are cleanly eliminated you'll need to look at something like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to help you with your anxiety issues -- and CBT can be very effective in most cases. It is a self-limited form of interactive therapy, not \"talk\" therapy, but rather a type of behavior modification that helps to patient learn to recognize the triggers, onset and mechanism of anxiety so as to dismantle the problem from the inside out. For this reason it doesn't take nearly as long as insight psychoanalysis. It even  involves some literal homework which can be really eye-opening. Let's hope this is where this all leads, as it's a lot simpler than having some exotic lung disorder.   Hope this is all helpful. Good luck to you and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "I am 21 years old, 5'4 and 120 pounds.  Since I was 15 I have had several different spells of difficulty breathing when doing nothing more than sitting.  It feels as if I cannot catch a deep and satisfying breath.  I will take many short and inhibited feeling breaths.  Finally, after sighing and yawning many times, I can catch one good breath.  I immediately feel better afterwards.  Then the short breaths will return.  These episodes can last as long as a few hours and happen probably once or twice a month.  Sometimes they are worse than others.          In the past it has caused my hands and feet to become numb and caused me to become very lightheaded.  After the first episode I went to the doctor and had underwent a few different tests.  I was young so I don't accurately remember what they did.  I remember an asthma and blood test which both found nothing.  They suggested it was a panic attack.  I did not feel panicked about anything prior to the episode.  However the first time I was around several people who were smoking cigarettes (I was not).  Since then, nothing in particular seems to set it off.  I am most interested in finding out if this is something I should shrug off as insignificant, or something I should seek medical care for.               Thank you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: difficulty catching breath",
    "content": "Hello -- What you describe (and especially the words you use to describe it) is classic for hyperventilation syndrome,which can manifest with chronic generalized anxiety (GAD) or may precipitate panic attacks with hyperventilation predominating. While it is possible there could be a physical cause it is unlikely given your very detailed description. What happens is one begins to sigh deeply (and unawares). This throws off too much CO2, which upsets the PH balance in the bloodstream, sending the brain the message breathing isn't especially important. Since breathing is a largely voluntary function driven by habit and autonomic nervous guidance, over-awareness of one's breathing can lead to faulty breathing patterns, hyperventilation, and ultimately, by extension, feelings of diffcult or non-satisfactory respirations, numbness and tingling in the extremities and around the mouth, then lightheadedness and, sometimes, carpal and/or pedal spasm and even momentary fainting. While all this is benign, since the patient is unaware of what's actually going on, it produces a great deal of alarm (panic) and sometimes anticipatory anxiety, resulting in further hyperventilation.   While some patients are able to unlearn this faulty breathing pattern it is generally necessary to refer them to someone who practices cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), an interactive and self-limited variant of psychotherapy different from conventional and open-ended \"talk\" therapy. Often a combination of the two may help find the root cause of the problem, but managing the breathing problem is almost exclusively a function of short-term CBT.   I hope this is helpful. Please follow up with us here as needed. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Do my daughter and I need the flu vaccine?",
    "content": "Hi there -- This is a difficult question. Even if your doctor told you specifically you each had had the flu, and the symptoms and clinical picture all fit, you still may not have had the flu du jour, and sometimes virulent viral infections can mimic influenza and not be influenza. You could be tested for the specific antibodies, but that hardly seems worthwhile. Neither of you are in a high-risk group for the annual influenza variant -- although H1N1 is an entirely different matter -- so getting the regular flu shot wouldn't do any harm and still might prevent you both from getting the flu going around this year. On the other hand, since you're not in a high risk group anyway, it may be worth the roughly 40/60 gamble and just skip the shot this year. It's strictly a personal decision, and if you're not very young (infant, toddler) or \"elderly\" (a vague definition now generally considered to be over 65, and neither of you have a chronic disease or condition, you'd likely be pretty safe in passing on the vaccine this year. If you want to make certain you don't have the flu experience twice this year (assuming what you both has was just some other random virus) then getting the shot won't do any harm.    Hope this helps. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -- This is probably not a big concern, but a pulmonologist probably should be consulted just to be on the safe side. An AV fistula is an unnatural connection between an artery and a vein, and given the worst circumstances could cause some serious problems -- of which you'd likely be quite aware already. Since this one is at the bottom of a lung chances are it's pretty small and not causing much if any problem, so I wouldn't be especially worried about it, but I would at least have it checked, at least have the CT films run past a pulmonologist just to be certain there isn't any potential for future problems. My instinct is this is a really trivial issue, but we go on facts, so hopefully you'll get the opinion of either a pulmonary or vascular specialist.   Hope this is helpful. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Half Paralyzed diaphragm...",
    "content": "Hi Kreg -- Partial paralysis of the diaphragm can be pretty uncomfortable at times, and people who have it often do develop chronic anxiety due to the sensations it causes which make them more aware of their breathing. This, in turn, makes the sensation of shortness of breath all the more acute. This is an area which may need work. Also, while the partial paralysis shouldn't affect your heart, there is still a family history of heart disease, which will eventually become a significant risk factor on its own. That and smoking are the top two risk factors for future heart disease, and one is controllable. Just keep that in mind. Your diaphragmatic problem in itself should be a contributor, but in time you may well have other reasons to be concerned. You (and only you) can eliminate one of those. That would make the other one (family history) far more manageable.  Diaphragmatic paralysis, smoking, anxiety and stuffy nose all can contribute to nocturnal dyspnea (trouble breathing), some of it quite genuine, some of it illusory but still annoying. For the nasal problem first make sure you don't have chronic sinusitis, a deviated nasal septum, or something similar. Also in many parts of the country it's chilly enough for the heat to be coming on, and this alone, if not coupled with a good-quality humidifier, can cause nasal stuffiness.   Basically your shortness of breath seems fairly explainable right now. If everything seems normal on physical exam and you continue to have symptoms it's likely you're developing some chronic respiratory anxiety. If this is the case, cognititve behavioral therapy (CBT), a kind of interactive, self-limited psychotherapy (not talk-therapy so much but actual re-trainin) is often very helpful and unlike talk therapy doesn't potentially go on forever.   Hope this is helpful. Good luck to you and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

So long as the granuloma's not causing any significant symptoms and is not changing/growing, there's little cause for concern. If it begins to compromise your ability to perform physical work then of course it would need more in-depth exploration -- and to be sure it's not being cause by some other coincidental disease process (such as sarcoidosis), but given your work history it seems likely this is the underlying cause and again, so long as there are no significant changes (which would be noted in perhaps annual followups or if symptoms do develop) then there's really no need to be overly concerned.

They could do a fine needle aspiration of the lump (remove some cells from within it, have them analyzed)....though some docs might be leary about doing this, 1) they're no 100% guarantee when you do a FNA that you're going to definitely hit the spot with the potentially abnormal cells....2) that sticking a needle into the lump could disrupt the cells and risk spreading them.  In some cases, the entire lump is removed, taking some of the area around it (margins)...and then it's analyzed.  Is there any way he could get out of Iraq and be sent to one of the larger Military Hospitals in Germany to have this checked out properly?

    "content": "Hi Docs,  First of all, just want to say thanks to whoever put up this site. Have no idea how relieved i am to have found a medical site where i can discuss stuff with dotors. Anyway, I also have this lump located over my Xyphoid process. I only notice that lump when i first felt this slight pain last early April. Its slightly painful when pressed. Size of around 1 inch diameter, slightly off-centered towards the liver area, feels hard inside like a soft bone, and non moving. No discoloration, definitely not bug bites, no itchiness, it seems like its located many layers under the skin since when i move the skin around the lump stays fixed in that same location underneath. I'm a 29 year old currently working here in China, I went to the best hospital here in this part of the country, they told me that this is normal soft bone and nothing to worry about. They say test is not needed. That time i also complain to them about a slight pain inside the liver area so they ultrasound my upper abdominal area and told me there is slight inflamation of my gall bladder, but no gall stone found. I like to know if that lump is really nothing to worry about or is there any connection to the gall bladder inflamation problem? Because both problems occured same time. These past few weeks, with proper diet, the inflamation problem seems to have subsided, no more pain, but the lump is still there. The pain slight pain when pressed is still there. I checked my dad's he also has this lump, but my brother doesn't, and i know when i was a child i also don't have it.  Thanks in advance  Lanz\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I am writing in regards to my boyfriend of two years (whom is stubborn & won't go see a doctor).  He has this lump the size of a grape in the center of his chest between the breast muscles on his sternum(not sure how to spell that).  It is attached and does not move at all.  The lump has been there for about three weeks and was sore & a little painful at first however now the soreness & pain  has subsided.  He has been short of breath for about two to three weeks as well. He is 25 & in reasonably good shape.  He works construction therefore he is continuiously using his upper body muscles.  Also, we noticed last night above the lump, located at the top of his right breast muscle is swollen also.  He says that he has not hit or dropped anything on his chest, that the lump & swolleness just appeared.  I am very concerned for him & his shortness of breath worries me tremendously.  Any advice would be much appreciated!! Thank You for your time.\n\n",

When I get a flare-up, I take ibuprofin to reduce the inflammation of the cartilege.  As far as previous chest trauma, I guess it can be something from many years ago.  I determined that mine was caused by a car accident in 1979.  THe condition started last year - after a series of stresses (overworking) to my chest area.  WHen I get a pain flare-up - it sometimes radiates all the way down my last rib - which is exactly what was damaged in the car accident...and the pain seems to be mostly on the surface - rather than inside.  Sensitive to touch.  Again, a couple days of ibuprofin and it goes away.  Get a professional opinion - for sure - but this is a possibilty.  Moving transmissions could surely trigger this.\n\n",

I covered it with some medicated bandages for a couple of days and some ichthammol ointment to try drawing the pus out.

The lining of the stomach/esophagus can get small tears in it during emesis that bleed some but heal quickly.  If you continue vomiting or there is becoming more blood in your emesis I would recommend you see your doctor.  If you're feeling fine I wouldn't be too concerned about the slight blood.  As always, though, the internet is not a place for solid medical advice since I cannot examine you.  If there is any concern seeing your doctor is best.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Missing Pectorial Muscles",
    "content": "Is there any type of surgery to repair pectorial musles so that my breast implants can look normal?  Let me give you the following background:  I have undergone 3 breast implant surgeries.  The first was done in the early 80's. The implants were placed over the muscles, they were silicone implants.  In 2001 I had the implants replaced with gel type because of concerns over silicone and also they appeared to have lost volume.  At this time the surgeon told my husband (I never was able to speak with the surgeon) that the implants had leaked \"all over\" he told my husband that it was \"one for the text books\", whatever that meant. He placed the gel implants under the musucle to help prevent hardening. There were photos included in my file showing leakage. In 2007 I had a third surgery because the gel implants had hardened.  These implants were to be silicone, and placed under the muscle.  This surgery lasted twice as long as normal due to the fact that the surgeon had multiple problems, the main problem was that I only had a small amount of pectorial muscle on one side, none on the other.  There was no or very little breast tissue and very thin skin.  The surgeon was at a lost to explain what had happened to the muscle.  There are photos showing the lack of muscle.  He stated that had I not been in such good health, he would have just closed the incisions and just left me without  implants because of the amount of time I was \"under\".  I am very self concious of my body and would do anything to make myself feel more normal. Any help or suggestions are greatly appreciated.  Thank you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Missing Pectorial Muscles",
    "content": "Hi there--  I'm so sorry to hear of your problems with the implants, but this does happen, and sometimes some strange, localized autoimmune effects such as loss of muscle mass are known to have taken place in certain patients. I've seen a little of this in passing (not having had any direct experience in plastics other than to assist with trauma repairs) and while it has to be terribly distressing I would think a good plastic surgeon should be able to do some sort of reconstructive work in the pectoral area that would roughly duplicate the form, if not the function, of the pectorals, which would help make everything look more right. Evidently your current doctor isn't up to speed on some of the more advanced reconstructive work. You would probably do well to find a surgeon at a major center and have a consult regarding just what can be done to even this out. It's important and while this does occasionally happen, avoiding silicone can largely avoid the really bad results such as you've experienced. Saline for the actual breast augmentation and some of the newer full-thickness muscle augmentation materials (I can't recall the names of them now, again because this is not something I've worked with, only had some conversations with plastic surgeons over a trauma repair) to help bring the chest wall flush seems a fairly reasonable expectation. I certainly hope you're able to find someone with the degree of interest that would be able to bring this about. Good luck to you, keep your spirits up, and please follow up here with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  The file linked in your post wouldn't open, although it was clearly the right one. However, given your description of the problem it sounds very likely you were diagnosed with h. pylori bacterial infection of the stomach,  which was also causing some reflux which can cause a cough. While it is generally wise to have an endoscopy done to see if the bacterium has caused an ulcer, antibiotics are the correct treatment and the symptoms you describe do fit. This can be diagnosed via blood test, so if the situation begins to improve with the medicine you will probably continue to improve.   I hope this is helpful. I will come back and try the linked file site again later,  and if I find anything additional will comment here, but I think it's pretty clear what's happened.   Good luck to you.

    "title": "Re: Infant Tracheomalacia",
    "content": "Hello --  Tracheomalacia will not progress to GERD, but is a problem all its own. It is sometimes problematic and can require treatment or at least close followup until and unless it resolves on its own, which it often does between 18-24 months of age. In tracheomalacia the trachea is, from birth, floppy, the cartilege forming the trachea is soft, and there is sometimes a fine line between this and normal, because babies do have rather soft and flexible tracheas anyway. If the child's breathing is noisy with crowing, wheezing, etc., or these things arise during feeding or crying, then the diagnosis is probably tracheomalacia, but a laryngoscopic exam is the only sure way to be certain. If this is confirmed then the child needs to be observed closely for any sort of abnormal breath sounds or difficulties as outlined above. Again, this most often resolves on its own by age two at the latest. If not, or if difficulties become pronounced, it may require medical intervention, which can include minor surgery. Usually this isn't necessary.   I hope this helps answer your question. It is best to know for sure if this is the problem so that appropriate measures can be taken if diffculties develop. Please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there --  While this and other household bug sprays can cause some airway irritation, the larger problem is usually systemic and caused by long-term misuse. You may have helped bring on a cold that was already percolating and this just helped set things off. That said, it's important when using these sprays (and especially ones like Hot Shot, which is intended for spot insect killing) to be certain there is adequate ventilation, that you're working with the wind at your back (however gentle the wind may be) or, if there is no wind, then to either clear the area immediately after hitting the target, or using a respirator for prolonged close work. You're probably fine, may have to ride out this cold, but when it's gone you should be okay. Just be sure you don't use this stuff at length without adequate fresh air at least, as the effects of inhlation and skin absorbtion, over time, can cause more serious systemic problems. You do need to keep it out of your face, though.   Hope this is helpful. Good luck to you and do follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there --   No, constochondritis is a fairly superficial inflammatory problem and should not be affecting visceral functions like swallowing, If you're having pain on swallowing you need to see a gastroenterologist and rule out esophageal ulcer and esophageal spasm as possibilities. It's always possible to be having more than one thing at a time going on, and it may be you do have costochondritis, but this is also a popular default diagnosis where chest pain is concerned, so whether it's present or not you'll need to have this other thing looked into just to be sure there isn't something that could be easily treated separate from the chest wall inflammation.

    "content": "Hello --  While  it's not generally practical to exercise vigorously during this sort of problem (either one will limit what you can do), light exercise is okay if you feel up to it, and if you do not build up an oxygen debt by working harder than you can keep the air moving. If you begin to cough spasmodically during any exercise you'll need to stop at once, and it's probably best to just give this a few days to get a better feel for where it's going before you resume any serious exercise. Whooping cough, in  particular, can really put a cramp in your exercise program, so please be cautious  in what you do. Basically your body should tell you if what you're doing is okay or too much.  Hope this helps. Good luck to you with this and please follow up with   us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Fibrotic Scanning seen and tiny calcification found during Chest X-Ray   I am 39 year old male from India, I have no major health problem. I am married for past 9 years and have a healthy son, age 8 years. I am not overweight 80 kgs, Height 185 centimeters, my Blood Pressure is good 110/70, i have no cholestrol problem, but i have my SGPT/SGOT running on a slightly hiigher side (got to know of it since past 3 years), as during one sonography it was revealed that i have \"moderate degree of diffuse fat infiltration\" in my liver. I do not drink or smoke at all.   About 3 years ago, during a regular Chest X-Ray P.A., it was revealed- \" Minimal fibrotic scarring is seen in right apex with tiny calcification in left upper zone\". I have never got any tuberculosis or any other major disease, hence to rule out any possibility a C.T. Scan (COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY) was carried out, in that the following was mentioned:   \"Thin axial plain sections were obtained for both the lungs on high resolution algorithm.   A small sub centimeter sized rounded nodule with calcification is noted in the left upper lobe representing healed granuloma. Rest of the lung fields show no significant parenchymal or intersitial abnormality. No evidence of any fibrosis, honeycombing, air space consolidation and bronchiectasis is noted.   The trachea and main stem bronchi appears normal.   The pleural spaces appears normal.   No obvious mediastinal or hilar mass lesion is seen.   Impression- No active disease is noted.\"     Recently for a Employment Visa medical test, during Chest X-Ray, \" OLD CALCIFIED FOCI LEFT UPPER ZONE OF LUNG\" has become a cause of rejection for me on medical grounds.   Could you please tell me if this is really serious, if so what extra test i need to undergo? Also is there any medication or minor surgical procedure to get rid of this calcification, as i understand that there was something at some time, but now there is no disease and it is only left there as a mark or remains.   Please reply!   Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  Thanks for your comprehensive history and background. This is a great help. What you have is extremely common in TB-prone areas, and usually is due to having inhaled a tubercal bacterium, which is then walled off and no infection takes place. The encapsulation becomes calcified over time, which makes it even more secure as a rule. While  other things, such as an inflammation due to pneumonia or some other inhaled matter can also cause this, it is most often due to TB bacterium being trapped and sealed off in the lung. It represents no medical problem  unless for some reason it is disturbed later, in which case sometimes the dormant bacterium can become activated.  Usually,  however, they are dead after this long.  I feel it  is unreasonable  in most cases to refuse a person work based on this finding, as it so rarely causes a problem. However, where a visa is involved there sometimes is required an appeal process to get past this obstacle, since many countries will not accept anyone who is even remotely suspect of having been exposed to TB. The fact is this is likely to pose no medical problem to  you. As to the employment visa, yes, I know this is sometimes an issue. I would try and find out if there is an appeals process you can follow, since this really is a trivial finding.  I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck with this and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Subcutaneous Emphysema",
    "content": "I am a 24 year old female.  Five days ago, I sustained a neck injury at work.  I was performing a restraint on a client (client was attacking staff members) when I got the injury.  There was two incidents of restraints (safely putting a client in a hold to prevent them from hurting themselves or others).  After the first restraint, I experienced severe chest pain and a dry hacking cough.  My throat hurt so bad, I had difficulty swallowing and talking.    The second restraint occurred about five hours later.  During the restraint, my neck felt \"frozen\" in place.  I couldn't move my head to the left or forward, my neck would \"spring\" back to the right.  This lasted about two hours and then I could keep my head straight. The next day I saw the doctor and told him my symptoms.  He ordered an x-ray.  For two days, my throat hurt so bad I couldn't swallow anything and even had a change in my voice.  My neck was sore, and the pain radiated into the top of my back and shoulders as the days went on. I went to the ER three days after the incident because I was having abdominal pain in my right side underneath my rib.  The x-ray didn't show anything because there was mysterious air pockets in my abdomin. I saw the doctor today for the x-ray results.  I'm feeling better.  I have better range of motion in my neck.  My throat doesn't hurt and my voice is back.  I have a minor sore throat on the back of my throat on the left side.  However, the back of my neck, upper back, and shoulders still hurt quite a bit.  He said there was a lot of air showing in the soft tissue x-ray.  His conclusion was...something could've popped in my lungs causing air to be released in the soft tissues.  He said it should go away, but to keep him updated if anything changes. Later today, I had to go to another doctor regarding the same incident because I was also biten by this client.  I told him about the neck injury as an explanation for not starting the antibiotic right away because I couldn't swallow anything.  He immediately became frantically concerned when I told him about the x-ray results.  He mentioned \"????? emphysema\" (I looked it up later).  He literally barged out of the exam room exclaiming to the nurse that I had a serious neck injury and wanted my company's Safety Coordinator notified to make sure that my other doctor is following up on it, etc....  When he got his answer, he came back in, sat down, stated he was only supposed to treat the bites and the other doctor was going to follow up on the neck injury.  I did read up on-line about this, but I don't understand a lot of it.  It seems like it really depends on the situation.  Should I be worried?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Subcutaneous Emphysema",
    "content": "Hello --  I hope by now this has started to resolve on its own, and you most likely did/do have some degree of subcutaneous emphysema. This means, as you noted, air escapes (from an unnatural leak) into the tissues, usually around the upper chest and neck, causing some puffiness or swelling, often neck stiffness, etc., such as you've felt, and usually it is not dangerous, but can be very uncomfortable.  Treatment is largely aimed at fixing the underlying injury or lesion.  In your case it would be an injury, and it's difficult to tell, from  here, whether you suffered a spontaneous pneumothorax (\"collapsed\" lung or at least a small hole, ruptured bullus,  in the lung) or possibly a separation in the cartiligenous rings of your trachea. Either could cause the symptoms you describe,  although pneumothorax is more common. You mght want to go back and retrace the various stages of the two events, and how you may have been struck, and where. Radiological studies should reveal where the leak took place, although it may have been small enough to have sealed on its own by now.   Sometimes, if there is puffiness or swelling of tissues locally, pressing on the area will produce a characteristic \"rice krispies\" sound,  almost like  tiny bubble wrap popping. This is the air bubbles trapped in the tissues popping (and won't do any addiotnal harm, may even relieve some pressure). The goal is to make sure the injury is okay. A \"neck injury\" in this case, I would think, would  suggest a fractured larynx, causing a tiny leak between rings of cartilege, but it's hard to tell, since your symptoms have been  fairly nonspecific. These injuries are usually not serious and often will resolve on their own, but should be followed by a physician for sure, with repeat CT scans to make  certain the air is dispersing and there's no redsidual leakage. Please follow up with your regular doctor and also keep us updated here. Hope all is well. My best to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  While adult croup is usually more of an annoyance than anything else, it can be a big annoyance and, rarely, progress to epiglottitis, which is what makes it so dangerous in children. You do not want this, so by all means continue both medications, and you might also try inhaling steam as well. Cool mist vapor is  preferable but not always handy, so even the warm steam from a shower is sometimes helpful. Guaifenesin, an expectorant (Mucinex brand name here in the US) is also sometimes helpful in  loosening the exudate and easing the cough effort and has almost no contraindications nor side effects. Should be available over the counter readily. Also, if this does not improve significantly in a few days, by all means  return to the (or a) doctor or, if any breathing difficulties (or even the suggestion) should occur, get straight to an emergency facility. This is unlikely to happen, but it can in adults on rare occasions, so one should be  aware at least.  I hope this is helfpul to you. Good luck with this and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  While your radiology report states \"mild fibrotic appearance\" and while this may well be correct and even related in one of two ways to the pancreatitis, it doesn't rise to the level of concern, because it could also be due to smoking and mainly it just isn't that unusual, neither radiologically nor symptomatically. For that reason I would not be concerned, and as of now you do not have pulmonary fibrosis.   The two possible causes of this appearance, as well as the atelactasis, are 1) the thing you mentioned, the guarding over breathing during severe abdominal pain and 2) a sometimes genetic predisposition to fibrotic disease which may have affected the pancreas and could also cause \"mild fibrotic appearance\" in other organ systems as well, generally without symptoms or any actual disease.   In any case your report is not remarkable, and the only suggestion I would attach is that you have repeat CT of the chest periodically (every few years) for a couple cycles, just to be certain there's no progression to actual disease, although you would likely develop symptoms in the meantime anyway. The best thing you can do for yourself right now is to go forward with your smoking cessation program. Otherwise I would not be worries at all, and just keep treating yourself right. Be well. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: What could cause costochondritis?",
    "content": "Hello --  Costochondritis can be caused by any number of sometimes very subtle and unremarked physical actions as well as sometimes by viral inflammation. It could even, yes, definitely be caused by playing bagpipes, or at least aggravated by it.  Most any activity that puts strain upon the accessory muscles and cartilege between the ribs near the sternum can cause chronic inflammation of these tissues with consequent pain, tenderness, stabbing sensations, and pain upon pressures and certain upper body movements. Again, bagpipe playing could most certainly cause or aggravate it.   Costochondritis usually responds well to non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofin (Advil, Motrin) or naproxyn (Aleve). If these fail to control or eliminate the symptoms, sometimes a stronger, prescription-strength NSAIDs or other anti-inflammatories sometimes have to be employed.  If you suffer noticeable shortness of breath you should have a physical exam including chest x-ray and 12-lead EKG, but this is simply precautionary, since you seem to have pretty well explained the mechanism of injury and have been diagnosed correctly. If your doctor isn't aware of the bagpipe connection you might invite him to try and get some sound out of a set sometime. :)  I hope this answers your question. Good luck to you and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

You require no treatment for TB. Use of the BCG vaccine is somewhat controversial, depending on what part of the world you're living in, but you certainly are okay to have it if it's needed, based on your test result. If the local protocol calls for an annual Mantoux test then you should of course repeat it, Otherwise you should be fine.  Hope this is helpful.  Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello.  I quit smoking after smoking 1.5-2 packs a day for 25 years. Now I don't expect to be healthy overnight...I am sure I've done a great deal of damage to my poor body!  I know all the \"usual\" things to expect when one quits, but I have never heard of the symptoms I have been experiencing:  --Sharp, stabbing pains under my right breast that sometimes starts in the same place in my back (and then moves through so I feel it under my breast); I also felt this on my left side once.  Have never felt this while smoking...would have scared the smoke out of me!  In both instances, these pains have been followed by belches...could it be merely gas???  They last for a few minutes, and happen...so far...maybe once a day.  Sometimes I feel the same \"pain\" lingering there but it is not as sharp and stabbing.  --Same sharp pains in the right side of my throat, right in the crook of my neck!  I experienced this WITH the pain mentioned above, and independent of it.    --I also have a white nodule looking thing on my left tonsil, and another just underneath it.  I have been experiencing a burning-type sore throat as well.  I have also experienced what I understand to be typical post-quit symptoms:  tingling in hands/arms, feet/lower legs; dizzyness, frequent clearning of the throat (no cough--yet); etc.    Also...I am on the patch...using Step 1, 21 mgs over 24 hours.  I have just moved into a new city/state less than a month ago and work from home. Consequently, I know no one and have no doctor...yet.  I will be visiting the Urgent Care center this afternoon for lack of knowing where else to turn...these symptoms are rather frightening and I have yet to find on online forums another ex-smoker who shares or shared these symptoms.  Any thoughts???  --Ex-smoker filled with regrets but determined never to give in to this addiction again!\n\n",

The nodule in your throat warrants a visit to your Ear Nose and Throat specialist, who will probably want to remove your tonsils and adenoids (a procedure called a T&A - tonsilectomy and adenoidectomy).  Remember that if ANY doctor places you on antibiotics, it is VERY important that you finish the ENTIRE regimen of medicne.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Help with Surprising Post-Quit-Smoking Symptoms",
    "content": "Hello -  First, to echo mal304, congratulations on your having stopped smoking and on your very strong resolve to stay quit. Good job!  The pains you describe in your right chest, back, and sometimes throat or neck definitely could be caused by gas, usually gas trapped in the hepatic flexure of the large intestine. I know this seems like an inordinate distance for the pain to be referred, but what happens is the sharp turn in the colon right at that point often does trap gas; what happens next, of course, is gas likes to move upward, in this case as though in a balloon. The bloating at the  flexure pushes up instead of down, and this brings it into contact with the right side of the bottom of your diaphragm. The diaphragm is loaded with nerves some of which are traceable all the way up to the cranium. It also doesn't like being touched. These sensations, which can be sharp, sticking pains, often can travel up into the chest on the affected side, on into the throat, and  sometimes even straight up into the head.  They can be quite debilitating at times.   I of course can't be certain that's what you're experiencing, but it seems likely based on the description and also because you are post-quitting. Quite often people who have quit smoking tend to swallow air while taking deep breaths due to the general discomfort caused by withdrawal, as well as the habit of taking long draws on cigarettes. The swallowed air gets trapped in the location described above (or in the splenic flexure on the left) and pains such as you describe often result. The pains sometimes seem to wander around and I have heard the description of a \"fork moving around around inside.\" Colorful but accurate.  The white nodule on your tonsil is a common sign of tonsillitis. Sometimes they go away, but if you are having burning sore throat as well, it deserves at least a look. Since doctors no longer like to take tonsils out as a rule (especially in adults) you are most likely to be put on a course of antibiotics. Again,  well worth it.   I hope this has been helpful. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: severe cough, chest pain, bronchial pneumonia?",
    "content": "Hi there --  I think you either have bronchitis or possibly a new presentation of asthma. However, since the phlegm has been yellowish it's probably due to an infection,  and while bronchial pneumonia is a potentially very serious disease, bronchitis doesn't automatically lead to it, and in fact it's mostly seen in small children and the elderly. Still, if this doesn't resolve soon you probably should see a doctor, especially if the cough becomes so spasmodic that it makes you vomit. (The color could be caused by blood, and that warrants investigation on its own, although it probably wasn't due to the cough itself). You also could have pertussis (whooping cough) which often does cause a mostly dry, unproductive cough that frequently becomes uncontrollable, causing gagging or vomiting. This usually resolves on  its own but can be pretty uncomfortable, and there are medications to treat the symptoms til it resolves.  You also (if all else is ruled out) might have asthma/bronchitis related to gastroesophageal reflux, which can cause the same sort of symptoms but happens most frequently during exercise. (\"Exercise-induced asthma\").   I'd see a doctor just to be sure there's nothing more serious going on, and to have something prescribed to break up the phlegm (whcih isn't moving as it should) and suppress the most severe coughing. You'll feel better and if there's an infection  that  needs antibiotics you'll be able to have it taken care of at the same time.  I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you. Follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there --  There are a number of possible causes of this, and the one which most closely resembles what you describe would be pertussis (whooping cough), which is  well known to cause deep coughing which triggers vomiting. However, it also could be due to gastroesophageal reflux (GERD), or a number of other things. She needs to be worked up for this problem, as there's nothing good or even very tolerable about this sort of problem. If it should turn out to be  pertussis it can be treated symptomatically until it resolves on its own; if it is due to GERD, this can be treated specifically and the problem relieved. If it is anything else there should be  some means of management. First it needs to be diagnosed, however.   I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you both.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  My wife has just suffered her third spontaneous numothorax (referred to as SN from here on to save my fingers) today. Her first was the left lung over five years ago. Her second, on the 29th April 2005 whilst we were on holiday in the Cayman Islands. We saw a Canadian thorasic specialist there who cleared us to fly home the day after the lung had re-inflated.  We are confused and alittle concerned by the different and sometimes contradictory information provided regarding her condition. Apparently SNs are normally suffered by tall skinny men. My wife is 5'2\", slim and generally healthy, so all seem at a loss to explain. Hereditory possibilities have been alluded to, but in truth, we don't know.  The Canadian specialist told us he could see 'boules'? or bubbles in her lung and that these ruptured causing the collapse. In the UK we have yet to be given this degree of information, but have always been told not to risk flying for a minimum of 6 weeks after an SN. Given that we flew home (three pressurised flights in 30 hrs) the day after 100% inflation was confirmed, could this have contributed to the collapse today?   The only course of treatment we have been informed as the condition appears to be persistent is to either use talcum powder or similar to irritate the lungs surface so that it heals (bonding to the chest wall) - OR - to 'staple' the affected area of the lung, removing any affected tissue.  Given the inconsistencies in details and advice thus far, we are wary of agreeing to this invasive surgery. I have searched the web, finding very little information relating to SPONTANEOUS numothoraces. What should we do?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Maya,  My husband just showed me your email.  It's surprising that you never hear of this, until it happens to you.  Since mine, I think on just about every hospital documentary, someone was admitted with a collapsed lung.  I think it is much more common than you realise.  I was referred to a lung specialist hospital and admitted for surgery.  I was advised that they allowed this to happen twice, but a third pneumothorax was not acceptable and surgery was recommended.  I had key-hole surgery through front lower chest, side and back and they cut away part of my lung and stapled my lung to chest wall.  I returned home Friday following the operation on the Tuesday.  I was very sore for about 10 weeks after but had very effective pain-killers. At my follow up I was advised that my lung would never be able to 'de-flate' again, however around 2% of people can still suffer a hole forming, but as the lung is now attached to my chest, it cannot collapse. I think I had a few panic attacks after when I thought it had collapsed again, but looking back, I think it was just fear of it happening again.  My only regret is that I didn't have surgery on my left lung (which collapsed 5 years previously).  My surgeon said that had my hospital informed him of this, he would have corrected both lungs.  I am now very wary of flying and have not done so since the surgery.  However the day will come no doubt.  If it is any consolation, I was told that if 6 months pass after a collapse, the chance of it happening again is greatly reduced and touch wood, my left lung has remained 'intact' ever since.  As yours was in September, I should be very hopeful that this was a one-off and all you can do is carry on as normal and try not to think about it.  Best wishes and I hope you enjoy continued good health.  Tracey.\n\n",

I doubt that I have come into close contact with anyone with TB. I'm a healthy girl with no health complications whatsoever.  Is it possible that I have TB?

    "content": "Hi there -  While it is less likely that you have TB, having had a clear chest x-ray, this doesn't absolutely rule out an infection. The x-ray is a screening tool largely, and sometimes one can have TB without yet having developed any lesions that would show up.  After prolonged infection (which can continue undetected in many people for quite a long time), a later x-ray would probably not come up clear.   For this reason, and because your test was positive (even though these can sometimes turn up false positives), it would be far wiser to follow up to be sure, rather than take a chance  on becoming ill (and spreading the disease) later on. If you're truly TB-free then that will be great news. If not, that will be useful to know so you can be treated for it and keep yourself healthy.    Good luck to you. Please keep us updated here.\n\n",

    "content": "My girlfriend has had a dry, painful, periodic non-progressive cough for more than a month, and has also been congested. (running nose, some difficulty breathing...) Other than some cough relief medicine, she has not seen a doctor or been treated. She did not feel abnormally fatigued during this time.  Since several days ago, her body has been unnaturally warm around her face and neck, even while she complained of feeling cold. She is not sweating unnaturally. Yesterday, she began to feel nauseous while walking, and her body began to ache later that night, to the point that she was unable to get any sleep. She says it is worst around her face and eyes, and the pain seems to be coming from within (as opposed to from the skin). The pain is not throbbing. I feel that she has a fever, but am a bit unsure. She does not feel like throwing up, and has no appetite.   Some other things to consider: She has had pneumonia before, and says that this feels different, in that she isn't coughing as much.  She had gotten a flu vaccine some time before acquiring the cough, and that had made her slightly ill for a couple days.   I would like to know what this illness probably is, and whether or not it is serious. Also, any home remedy/non-prescription medicine suggestions would be greatly appreciated, as she is not covered by any insurance.   I apologize if her condition isn't strictly pulmonary: I felt that her illness/nausea could probably be related to her coughing/congestion, so I posted in this section.   Thank you in advance, it is much appreciated!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  After a month of debilitating illness I'd hope your girlfriend is ready to see an actual MD, even if it requires a financial stretch. While it sounds very much like she has a chronic deep sinus infection (the dry cough, runny nose, congestion, nausea,  etc., all fit the clinical picture, anyway, and especially now the throbbing pain around her face and eyes) the only way to be certain would be to be examined in real time by a healthcare professional who can then either prescribe antibiotics (which she by now may very well need) or give her some samples.   If she doesn't have pneumonia again it may be only a matter of time before she does,  if not something worse, as untreated sinus infections can cause some serious problems inside the head as well as the lower respiratory tract when left untreated.  Home care for this would include inhaling steam (preferably cool steam as from a nebulizer, but steam from the shower would at least help), ibuprofin or naproxyn for pain, and guaifenesin (either generic or as Mucinex) to help loosen the secretions in her head and, if necessary, her chest also. This may help her feel better, but she definitely needs to be seen as this has gone on too long now, and could turn into something more serious and won't naturally just go away on its own.   I hope  this is helpful. Best of luck to you. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  Based on your description of the symptoms, plus the fact that your EKG and bloodwork have been normal, I strongly suspect you are suffering from an anxiety problem. This may have built up over a long period of time, or could have been triggered by some fairly recent stressful event or situation. You've done the right things to have heart and lung problems ruled out, which was appropriate. You describe some things that are extremely common in anxious people, including the dry mouth, dizziness and feeling of low blood pressure. Anxious people tend to unconsciously do a lot of deep sighing, which not only makes the mouth dry but can actually cause dehydration. It can also cause lightheadedness as in low blood pressure.   Palpitations, while common in the general population, are noted far more frequently by anxious people as well.   This is a more difficult thing to deal with than physical problems, because those can be isolated, treated, and measured. Anxiety is a much more elusive and tricky animal. I'd strongly suggest bringing this to the attention of someone who specializes in anxiety problems,  such as a psychotherapist who's adept at cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which is one of the more effective tools in the arsenal of anxiety management -- along with medications to help get things in hand initially.  I hope this is helpful to you. Please follow up with us as needed, and keep us updated, as well.\n\n",

Being someone who is the sone of the doctor AND as someone who suffers from occasional anxiety (and hypochondria), I know the difference. I assume most people know their bodies and its retarded for doctors to tell them, essentially \"don't listen to what your body is telling you -- it's all in your mind.\"  This is what they all say when they do not know how to diagnose the problem, or are doctors int he traditional western tradition which essentially does not attack a problem until it is already too late.  Sounds to me like you might be suffering what I suffered -- a pneumothorax. I've had a lot of the the same sumptoms as you.  Explain, in as much detail as possible, the first time you felt this way. What happened?  What followed?  Any unusual sounds or feelings besides the pain or heaviness?  Does it make any difference what position you are in (physically speaking)?  Does it make any difference what position you are in socially or environmentally speaking?  Think of anything that you can find that is common to all of your episodes, and please dish to the forum.  3 of my pneumothoracies went undiagnosed, and even with my 4th, with all the same symptoms (which was finally diagnosed) doctors are saying that they'd rather not DO anything because they don't think that they have enough evidence that it has happened before.  Doctors, as smart and hard-working as they are, are fallible, like the rest of us. Do your own research, and make a good case to your PCP o specialist for whatever tests you think may be applicable if he/she doesn't recommend them on his/her own.  Better safe than sorry, buster.\n\n",

    "content": "Three years ago I had acute bronchitis, I took antibiotics but they didn't seem to help a lot. After about a month my cough and wheezing went. Afterwards, I didn't notice any particular breathing problems, only that during the winter I would sometimes feel a slight heaviness at the bottom of my chest. However, over last eight months I began to notice that occasionally I felt a little short of breath. As the months passed by it became more frequent, but still intermittent, and sometimes I would begin to suddenly feel short of breathe even when sitting down, but eventually it would pass. I went to a doctor here in slovakia. He asked a few different questions, and then did a spirometry test and an x-ray. He concluded that I had COPD. I was totally shocked by this as I am 27, I have never smoked, or spent much time in smoky places, or worked with any dangerous substances, there is no history of this in my family. I have two older siblings and they have no lung problems. When he listened to my chest, he said that my breathing sounded clear, and I can't say I really have much of a cough. I am currently taking an anithistamine daily, a tablet broncholidator twice daily, and two steriod inhlaers twice daily. I am always very nervous when I go to the doctors, and so wonder whether this may have affected my spirometry results. Also I have been under a lot of stress the last few months, and so it may be a contributor as I suffered briefly with panic attacks as a child. I  also suffer with irritable bowel symdrome and have intolerence to certain foods, like raw onion, and sometimes garlic for example. Could my problem be more to do with stress and some allergy or food intolerance?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  While it is possible to develop COPD early and without smoking, it is usually due either to chronic bronchitis or asthma,  or to some environmental contaminant. While any of these is theoretically possible, it seems unlikely.  The fact that you're aware of the potential of stress in anxious people  to adversely affect breathing patterns  and to throw off the CO2 balance, causing some difficulty in putting out air forcefully, temporarily, this could be  a possible factor also,  although I  would think a competent physician would recognize this, as it may have compromised the test. I'm not aware of any way in which IBS could affect a PFT, however. Do you know which type of spirometer was used and which sort of reading was done? There are several, as well as a chemical challenge test, and it just seems slightly odd that the diagnosis of COPD was made so quickly and possibly under  less than ideal conditions.   Again, it is possible you have COPD, but I really think a second opinion, based on a fully comprehensive pulmonary function test might yield different results. It may well be worth the trouble.   I hope this is helpful to you.  Best  of luck and please keep us updated.\n\n",

I only did this breathing test, no others. I also had an x-ray done and that was clear. Yesterday, I went for a checkup and my doctor did another spirometry test, and my results were dramatically better than the first time. My first test showed I had medium hard respiratory problems, and the second one showed that I have light respiratory problems. He also took a blood sample, but the results were clear. He's slightly changed my medication and has also prescribed calcium supplements in order to strengthen my immune system which he feels is weak. I will return in 10 days time. My doctor has told me that he's a little unsure as to what exactly is wrong with me, but he's still considering it and treating it under the umberella term of COPD.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi again -  This is very interesting. Apparently your problem varies depending upon so-far-unknown factors, which makes it sound rather like asthma more than COPD. Also, I'm a little skeptical of that diagnosis because of the fairly limited testing and generally positive exam. I'm relieved to hear the doctor is loosening somewhat the strict diagnosis. Even if you have asthma it would be treated \"under the umbrella\" of COPD, pretty much. Hopefully this continues in a good direction and the main concern is that you are able to function normally, even if it means use of asthma/COPD meds. What this is called is only important clinically.   Thanks again for following up. Stay in touch,please, and let us know how things progress.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 20 year old female in relatively good health. I have for the past week been experiencing some problems at night sleeping. I have woken up twice with severe pain in my upper/middle back that makes me feel like I can't breath. I can't sleep when it hits me. I can't lay on my back or side. The only thing that halfway relieves it is to sit on my knees bent over a pillow.   To give you a little history I had suffered from a severely herniated disk for about 3 years. I underwent physical therapy, epidural steroid injections, chiropractor visits. Nothing help so we finally did surgery in April of 2008. When he went in apparently the disk had ruptured. After surgery I couldn't breath well when they ex-tubated me so they re-intubated me. They then informed us that I had pulmonary edema and pneumonia. They couldn't find a cause they just assumed I had a reaction to the anesthesia. All of my labs were normal. My body systems seemed normal on the test. My overnight stay for observation turned into 6 days in the hospital, 4 of which were in ICU.   I guess my question is any idea what might be causing me this pain. It prevents me from sleeping. And could it be related to the events that happened in April. My doctors are all booked for a few weeks so I can't get in to see them yet. Any insight you might have would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: upper back pain with difficulty breathing",
    "content": "Hi there -  It seems pretty likely the upper back pain and difficulty breathing would be related, in some way, to the ordeal you went through back in April. You don't mention which disk had ruptured and was repaired, so it's difficult to make a more direct connection, but the fact that all the other problems took place then as well just makes it more likely this is related to that. Also, the fact that the current problem seems somewhat positional (hurts to lie on your back or side, and is partially relieved by assuming a fairly unnatural postion -- at least for sleeping purposes).  A number of things could be going on: for one, the original problem, were it a cervical or thoracic disk, could have become aggravated in some way (or at least the site of its location).  I  don't think your episode of respiratory distress post surgery would be related to the current problem, at least not directly. However, having been intubated twice during your hospital stay there is always the potential for a nerve injury, although it's difficult to say which one, given the symptoms. It could involve the phrenic nerve (but then you'd have breathing problems all the time) or a cranial nerve that descends into the thorax (but then you'd likely have constant hoarseness and other, neurological, signs as well.   It seems the first stop probably should be an orthopedist or perhaps a neurologist, someone  who could help  determine the cause of the current problem.  If the pain and sleep deprivation are severe enough and you can't be seen by any specialist in the office, this would perhaps warrant a visit to an  ER. This would possibly get you seen sooner, too, by one of the specialists.   If you can supply any further info on the  disk that was repaired, that might just give us a clue. Other than that, I  do believe it's  orthopedic in nature most likely.  Best I can do with what I have to go on. I hope it  gets better real  soon. Please  follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

Well later I took of my shirt to find a fist size bruise there like I have been punched.  All that comes to my mind is that a vessel ruptured but I am not expert.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  It does sound as though a superficial vein may have broken in the skin of your chest. While  this is an unusual location for this sort of break, they do happen at times, and in random areas (usually in extremities). This can sometimes be caused by a vitamin K deficiency. If there  is any more spontaneous bruising you should bring it to the attention of a medical professional for evaluation. Once is probably just One of Those Things, but more than once would  suggest a possible problem either with vitamin K deficiency or perhaps some  other  blood chemistry issue.   Hope this  helps.  Follow up with  us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Sirs / Madam,  I developed these symptoms in May 2007. But was not in my home country and I had no medical support. I was in Riga, Latvia.   For several weeks (3 weeks) blood tinged green sputum.  Then 1 night I had no sleep together with 6 weekly exercise work-outs could have lowered my immune system.  There was a severe illness worse than anything I ever had in my life. symptoms:  Night sweats (I wake up in the middle of the night with my pillow soaked in water). Fever. Breathing difficulties. I was coughing up lots of blood as hemorrhagic sputum, green sputum filled with blood.  Extra symptoms was I had CNS confussion problems.   After several days of these extreme symptoms I went for medical help. I said to the family doctor could it be Tuberculosis. She said No.   I demanded antibiotics and was given Amoxicillin + Clavulanic Acid. Within 1 day I was immediately better. The blood-sputum dissappeared and I made a near complete recovery in 1 day. All the symptoms went. Whatever bug it was, these antibiotics killed it.  However I still strongly suspect it was TB exposure as FACT is the city Riga has this problem. A much poorer country and many people do not seek medical help. So secondary TB with spread to the laryngeal cords allowing carriers to infect everyone is quite high in public transport. Plus I am unable to find in medical books anything else that can match these symptoms except for Sarcoidosis, but this does not involve coughing up blood.  I have had the BCG vaccine as a child so a PPD skin test is useless. Before I go to a pulmonary or infectious disease specialist, I would like to check first as I don't want to waste there time.   I don't know for sure what it was? I don't know what to do or how to check?  This was 1 year ago, so now will I never know what caused the illness?  And if it was TB should I not have anti-TB drugs for 6 / 9 months? Or does it not matter if I have some of these bacilli in my lungs.   Thank you very much for any help you could provide.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, You can have a Manitoux skin test for TB in spite of BCG vaccination as a child.  The effects of the BCG on the test itself only lasts for about five years.  It is commonly believed that it shows up for life but this is not true.  If you have a significant reaction to the test this many years later it is considered an exposure and infection.  Then it is followed by a chest x-ray to determine if the infection is latent or active.  If it is active, there is a different antibiotic course than the treatment for latent infection.  In either case it is several months' long of strict adherence to a schedule of particiular antibiotics, chosen by culture results of sputum testing, should the x-ray be positive for TB.  I would definitely get the skin test and proceed from there.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Bactruim & persistaint cough",
    "content": "Hello -  A dry, unproductive,  \"barking\" cough could be due  to a lot of things, including asthma (and there seems to be a family history, if in reverse). Bactrim is unlikely going to do any good if you've been taking it this long without improvement and your symptoms don't particularly sound  like an infection  anyway. Pneumonia is possible, but usually will either have no cough or a productive cough. What is more likely is that you could have pertussis (whooping cough), which also sounds as you describe, is loud and forceful, non-productive, and sometimes quite exhausting. It usually resolves on its own,  whooping cough (pertussis) can last a long  time, and is quite contagious. While it sometimes can progress to pneumonia, it usually resolves on its own. The cough may last weeks beyond the contagious stage. It eventually does go away. It is treated by antibiotics, so Bactrim would be an appropriate medication, and you should take all the rest of it, even if the symptoms don't seem to resolve. Once the course of Bactrim is finished, if you're still coughing, you may need something to help suppress the cough. You'll also need to watch your children to see if they develop the same sort of cough. If so, they'll need to be treated also.   I hope this is helpful to you. Best of luck with this, and please follow up with us here.\n\n",

    "content": "I was diagnosed in Oct. 2007 with moderate stage COPD. I am 51 yrs. old. Upon diagnosis I was a 35 yr. smoker. Numerous attempts to stop smoking failed since diagnosis. I am now 57 days smoke free. This is my best attempt yet and I know this time, that I am now a former smoker. So, I know I have furthered damaged my lungs, by the continuing to smoke, up until 57 days ago. I can see many differences since before diagnosis, at the time of diagnosis and now almost one year later. What is troubling me at the present is numbness in left hand. One morning in July this year, I woke up and the left ring finger and small finger were numb and tingling. Now, it has since moved down into the palm of my hand, especially on the left side of palm. This numbness has about reached the wrist area. It does not ever ease up or go away. There is much weakness in this hand now as well. I am to the point that I cannot even open a simple jar of food or get the cap up on toothpaste. I have had several near serious accidents in the kitchen, due to the numbness and weakness in this hand as well. I am beginning to now notice, that there is numbness and tingling at times in the calf of my left leg. There has been swelling in the left ankle at times. I have researched COPD in depth. I know that COPD can effect the heart, circulation, etc. I will be going to the doctor, but that is not for some weeks yet. I know only my doctor can confirm what these symptoms actually mean. But, any input by a doctor on this forum, would be so deeply appreciated. I am very concerned and worried. Something is very wrong with the left sided limbs of my body. COPD has greatly effected my life. But, losing the use of my hand and leg, well that is a whole other area of concern. Thank you so much.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  First,  I'd like to congratulate you on your 57 smokeless days, and many more to come. Your resolve is commendable, and something in which you can take a great deal of pride. You've also begun the process of extending your life and improving your future health. Keep up the good work.  Now then: the symptom you're concerned about now, as you describe it, likely has absolutely nothing to do with COPD. Not only is there no apparent cause and effect associated with one and the other,  but what you describe is almost certainly ulnar neuropathy, which is the result of pressure somewhere between the cervical spine and  the left elbow most likely, on the ulnar nerve, the one which serves the outer side of each hand (the \"pinky\" and 4th finger, as well as the outer edge of the hand, usually, as you describe, extending into the wrist on the affected side, and sometimes part way up that part of the arm). This could be due to any one of a vast number of causes, from degenerative disc disease to a muscle spasm, to thoracic outlet syndrome (pressure on both the ulnar nerve and the blood supply to that part of the extremity where both pass between the collar  bone and the first rib).  This is almost certainly an  orthopedic problem, and should be evaluated by an orthopedist or a neurologist (the latter because it is a nerve that's involved). The problem could be resolved by something as simple as postural adjustment, physical therapy, or maybe even minor surgery, depending on what may be causing it. COPD could only be somehow remotely related, in that advanced COPD can sometimes cause changes in the shape of the chest itself, and so could indirectly cause some postural changes. Even at that, COPD wouldn't be considered the underlying cause.   I'd advise seeing your primary physician,  who can refer you to either an orthopedist or neurologist, either of which (or perhaps together) can help figure out where the impingement lies and how best to correct it.   It's not serious, but ulnar neuropathy can be infuriating, as you're finding out. Dropping things, mis-dialing, tooth brushing and inserting keys in locks are some of the most challenging tasks we normally take for granted.   The numbness and tingling in your left leg is either a separate issue or perhaps indicative of multiple nerve compressions. It seems unlikely that both are related (in the sense of a stroke, as everything would have happened together, at once, quite suddenly). You may have more than one site on the left side of your body where nerves are becoming compressed at the spinal outlet.  I hope this is helpful to you.  Please follow up with us as needed or update us after you've seen the appropriate specialist. And again, congratulations on your smoking cessation. That is a major accomplishment!\n\n",

My family doctor diagnosed Emphysema and gave me a puffer - however I am concerned with this diagnosis for two main reasons - The puffer does not help my breathing and my symptoms do not worsen after excercise.  Can the symptoms of Emphysema normally manifest after quiting smoking? From everything else I have read should my breathlessness not worsen after excercise & should I not experience a cough?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Emphysema but no cough",
    "content": "Hello -  You raise some legitimate questions. While it is possible for you to have early emphysema and shortness of breath (dyspnea) should start at the onset of exercise, and certainly should occur afterward. The pains and discomfort you describe, for the most part, sound like new tenderness due to use of accessory muscles in breathing. While this can happen  with emphysema, it is usually associated with asthma pre-COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or emphysema). It may be that you have asthma as well, but then the puffer you were given should at least provide some relief if that's the case (and should even if you have early COPD). It sounds suspiciously like you have asthma complicated by early COPD. It might well be due to both asthma and smoking. It may also still be very amenable to therapy.   Could you tell me what sort of medication is in the puffer? There are a number of different kinds, and this one may just not be working for you where another type might. There are also other rehabilitative therapies for this problem. You'd seem a good candidate for treatment, and sound as though you're pretty healthy otherwise. The fact that you've stopped smoking is hugely significant and you deserve a lot of credit for having stopped.   I hope this all is helpful to you. Best of luck, and please follow up with  us here.\n\n",

Wear a soft covering of some sort over your mouth and nose to decrease heat loss and intake, as keeping your body temperature controlled is important in any situation.

    "content": "Hello -  What this suggests to me is an episode of heartburn (gastroesophageal reflux) aggravated by water with citric acid in it. This is actually classic for GERD. Of course the peach schnappes could do the same thing, especially if you're inclined toward GERD or actually have it but don't routinely have such severe episodes.   Try something like  Tums if this happens again. If it helps, you probably should be taking a medication dedicated to treating GERD, such as Prilosec, Nexium, etc.   I see no relation between this and your early period, something that  does happen from time to time. If it keeps happening you may want to see a gynocologist about it, but if it's a one-time thing I'd just blame it on the law of averages.   Hope this helps. Good luck to you.\n\n",

I conitnuous cough can be a caused by many things and the Doctor can run some tests to see what's causing it...You didn't mention much about the cough.....Is it a dry or wet cough?? Do you produce phlegm? What color is the phlegm?? Have you coughed up any blood.....Do you have a fever or night sweats? These questions will help your doctor to diagnose your cough..... If you answered no to the questions above then it might be that your lungs are just irritated do to smoke, allergies, asthma and some medicines can even cause a chronic cough.......That's why I recommed the Doctors appointment so you can get a proper diagnoses......\n\n",

This is called \"cough-variant asthma.  Your doctor needs to get a spirometry test to help sort out the above 3 causes - you cannot diagnose asthma without this test.  I assume you are not taking any medications?  Some meds, like ACE-inhibitors very commonly cause cough.\n\n",

    "content": "I had a cough that lasted for almost 18 months (dry, no phlegm, no fever...just a really really annoying cough).  I thought it might be allergies so I foolishly didn't go to the doctor but then it disappeared when I started to drink more water (water-cure that you might read about on the web). It has been gone for almost 2 years. Coincidentally, I had to go for a chest x-ray last month due to some other infection I had and the pulmonary doctor has since sent me for a CT scan and has diagnosed Sarcoidosis.  Apparently, I have this disease that is not uncommon but is rarely diagnosed.   It usually involves some swelling of the nodes and may also attack other organs of the body.  In fact, if you have ever had swelling of the lower legs or eye problems (tearing, blurry vision, etc.) these could also be symptoms...but you don't have to have any of those.  90% of Sarcoid diagnoses are done almost accidentally because of some kind of cough of lung ailment that comes on. The disease is not curable but apparently, it is manageable if there is another flare.  The general tendency is that it flares for 1-2 years with the cough and then may never come back....or, if you ignore it, you could become more chronic and have a very bleak prognosis. This might be another route to pursue...put hopefully, it is a more positive diagnosis than I received.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  Your pain, given the bilateral nature of it, probably is muscular, and yet may be indirectly related to the pneumonia and pleurisy prior. It could be a neuritis also, but since it responds to ibuprofen I would think muscle most likely. There is even the possibility of a lingering irritation of the pleura from the earlier infection. If ibuprofen works, I would stick with it, using it according to instructions, since these type of meds often can be curative of inflammatory processes if used long enough. (\"Long enough\" would be until the pain no longer recurs). I'd give it a month. If the pain continues to return after that, you're going to need a second opinion.   If the pains you're having now do not resemble the kidney pain you've experienced in the past then it's not likely to be that. That pain would be deeper and more severe or a long-lasting ache. It sounds as though you're having some sort of nerve or muscle irritation.  Hope this is helpful. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Breathing problems and calcified granulomas in lungs",
    "content": "My problems started just over a year ago when I caught a bad cold which I believe turned into Bronchitis. By December I was coughing up very discoloured phlegm and having bad chest pains (I am a smoker). I got a chest x-ray and everything was normal. As the year progressed the chest pains lessened, but I developed difficulties breathing and had a pulmonary function test which was poor. My doctor said I had emphysema and I am now on Atrovent Inhaler 4 times a day, with Ventolin inhaler as backup for emergencies.  I am a 47 year old femail (who feels about 90 at the moment)  Recently, the breathing got worse and i'd sometimes wake up in the night gasping for breath, other times I'd appear to have a spasm where for an instant no air could enter of leave my throat area. This was very scary and prompted me to seek private help in Harley Street, London. I had a Heart scan and chest and lung scan. The results showed that I did not have any problems, in fact everything appeared in tip-top condition and there was no sign of emphysema. My lungs however had 4 calcified granulomas which i'm told are of no clinical concern and require no follow up and that these most often represent previous TB. Surely I would have known if I had TB? By looking up these calcified granulomas on the internet, I found they could also be something called Sarcoidosis which could also cause breathing problems, and which could possibly be caused by toxins or allergies.  A few years ago I had problems with raised lymph glands behind my ears, and a consultant said it could be an allergic reaction to my hair dye. SInce then I have noticed that everytime I have my hair dyed, about 3 days later my breathing gets worse and I sometimes feel as if i'm going to faint. I am now going to stop having my hair died of course, and stop smoking (a bit harder to do!). I wonder if the granulomas are a result of an allergic reaction to hair dye?  If anyone can offer some assistance with this, i'd be really grateful. There is no point in going to my doctor, he just wants to put me on anti-depressants.  Thanks\n\n",

Unless of course you had chronic bronchitis + emphysema (aka COPD).                Do you have to  use the inhaler 4 times everyday, or do you use it only when the need arises ? Also, the calcified granulomas that were found on your X-ray were most probably due to TB in the past. Don't worry, most (more than 90%) of the people infected with TB develop these granulomas in young age, without ever feeling sick.                 About those nocturnal bouts of breathlessness, do they appear at about the same time every night ? If yes, does your inhaler (or something else, like a hot cup of  coffee, for instance) help ?                If you have already undergone pulmonary function tests, can you provide more details on them ?               Besides the breathlessness, do you have any other symptoms ?

    "content": "Hello -  The initial diagnosis of emphysema seems to have been made in haste and been quite off the mark. You do sound, however, as though you may be having either episodes of asthma or perhaps reactive airway disease (practically the same thing). The granulomas in your lungs are probably not related to this, and if they do not grow, multiply or otherwise become more of a presence, then they likely are not sarcoids, which would be a much more serious problem. As for TB, a good many people have actually had that and not realized it. A simple PPD skin test could rule that in or out. Meanwhile you're having symptoms that do seem to be related (at least statistically) to your having your hair dyed, so stopping that, at least until you're certain whether or not that makes a difference, is a good idea. Stopping smoking,  while not easy, is a much better idea yet, and while it isn't easy it is certainly possible and well worth it.   I hope your symptoms have resolved by now. Please follow up with us if there is anything new. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "pneumothorax... what to do??",
    "content": "I am a 35 year old female who had an ulnar transposition on Nov. 28th of 2005.  I had a nerve block that I guess ended up giving me an pneumothorax... at least that was the best educated guess.  (I waited 2 1/2 weeks until I just couldn't stand the shortness of breath, pain, etc. any longer and by the time I had gone in the pneumothorax was at 15%.  Therefore, the Dr.'s agreed to let it continue to heal on its own.  However, I have still continued to feel weak, heart rate at rest 119 and just an over-all feeling of weakness.  My Dr. sent me for a echocardiogram and we found out I have a trace regurgitation of my tricuspid valve and a moderate regurgiatation of my mitral valve.  (The Dr. said it isn't anything to worry about and is minor.)  The internist I saw said to me, \"Some people tend to hyperventilate due to the lack of oxygen they were getting.  This might just be a psychological thing.\"  So, I felt like I was going INSANE and started to do light walking at home.  Well, Tuesday I thought I would add pilates to the mix, because before this pneumothorax I WAS VERY ACTIVE and pilates is no impact and just basically stretching.  Appx. 2 hours after the 10 minute workout I started to get a gurgling sensation (without pain) under my ribs on my left side.  It started in the front and then went to the back.  (This is the side I had my pneumothorax on.)  Later on that night, I started to get a stabbing sensation, with intermitted gurgling.  I decided to sleep at an incline, but thought that my body wasn't ready for the pilates and was just telling me so.  Now, two days later... I am have pretty sharp pain right under my rib cage that increase when I walk.  My Dr.'s have played the \"Dr. shuffle\" is what I like to call it.   So, my question is... could this just be my muscles or should I be concerned??? I am currently taking 200mg. of Topamax and taking 7.5/500 mg Vicodin every 4 hours.\n\n",

I was at a dog show and after running around the ring three times collapsed and was taken to the nearest ER where the pneumothorax was Dx'd and a tube put in the help reinflate the lung.  Were I you I would go to my pulmonologist and insist on a good discussion w/complete information as he could provide including going over films and showing me what he is referring to. Then I would insist on a treatment plan that would speed up recovery and lessen the need for medication and pain killers. If that includes intubation to help w/re-inflation, so be it.

    "title": "Re: pneumothorax... what to do??",
    "content": "Hello -  I just found your question here as I normally help moderate the cardiology topic.   It is entirely possible that an inept nerve block caused the intial pneumothorax, although you also could be  one of those people born with a certain number of \"blebs\" on your lungs, which occasionally will break and sometimes cause a partial collapse of a lung. Since your first pneumothorax happened subsequent to a medical procedure involving a needle insertion, however, it is just as likely to have been a medical error. In either case what you've experienced since has very likely been related to it.   Your echo results actually yielded nothing of importance (a very high percentage of the healthy population has minor regurgitation in one  or more heart valves). I don't think your problem is \"all in your head.\" What it is isn't clear, especially at a distance, but given the pneumo history, I wouldn't blow off your current complaint. From your description of the pilates-related symptom, I think you were feeling crepitus related to a second, probably very minor breach in the lung where the first pneumothorax occurred. It apparently wasn't as significant, and probably resolved on its own. You may have been experiencing trapped air in  the pleural space  since the first event, and that could have accounted for the other symptoms. There is, after such an  experience, a certain psychological component that enters into the equation (\"waiting for the other shoe to drop\"), but ths is reasonable when the symptoms have not altogether subsided, and I don't think it is causing your symptoms, although as increasing concern turns into anxiety it makes it more difficult to recognize concrete symptoms from the usual funny business the body pulls on a day-to-day basis. Had your doctors been more thorough to start with, you probably wouldn't be feeling this way now. Rather than acknowlege you could be having sequelae to the initial pneumothorax, they are trying to marginalized it. Unfortunately this leaves the patient feeling marginalized (and rightly so). The patient is actually who is being treated. The problem isn't just a symptom, not just a body part, but a person. Sometimes this fact is forgotten in the business.  Pllates actually is a great no-impact exercise, but because it involves stretching it definitely could have caused an aggravation of the original site. Hopefully it's no worse than it was, and small pnuemos are sometimes allowed to heal on their own, but if symptoms persist I would think someone would at least take a look to be certain there isn't some air trapped in there. Since air doesn't show up on x-ray (although a collapsed lung usually will), there can be pressure between the pleura and the lung just sufficient to make  a person feel very uncomfortable (cause some symptoms) without being obvious on a cursory examination.   If you can't get a better answer from one of your doctors, perhaps you could get a referral to a pulmonologist or at least insist on a second opinion. Everyone's entitled to one of those.   I  hope  by now this has resolved on its own. If not, please do follow up with us. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Breathing Problem",
    "content": "This is fairly long and complex but I think any info at all now might help with my problem.  I am a 21 year old male. For the past few weeks I have had some diffuculty breathing.  I feel like I am not getting enough air.  I feel like I need to take deep breaths but even when I do that it feels like my lungs aren't filling up sufficiently. It reminds me of the feeling of being bloated or eating too much.  I haven't felt this way continuously for the past few weeks. I have had some good days in which I felt fine.  I have good days and bad days. Some days I start to feel like that in the evening, other days I wake up in the morning feeling like that. When it starts it can be the next morning that I feel better or it can take about  3 days. Before, I thought that it had to do with the heat because I felt  much worse during hot humid days in the city. However we have had a string of really cool days and I am still having some problems (unless I currently feel bloated now for another reason).    I've gone to the emergency room twice and I am currently seeing a doctor who sees me once a week and is trying to rule out certain possible causes. Currently she doesn't know what is wrong with me.  I've had two chest x-rays when I went to the ER two times (since I was having mild chest pains the second time), two blood tests for hemoglobin. All of these turned up negative.  The doctor I am currently seeing gave a me Ratio Salbutamol HFA puffer and some Pariet (rabeprazole sodium) pills.I have been using them for a week and there doesn't seem to be any effect. In the ER I had a cardiogram done and it seemed fine.  I have a loss of appetite. I haven't felt like eating very much at all for the past few days.  While waiting in the hospital for six hours I began to get really hungry but it felt easier to breath when that happened. When I do feel this way I get uncomfortable and I have gone to bed feeling that way and not being able to fall alseep for hours.  I am not breathing rapidly.  My breathing is fairly slow and I am often aware of each breath I take.   I don't feel well enough to do some of my normal errands.  The day before yesterday I did a fair amount of walking outside and I felt like I was going to faint..  Currently I am just sitting here and I feel like something should be done. It feels silly sitting here like this but apparently noting can be done yet.  I don't think I am having a panick attack because it lasts for so long and I don't feel like I am stressed out or anything.   Medical History for this year  In January and February I was sick for a long period of time (about 4 or 5 weeks).  It felt like a cold and I was constantly coughing.    During the winter I had a very hard time breathing when it was cold and the wind was blowing. This was the first time this happened to me. I thought that it might be related to coughing.  Also during the winter I went to a doctor to ask about a problem that I have had for about 11 years (I am now 21 years old)  with my hands turing blue when it's cool. She thought it might be Raynauds, did some blood tests and I tested positive for Lupus. She sent me to a Rhumatologist who didn't find anything else wrong with me and can't pinpoint the cause of the Reynauds.  He will be seeing me a couple of months again  Also in Feb I had an absest growing on my gums near where my wisdom tooth was poking through and had to have it removed. At the end of April (while I was home for two weeks)  I found out that I had I had 6 surface cavities in between my teeth and I got them filled in two days.  Not long after i started to feel constant pain in all of my teeth and currently for some reason it feels that most of my teeth are now sensitive.  Also, I have been having problems with some of the fillings (possibly because they were done wrong) and got a temporary filling to replace one that and will be haing another temorary filling in soon. As well I have recenty had another wisdom tooth removed.  I would appreciate any advice you could give.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello lukey -  While many people with your sort of complaint would fall into the anxiety-based category, and that may be true, you do have lupus and possibly Raynaud's syndrome, both of which are connective tissue/autoimmune diseases and which, in your case, are probably part of the same larger issue (if one has lupus one may well have Raynaud's as well, so there is no great mystery there), and so you may have some more arcane pulmonary problem that would require a more sophisticated workup to ascertain and treat. Oh, with Raynaud's your fingers would actually be more likely to turn white rather  than blue, but the blueness could also be related to a breathing problem instead.  With lupus the various problems that arise must be treated specific to each, as well as an overall management strategy. What exactly is happening in your case is impossible to guess at a distance, and especially given your complex medical issues. A referral to a pulmonologist would probably be in order now. With lupus you are likely to experience a variety of annoying problems from time to time. I wish you the best and hope you are able to get this problem well-managed.  Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Chest Pain - centre/right-of-centre - Help !",
    "content": "OK, if anyone recognises these symptoms I'd appreciate any help identifying what's wrong with me:    I'm male 53, overweight, been intermittently a heavy smoker but quit for good 7 months ago. I've suffered severe acid reflux for some years which I control with over-the-counter antacids. The acid problem is a lot less since I quit smoking but I still get it sometimes when I turn over in bed.  Around the time I quit the ciggies I tried to diet to prevent massive weight-gain.  My idea of a workable diet tends to be mainly grilled fish, huge salads, fresh fruit and probably a little too much dry white wine.  It kinda worked as my weight rose a little but slowly came back down again.  But, I began getting a regular chest pain which has not gone away all these months.   The chest pain is focussed to the centre, radiating just right of centre, of my upper chest. If I draw a line between my nipples, I'd say the pain is centred about an inch above that line. It typically strikes every other day and usually in the late afternoon or evening. It's triggered by my walking even a short distance, not necessarily uphill or relating to any kind of real exertion. It also comes on sometimes when I lie down in bed.  To get rid of the pain I have to either sit down and lean forward, or if I'm outside walking I must stop and lean on a wall or whatever. The pain goes away in less than a minute. There is no shortage of breath, no sweating or dizziness and no palpitation.  There is no sensitivity on the surface although the pain doesn't seem to be very deep.  Describing the pain is difficult.  I'd say it is a 'hard ache' and feels as if I've swallowed a chunk of rock and it's lodged in my chest.  It doesn't seem to matter if I've eaten or not, or what I've eaten, but it does seem to occur at times of day when I'd normally be eating.  I have a history of hypertension but my blood pressure has been under reasonably good control for many years by taking a daily cocktail of Atenolol, Nifedipine, Losartan and Aspirin and getting regular check-ups.  I was told I had a 'slight systolic murmur in the aorta area' about 18 months ago but I was smoking heavily at that time.  If I go see my doc about this problem I know he will give me his usual lecture about my being overweight/obese as he has done for every complaint I've consulted him about for the last 20 years.  I've read about Barretts and hiatal hernias, GERD and gallstones ... what's happening doesn't really seem to fit any of those exactly.  Anyone have any ideas?  It's almost disabling me and scaring the hell out of me to be truthful.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear sir,                first of all, good job on kicking the smoking habit. About your weight loss, its best you take a lot of salads and fruits (as you do), but try to avoid fructose rich fruits. Not only do they help loose weight, they are also good for preventing complications from hypertension.                 About your pain, it definitely is atypical for being cardiac in origin. More likely GERD, seeing how it appears at mealtimes, and antacids help relieve it (have you tried nitroglycerine  for the pain ?). Anyways, I'd say you best  go see a gastroenterologist if possible, and a simple check up would help diagnose it for sure.                 P.S. Don't overdo on the white wine please, keep it to a mid-sized glass per day, regards. :)\n\n",

    "content": "Hello walrus52 -  Despite your concerns about what lecture your doctor may fire your way (and of course you're going to hear the  weight one), and the possibility of GERD or some related problem which certainly could be aggravated by your interesting diet (not necessarily a bad one, but perhaps portion control could be a starting point), the pain you describe does sound as though it could possibly be heart-related. I realize most people believe all cardiac pain occurs beneath the sternum and radiates to one or both shoulders, arms, etc., but what you describe follows more the pattern of exercise-induced mild to moderate angina. It may well not be, but the description regarding your walking is classic for stable angina. If you have this problem you hopefully have long-since had it ruled in or out, as it can get suddenly a lot worse. If it is not the problem, with your chronic weight issues and history of smoking you could be  looking at a coronary event down the road anyway, and so should definitely have gotten a thorough workup to rule out coronary artery disease.  \"Atypical\" chest pain is much more common than people realize.    I hope by now you've found out what the problem was and done something about it and that this finds you in good health.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello.  I am a 29 year old male living in New York.  I drink alcohol about once or twice a week in moderation and I am a non-smoker (quit 7+ years ago).  I have had a problem for several years now, but it continues to get worse.  Prior to describing the symptoms, here is the extensive history of doctors and test I have had because of this.  I have had several full physicals, x-rays, blood tests, catscans, pulmonary exams, and more.  I have visited a primary doctor, a gastroenterologist, a pulmonary doctor, a chiropractor, a neurologist, a rheumotologist.  All exams and tests have come up with nothing.  I have tried asthma medication, muscle relaxers, allergy medication, and more.  I have also tried various forms of exercise and diet changes.  Nothing seems to relieve the condition.  I have also tried humidifiers, air purifiers, and things like that and nothing has helped.  Also, I have moved during this period and the condition still existed in the new apartment.  On to the condition....  I have occasional pain and discomfort in an isolated area of my chest.  When I cough, it hurts in that spot like it is inflamed (similar to how your entire chest feels when you have bronchitis).  My cough sounds bad, like a duck, and can be extremely painful at times.  Also, when i breathe in deep occasionally I feel a cracking in that area (similar to the sensation of cracking knuckles).    The best way I can describe it is it feels like I have bronchitis or a chest cold in one small spot but it never goes away.  This condition keeps getting worse and I have tried effortlessly to find out what it is or how to get rid of it.  It is starting to really affect my life in a bad way.  Any help here or suggestions will be greatly appreciated.  Thank you in advance for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello NewYorker29 -  What you describe sounds very much like constochondritis, sometimes also known as Tietz' syndrome.  It is a chronic inflammation of the connective tissue between the ribs and/or where the ribs connect to the sternum or other areas. It is treated almost exclusively with non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen and naproxyn (Advil and Aleve).  Hopefully you've tried one of these by now. The problem can sometimes be a long-term or recurrent problem  and on occasion more sophisticated pain management is required, but usually these drugs will do the trick.  Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear brennyh,   I am truly sorry to hear about your pain. I am not an expert in Lupus or antiphospholipid syndrome. However, I would like you to note several points. Are you saying you have had continuous pleuritic pain for 7 years?  Pleuritic pain characteristically increases with deep inspiration. While it is not categorized as pain that changes with position, your description of pain on the right side that increases on lying down on the left side is characteristic. What happens here is that by sleeping on the right side you would tend to feel more comfortable because you are decreasing the amount of thoracic expansion on your right side. When you sleep on the left side your right side expands more freely and hence causes more pain.  Acute pleuritic pain is generally treated by analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs. However, if as you describe this is a continuous problem lasting for a long period of time you may wish to discuss other pain control options (e.g. nerve block) with your doctor. This could provide you with permanent relief and if appropriate to your condition would have no side effects.  Please let us know if you would like to inquire about anything else.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello brennyh -  While muscle pain can follow or accompany pleurisy, it wouldn't last for this long. You still can have muscle pain for other reasons of course, but pleurisy can also, as I believe Dr. Fouad mentioned earlier in the thread, become chronic. In cases like this a pain management strategy needs to be set up. And while it is sometimes possible to elicit pain by manual pressure where there is also pleurisy, it is also possible (and more likely) that this pain is caused by either muscle pain or perhaps costochondritis, which often is found in the company of a chronic problem like pleurisy as both are inflammatory and are treated by the same methods.   I hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi jartex30 -   First off, I can assure you the type of pain you describe is not cardiac-related. Heart pain (at least heart pain of any concern medically) is never stabbing, shooting or fleeing as you have described. It also never leaves a soreness on external touching or pressure. There are many many innocent possible causes for what you experienced, including that spicy fried chicken, but I think we can safely rule out heart problems as a cause of the pain.   That being said, 5-10 and 210 lbs. is more than a \"little\" overweight, and although you are only 26, the burden of the extra weight and the likely diet (see the fried chicken suspect above) can begin leaving plaque deposits in your arteries which can build up over a period of years. No sense in letting that happen.   Just a thought.  Hope you are sleeping through the night now.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a pretty healthy 22 year old female. My past history has been pretty clean, besides my cholesteatoma as a child, but that seems irrelevant. I started coughing about 9 months ago and it has worsened throughout time, including hemoptysis which started 6 months ago.  I saw a doctor about 3 months into the coughing and was handed off to Washington County DHS, because they thought I had TB. After 2 skin tests and a sputum test, I was dismissed to figure it out on my own.   After finding a new doctor, she performed a CXR and diagnosed me with pneumonia. Round one of the Zithromax worked for about a week and round two didn't seem to do much. She ordered another CXR and a nodule was found, then the CT scan to further investigate. And this is what was found:     I have an appointment with a pulmonologist on Monday, but was hoping maybe a little info before then. My doctor said she called an oncologist, but he thinks it's a bacterial infection more so than cancer.  I seem to be easily dismissed because of my age. I was also wondering I could get a bacterial infection from a salt water fish tank, because it seemed to have all started when my fiance got the tank.  So my symptoms are: Coughing Hemoptysis (Bright red blood and sometimes clots) Easily fatigued Insomnia Shortness of breath Rapid heartbeat (probably due to lack of oxygen)  Sorry for the long post, I just wanted to be specific.  Thank you, Jennifer\n\n",

After being admitted to the hospital for the \"missing\" marrow in my spine, not found on this slide of the CT, but others. I had a needle biopsy of the spine and it still came back negative for anything. After that, I got my first thoracotomy, which came back positive for Hodgkin's Lymphoma.  I was staged 4B Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma in January and started ABVD a week later. I had a PET scan in April and it came back with a couple spots in the spine, but was gone from my lung and pelvis. I'm due for another PET in a week, so hopefully, August will be the end of treatment. So in total, 8 cycles of ABVD with no radiation.   I know you guys get a lot of questions on here without follow-up, so I thought I'd fill you in. :)  Keep on doing what you guys do best! <3\n\n",

It doesn't move freely, when i put some pressure on it, it bother me a lil bit but not reaching pain. My skin colour is normal... not sure what else I should say.

    "content": "Hi FloridaGirl,  Chest pain which increases in intensity and when you cough has two possible causes. One is the classic musculoskeletal pain which comes from the muscles and bones of the chest. Another is from Pleura that is the thin membrane cover of the lungs. This pleura may get infected, get a collection of fluid or even some pus. The fact that you have asthma for 18 years makes this possibility of a pleuritic pain more likely.   You do need a consultation with your internist and then some X rays and blood tests.   Apurva\n\n",

    "title": "Hiccups and CO2",
    "content": "Hello everyone,  I have a bit of an odd question.  I've been suffering from hiccups the past few days---I think it is related to a flu or strep throat I'm recovering from.  I am talking about bouts of hiccups that go on for several hours and only seem to want to stop when I go to sleep.  So I was reading Wikipedia (dangerous thing to do, huh?) and I learned that the hiccup reflex can be stopped in all mammals by raising levels of blood CO2.  Hence the advice to hold your breath, or drink water in some sort of contortionist or acrobatic way.  I tried these things but they didn't really work, and I know that a lot of people do suffer from hiccups that just don't seem to want to stop.  So I tried something a bit more powerful.  I know that people inhale nitrous oxide (from cream whipper cartridges) as a recreational drug.  It so happens I have some CO2 cartridges (for making soda water).  I filled a one-gallon bag with CO2 (that's about how much is in one of those  cartridges at STP, I think), stuck in a straw, and took a deep breath of the stuff.  Oh, man, that was unpleasant!  The brain immediately thinks you're suffocating and starts the lungs going like crazy (breathing air).  However... as a hiccup treatment, it worked perfectly. I was flabbergasted!  I had really been suffering from these hiccups (they were giving me very bad and unpleasant heartburn) and they just stopped immediately.  My question is...for future reference... is there any health risk in taking a single breath  of pure CO2 like that?  It is so unpleasant that I don't think there's any chance at all of asphyxiating \"by mistake\" the way there is with N2O or He (the brain doesn't let you \"breathe\" pure CO2---it really knows it's bad stuff).  But can the spike of CO2 in the blood  cause any sort of dangerous breathing (or other) disorder?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Hiccups and CO2",
    "content": "Hello, I cannot overstress the importance of avoiding all over-the-counter and recreational inhalants.  I do not mean the prescribed inhalants used for asthma or other breathing problems.    In spite of any potential \"benefit,\" brain damage can be caused by inhalants, because the cells don't get enough oxygen. Repeated users of inhalants may lose the ability to learn new things, recognize familiar things or may have a hard time following simple conversations or doing basic tasks.  It is hard to say exactly what the long-term results might be, but there are better ways to stop hiccups for sure.  The goal in hiccups cessation is to relax the diaphragm.  After inhaling to full capacity and holding one's breath for several seconds, if they exhale very slowly and deliberately, then continue with slow, deliberate breathing in and out for several cycles, without interruption, in many cases the spastic diaphragm returns to normal.  Just holding one's breath alone, followed by normal breathing usually will not do the trick.  Each person may have their own \"cure\" for hiccups - many abound.  Most often they resolve on their own with or without treatment.  If not, there are medical treatments and persistent hiccups should be investigated to see if there is any related underlying digestive disorder.  Preventive measures include eating slowly, not overeating, avoid drinking alcohol or eating spicy foods, and taking an antacid, especially one containing magnesium (seems to calm the nerves in some).    I have never known of anyone dying from hiccups; but I have known of deaths as the result of inhalants that \"seemed\" safe enough.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I noticed over 8 months ago that if I lay on my side or my husband lays on me or drapes his arm over me that it causes me to cough. Now when I sit in my car with my seatbealt on or I am not sitting up tall, I have the urge to cough and I feel pressure in my broncial/lung area. I was recently sick with a sinus infection and the nurse practiciner told me my chest/lungs were tight. I told her what had been going on and she said it was probably because my lungs didn't have enough space when I am sitting/lying down. Now all of the sudden my lungs don't have enough room? Should I be concerned? I finished my meds and still have that feeling. It does not bother me to take a deep breath, it is on the exhale and has more to do with the area between my sternum and throat. I am 41 year old female with no knowledge of family history. Other then this issue I feel great, never really sick, just had bloodwork done and all is well except the LDL is 122. I am a little overweight but very active.  Any help would be great, Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  The situations where you have your problems are all where the Total Lung Capacity [TLC] is slightly compromised either due to position or pressure. Generally this slight reduction is not noticable beacuse nature has built in some reserve capacity in our lungs.  Normal breathing has two components. Inspiration [taking air in] and expiraion [exhaling the air out]. Inspiration lasts slightly longer than expiration. In certain lung conditions such as bronchial asthma , chronic bronchitis, and Emphysema the bronchi go into spasm and though the person can comfortably inhale, the exhalation becomes difficult due to Lungs' recoil. Thus exhalation becomes not only difficult but more prolonged too.  With your smoking history it is just possibly likely that you have started manifestations of chronic bronchitis or emphysema. A consultation with a pulmonologist and a Pulmonary Function Test will settle the issue.  Take care,   Apurva\n\n",

That didn't do anything.  - Peak flow test which was 340.  My pulse ox was normal.   - Treated me for Asthma.  Albuterol and Flovent did nothing after a 1 1/2 weeks.   - Went to the ER as I started feeling worse, chest x-ray and blood work normal, no improvement from breathing treatment. -Pulmonary Function Test showed reduced FEF25-75 with normal FVC and FEV1, no improvement with bronchodilator. -CT of Chest showed normal - solidary mildly enlarged 2 cm superior mediastinal lymph node (Not sure what this means)  It's been over a month and I feel the same, sore throat, sore and burning chest, and shortness of breath constantly.

    "content": "Hi,  Lungs are made of spongy tissue with some extraordinary property to expand and collapse with breathing so that fresh oxygenated air can come in and carbon dioxide containing air can be breathed out.  Somking cigarettes, smoke from vehicles and factory, dust particles, foreign particles from stone quarries and cotton mills all can injure this fine mechanical property of the lung.  Even in those who do not smoke or have never smoked, diseases like Asthma, Emphysema and chronic bronchitis may result in the same injury.  Pulmonary function tests results show primarily two types of abnormality. Obstructive and Restrictive. Your PFT result show more of a restrictive pattern. Restrictive abnomality doesn't get much benefit from drugs like albuterol and flovent. You just might need somthing like Ipratropium to relieve your symptoms if your pulmonologist thinks so. Unfortunately internet is a medium where one can give opinion only from the data presented and we have no way to check the facts first hand.  But I do advise you to get in touch with your pulmonologist quick and follow his advice. Sometimes a different antibiotic prescribed on the basis of a culture and sensitivity test will relieve your symptoms.  Take care,   Apurva\n\n",

    "content": "I suffered an inhalation injury several years ago and recently was exposed to asbestos (and probably still am as it's in the house).  The discomfort was originally around my lower lobes, but has since migrated to other parts of my body (neck, hands, gentitals, abdomen, etc.).  I am wondering what kind of barrier there is between the lungs and bloodstream, could it have been compromised with the earlier lung injury and should I be concerned?  Are there any diagnostic tests that can be performed?  Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Mhenry33,  The most commonly used diagnostic tests for asbestos exposure are Pulmonary Function Tests and CT scan of the lungs.  Further testing may include lung biopsy, colon cancer screenings and blood studies.  Pulmonary function tests are statistically shown to be abnormal in 50-60% of people exsposed to asbestos.  If symptoms are progressively getting worse I suggest seeing a Lung doctor (pulmonologist) for further testing.  Asbestos exposure can lead to mesothelioma a rare form of cancer.  Asbestos is considered a carcinogen in humans.  There are also non-cancerous problems associated with asbestos exposure.  I urge you to continue seeking medical advice and see your doctor.  I wish you the best of luck.  Sandy Tracy RN\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  My father is a Vietnam Veteran and he is not listed on the National archives injury list from that war. However, we have documentation stating he was injured by a trip flare. With that he was also injured via a mortar round going off by him the metal fragmentation embedded itself in portions of his face (which doctors removed), legs (also removed), and lungs. Currently, via X-Rays you see spots which his Pulmonary doctor regards as ephasima (caused by smoking, which he quit over 13years ago). But, they are do to metal fragments still embedded in the tissue of his lungs. A biopsy was hard or impossible to do because the tissue has scared up and they either could not or it was extremely difficult to get a good sample. In any case, the Board of Military Records Corrections says he has TB because the PA stated in the summary of the chest x-rays at the time he was separated from active duty states his lung are comparable to that of someone having TB. Could you help me out so they can straighten it out?  My question is if someone who does not have TB is treated for TB could their be ANY adverse affects?  Thank you for your time and any suggestions you may have to assist me in clearing this matter up.  Happy Holidays,    Jonathan Ince\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, First I will say that pulmonologists who deal with TB regularly are very good at interpreting the results on x-ray so if your father has been evaluated at a TB clinic, possibly through a health department where TB is regularly diagnosed and treated, I think you can feel confident.  Usually sputum specimens will also confirm the presence of infectious disease and whether or not he might be contagious to others.  This usually comes about because of a positive TB skin test (Mantoux) - typically the first trigger - but sometimes symptoms bring the patient to the doctor when active disease is present.  The treatment with antibiotics is very effective and safe for most people but it must be completed and it is a long process because the TB bacteria is a slow-growing organism.  Some who suffer liver damage might have problems with the anti-TB drugs, but for the most part the risk is like that for other antibiotics and benefit/risk ratio is considered.    Because TB is infectious to others and can cause serious illness, this is a public health matter and treatment is required for the good of the community.  So, if he is not already in that system, it would be good to consult with the local health department communicable disease staff.  They should be able to help differentiate between the various lung conditions your father may have.  Best wishes to you both.\n\n",

The pain comes and goes.  It is achy.  I have had almost every test done possible it seems.  I have had a chest x-ray when this started 9 mo ago, a ct scan, a pelvic ultrasound, a colonoscopy, a breath test that came back positive for bacterial infection.   I was given an antibiotic for this but the pain in my chest still won't go away.  Not sure if it could be something worse. I am concerned to say the least as all my tests keep coming back fine.  I feel like I am losing my mind.  Is there any suggestions you can think of that this could be.  The pressure is mainly when I am sitting/standing upright and pull my arms back to stretch my chest.  It is very achy.  I am set to do an upper gi test with the gastro dr. Jan 9 but was wondering if this could be anything else .  I also sometimes get a pain in my right upper leg.  It's like my blood vessel is expanding or something.  This has been just recently.  Any suggestions?\n\n",

If your symptoms continue over the next few days I would recommend you see your doctor to have this checked out.  If it is an infection you may need some antibiotics to help clear it up.

    "content": "I own a business and when we moved into the space we are leasing two years ago. It did not occur to us to have the building inspected thoroughly like one would do when buying a property. We moved in, in November and the following spring once the weather started warming up the building smelled like decay. The smell went away after a short while so we shrugged it off. However, two years later you can smell mold once entering our building and two of my employees have been under the weather. Coughing, sneezing, running nose, headaches and several other symptoms that seem to be common to prolonged exposure to mold. I just had a mold inspector out to our space a few days ago to learn that our building has five years before it collapses and that the foundation is entirely covered in mold and there is black mold above the ceiling tiles.  So here is my question.  Are there any medical test that can be performed to assess if any of my staff may have health damage due to the building conditions?  I also was under the impression that once removed from the situation (moved out of building) that with a little time what ever symptoms may be there from this exposure will elleavte themselves or go away. Is this true or a nice myth to make me feel better? Should I be concerned that this exposure may potentially cause problems for my staff years from now?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I am sorry to hear about all the bad luck you are facing with your business. I would also like to apologize for the delayed response.   I would like to note that most common diseases associated with mold exposure are allergic reactions to the mold in sensitive individuals. If you say that your staff have only recently started developing symptoms then, assuming that the exposure conditions at work haven't changed, its probably unlikely that this is related to the exposure.  The other and more serious condition that can result from exposure is infection. Mold infection doesn't happen to everyone, especially normal healthy individuals. However, if a person is immunocompromised or has a disease of the lungs (such as COPD) they may develop mold infection. This is rare but can be fatal.  I appreciate your sense of responsibility towards your staff and I would advise you to act quickly and responsibly towards them so that they do not decide to press charges against you. Showing them that you are acting responsibly will help to exclude their fears that this was the result of negligence on your part.  You should have an occupational physician examine them and advise you and them regarding further steps. Applicable codes, insurance, inspection, legal, and similar issues about mold generally fall under state and local (not federal) jurisdiction. You may also want to consult the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) - they have a toll free number (800) 438-4318 which you can try. Every step you take should be documented and I also encourage you to consult your lawyer to help you take appropriate steps for your employees and your business.  Please let me know if there's anything else we can help with.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Medical Doctors, Over the past 2-3 months I have smoked marijuana VERY occasionally.  I have shared about 5-6 joints with other people, the total effect being as if I had probably smoked between around one or two marijuana joints by myself.  I have also in the process of smoking marijuana probably consumed around half a cigarrette's worth of tobacco in adding agents to better burn the joints.  I know this amount of tobacco is so negligable, and in a week of walking around in any city's downtown I'd get more than this, but I am still worried and would still like to ask I am a 16 year old healthy male in a family of non-smokers and non-drinkers and I am on no medications. Would the amount of substances I have smoked have any permanent damange on my lungs?  I have heard the lungs have a natural ability to clean themselves.  Can the lungs clean out stains and tars and toxins from smoking?  Have my lungs been damaged, and if so, will they ever return to the way they were? Thank you very much. On a similar topic, I have a question about using a vaporizer as an alternative to smoking.  I know that most of the chemicals found in smoke are there due to combustion, not due to the herb itself of marijuana.  Assuming one heated the substance enough to release THC in gaseous form, and inhaled the vapor, could that damage one's lungs? Thank you very much in advance for reading my question, and I hope you will answer it for me.\n\n",

    "content": "It is a little more complicated than this.  It is believed that some people have a genetic predisposition to harmful effects of tobacco and other substances.  We do not currently have a way to determine this but it explains why some smokers are never affected and other non-smokers get cancer from second-hand smoke, even in negligible amounts.  So from a health standpoint there is no such thing as an insignificant exposure. You have no way of knowing how your body will respond and what permanent effects there may be.  You play Russian Roulette when you smoke or inhale in any way, known harmful substances.  For your future health and well-being, I would put my efforts in trying to quit this habit before you do any further damage.  It is known that some people do recover well from smoking in the past.  Again, it is an individual thing.  We do know that quitting has a very positive effect on the future chances of getting lung cancer, emphysema, asthma, etc.  Good luck.  I hope you will make wise choices to avoid a future of worry and possible serious consequences.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Shashi1,  The pain you are describing may be related to inflammation of the rib cartilage, known as costochondritis.  This is a relatively common condition.  The pain can often be reproduced by putting pressure on the area where the pain occurs.  It may also be related to a condition called pleurisy.  This is inflammation of the lining of the lungs/chest wall.  This pain is usually worse with deep breathing because the inflamed area of the lining is rubbed on the chest wall.   Some inflamed muscles of the rib cage may also be at fault.  These can become injured by turning or twisting wrong.  Subsequently they take a long time to heal because they are constantly being used due to breathing and moving.  Another, less likely, possibility is reflux. This pain is generally more in the center of the chest.    All of these, with the exception of reflux, are treated by anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen.   If your pain continues I would recommend you follow up with your doctor.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "First, thank you for taking the time to read and respond. It really is appreciated.   I'm a 27 y/o male with type 2 diabetes, NASH liver disease, diabetic neuropathy, and acid reflux. No past surgeries.   Family history of diabetes, heart disease, and various auto-immune disorders.  Currently taking metformin, nexium, and gabapentin.  I'll try and make this as short as possible but it is a scary situation for me.  I work as a deputy sheriff with the warrant division. We (my partner and I) got a call to back up a supervisor having problems with a suspect he was trying to arrest. We got to the house, went inside, stood right next to the suspect for about thirty minutes in a small living area with the guy smoking some cigarettes and coughing while the main deputy finished verifying paperwork. Our supervisor (main deputy at the scene that we were backing up) pointed to his chest once but we didn't know what he was trying to tell us.  The warrant was for a \"writ of attachment\" which is usually for possessing property from law suits etc. but in this case the county was ordering the man himself to be attached/taken into custody. The main deputy never told us specifics at the scene.  We follow behind the main deputy in our car and we end up at the state hospital's center for infectious diseases (this is when I start worrying). After we get out of the car, the main deputy finally makes it clear that the guy has active tb and wasn't complying with his treatment (starting and stopping). The nursing staff looks at the guy's paperwork and starts asking about why the guy and us are not wearing masks. They start asking all kinds of questions and get all over the main deputy (rightfully so). He didn't care. The paperwork was a writ of attachment for the man to be taken into custody and immediately transported to the state hospital's infectious diseases area due to non-compliance with treatment. The nurses confirmed from the paperwork that the suspect has active tb.  They tell us to go to a hospital immediately. The supervisor refuses to go but myself and my partner go. They gave us a tb skin test and we come back Monday for results.   The staff said that even if it comes back negative we have to come back for testing every six weeks for \"quite some time\" to be sure. My main concern, aside from my own health, is how this is going to affect my home life. What precautions (if any) should I be taking for the foreseeable future? Does my present health situation put me at greater risk? Should I limit contact with my wife and children? I'm the main cook in the family, is it safe to prepare food? Should my family get tested at some time?  I'm asking here because I always forget to ask something at the Dr's office and I want to cover as many bases as possible.  Again, I apologize for the length of this post but I wanted to provide as many details as possible. I sincerely thank you for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I understand your concern but I can allay your fears.  TB is something that is actually quite difficult to catch from someone in a single, limited interaction, and those at most risk are usually having close and regular contact with the infected person.  Also, the fact the patient has been in treatment but is not currently compliant, could mean he has passed the period of being contagious, even though he has not completed the required regimen to make sure all bacteria are dead.  These two factors (limited exposure and some treatment) do improve your odds of being infected.  Now, the next part of the puzzle - once you have had an exposure such as this (even if at a future date your test shows positive), your body develops antibodies to the bacteria and this is why the test shows up \"positive.\"  A positive skin test does not mean you have active TB and only active TB can be spread to another person (your wife, children, coworkers, etc.).  So, your skin test can become positive, meaning you were infected, but your body's own immune system can keep it in check for some time.  Meanwhile, the health department may offer antibiotic treatment (if your reaction is significant) that will kill the bacteria and you will not need to worry about it becoming active in the future.  But, even during your treatment, which could take several months because of the nature of this bacteria, you would NOT be contagious to anyone.  Only those with active disease, verified by abnormal chest x-ray and sputum sample labwork, are actually contagious to others.  The staff who wondered about the masks probably assumed the patient is still contagious, but a person is not contagious throughout the whole course of treatment, typically (I don't know his status at that time of course).  The non-compliant person is taken into custody because if they do not kill the bacteria completely with the whole prescribed regimen of antibiotics, they can develop a resistant strain and become a threat to society.  It is the responsibility of the local health department to make sure society is protected in this way so they do contact investigations and offer testing/treatment as needed.    You do not need to worry about food preparation, interaction with your family or anything else like that unless your test becomes positive, AND it is followed by a positive chest x-ray and sputum, indicating active disease (very unlikely it will reach that point because you will be treated earlier if you do show infection/exposure).  So, relax, but do follow up on the recommended 'TB skin testing to be sure you catch any sign of infection early.  Let me know if you have other questions.\n\n",

    "title": "Sporadic Coughing for a year now",
    "content": "I am a 22 year old male and have been having sporadic coughing for a year now. The cough does not have a specific time, it occurs at any time of the day, but never when I am sleeping. The cough's time last's about 5-10 min and then dissapears. It is sporadic in the sense that it may occur one day,then 2-3 day's or even a week later. Sometimes I do not cough for a month,but somehow it returns after a while  I think the coughing is dry, but I do have excessive saliva in my mouth, so I really don't know weather to classify it as a dry one or a wet one. I do feel some extremely mild chest pain while I am coughing, but nothing after the cough vanishes.  Inspite of this irregularity in the cough I did manage to come up with some causes when the coughing starts. The cough almost every time starts when I am tensed, especially an hour or so before my university exams or other exams which I take. The coughing also starts when I have'nt eaten something for a while but drank only water in that time.Sometimes the coughing starts when I am around smokers but not always. The coughing also starts when I drink or eat something cold, especially icecream or soft drinks. But in some cases no matter how much icecream or soft drink I consume, I do not cough.  I have never had any previous surgeries. Here are the dignostics :- Chest X-ray came out normal when I showed It to my doctor. I did some blood tests ( I apologize if I misspell them) Blood CPESR (normal) CXR PA viear (normal) Pulmonary function test , which I have taken twice in about a year, both results came out normal. I also took a blood sugar test came out normal.   The doctor's prescribed me the following medications Ventide Inhaler ( 1 puff as required ) singular tablets ( I have been taking one tablet per day continously for 25 days )  So far these medicines have not work, my family does have a past hsitory of asthma, But nither did the reports or the doctor's indicated any sign of it. I am currently taking no medications.  Please help me because I have heard that coughing like this could lead to more serious diseases later in life.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Patient12007,  It sounds like you've had quite a work up at this point.  There are a few other things to consider.  One is the possibility of gastroesophageal reflux.  Occasionally, there are no other symptoms, only a nagging cough.  Treatment with an antacid can help.  Your symptoms are so inconsistent in timing that this is probably less likely.  Also, it would be expected that this would continue during sleep.  With your description I am suspicious that this may be a psychogenic cough.  By this I do not mean that the cough isn't real.  Rather this cough usually is the body's way that it has learned to react to things.  In particular your mentioning that stress brings on the cough and that it never occurs during sleep are very suggestive of a psychogenic cough.  There are various methods to help treat this if this is what is going on.  A pulmonologist can be of help.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Hello Doctor. I don't smoke or drink liquors. I''ve been diagnosed sputum positive with tb 3 weeks ago and was given medications by a DOTS clinic. But 2 weeks after i started taking the medications my cough and the pain in my chest when i breathe came back. I took the medication one more week and still my symptoms are worsening.  Why are my symptoms coming back? ..except for the fever and sweating.. I consulted a physician and he said that i must let a month pass before any improvement.but mine is not improving, its worsening. In the morning upon waking up i feel shortness of breath and the urge to cough hard plus the pain again. i had improvement before this time but now it's coming back. i have been taking the medications as prescribed to me-- 3 tablets once a day, 2 hours after breakfast, and i wait an hour or two before i eat again because the doctor said absorption is better in an empty stomach. Is it really too soon to question the effectivity of the medications? Like this morning i had wheezing that went away when i coughed out the phlegm.this one subsided already and came back. Should my medication be increased? changed? shouldn't i improve after 3 weeks? on tuesday, sept 11, it's the start of my 4th week of medication. pls help me. will i still get better? does breathing exercises really work? Thank you so much for sharing your expertise.\n\n",

    "content": "TB is a very slow growing bacteria and the treatment is also very slow so you must be patient.  Your doctor is right, you may not see improvement for at least a month.  It is a serious disease.  We are accustomed to bacteria that multiplies quickly and responds to antibiotics almost immediately (like strep throat does).  This is very different so you need not be alarmed about the time frame yet but you will most likely get better with correct treatment taken faithfully.  It may be tempting to stop taking it before the required long-term is completed but please do not do this!!!  You could create an antibiotic resistant bacteria that would be much harder to treat.  Keep in touch with your doctor if you have more serious breathing difficulty in case you have developed a secondary infection of some type along with the TB.    Good luck and best wishes for your continued improvement of good health.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 19 year old white male. This is the first time I have had any trouble and my family has been healthy. I have noticed last year a tingling/vibrating in my chest if i am slouched over talking to someone. It is usually in my left side and I can feel it in my chest and my left arm. I have been able to reproduce the feeling if I am bent over and either humming or talking and am near the end of my breath.   I also all my life have experienced occasionally a sharp pain in my chest that I feel as I breathe. I have to slow down my breathing and take short breaths in order to not feel the pain. Eventually to over come it I have to take in and give out a very long and heavy breath and face the pain but after that it it gone.  I have also recently just 2 month ago felt a very heavy feeling and had pain that feels like pressure inside my  chest after laughing very hard. Normally laughing doesn't do it but if I am on my knees laughing very hard I end up stopping because taking in deep breaths of air I begin to have pains that I have to stop what I am doing and control my breathing for it to go away after a few minutes.  I haven't been on any medications prior to the symptoms occuring.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi KJ8742,  It sounds as if you may have a case of pleurisy.  This is when the lining of the lungs/chest wall becomes inflamed.  Classically, pain is worse with deep breathing because the lining is forced to drag across the chest wall producing the pain.  This sounds like it has been going on for a while.  Pleurisy can persist but it is a little unusual for it to be constantly present for a year.  Typically it will come and go.  I would recommend you see your doctor for an evaluation to make sure everything else in the lungs is OK.  If your doctor agrees it sounds like pleurisy it can be treated with anti-inflammatory medications.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "After completing the antibiotic course, your TB will be rendered non-infectious.  However, a TB skin test will still show positive.  This is why it is important for you to carry a card verifying your completed treatment if you are asked to get another test.  Since we already know it will be positive, there is no point in repeating it.  Your chest x-ray was negative so that tells us you did not have active TB, but rather, latent infection.  It is treated to be sure it doesn't turn into active disease at a later date.  You might say this is preventive medicine - you did not actually have TB disease at all, but you were at risk for it if you developed an immune system deficiency, cancer treatment, etc. that might allow the TB bacteria to flare up and cause lung disease.  Your blood tests will not show TB bacteria or lack thereof.  You can feel confident that the full course of treatment will take care of the problem.  This is why it is important to take all your medication as prescribed.  As for your other question,  I don't think the sputum is related to the TB testing and treatment since you did not have active pulmonary TB.  Perhaps is is related to your smoking, in which case it is clearing as your lungs are more smoke free.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 44 year old woman in generally good health, 5' 5\" and 130lbs. No know relevant family history.  Starting a few weeks ago i began to experience pain on the chest when laying on my side, and it's gotten worse to the extent that now my chest is tender to the touch pretty much all over, and there's pain, pressure and tightness radiating from behind my sternum. RHS hurts worse than LHS - but both hurt. Distinct Facial Pallor. Low grade fever. Breathing is labored and 'wheezy'....especially in the heat.Somewhat episodic - if i'm not physically stressed - the symptoms diminish.  I've had TWO episodes where there was apparent tachycardia and angina......after bouts of minor exertion.......but i wonder how much of those 'conditions' were simply acute chest pain, difficulty in breathing, weak pulse and sheer panic.  Originally the doctor thought this was all due to sinusitis and more recently bronchitis, but if i have these conditions i honestly believe they are masking something much more fundamental.  Finishing up a course of antibiotics and of predisone type steroids. Neither  seems to have made any difference.  All the 'CAD' tests, inc, EKG have come back negative - thankfully.....and my blood pressure is good (100/70), - my resting sine wave is good, and when i'm not physically stressed my pulse returns to the '70's...although it's more volatile than it used to be.  I'm worrying about other conditions such as costochondritis, pericarditis, pluerisy, abnormal chest expansion etc., and wondering how best to (a) arrive at an accurate diagnosis (b) arrive at an effective treatment.  This condition (cluster of conditions?) is effecting my employment.  Your thoughts in this matter are very much appreciated.  Deeply Worried.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Deeply Worried,  I think you may be right about the tachycardia being related to something else rather than a heart problem.    Chest pain can be a bit difficult to diagnose at times.  All the things you mention could potentially cause chest pain.  Pleurisy classically causes sharp, stabbing pain that is much worse with a deep breath.  Costochondritis is inflammation of the cartilage portion of the ribs.  Pressing on the rib in the area where the pain is causes the same type of pain.  It may also be that you have a pneumonia (such as a walking pneumonia from a bug called mycoplasma).  A diffuse pneumonia such as this can cause diffuse inflammation and pain all over the chest.  Another common cause of chest pain (although it doesn't fit your story very well) is acid reflux.  During acute attacks, if you take an antacid such as Tums or Rolaids and the pain gets better this is likely the cause.  I would recommend you continue to follow up with your doctor to try to determine what is going on.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Off and on smoker( binge) Trying to get back into swimming, have been off and on since surgery in 12/02 however, recently i notice after smoking on the weekend  and getting back in the pool i am not recovering breathing wise. I feel like i have asthma or my breathing is restricted especially when i am really doing streneous sets of swimming. I would have that in the past but after one day my lungs would clear and i would be fine. Now it is three sessions of swimming and i still feel restricted. Is it my age and my past smoking that it is taking longer to recover or have i done permanent damage. Should i give it longer or go get checked\n\n",

During a routine echo (part of work up for HTN), my pulmonary pressure was 44. I saw a specialist who repeated it one month later. It was the same. I am also light headed and dizzy. The SOB is gradually getting worse. He then did a right heart catheterization. It was normal. My doctor took me off my HTN medication thinking it might help but it didn't. She even put me on Buspar in case it was anxiety but still no change. Now I have mid sternal chest pressure that comes and goes. It is accompanied with a cough that feels like a balloon that the air has been let out. The cough will come in mid sentence sometimes, just like a release of pressure. This can last for a few minutes or all day. It is not related with eating or lying down. I did notice that if I lift or move anything heavy during this time, I get very SOB. My BP has been fine. A cardiologist thought it might be related to high BP. STRESS test and ECG  are normal as well as chest xray and PFT's. All done several monthes ago. Any ideas?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Babineau,  Pulmonary hypertension can cause some shortness of breath feelings.  Basically, with pulm. hypertension the heart has to work harder to pump blood through the lungs.  This can make the heart begin to fail and lead to a back up of blood in the blood vessels.  I am sure the cardiologist also looked at your heart's squeezing ability to make sure this is normal.  If it was, heart failure is less likely the cause.  There are a few medicines directed specifically at pulmonary hypertension.  However, it will be important to make sure that this is primary pulmonary hypertension and not hypertension to help compensate for or because of something else (such as a lung problem).  PFT's that are normal make a lung problem less likely.  Pulmonary hypertension can be quite a complex issue, as I'm sure you've found out.  Follow up with your cardiologist is important.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "My very healthy and active 14yr old daughter has been complaining of trouble taking deep breaths, and pain under her left ribs. She also has an indentation on the left side. The breathing difficulty is not necessarily activity induced. I don't think anxiety is a factor, since she doesn't really have any stress in her life. We went to our family physician, who took 2 chest xrays, and sent her for a PFT, both of which came back as normal. He acknowledged that there was an indentation on her Left side which he feels she was probably born with. My daughter says the symptoms are getting worse and I'm not sure where to go from here. Allergist, Pulmonary specialist?  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!!\n\n",

She keeps saying that she can never take a deep breath anymore,  only short breaths and it has gotten worse during activity since her PFT on June 25th. She doesn't cough or wheeze though. If it were allergic asthma I would assume the PFT would have picked that up? She was really frustrated when I told her the xrays and PFT were normal, because she definitely feels something is wrong. I just don't know what type of doctor or tests to try next!! She has woken up in the morning short of breath, which is when I decided to take her for the initial doctor's visit on June 11th. She is now getting short of breath when riding her horse or trotting the horse around the ring on a leadline this past week.\n\n",

    "content": "Asthma is a possibility although the PFT's should have shown some degree of obstruction if she were having trouble at the time.  Another possibility with the sharp pain is a condition called pleurisy.  Pleurisy is when the lining of the lungs/chest wall (the pleura) become inflamed.  It can be very painful.  Taking a deep breath causes the lining to rub and induces pain.  A similar condition is called precordial catch syndrome.  In this syndrome, it feels as if something is caught when taking a deep breath and can cause intense pain.  Subsequently, it feels as if the catch gives way and the pain gets better.  The exact cause of this is not known but probably it is a variant of pleurisy.    Pleurisy can be treated with a course of scheduled anti-inflammatory medications (such as ibuprofen).  Usually it takes about a week to get better.  I would recommend following up with your doctor to consider this possibility.  It may also be worth a trial of albuterol to see if she feels better with it.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Most often the skin test is going to be positive but chest x-rays can also diagnose it so if they told you it was consistent with TB that sounds pretty clear.  Yes, other conditions can also have similar symptoms (cancer, other lung conditions, lymphoma, pneumonia, etc.) so I'm sure your doctor is working on this.  Good luck and be sure to follow up with recommendations by your doctor to be sure you get the complete and necessary treatment.   Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "My 4 yr old was recently exposed to active TB.  My brother seems to have contracted TB on his last trip to India in Janurary.  My 4yr old son just had a chest xray and the radiologist said he'd found \"central peribroncheal thickening without focal consolodation\".  Could you explain what this means? I  do understand that no mass was found, but I'm still concerened.  The Health department is suggesting that we put him on medication.  He is not showing any symptoms.  Do you think medication would be premature?\n\n",

    "content": "Treatment for TB generally falls into two categories: treatment for active disease which is generally 3 to 4 drugs for 6 months and latent disease (no active disease but conversion to positive in the skin test) which is generally treated for 9 months with a single drug.  In your child's case, if the skin test is positive he should most definitely be treated.  If it is negative, given his age it is likely that most physicians would recommend treating him at least until the skin test is repeated in about 3 months.  Some would recommend treating for the full 9 months due to a small chance that his immune system may not be developed enough yet to give a positive skin test.  Follow up with the health department is crucial in cases that involve TB.  Best wishes.\n\n",

At times, they are so bad I cringe.  This has been going on for 2 days now. I have been quite tired for a week now and seem to have flu like symptoms. At times I have a fever. The only constant is the pain. It almost feels like pressure or bloating like is building up where the pain is. Relaxing and over the counter pain medication does not stop the pain.  Does anyone have any idea what this could be? This is my 1st time using the net to seek help. Thank you for any and all advice given. I am concerned but I do not want to raise alarm in my home. If I even get the sniffles my husband panics. So I guess I am looking for advice on what it could be and is there any urgency to call my doctor. Thank you.\n\n",

These infections often can cause the lining of the lungs to become inflamed.  This can cause very severe pain.  The characteristic of pleurisy is that the pain is often worse while taking a deep breath.  Given your past history, if the pain does not improve over the next few days I woud recommend you see your doctor for an evaluation.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Zoelextux, The first question I would like to pose is if your daughter had a fall recently?  The pain you describe and the physical observation could possibly be rib cage damage due to a fall.  The best way to know if there is any damage is by xray which can be done at your local emergency room.  Without knowing if she fell, or had any other trauma (like being \"tossed\" against a fence railing), it is too difficult to conjecture what may be causing her pain and shortness of breath. An xray is a simple way to determine any fractures.  her pediatrician may have capability at his/her office to xray her, and certainly the doctor needs to evaluate her in person. The emergency room has additional capability to do a Cat Scan, to see if there is internal injury.\n\n",

I would strongly recommend that you get established with a doctor who can help manage your symptoms and illnesses.  Not to scare you, but I would be quite concerned that without proper medical care you may continue to get worse quickly.  Your illnesses are very severe.  There are some new treatments available that may dramatically help you.  You need to discuss these with your doctor.  Also, I would strongly recommend seeing a pulmonary specialist.  If you can convince your family that smoking truly does endanger your life you may have luck getting them to stop.

What could this mean and what needs to be done as follow up, my doctor didn't even tell me it said this, he just said \"normal\" and I found out when I got copies of the results.   I am told that one cause could be COPD and this scares me. I have no risk factors that I know of. However, I have had about 6 VQ scans over the last few years because of my symptoms. Could this cause COPD as I read environmental pollutants could cause it. So couldn't breathing in the gas and be injecting with stuff that goes to lungs do it??   Any info is welcome. Thanks.\n\n",

    "title": "Pulmonary Fibrosis - Can We Save Our Dad?",
    "content": "Dear all,  My father-in-law, who is 79 years old and is just a month away from his 80th birthday, was hospitalized a week before Christmas because of shortness of breath. Though initially pneumonia was suspected, his X-rays and CT scans revealed scarring on one of his lungs (at least that's what we were told at that time). In a week he left home with oxygen-generating equipment and was told he would have to use it indefinitely.  He was feeling good for a while, though last Friday I noticed that his skin was kind of yellowish and that he did not look that healthy. Me and my husband left for a short vacation and returned home yesterday to learn that our dad was hospitalized again on the New Year night! Same shortness of breath, pronounced yellowish colour, heart beat irregular. What we know so far (and we don't have an official diagnosis, though the word 'fibrosis' was used by a doctor) is that is lungs are in trouble, that there is liver damage (we don't know why) and there is some infection going on. He is receiving antibiotics, IV and they are going to check out his gallbladder as well.  My father-in-law had arthritis for years, and he did not receive any treatment for it. We know that his lung problems can be a result of that. He used to be a strong man - a retired officer and a former football player, though when I met him, he was pretty thin. Now his weight loss is especially pronounced.  We are aware of the fact that even if his current status improves (that is liver issues and infection are addressed), the diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis is very bad. But I told my husband that we should do whatever we  possibly can to save the life of our dad. Just three weeks ago he was an energetic individual with alert mind and generally healthy (other than his arthritis and a sore on his limb which was hard to heal, but eventually did heal). He did take some medications, but I am not sure what exactly.  I would appreciate very much your professional advice on this matter and thank in advance for your help.\n\n",

Depending on the cause, there are some treatments, but the scarring is often relatively permanent.  Adding the liver issue makes it more difficult as many medications are processed by the liver.  Unfortunately, I don't have any great advice for you.  I recommend you stay in contact with your father-in-law's doctor to discuss his condition and possible treatments.

    "content": "AGE: 40 SEX: MALE  PAST DIAGNOSIS: Erythema Multiforme, Recurrennt HSV, HTN, Allergic Rhinitis, Migraine, Benign Systolic Heart Murmur, Depression.  PAST SURGERY: NONE FAMILY Hx: Hyperlipidemia, HTN, Cardiovascular Dsease, Prostate Cancer.  MEDS: Plendil, Effexor, Acyclovir, Prednisone, Atarax, Warfarin, Flonase, Triamcinolone Cream, Imitrex.  BACKGROUND:  Thanks for your time. I recently collapsed, spending 1 week in hospital (telemetry and Med-Surg).  I was diagnosed with : Bi-lat P.E. in segmental pulmonary artery branches to the lower lobes, and in the right main pulmonary artery, including the bifurcation and extending into the bifurcation of the right main pulmonary artery. Wedge shaped area in the posterior aspect of the right middle lobe is indicative of infarct. Right pleural effusion and bibasilar areas of consolidation may also represent infarct.  Also, doppler studies of legs showed: persistent occlusive DVT of left popliteal vein.  I'm now home and currently managed on warfarin, analgesia and anti-embolus stockings.  I have no previous history of DVT or PE - MD's are baffled to the cause (still pending some lab results, but as of yet, all bloodwork is relatively normal).  QUESTION: According to research studies, what is my prognosis - of particular interest to me is knowing what is the likelihood of PE recurring?  Thanks for your time - I look forward to your response.  Tim\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Pulmonary embolism",
    "content": "Dear Tim,   The pulmonary embolism could be secondary to the dvt that you had even though some would argue that calf dvt does not cause pulmonary embolism.  Did you have any recent long trips? Were you sick and stayed in bed for a while recently? Did the doctors check for what is known as hypercoagulable states? Anyone in the family ever had any blood clots before?  Recurrence of pulmonary embolism differs according to what caused it or if the patient has a risk factor for recurrence of blood clots in general. So, in your case we have to find out what is the reason behind the blood clots in both your leg and your lungs. i think the likelihood of pulmonary embolism recurrence in general is about 2-9%.  Patients who stay on blood thinners longer usually have a lower incidence of recurrence.  If no definite cause is identified, you have to stay on blood thinners for six months. If you develop a second episode, you stay on blood thinners for life and some people would argue that you need what is knonw an inferior vena caval filter to prevent blood clots from travelling from your legs to your lungs.  If there is a reversible cause that is identified, you only need to be on blood thinners for six months.  If there is an irreversible cause such as a hypercoagulable state, you will be receiving blood thinners for life.  In your case, given the burden of blood clots in your lungs, i would like to know what is your lung status functional capacity wise. If you have good lung functions, well and good. If your lung functions are bad and you might not tolerate a second episode of pulmonary embolism, some would argue that you need the inferior vena caval filter to prevent blood clots from reaching your lung. There are others who believe that a filter is not to be used except when anticoagulation has failed meaning that you have to have a second episode of pumonary embolism before they consider using a filter as putting a filter in has its own complications as well.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and I hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Tim, I have seen and assisted with the treatment of quite a number of patients with Pulmonary Emboli or DVTs.  You mentioned that you are on Coumadin.  You did not mention if you were aware of the dietary considerations while on this medication.  For the sake of the other readers of this post, with your kind indulgence, I will briefly overview the dietary factors. Coumadin is a very efficacious drug for the creation and maintaining a particular level of anticoagulation for the patient population best served by its pharmacology.  Of interest and of value to know is the fact that a dose of coumadin taken today will generally show in a lab value aproximately 3 days from now.  This means that a sequential dose of coumadin that is too high will have a cumulative effect on the body before the dose may may noted to be high by the lab value.  It also means that any dose lower than optimal, or any external affect on the dose efficacy will also be in existence before any lab value will detect it.  There are general \"rules\" regarding the level of the Coumadin depending on the reason for the drug as well as MD preference.  The lab value is noted as an  PT/ INR.  For years, the PT (prothrombin time) was the lab value that determined the dose of coumadin.  Within the past 10 years, there is more favor to the use of the INR (international normalizing ratio).  This is because the INR was developed to enable a traveler across the country or across the globe to be able to have a local lab test and compare the lab values to a set base of the population instead of a set of controls that was how the original PT was calculated.  (Considering that several companies may make the controls and there was little ability to standardize these internationally.)  Concerning the external affects:  Diet is the biggest one.  Vitamin K is the antidote for Coumadin.  It is contained in good quantities in deep leafy greens, as found in salads, and other vegetables.  It is important to level the playing field, so to speak, with one's intake of salad.  It does NOT mean you have to eliminate the salad. It means that you need to have a sense of same-ness across the week's diet that prevents salad binging alternating with salad fasting.  It is possible to have your INR level fluctating enough if your diet is inconsistent to have the potential of causing clots, if you have either an underlying coagulopathy, or if you have an underlying condition that potentiates the formation of clots.  You mentioned a \"benign\" systolic murmur.  Depending on what is causing the murmur, it is possible for you to form clots in the heart chamber affected. Coupled with a ping-ponging Coumadin level, this could be the source of PE or DVT.    I hope this nursing insight may give you additional information to empower you to protect yourself.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a nurse and have a patient with severe COPD. What is the highest level I can turn the O2 concentrator up to? His SPO2 was in the low 80's. He was on 2L and I gradually turned it up to 4L. When his O2 was not coming up, I put it up to 5L, but only briefly, I'm talking about 5 minutes. He had even dropped into the 70ls a few times. I know that there is a mechanism in the brain that shuts off when you get too much oxygen. I also worked in a hospital where I was told that a patient with COPD could have it up to 5L. However, in school, we learned not to go over 4. What is the correct answer. And, does it do any damage to put it up to 5? Yes, I sent him to the hospital. I work in a nursing home.   Thanks Cherie\n\n",

    "content": "Cherie, I very much appreciate your post, and the fact that it represents a sincere desire to do the right thing for the patient and to understand WHY it is the right thing.  A COPD patient can have a tendency to retain CO2 at a higher than normal concentration, which is bad, when oxygen is administered at greater than 3 - 4 L.  This can lead to respiratory distress, and ultimately acidosis and respiratory failure.  There are many physicians who stand adamantly on not administering more than 3 L of oxygen to their patients at any time - even when the finger Sat is at 88%.  It may be that for that patient, that is where they \"live\".  However, not all COPD patients retain CO2, so, in some cases the attending MD may request as much as 5 L oxygen to be administered.  It would be the prudent thing thing ( to protect your patient, and to protect your license),  to ask the attending physician what his or her preference is regarding the amount of oxygen to give the patient  Then request a set of parameters of what are the acceptible O2 saturations for this patient, and record that with the daily or shift vitals. This way you have a way of identifying what is an abnormal for THAT patient, and alert the MD as needed. Hope this is of some value.  Marceline\n\n",

Post nasal discharge results in sore throat also. This is more likely to be the cause of your symptoms.  All causes that result in chronic irritation of the nasal mucosa can produce bloody mixed discharge due to mucosa damage.

I was just told that the bone that was harvested from my hip bone is not growing in the disk space.  That there is just an empty space there and the right screw has become loose.  This morning I woke up with pain in my upper chest/throat area when I breathe.  I have had a headache all morning that seems to go all the way down to my throat.  I have also coughed a brown/green looking blog of junk.  I went to a Care Now Clinic and they took my vitals, temp was 99.5 which is high for me because my normal runs about 97.8, did a chest exray and a EKG.  She said everything was normal and I should have a sonogram of my gall bladder because the pain could be caused by that.  (I have acid reflux and have been on NEXIUM 40 mg. for many years)..  I don't think it is my gallbladder but what else could be causing this pain.  It hurts when I try to lay down or when I try to bend over (cleaning cat box) and hurts when I breathe.  I also had a root canal with infection fixed last week.  I've been on antibiotics for that.  Do you have any idea of what this pain is?  I thought for sure it miust be bronchitis or pneumonia as I have had both several times in my life.  When I was 6, I was hospitalized for 6 weeks with viral pneumonia.  Should I take what this Care Now doc say and have the gallbladder sonogram or do something else.  Any information you can provide would be much appreciated!  Sinhcerely, Shirlee M. Smith\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  -Sometimes chest pain is not originating from the chest itself, instead it is due to problems in the digestive tract. These problems include gastritis and gastric ulcer, gall bladder disease, and GERD.   It sounds like GERD and gastritis is the cause of your symptoms. Esophagitis is a known complication of GERD and can lead to esophageal spasm. You receive treatment for GERD but it may not be enough and you need to follow up with your doctor to prescribe the proper treatment.  People with GERD may present with:  Chest pain,  Pain in the throat,  Morning hoarseness, and  Discomfort in the chest  Others may experience a feeling like the food stuck in their throat or tightness in the throat, dry Cough and Shortness of breath similar to Asthma. These symptoms are mainly due to inflammation of the esophagus (esophagitis)   Certain foods as well are known to aggravate the condition, and you better avoid them.   As for gall bladder diseases, although your symptoms are less likely to be related to gall bladder disease, many doctors  prefer to exclude this cause.  -Psychological or emotional stress and Anxiety, are additive factors.    Other causes to be excluded and can give similar clinical picture include:  -Pleurisy is an inflammation of the pleura, which is a double-layered membrane covers the lungs separating it from the rib cage. Viral infections are commonest cause and dry cough is usually present which increase the severity of the pain.  -Evolving lung infection.  - Associated Muscle spasm is to be excluded too as in many cases is the result of inappropriate posture for long time like traveling, driving, carrying heavy objects, and certain types of work or spinal problems (which you have).   -Cardiac causes, should be excluded in any case of Chest pain as your doctor has done.  Hope you find this information useful.  Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Are you able to tell us what the results of the ECG were?  Knowing what the abnormality was will help answer your question.  It would be a bit unusual for a man of your age to have heart problems.  An echocardiogram is essentially an ultrasound of the heart.  It gives good pictures of the heart to look for any structural abnormalities or thickening of the walls.  They can often also look at the coronary arteries to some extent.  If your doctor is not concerned it is very likely that nothing major is wrong, but we often like to do some confirmatory tests to verify our belief.  I suspect that this is why your doctor wants to do the echocardiogram.  Let us know if you are able to give us more info and I may be able to help more.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "Small holes in the heart, such as an atrial septal defect, if allowing enough blood flow across to the right side of the heart can cause the right side of the heat to enlarge.  This enlargement can be picked up on an ECG and may be what your doctor was seeing.  Unfortunately, ECG's are very, very sensitive to lead placement.  If the electrodes are placed in a slightly wrong position it can also show similar findings.  So, as your doctor has recommended, the way to get a definite answer is with an echocardiogram to actually look for holes and blood flowing across the heart.  They can also measure the size of the heart.  There's a very good chance that the ECG changes may be artifact and not accurate.  The echo will be able to tell for sure.  Let us know what you find out.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "I just started INH treatment but still have a few questions:  1)  The doctor never mentioned anything but the paper that came with the medication from the pharmacy (that lists all the details about the meds) stated that someone taking INH should not take a few other medications at the same time....I couldn't recognize any of them except acetameniphine or as I know it, Tylenol.  How dangerous is this?  I normally take Advil for a headache, maybe once or twice a month, but it has 500mg of acetameniphine in each dose.  What are the dangers?  and if it is dangerous, should I confront my doctor to find out why he didn't tell me.  This could of very easily been overlooked by me and if it is dangerous I want to let them know so they can ensure to inform future patients of this danger.  2)  I'm a very very light drinker by nature...maybe 3 beers in a month and I've been told that I shouldn't drink while taking INH because of the drain on my liver.  What if I didn't drink at all for the entire 9 month period except for a couple drinks one day (for my brother's wedding)?  You see my delima?  Not drinking for 9 months isn't an issue for me, I rarely drink anyways but on my brother's wedding day I would like to at least have a beer or two with him and our dad.  Is 1 day \"off the wagon\" going to kill my liver???  Thank you very much for volunteering on this forum.    JP\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Although it has been reported that there is a higher risk of liver damage (chemical hepatitis) when isoniazid and acetaminophen are taken concomitantly. This interaction is poorly explained and poorly documented, although when occur is very severe.  You better inform your Doctor if you have to take the drug on regular basis, thus he can either prescribe you another analgesic or keep you on close follow up to monitor any symptom or sign suggestive of liver damage.  As for alcohol, the risk of hepatitis is considered if alcohol is taken on regular daily base.   Avoid using this combination, Isoniazide, acetaminophen and acohol, as it will increase the risk for liver damage.  I advise you to follow up with your Doctor and to discuss with him your concern  Best regards.\n\n",

    "title": "UNKNOWN CHEST PAIN!!!!!!!",
    "content": "I AM A 21 YEAR OLD FEMALE.  I AM A FULL-TIME EMPLOYEE AND I ALSO ATTEND COLLEGE FULL-TIME.  I AM BELOW AVERAGE WEIGHT.  I WEIGH 86 LBS AND I AM 5\u20192/3\u201d.  I DO NOT DRINK, DO DRUGS, OR SMOKE.  I OBVIOUSLY AM NOT IN THE BEST OF PHYSCIAL CONDITIONS BECAUSE I AM UNDERWEIGHT.  ALSO, ALTHOUGH I HAVE SUCH A BUSY SCHEDULE GOING TO SCHOOL AND WORK, I AM FAIRLY GOOD IN MANAGING MY TIME.  THEREFORE, I DO NOT LEAD A VERY STRESSFUL LIFE.    ABOUT 6-7 YEARS AGO I STARTED EXPERIENCING A SHARP PAIN IN MY CHEST.  WHEN IT FIRST STARTED, IT WOULD HAPPEN AT RANDOM TIMES, ABOUT 3-4 TIMES A MONTH.  SINCE THEN IT HAS GOTTEN PROGRESSIVELY WORSE.  NOW, 6-7 YEARS LATER, THE PAIN NOT ONLY OCCURS MORE OFTEN, BUT NOW LASTS LONGER.  I GET THE SHOOTING SHARP PAIN IN MY CHEST THAT TYPICALLY LASTS 3-5 MINS EACH TIME, AT LEAST A COUPLE OF TIMES A DAY.  ALSO, NOW THAT THE PAIN IS MORE FREQUENT, THE ARE ALSO OTHER EFFECTS OF THE PAIN TO OTHER PARTS OF MY BODY.  NOW, I GET THE PAIN FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES, AND THEN IT GOES FROM A SHARP PAIN TO A DULL, DISCOMFORTING PAIN.  THIS DULL PAIN IS ALSO VERY PAINFUL, PROBABLY EVEN MORE SO BECAUSE I CANNOT PINPOINT THE PAIN.  THE PAIN THEN TRAVELS TO THE REST OF THE LEFT SIDE OF MY UPPER BODY \u2013 FRONT AND BACK.  ALSO, THE PAIN SORT OF RADIATES TO MY LEFT ARM AND LEG.  ONCE THE PAIN REACHES MY LIMBS, MY ARM AND LEG BEGIN TO FEEL TINGLY AND START GETTING NUMB.  THE TINGLINESS AND NUMBNESS ALONG WITH THE PAIN IN MY LEFT ARM AND LEG DOES NOT OCCUR UNLESS IT IS FOLLOWED BY THE PAIN IN MY CHEST.    ALSO, THE PAIN AS A WHOLE DOES NOT ALLOW ME TO TAKE DEEP BREATHS.  I ALWAYS FEEL AS IF I AM OUT OF BREATH BECAUSE OF IT.  THE WORST THING IS THAT THE PAIN IS VERY UNPREDICTABLE.  IT COMES AND GOES AS IT WISHES.  I HAVE BEEN IN SITUATIONS WHERE I HAVE HAD TO PULL TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD TO HAVE SOMEONE ELSE DRIVE ME HOME.  I HAVE BEEN GOING TO NUMEROUS DOCTORS SINCE MY PAIN FIRST STARTED ABOUT 6-7 YEARS AGO.  AT FIRST I WAS TOLD THAT I MIGHT BE ANEMIC.  WHICH IT TURNED OUT THAT I WASN\u2019T.  THEN THE DOCTORS INFORMED ME THAT I HAD JUVENILE ARTHIRITIS.  I WENT ON FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS BELIEVING THAT I DID IN FACT HAVE JUVENILE ARTHIRITIS.  JUST RECENTLY, I HAVE FOUND OUT THAT I DO NOT HAVE JUVENILE ARTHIRITS.  I HAVE BEEN GOING TO DOCTORS, LIKE I SAID, FOR MANY YEARS NOW.  EVERY DOCTOR DOES BLOOD TESTS, ORDERS X-RAYS AND EKGs.  EVERYTHING SEEMS TO BE COMING OUT NORMAL.  BECAUSE OF THE FACT THE EVERY TEST COMES OUT NORMAL, I FEEL AS IF MY DOCTOR IS NOT REALLY TRYING TO FIND OUT WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME.  THE DOCTOR JUST CONTINUES TO GIVE ME HIGHER AND HIGHER DOSAGES OF PAIN MEDICATION.  HONESTLY, I HAVE STOPPED TAKING THE PAIN MEDICATION THAT IS GIVEN TO ME.  THE REASON SIMPLY BEING THAT IT SEEMS MY BODY GETS IMMUNE TO PAIN MEDICATION VERY QUICKLY.  JUST AS A QUICK EXAMPLE.  AT FIRST I WAS TAKING 550mg OF NAPROXEN 3 TIMES A DAY.  AFTER ONLY ABOUT A MONTH, I WAS UPPED TO 1000mg OF NAPROXEN 3 TIMES A DAY.  I HAVE BEEN GIVEN MANY TYPES OF PAIN KILLERS TO TRY TO HELP WITH THE PAIN, BUT IT JUST SEEMS THAT THE MEDICATION DOES NOT HAVE AN AFFECT ON THE PAINS.  SINCE THE PAIN IS SPORATIC, I BELIEVE THAT THE MEDICATION DOES NOT HELP.  ALSO, DOCTORS HAVE TRIED TO GIVE ME ANTI-DEPRESSANTS THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO HELP WITH THE PAIN.  ALL THAT DOES IS MAKE ME HYPER AND \u201cOFF THE WALLS\u201d ALL DAY LONG.  AT TIMES WHEN I USED TO TAKE THE ANTI-DEPRESSANTS, I WOULD FEEL AS IF MY BODY WANTED TO JUMP OUT OF ITSELF.  ALSO, I FEEL THAT TAKING SO MUCH PAIN MEDICATION FOR SOMEONE THAT WEIGHS 86LBS WOULD HAVE AN ADVERSE NEGATIVE EFFECT OF THEIR BODY.  FOR ALL OF THESE REASONS, I HAVE MADE THE DECISION TO NOT TAKE ANYMORE PAIN MEDICATION.  MAYBE THAT DECISION IS NOT TOTALLY SMART, BUT I FEEL THAT THE MEDICATION DOES NOT MAKE THE PAIN BETTER ANYWAY.    I HAVE BEEN SEEING A REUMATOLOGIST FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS.  I HAVE ONLY HAD TWO VISITS SO FAR.  I DID TAKE ALL OF THE RESULTS OF MY PRIOR TESTS WITH ME.  THE REUMATOLOGIST DID ASK ME TO GET ANOTHER BLOOD TEST DONE, WHICH DID COME OUT NORMAL.  ALSO, THEY ASKED FOR ME TO GET A BONE SCAN TO SEE IF THERE WAS INFLAMATION IN THE BONES.  APPARENTLY, THE BONE SCAN IS DONE ON CANCER PATIENTS, BUT IT WOULD HAVE APPARENTLY HELPED IN LOCATING ANY INFLAMATION.  THE BLOOD TESTS AND THE BONE SCAN HAVE BOTH COME OUT NORMAL SO THE REUMATOLOGIST HAS NOW BLUNTLY SAID THAT WE ARE BACK AT SQUARE ONE.  HE SAYS THAT HE WILL SPEAK WITH MY PRIMARY DOCTOR TO GET ME EVALUATED BY A NEUROLOGIST.  MY PRIMARY DOCTOR DOES NOT AGREE THAT MY PAIN IS NEUROLOGICALLY RELATED.  I HAVE ALSO BEEN TO THE ER MANY TIMES, WHERE THEY JUST ORDER MORE BLOOD TESTS, X-RAYS, AND EKGs.  THOSE TESTS ALWAYS COME OUT NORMAL, AND THEN THEY START AT SQUARE ONE AGAIN.  I AM SO FED UP WITH GOING TO DIFFERENT DOCTORS AND PRACTICALLY GETTING NO ANSWERS.  I WOULD GREATLY APPRECEIATE IT IF SOMEONE CAN LEAD ME IN THE CORRECT DIRECTION TO TRY AND TACKLE THIS PROBLEM.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi pvyas1, There are many causes for cardiac/noncardiac in origin chest pain. I will first start by stating that even though you may think that you are not at all stressed, if you are working full time and going to school full time, you most certainly are and you just don't realize it. For your physician's, it may seem that they aren't trying to diagnose your problem but the fact that they are performing the standard diagnostics would suggest that they are attemptimg. To find a causative factor for a condition or illness it is sometimes necessary, when it is not clear what the exact problem is, to eliminate each one in a chronological order. Certain neurological conditions/diseases may cause pain, numbness, tingling,weakness, visual disturbances, etc. A neurologist would be able to identify if you have a dysfunction that's causing your symptoms, and may order a diagnostic, i.e., MRI to identify any anomalies. If the recommendation is to have an evaluation by this specialist I would encourage you to do so. An update of course would be appreciated. Best wishes. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "Hello and Merry Christmas. Thank you for taking time to offer this service...it is greatly appreciated. I am a 45 year old female with a history of degenerative disc disease in my lumbar and cervical spine, osteoarthritis in both hips, etc. I am currently taking Lexapro for depression and various OTC meds such as fish oil, glucosamin/chondroitin (sp?), and calcium. Several months ago I was simply walking down a hallway and suddenly had extreme sharp pain in my spine (a little above the base of my shoulder blades) and a few minutes later it spread to the ribs at about the same level on the right side. It hurt a great deal to take a deep breath or move too much for a couple hours, after which it eased slowly and turned into a dull ache for several more days. What are the most likely causes of this kind of pain? I have never been tested for osteoperosis and was wondering if it could be a spine fracture or if it is more likely to be related to the degenerative issues...or neither one for that matter. I realize without an exam you can't say for sure but am looking for possible leads to information I can look up and discuss with my new doctor...unfortunately, due to the holidays I won't be able to see her for several more weeks and thought I'd put the time to good use. Thank you again for taking time to answer questions and have a wonderful holiday!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,    It sounds like muscle spasm is the cause of your symptoms.   The back has a group of muscles that enable us to stand erect. These muscles are attached to the ribs, being in spasm make the breathing difficult or painful.  Muscle spasm can also occur due overexertion of the chest wall muscles to maintain the chest in certain position to avoid pain of skeletal disorders like costochondritis or spinal problems, like disc problems as in your case.  Muscle spasm  in many indiviuals is the result of inappropriate posture for long time like traveling, driving, carrying heavy objects, and certain types of work.   Self care and avoiding the precipitating cause will lead to a gradual but clear improvement in the pain.   If the pain is recurrent and is not relieved by conservative measures and analgesics, nerve compression  due to disc prolapse should be excluded.  Direct clinical examination is essential.  I advise you to follow up with your doctor.  Keep us updated.  Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "For about a month now i have been suffering from a nagging cough. It doesnt so much feel like a lung thing but more like something is tickling my throat constantly. I have had fits of coughing so bad that i vomited, or dry heaved. I cannot seem to arrest the cough with over te counter medicines. I have visited my family doctor, and after checking my ears nose and throat, and listening to my lungs he said i should be fine in five days. He also recommended that i get some over the counter cough medicine. I find it hard to believe that if i have had this for a month and it hasen't gotten better, i doubt it will in five more days. My body is so drained now from all the coughing, and i have a throbbing headach that worsens with every cough. Some of my other symptoms include, a flu that i got during the second week and lasted for 3 days (103 degree temp). I have also had some dry sweats, a little disoriented feeling, loss of appetite (have lost about 5+ pounds), runny nose, stuffed up nose, and Flem does come up when i cough. The things i have been taking (without results) are: Claritin Sudafed - Nasal decongestant Cough Drops - lemon and honey (no menthol) Antihistamines - not sure of the brand Tylenol - for headaches  My doctor said five days, but five days is like hell  Is it really nothing, and will it be gone in five days? or should i be worried about something else? i have never had something this bad\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  It would have been more helpful if you described more the character of this pain and if there are any other related symptoms or signs. However I would give you a general idea about what it could be.   The chest contains many organs, like the heart, lungs with its pleural covering, esophagus, muscles, ribs, tendons, and nerves. They all can be the source of the pain felt in the chest.   - Muscle spasm alone can cause pain which can be an unidentified cause but in many cases is the result of infections(viral), inappropriate posture for long time like traveling, driving and certain types of work.   Self care and avoiding the precipitating cause will lead to a gradual but clear improvement in the pain. Home treatment includes the use of Analgesics, cold or hot therapy. Rest for maximum two days is also beneficial.   - Pleurisy is an inflammation of the pleura, which is a double-layered membrane covers the lungs separating it from the rib cage. Viral infections like flu, are the most common cause of Pleurisy. The pain is felt as sharp pain which get worse by Coughing, sneezing, moving and deep breathing. auscultation of the chest shows a characteristic sound known as pleural rub.   - Sometimes Chest pain is not originating from the chest itself; instead it is due to problems in the digestive tract. These problems include IBS, Gastritis and Gastric ulcer, gall bladder disease, GER.   -Cardiac causes, should be excluded in any case of Chest pain although it is unlikely to be in your case (young age, non  typical symptoms).   Direct clinical examination is essential. Best regards.\n\n",

And I am currently taking Lo-Ovral.  I was taking 600mg of ibuprofen for my pain, but the Dr. told me to stop taking it.  Can you please help me figure out what the lump on my ribs could be?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Costochondritis results from inflammation of the cartilage where ribs attach to (the sternum) the breast bone. It may affects more than one cartilage area on both sides of the sternum but usually one side is affected.  In Tietze syndrome, a condition that affects same area and. Costochondritis is causes similar clinical picture but associated with swelling on the affected area. On examination there is also redness, tenderness, and heat.  On Labs: ESR,  C-Reactive Protein Test are typically high in patients with Tietze syndrome.  Rest, anti-inflammatory drugs, physical therapy are helpful for both costochondritis and Tietze syndrome.   Direct clinical examination is essential. I advise you to follow with your doctor.

    "content": "Hi. I'm a 21 year old male with no past surgeries, current medications or family history. I'm a do not smoke. I do have asthma, but not severe, infact I used my inhaler for the first time in years today.  Yesterday I had trouble lying on my left side in bed, it brough a discomfort to my chest which wore off if i lied on my right side. However even on the right it was uncomfortable though slightly less.  Today, the discomfort in my chest is noticable even when sat or stood up. It feels almost as if there is a blockage or norrowing of my airways.  I also have a small lump under my chin which has been there for years. I researched this as saliva glands (i hope). This lump/gland was swollen yesterday to the size of a pea and I could feel it when eating. However today the swelling appears to have reduced slightly. The lump does not hurt in anyway.  It's my chest I'm worried about, what are the possible causes to this? I'm very worried and any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thankyou.\n\n",

The specialists at the children's hospital, where you were treated can identify if you have any of the risk factors associated with this problem. The anxiety may be related to the pneumothorax itself and the fear of another episode. Once you have been given a clean bill of health so to speak, (no asthma etc.) then that should decrease your anxiety. Please be sure to discuss  your concerns with your physician.

    "content": "Hi angelforever34, Scarring of the lungs may worsen over time causing chronic lung problems, ie., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, emphysema, etc. Scarring reduces the expansion ability of the lungs and causes them to be more fibrotic. If your CPAP has provided you with minimal relief, have the settings on the machine checked as it may be incorrect. Injury to the bone and cartilage may cause significant pain. One condition, for example, costrochondritis is due to cartilage/bone irritation and inflammation along the chest wall. Treatment for this particular condition is typically with NSAID's, application of heat or cold to the affected area, etc. This condition is diagnosed after other causes are ruled out.

You did not clearly mention your main symptoms and whether the disease is limited to that removed lymph node or in any other parts of the body.  Surgical excision is the treatment of choice in most cases of localized Castleman's Disease and is curative.  Highly aggressive generalized disease is fatal in spite of aggressive management.

This was going on about 2 times a week. They get so bad sometimes that if they are on the bottom of my feet it hurts so bad to walk. Also I have been getting pains in my chest & it feels like my throat is closing...very hard to breath. Dizzy feeling, sweeling of the hands & arms. I was also feeling jittery feeling & get a sore throat alot.   Within the last 1-1 1/2 months the knots have been coming up every other day. My hand has been so swollen that I could not even open a bottle of water. I have also been getting like hives all over my body.  I went to the doctor 2 months ago & when I was there he said that I had high blood pressure & put my on Diovan HCT then I went back & he put me on Dyazide. I take that everyday. he also has put me on Xanax.   Within the last 2 weeks I have been really sick, abdominal pains, throwing up. I stayed in bed last week for 3 days I was that sick.   My doctor sent me to a allergy clinic today where they di the testing & came back I was allergic to NOTHING.  I have no clue as to why I am getting these knots & why the pain on my chest & hard to breath.

    "content": "Hi pt_i_am, The following is directly quoted by the University of Florida's Division of Surgical Oncology: \"Parathyroid Disease: Hyperparathyroidism is a common disorder involving tissues of the parathyroid gland located at the base of the neck, near the thyroid gland. The parathyroid gland makes a hormone which helps the body store and use calcium. When this hormone is produced in excess, hyperparathyroidism develops. In patients with hyperparathyroidism, one of the four parathyroid glands behaves inappropriately by making excess parathyroid hormone regardless of the level of calcium . In other words, one of the parathyroid glands continues to make large amounts of parathyroid hormone even when the calcium level is not high and at a time when the parathyroid glands should not be making any hormone at all.  The most common cause of excess hormone production (hyperparathyroidism) is the development of a benign tumor in one of the parathyroid glands. This enlargement of one of the parathyroid glands is called a parathyroid adenoma which accounts for 95% of all patients. This parathyroid tumor is typically only 1/2 inch in diameter. Several years ago, standard parathyroid surgery involved making a big incision to identify this small parathyroid tumor. Now utilizing state of the art technology, Surgical Oncologists at UF can remove this tumor in over 90% of patients with minimally invasive surgery. This involves making a small incision (typically about 1 inch) to take out the one bad parathyroid gland. The other three normal parathyroid glands are left alone. Most operations can be done in the outpatient setting with patients going home the same day as the surgery. All surgeries are done using a special monitoring device which ensures the safety of the nerves that supply the vocal cord and larynx\". Lymph node biopsies in general, consist of either excisional biopsy as mentioned above or Fine Needle Aspiration. As for determination of what  the condition is regarding your lungs, if enlargement is due to a disease process located there, yes. If it's due to the above stated, (parathyroid disease) it may be an entirely separate process.  Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

Yesterday I was told by my pulmonologist, who I was seeing for sleep apnea, that I have Interstitial Lung Disease with diffuse Ground Glass Opacities in the lung. This was  after having a cat scan of the lungs done two weeks ago.  I am a non-smoker with no history of lung disease in my family.  My only symptom is an O2 sat of between 80-92 on room air and shortness of breath on exertion.  I have asked the doctor for the cause of this disease and he tends to be vague and not answer my questions.  He said RA or Lupus could be causes and this friday he will do a lung wash and biopsy for which he is coming in on his day off to do, saying it is urgent this be done quickly.  What he refuses to discuss is whether there is a possibility of lung cancer.  I have been researching this disease and everywhere I go it talks about this being a terminal disease with a survival rate of 2-6 years even if it is not a malignancy. If that is incorrect then what is the general prognosis for this type of lung disease?   My question is what is the possibility that this could be a malignancy and if it isnt lung cancer, then is there any treatment for this disease that would have a better outcome in survival rate?  Is there anything I can do to improve my prognosis. I know you cant diagnose me, but I want someone to be frank and open with me and let me prepare myself for the worst case scenario as well as take steps to improve my chances of survival. Thanks, Carolyn\n\n",

    "content": "Dear CmMerritt,  The pattern of the radiological lung picture, helps the clinician in the diagnosis.  Causes of Ground-glass opacities in the lung include:  Drug-induced lung diseases, worthnoting that morphine is one of these drugs, Idiopathic nonspecific interstitial pneumonia Nonspecific interstitial pneumonia secondary to underlying diseases including connective tissue diseases like RA or Lupus.  The presence of diffuse alveolar infiltrates for a period of weeks to months are seen in cases of chronic infection, advanced bronchioloalveolar carcinoma or lymphoma.  Other lung problems can cause the same type of lung opacity include: respiratory bronchiolitis\u2013associated interstitial lung disease, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, chronic eosinophilic pneumonia and sarcoidosis (LN enalrgement is a mark of this disease).  Diagnostic tests include: - high-resolution CT scan of the chest  - pulmonary function tests  - measurement of the blood oxygen level at rest or during exertion , as requested by your doctor. - blood tests to evaluate for connective tissue diseases which is important in your case. - bronchoscopy and transbronchial biopsy  - surgical lung biopsy if needed    The treatment of the underlying cause is the primary gaol although, anti-inflammatory drugs, such as corticosteroids or immunosuppressing drugs, are usually prescribed. If the underlying disorder, could not be identified or there is no specific therapy, supportive therapy including O2 is indicated.  The prognosis of the disease depend on the underlying cause.  I hope you find this information useful. Keep us updated with the results of the bronchoscopy and biopsy. Identifying the underlying cause is essential for definitive therapeutic approach.  We wish you best of luck,\n\n",

    "content": "Dear sk8ermikey,  I do not understand well what do you mean by having lung congestion.  If my guess is correct, Viral infection and pleurisy is more likely to be the cause of your complaints.  Pleurisy is an inflammation of the pleura, the double layered membrane that covers the lung.  The condition is due to viral infection in most of the cases. In such cases there are also other symptoms of viral infection like headache, fever and muscle aches. It usually lasts from a few days to 2 weeks.  The pain is felt like sharp pain on one side or less commonly in both sides, it increases with deep breath. The pain usually stops once you hold your breath and result in rapid, shallow breathing.   The condition gradually improves with rest, plenty of fluid. NSAID can help reduce the pain.   I advise you to follow up with your doctor. Only by complete history and physical examination, the correct diagnosis can be reached.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Dear sambakersman,  The chest contains many organs, like the heart, lungs with its pleural covering, esophagus, muscles, ribs, tendons, and nerves.  They all can be the source of the pain felt in the chest.   Cardiac causes, should be excluded in any case of Chest pain especially if the pain is similar to that caused by cardiac ischemia although less likely to be the cause in your case (young age with no risk factors). Some other cardiac causes like Mitral valve prolapse give pain that may be similar to that of ischemic heart disease and is usually associated with palpitation. These conditions should be investigated by ECG, stress ECG, Echocradiography and Cardiac catheter if needed.   Overexertion of the chest wall muscles or their inflammation as a part of viral infection like flu or cold results also in Chest pain, the pain is usually aggravated with certain moves and is usually associated with tenderness over the affected muscles. Pain due to rib or chest wall bone disease is also another cause of Chest pain and should be excluded By Chest X-ray and CT scan if needed.

This makes him put on weight and complicates his breathing. In certain medical jornals, it is said that Cortizone should only be used in the treatm of an infection of the lungs and does not help with emphazema. In fact it has the opposite effect, because it puts on weight, this strains the lungs even more. CAN you please tell me, should my father be on Cortizone or not! He takes oxygen dailey and a nebulizer to open the chest. He is hooked on the Cortizone and pops 8 tablets a day! I think this is killing him more than the emphazema.  John.\n\n",

They include chronic bronchitis, asthma and emphysema. Patients with  emphysema have shortness of breath, chronic mild cough and wheeze. Smoking is the main cause. The disease progress gradually and usually evident clinically by the age of 50.  The disease is treated mainly by smoking cessation in addition to other supportive measures like bronchiodilators mucolytics and steroids.  Oral steroids showed success to treat outpatients with acute exacerbation; after stabilization gradually withdrawal should be done to avoid adverse effects.  Some doctors recommend to keep steroid responder on long-term inhaled steroids.  Small Isolated bullae with normal lung that do not interfere with lung functions are treated by conservative measures. Giant bullae in otherwise normal lung affecting lung function may benefit from surgical excision of the bullae.  I advise you to follow with his Doctor and to discuss with him this information.

    "content": "Hi  For the past month now i have had a mild chest pain, it seems to be in the region of just right from my breat bone and behind, depending on my posture i seem to feel it mid back of just to the side of my front, it does not particulary feal like heartburn. Some of the time it seems to spread to give me a saw shoulder or side.  It began with somewhat of a drinking binge with afew smokes, it seemed like i got heartburn from the beer drunk. the heart burn seemed to last another day. i have had the pain ever since. i have been to the doctor who seemed to think it was a virul infection although i tested negative twice. An x-ray yelded no furthur results. i think i have a cough although so week i almost have to force it. this seems to bring up white sputum.  i am 18 and do not smoke although afew times on occasion,  it seems that i may be somewhat short of breath, but i can not tell for surem bad life style perhaps?. Exercise seems to make it worse. When i eat it seemes to take the pain away somewhat. Also. when i drink a cold coke it seems to ease off aswell.  I was on a painkiller called mypiad forte which didnt seemed to do anything, if anything it made things worse, which makes me think it is not muscular.  Im not to sure what to do at this point and im not to sure my doctor does either.  Any advice on possiable causes, tests , medication etc would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance.\n\n",

For three years she has been having excruciating chest pains that last for an hour or more, occurring once a month. The pains are alleviated, almost completely by taking 3 Ibuprofin + 1 Valium. She has had repeated testing for cardiac problems, all show normal findings.  Out of a \"last ditch effort\" her doctor ordered a CT scan of the chest and digestive tract. The CT scan findings were as follows:  No Masses, nodules, nodes or Pleural Effusion noted Multiple small bullae noted in upper portion of lungs bilaterally Diagnosis: Bulleous Emphysema  She has no follow-up, was told to do nothing other than to stop smoking (she has smoked for 40 years). She was not referred to a Pulmonologist.  She has no other symptoms of emphysema, no SOB, no cough (other than the dry cough she has had for the past 20 years), no wheezing, no persistant chest infections like pneumonia, bronchitis...  The only symptom was her Chest Pain, which when she does experience is accompanied by SOB. She was told that the CP is unrelated to the emphysema and is chest muscle spasms.  Our family history includes: my grandmother (her mother) died 2 years ago from Lung Cancer, multiple people with asthma, her sister had a collapsed lung.   Does this sound like she's receiving proper care/diagnosis?  Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Angelina Pitt,  Pigmented Villonodular Synovitis (PVNS ) is a benign proliferative disorder of unknown etiology that involves synovial lined joints, bursae, and tendon sheaths. It is uncommon and represents a diagnostic challenge for doctors.  The disease is known to affect  mainly males at the age of 20 - 50 years old. It tends to affect multiple joints, but mainly affects the knee and  the hip joint.  Although it has a benign nature, it can involve adjacent bone and affects the extra- articular tissues. It may also metastasize to lung/viscera.  Diagnosis is made by CT and MRI imaging. Treatment is by Convector.  If you have these positive chest lesions by PET Scan, what did your doctor interpreted them, are they bony lesion, soft tissue, lung or pleural? What did he recommend you for that?  I think you need to follow up with him and to discuss with him this information. Hope you find this information useful, Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Chester,  Pain in the chest with characters similar to what you have described can be due to one of these causes:  In appropriate contraction of the throat or esophageal muscles causes chest pain that can be severe and sometimes is felt as a lump or tightness in the chest with difficult swallowing and bad breathing. The condition can be a sequence of sore throat or (viral, bacteria) infection that subsides gradually after recovering from infections or as part of a spastic esophageal motility disorders.   GERD The anatomical relation between the diaphragm and the Lowe Esophageal Sphincter LES prevents the gastric acids to come up into the esophagus (reflux). Acid reflux causes severe pain and discomfort in the chest in the morning. Others may experience a feeling like the food stuck in their throat or tightness in the throat, dry cough and shortness of breath similar to asthma.  Stress and smoking can increase these symptoms. Certain foods as well are known to aggravate the condition, and you better avoid them. These include chocolate, beverages containing caffeine, fatty and fried foods, garlic and onions, spicy and tomato containing foods.   Overexertion of the chest wall muscles or their inflammation are common causes for chest pain. They all are associated with tenderness over the affected areas. In all of these conditions the chest pain is usually aggravated by taking deep breath, cough or while doing certain movements like bending to one side of the chest. They usually improve with physiotherapy, muscle exercise, pain killers, muscle relaxants. Avoiding exposure to cold humid environment is very important to improve the symptoms  Psychological or emotional stress and anxiety, in these cases the diagnosis is made by exclusion of other causes.  Diagnosis is made by complete history taking, physical examination, investigations like Upper endoscopy, Manometric studies, and other lab tests that can be recommended by the doctor accordingly.   Best Regards,\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 37yr.f.  I do have a complicated health history.  I have a pacemaker,  and I have been on multiple medications for arrythmias, including amiodarone for 5 yrs.  I was sent to a pulmonologist in the fall who performed a VQ scan.  My breathing was terrible.  I was taken off amiodarone.  The VQ scan did not show lung clots and I never saw the pulmonologist after that.  I do take coumadin as well. I will skip ahead to now.  Recently I was hospitalized for significant generalized edema.  Because my head swells when I lay down and my veins pop out in my head and neck, the docs. worried about superior vena cava syndrome.  I had a CT angiogram of my chest.  It  showed clots in my chest, but also scarring on my lower lung.  My doctor merely read that out loud without explaination. Here are my questions: Do I need to pursue finding out about the lung scarring? What could be the cause? I am worried because I heard that amiodarone therapy can cause pulmonary fibrosis.  Is that a possibility? Thank you for your time.  It is so appreciated.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Lung scarring",
    "content": "Dear Basil,  i have read your two other posts and your medical history is definitely complex.  Diagnosis of amiodarone lung toxicity is one of exclusion, meaning that everything else has to be excluded before we say that this scarring is caused by amiodarone. There is no specific ct scan of the chest picture for amiodarone toxicity. It can be of various types.  In clinical trials, patients who were taking more than 400 mg per day were more prone to having amiodarone lung toxicity. It is difficult to predict who will get amiodarone lung toxicity even by having breathing tests on regular basis.  i think it is a good idea for you to see a lung doctor again to help with this problem and to give recommendations on what kind of breathing medicines you are supposed to be taking now since your cardiologist wants you off the advair and given the breathing test report, i think you need your breathing medicines.  What did you mean by having blood clots in your chest? Were the blood clots in your lungs? If you were taking coumadin, your chances of developing blood clots are usually less and if you are taking coumadin and you still get blood clots, this means that you have to be on higher doses of coumadin.

    "content": "Thanks for responding.  The doctor who actually ordered this recent CT angiogram is a nephrologist.  I have been seeing him for quite sometime.  He and my cardiologist have been trying to figure out the cause of edema.  As I said because I get so much swelling in my head and neck, they wanted to explore the possibility of superior vena cava syndrome. No, I do not have clots in my lungs.  The clots are in the veins, like the subclavian and cephalic, and my SVC is likely partially obstructed.  I was told the treatment is life long anticoagulation, which is what I take anyway.  At least it will prevent future clots.  The thought is because I have wires in from the pacemaker and multiple cath. procedures that it has resulted in scar tissue/clots obstructing veins.   I think I may call to get the results of the CT, and then either bring it up with my cardiologist when I see him or go back to the pulmonary doc.  I only saw him once and he ordered a VQ scan because after walking  up and down the hall in his office my o2 sats dropped to 92.   Are there many causes of lung scarring? If it is from the amiodarone will it progress or halt because I am no longer taking it? Thanks so much again!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Follow to lung scarring",
    "content": "Dear Basil,   Thank you very much for the update.  Lung scarring can be causes by many diseases. The simplest of which could be pneumonia.   If you have not had blood tests to rule out rheumatological diseases and vasculitis, i would encourage you strongly to do so.  After amiodarone is stopped, you don't have to worry, because in most cases regression of the disease occur. There might be an initial period where symptoms might worsen because of the fact that amiodarone takes a long time to be metabolized and excreted out of the body but after that there should not be a problem. If the symptoms persist, steroids might be given to help with the symptoms.  With the saturation going down to 92%, i don't  think you have to worry about it. If your cardiologist is worried that you might need oxygen during exercise, you don't require oxygen during exercise according to the guidelines.  Seeing a pulmonologist would be because of the pulmonary functions test report that you talked about and because of the lung fibrosis.

However, it has been going on a long time, and the pain episodes seem to be somewhat related to the GERD I had s few years ago.But no medications prescribed for the GERD symptoms relieve the pain. Using pain meds such as Demerol and Lortab relieve the pain and additional medications such as Valium and sleep medication Ambien make it possible to sleep without the pain. Any additional ideas would be appreciated. Thanks....\n\n",

    "content": "Yes have been tested and with negative results.  History of ulcers/GERD started about 1995/96 due to high use of ibuprofen prescribed for severe tendonitis. From the ulcers, which were treated and healed successfully, esophageal problems developed, mostly esophageal dysphagia.  Endoscopies were done, very small and of no consequence hiatal hernia. GERD was diagnosed, but has been treated with success by Nexium and Prilosec.   Swallowing difficulties continue, but have tapered off over the past year. 3 times have had to go to emergency room for emergency endoscopies to alleviate food stuck in severely spasming esophagus. Nitroglycerin was prescribed to stop the smooth muscle spasms if and when they occur.   I have been treated consistently by my Osteopathic Physician with osteopathic manipulation therapy to relieve pinched nerves in thoracic spine area. I apparently have a chronic condition where three or 4 vertabrae slip out of alignment and create severe upper back, shoulder, neck and rib pain. This might be contributing to this chest/sternal area pain.\n\n",

My blood pressure was high also 146/100 (normal for me is 101/86) I went to the ER on saturday morning at about 8 am. They did an EKG which came back clear. The DR asked if I had ever done cocaine or been diagnosed with cancer and a few other questions. All the answers were no. I was treated with a Gi cocktail (if you never had one you don't want one  :(  ) it consisted of milk of magnesia and something to numb my throat and stomach. ( I can still taste it occasionally) They also gave me an IV dose of pepcid. After looking at everything the DR kept mentioning blood clot. They then sent me home with a script for ibuprofen. No other tests were run. I'm putting in a call to my PCP monday are there any tests I should ask for. I am a 30 yr old female who is active full time employed as a nurse aide. I am some what over weight bit don't really look it. I do smoke but less than half a pack a day (trying to quit).\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Casino,  In our countries (I\u2019m from Peru), thickening of the pleura in the apical region is a very common finding in an adult CXR. In low risk groups, and otherwise healthy persons, those lesions are frequently a sign of a past TB infection, now a non active lesion (an old scar).   It is important to know if you have a past or recent tuberculin skin test (PPD, Mantoux), and the results. If you do not have one, I strongly suggest you get one. In many countries is part of the requisites you need to accomplish for a job.  A practical guide, prepared by the American Thoracic Society and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and endorsed by the Infectious Disease Society of America, suggests that persons who are not likely to be infected with TB should generally not be tuberculin tested (only high prevalence and risk groups).  Persons born in countries with high prevalence of TB and/or have chest radiographs suggestive of old TB are considered in those high risk groups. Of course there are other explanations for a pleural scar, but if you are seeking for a job overseas, it is important to provide evidence that it\u2019s not active TB.  I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s only a scar, but just to be sure you cover up everything to achieve all your employer\u2019s prerequisites, ask your doctor about the skin test.  Sincerely,  Dr Torax\n\n",

    "title": "Can't take deep breath/mucus in throat",
    "content": "Hi,  After my last minor bout of laryngitis around Christmastime, I've continued to feel a bit of mucus/phlegm in my throat a lot, causing me to cough every now and then.  Starting a few days ago, I noticed that I would occasionally feel veyr slight difficulty breathing... That is, I could breath normally just fine, but now and then, I'd feel like taking a deep breath, and I found that I couldn't take a full deep breath.  After a certain point, I just can't breath in any more, and I feel a bit of pressure at my chest.  Again, I don't have any real trouble breathing normally, and I don't actually get SHORT of breath, so I don't think I'm in any immediate danger.  Some background:  I'm 24, and I've been recurring laryngitis sufferer since I was little.  (I used to get it every month or two when I was really little in Shanghai, but once I moved to the US at the age of 6, I haven't been getting it more than once a year.)  (I'm told it's laryngitis, anyway... my throat gets itchy and I get loud coughs.)  Anyway, these days, I'm usually able to mostly suppress it just by getting lots of sleep and drinking lots of water.  In any case, it usually goes away in a week or so, and I've NEVER had this can't-take-full-deep-breath symptom before.  I've never smoked, and I don't hang out with smokers often.  I have, however, been living in a new city since October.  In any case, since this is new, I'm a bit worried about whether I might have something serious like emphysema or something.  Unfortunately, I'm working abroad for a few months, and I won't have health insurance again until April or May.  So if anyone has any information for me, I'd be grateful.  Thank you so much!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for using our website.  You could be suffering from some kind of allergy. Your chronic long standing symptoms could be related to either allergic sinusitis or allergic rhinitis although i favour the former.   This is not related to your symptoms of not being able to take a deep breath. Not being able to take a very deep breath is normal because your lungs have that much capacity.   The problem is that this is new to you. Emphysema or chronic bronchitis or the combination of both are diagnosed on the basis of chronic productive cough (for at least 2 months of the year usually winter months) for at least 2 years. In addition you have to have some shortness of breath. Being 24 and not a smoker makes the diagnosis of emphysema very highty unlikely but not impossible. Young non-smokers can have emphysema if they have had asthma for a long time or if they have a condition known as alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Your symptoms do not correlate with either.  All it could be is just a lingering cold that could have affected your pleura (the membrane surrounding the lungs) and caused a little inflammation that should take its time and then you will be over it very shortly hopefully.  Once more, thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "title": "Difficulty Breathing, Heavy Chest & Mucus",
    "content": "I am a 25 year old student and over the last couple of months I have been suffering from panic attacks.  The doctors prescribed paxil and after two days, I had to drop the treatment all together becuase I was getting a strong disassociation and felt like even the 10mg was way too strong for me (perhaps I am sensetive to medications becuase I have had severely amplified side effects on a 6.75mg dose of clonazapan as well).    As I was sleeping, the first night I took paxil (mon), I noticed that I was waking up in the middle of the night (which I NEVER do) and I was breaking out into very slight hives and my skin was very itchy and prickly...as if further aggravation of any sort would make my skin welt.  This didn't happen the second or third day, but on thursday (2 days after I stopped the paxil), I started breaking out into hives and again, I woke up in the middle of the night becuase I felt like I couldn't breathe.  The doctors ruled out the possibility of an allergic reaction becuase it had been so long since I last took the paxil and it was a severe case of full blown hives.  The hives/itchy prickly skin went on for about 2 more days until it got a lot better and yesterday I had no such episodes.  All of a sudden today, however, I started getting the hives again with no evident trigger and I woke up twice as I was sleeping becuase I felt like I couldn't breathe and I kept coughing/spitting up mucus.  The reason I feel like the difficulty breathing/mucus is related to the hives is because just like the hives...it will come and go.  The hives/mucus usually get worse toward the evenings and worst at night.  Is it serious to feel like I can't breathe?  What could be the cuase of these hives (i.e. the paxil, stress) which usually lead to panic attacks/episodes?  What should I do next time this happens?    Oh, one more bit of info.  I am also a thyroid patient.  I've been taking 5mg of methimozole and my last bloodwork (2 weeks ago) indicated that I was hypothyroid.  I have taken methimozole with no reactions for over a year but yesterday when I took the methimozole...I kind of had a reaction where I felt like the medication was really strong...it was metabolizing really quickly and couldn't breathe etc.  I can't tell if I'm getting the hives becuase of the meds or if I'm having the reactions to meds on the days I'm getting the hives.   Is it possible that I am all of a sudden developing allergies to methimozole?  I am so frustrated and my doctors are really clueless.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

There were however, two instances in the past 3 months in which I have spit up large wads of neon green/yellow phlegm. And several times that I've spit up tiny balls of thick yellow green phlegm which to the touch feels very rubbery. As with the previous poster I have found streaks of egg-white colored substance in my the spit that feels like it's coming from the lungs, and on several occasions would find streaks or spots of blood. Not alot usually, it would contribute to maybe 5% of all the sputum coughed up.  I don't have a cough of any sort, however my chest would have a slightly sharp pain every now and then on one side, and there is a slight tightness that seems to keep me from a full capacity breath. I would breathe in normally and then at a third of the way to filling my lungs I can't seem to breathe in any more.  My heartbeat has also increased to an abnormal rate of a counted 80-95 beats a minute. I had gotten checked up 2 months ago and the doctor said I most likely was anxious.  I have a short history of smoking, I was an infrequent smoker, perhaps a pack a week, and I had only done so for less than a year before I quit. I had quit about 5-6 months ago and this problem with the breathing has fluctuated from better to worse about a month after quitting.  As said before, it was better then worse then better, where I feel Id be able breathe better, but not completely.\n\n",

If your cardiology workup is normal, and the pain doesn't present itself during periods of stress the one other suggestion I can give you is a dental exam to rule out any abnormalities as this will also cause that specific type of pain. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "content": "I had bornholm disease three months ago, I am 28 years old, female, and asthmatic. Yesterday i got hit with this major pain, that radiated through my lungs from underneath as though someone was driving a double edged meat hook through the left lung. It made my eyes water and carried on through the night. I took an arthrotex tab to ease it and it dulled to a throb. Its still here today. i can work with it, although it is still pretty intense. can borholm disease reoccur? I know that i need to go and see my doctor again. but i really don't want to unless I know that this is not just my asthma causing pain again. I had an echocardiogram three months ago and all was well. the pain does make my arm go tingly sometimes, but there is nothing in the heart area this time, its kinda jutting out from the mid ribcage at the back and just under my left breast. My ribs are also extremely sensitive and I woke up last night in a sweat. advice please?\n\n",

    "content": "Asthma doesnt cause that pain.  bornholm  disease is fairly rare.  Other causes like a pneumothorax need to be ruled out.  It is an acute infectious febrile disorder caused by a group B coxsackievirus and characterized by severe epigastric or thoracic pain. It can occur at any age but is most common in children. There is sudden onset of severe, frequently intermittent, often pleuritic pain in the epigastrium or lower anterior chest, with fever and often headache, sore throat, and malaise.  The disease usually goes away in 2 to 4 days, but relapse may occur within a few days and symptoms may continue or recur for several weeks. Having this happen a few months later means you should go back and see your doctor.\n\n",

I mentioned it to him, and he started talking about panic attacks, which I'm sure Im not having. My stress levels have if anything quartered in the last four months, i am fairly calm, even when my asthma is bad. I even take my B vits regularly. I'm happy, and calm, so I'm not convinced that they are panic attacks. Theres a further complication though, and its taht my medication is being upped for the asthma again. I've moved from 2nd to third level. So heavier steroids, more management. I think thats got him distracted at the mo. My Lung function was a 320 after 4 shots of ventolin. supposed to be 5 or something. Pain is still there. will talk to him again when he takes me off the prednisone.\n\n",

A friend of ours recently died from it and it was a horrible death.  I don't sleep much at night because I'm afraid he'll die in his sleep or go into a coughing fit and not be able to get enough air and sufficate.  The finger machine for O2 says he's getting enough O2 in his blood so the doc won't let him have O2 for at home use, but I feel he needs it to compensate for his constant coughing and SOB.  He uses cough drops like they are candy and at night he sometimes falls asleep with them in his mouth which concerns me also.  How much longer must he suffer before they do anything to help him?  He's 71yr young and still works a full time job but is breathless most the time.  Concerned in NV\n\n",

There is no medicine unfortunately that effectively decreases the amount of phlegm in chronic COPD.  Tiotropium (Spiriva) is an inhaler that is very important and if not prescribed (or Atrovent), then you need a referral to a pulmonologist.  To determine the severity of his COPD, he needs a spirometry test.  The patient blows into a tube and a computer calculates various things related to his air-flow.  This test cannot really predict how long someone will live; we now know that other factors are needs, such as his body weight, how short of breath he is (a special scale is used for this - a dyspnea score) and how far he can walk in 6 minutes.  These tests can be done by your pulmonologist specialist.  It is called a BODE index.  That number can help determine how far along his COPD is.\n\n",

    "title": "Pleurisy Question",
    "content": "Hello,        I have a question regarding pleurisy.  About two weeks ago I went to my physician because of a problem getting a full breath.  Taking in a deep breath led to a feeling like something was stopping my breath short of completion.  My doctor examined me, had a chest X-Ray done, and also did a blood test; which I believe was basic blood count test.  The tests came back fine  and he told me I had pleurisy.  He said it was  probably from a viral infection; he had ruled out bacterial.  I figured this was probably right as I was starting to get a pain behind my shoulder blades and some tenderness in the ribs that I had experienced in years past when I had pleurisy-like symptoms.  I have pretty bad allergies and when the spring/summer starts  here in Louisville, KY I often get respiratory infections of some kind.  The doc gave me some Allegra, for allergies, and told me to take Ibuprofen for pleurisy pain.  I followed this advice.  About three days later I noticed that I was getting pains farther down the back, where I would think the kidneys are, and also in the stomach, specifically about two to three inches to the left of my navel.  It's sort of a dull, sore pain, but can be more burning if I move certain ways.  If I'm totally still it doesn't bother me much.  I type for my job, so I'm often crunched over a keypad, which may make it worse.  Anyways, I went back to my physician last weekend, just to make sure it wasn't something else.  He did some bloodwork again.  I was running a low-grade fever, 99.1, which I couldn't even tell I had.  The bloodwork came out fine again.  He also had a urinalysis done to make sure there was no kidney infection.  He said it came out fine.  My breathing problem has about cleared up.  It's much better.  I was wondering though about the soreness.  Is it normal to last a bit?  And is stomach pain common with pleurisy?  I have never had it before.  Of course the doctor was vague, because he wasn't really sure what kind of viral infection it was.  He said sometimes they can last weeks.               Thanks,                           Kevin\n\n",

To answer your question, well for me anyway was that since it was painful to breath at times and in certain positions like sitting down over a keyboard that my diaphram basically took over in my controlled breathing. Basically I was using the muscles in my stomach and side to inhale rather than my chest. Which allowed some air to get into my stomach causing pressure and pain as it worked itself out. When my allergies was under control as well as the coughing, the pluersy finally went away and I was able to breath normally again. So the muscles I was using to breath with,  was no longer needed as the main source of my breathing so  they cramped up causing me pain. So basically I had to recondition my body on how to  breath. I hope this helps.\n\n",

    "title": "undiagonosed breathing problem ct, xray, echo performed",
    "content": "Hi, thank you in advance for your time. I am frustrated by lack of diagnosis and would appreciate any quidance and \"guesswork' as to diagnosis.  History: In the first week of Nov. I had a fever and cough. It was diagnosed as pneumonia. The fever subsided but cough continued. The cough continued through out the month of Dec leading my PCP to refer to pulmonologist. The pulmonologist tested me for asthma with metholcoline (sp?) response test. I reacted at 19percent. The Dr. said this was not quite the threshold for asthma (i had been on predisone the week before). The pulmonologist/Dr.referred me for ct scan, eventhough, each x ray (4) were clear except for the first one (\"whcih was of poor quality\"-Dr.). In early Jan. the Dr. called in to hear the ct report and said he was not concerned but there was something found in the upper lobe, a very small something (can't remember his exact words). He believed it was probably a sign from the pneumonia, but he had some suspicion of TB. He said he would review the actual ct scan results and call me if he beleived I needed further testing. I never heard from him. I went along still coughing once or twice a day, but figured things were ok and would resolve.   In first week of June I went back to the pulmonolgist with shortness of breath, mostly upon exertion, and coughing (2-3 times a day, and possibly once at night). My coughing has most always produced a white sputum. The reason i went to see him is the shortness of breath in the recent weeks and a couple of times at night I woke up wheezing (expiration) and coughing with difficult breathing-this seems to be aided/resolved with albuterol.  Anyway, the pulmonologist ordered an xray whcih was clear then scheduled an echo. The echo was normal. He ruled out TB saying that it would have shown up on hte xray now if it was what caused the tree-in-bud ct scan finding. I subsequently was tested for TB on my own - just in case. It was negative. So now I am still without a diagnosis and spent a two or three thousand on testing with no diagnosis. He has given me some Advair in case I do have asthma, but it seems to have little impact on shortness of breath.   -I am: 6ft1, 400lbs -I take: prilosec, synthroid -My oxygen level is always 99=100 on the thingy they put on your finger for the reading -My blood work has been \"unremarkable\" during all of this. -I don't have a fever. -No night sweats. -The pilosec has helped indigestion immensely, however my shortness of breath persists. -I still feel like if there is something infectious that it is in my right side. I don't have pain, I just sense something is there. -non-smoker (use smokeless tobacco though) - blood pressure is usually suprisingly OK  125/80 - I am being referred for sleep apnea testing, but the only real symptom of suspicion in unrestful sleep - I am not overly sleepy during the day.   I am sure I forgot somethign. Please ask if you need further info. to assist.  Questions:  1. What would you suspect is causing these shortness of breah symptoms? 2. What/who should i do/see next? 3. Does a clear xray in June rule out any infectious cause of the Dec. CT scan result?   thanks again for any guidance!\n\n",

    "content": "If you don't smoke and you have a normal cxr (which is basically like your xray), the 2 most lilkely diagnoses is asthma or refux (from the stomach, for which you re on protonix).  The other cause of your symptoms is post-nasal drip.  These three diagnoses (drip, reflux, asthma) account for 92% of ALL COUGH in nonsmokers with a normal chest xray! The fact that you wake up at NIGHT with shortness of breath makes asthma very high on the list.  Also, many people with astham have cough as the only symptom.  I would take the advair but you need to take it twice a day - you will not notice much for at least the first week or 2, but keep taking it religiously.  If there is no effect at all after a few weeks, it may be the refux.  You can go to twice a day for the protonix (or prilosec) or you can get a test called a 24-hour pH monitor to really nail down the diagnosis. If you have pot-nasal drip, a steroid inhaler (like flonase) is a must - and will clear it up in a week. The meth challenge of 19% is POSITIVE.  All you need is a 12-15% change for the test to be considered positive.  It would also be useful to know how many doses of methcholine it took before your irways reated t 19%.\n\n",

I have never had a pulmonary function test, so thank you and I will have one done. I sound like I ran a marathon when i go to the mail box or walk up the stairs in my house.  I do not have asthma, it runs heavily in my family and it's been ruled out year ago. The mucous bubbles have been going on a very long time, the shortness of breath has been rapid the last 5 or less years.  Again thank you and I will have the lung disfunction test, maybe it's something similar to asthma. No one i know with asthma coughs up this bibble.\n\n",

    "content": "Sarcoid has made itself known in a few members of my family including one of my sons.  I had a sis who had such a pronounced case she perished of complications from it.  I am having breathing problems ... Not getting enough air at times or just exhausted by climbing 6 stairs.  I use eye drops and at times when I have to hold my headback to instill the drops I find myself breathless.  I can hold my breath for about 25 seconds and even while i'm at rest I sometimes need to find a breath of air.   I do at times have pressure in my chest that seems to abate when I press the place of the pressure ... which is never severe or painful, just annoying.  My Dr. had me do scans for mediastinal widening but the scans can back \"No significant abnormality.\"  My question is: How pronounced does Sarcoid need be to be diagnosed with it?  Can it be so slight that it could be mistaken for something else?  Thank you!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi! Do doctors answer our questions, or is this forum just people talking about their problems? I have something very bizarre to ask;  Sometimes I'll take a bite of food, and within seconds I suddenly am completely unable to breathe. I can not take a breath no matter how hard I try, and the only remedy is taking a drink. This happens before I even swallow the food. After I take the drink, I can breathe again, and the weirdest part is, I can continue eating the food without it happening again! That leads me to believe that it's not an allergy. This happens with all kinds of foods; it happened yesterday after tasting cake batter! That time was the worse one ever; after I quickly got a drink, I should have been able to inhale again, but I nearly couldn't, and a loud noise emmited from my throat, like a strangled gasp. It makes no sense to me, and it's scary. It's happened from eating a gumball out of the old gumball machines, purple grapes, chocolate covered cherries, and yesterday's incident was fruitcake batter. Anyone have any idea? Is it possible that there's one particular thing in those foods that I'm allergic to, and I'm experiencing a 'mild' anaphylaxic reaction? The thing is, the fruitcake batter was made from scratch, not a cake mix; there was no preservatives or junk in it. I'd really appreciate an answer from someone, lol. I have no health insurance, so seeing a doctor is not possible for me.   Thanks very much!\n\n",

    "content": "Deana, It doesn t look like you have an anaphylactic reaction. It looks more like a behavioural or psychological problem. It is also known as phagophobia (fear of swallowing).  The treatment of choice is to find a good behavioral or cognitive behavioral therapist who can help you deal with this problem. Basically you want help to identify and challenge your anxious thoughts and how your anxious thoughts contribute to your fear. More importantly though, you want to unlearn your fear by gradually approaching the foods that are difficult for you to eat.   In behavioral treatment to overcome this kind of learned fear, you would be asked to make a list of foods that you currently can eat and what you cannot, then your therapist would help you to gradually approach the foods and situations that you fear. Typically people start by eating things like thin milkshakes and clear soups, work their way up through pureed fruit and soups, babyfood and very wet (soggy) cereal, and then gradually expose themselves to slightly less \"liquid\" and more chewy food, and finally things like toast, french fries, peanut butter and \"dry\" cereal. If there is no behavior  or cognitive behavioral treatment available where you live, you could use the Panic Program to help you with this. Basically you want to expose yourself to eating for 1/2 hour or an hour per day, the way somebody else might have to expose themselves to driving or riding in elevators. It is a tough go, for sure, but it works. The secrets are to start out with foods that are doable right now (even if it isn't easy),  and make sure your physician knows what is going on for you.\n\n",

I'm just a lay person and it seems obvious to me that you have a psychological problem.    Maybe you saw one too many episodes of \"Fear Factor\" or you almost choked to death in childhood and repressed it.  Whatever has caused you to react at certain times in this manner is in your mind.  The raspy voice afterwards is not a determining factor to prove the doctor wrong nor does it prove you right.  The mind is a wonderful machine ... capable of taking over and defending you when you least expect it.  And, without your knowledge.  No dear, don't waste your money on insurance.\n\n",

    "content": "Before something is chalked up as being psychological, it is important to rule out more serious things.  If you have trouble swallowing, this may be because a. there is a psychological problem with initiating swllowing (see above messages), b. there is a problem near the vocal cords (like vocal cord spasm - i.e. the food triggers the vocal cords and air flow stops.  But  it may be more serious, such as something partially ostructing the airway or even the esophagus (swallowing tube), such as a tumor.  This is not likely, but I thought it would not be fair to say it's \"all in your mind\" without mentioning ome these more serious possibilities.  You should see a doctor.  If, for instance, he/she hears wheezing over your trachea, you may have something that an ear-nose-throat octor would nee to look at....\n\n",

I have never smoked cigarette's but I'm afraid I have smoked 5-6 joints every night for the past 10 years thinking they helped me relax and helped me get to sleep, but in actual fact it was just nicotene addiction. Now I know smoking a joint (due to no filter) is apparantly the same as smoking 3-4 cigarette's... So I guess I've been quite a heavy smoker for 10 years.  I stopped smoking a week ago after watching a DVD (The Easy Way To Stop Smoking by Allan Carr) I would say gave up smoking, but in fact I haven't actually given anything up (if a smoker thinks they are depriving themselves of something then it only makes it more precious...)  Anyway, I broke the 3 day barrier (the worst bit) and now physical cravings have gone and I know I'll never smoke again. I'm just worried about the damage I've done to my lungs....  Now I swim regularly and never have any breathing problems, out of breathness etc. However I know my lung capacity is not what it used to be. I assumed over the past week I'd cough up the cr*p from lungs due to them cleaning themselves (the body is so remarkable!) but nothing...! : (  Anyway my main question is there anything I can do (apart from exercise) to speed up the removal of cr*p from my lungs?... ie. would taking a bronchial dilator help at all?...

There is phlegm/mucus that builds up in my throat and I start to cough/spit it out...the problem with that is, while I'm coughing out the junk in my throat, my nose also clogs up and I can't breathe.  Once I finish coughing I can blow my nose....the color of the mucus started 3 weeks ago as clear with  some yellow occasionally, but now the mucus is a very dark yellow with small amounts of blood or another red substance.  Only on 1 occasion did I blow my nose and had green mucus.  I've looked in my throat and I can tell it's a little raw from all the coughing, and I have a headache for a while after a coughing spell.  Other than that I suffer no pain.  I've been drinking hot tea, eating my oranges, using Vicks VaporRub, taking Day/NyQuil, and even kept away from all dariy products.  What else can I do?  My mother originally thought that I was just dealing with a normal cold or possibly the flu, but now I'm not sure.  Please help me!\n\n",

I have stress incontinence (that's when you urinate when you cough, right?), pain in my lower ribs, and still no sleep.  I don't have fever.  In fact, I'm very far from fever because my temperature hasn't gone above 97.7.  I'm not one too make a big deal over colds and stuff, but the lack of sleep is really getting to me, and I'm very surprised that antibiotic didn't help.  I've been on antibiotic once or twice before in my entire life, so I doubt I could have developed a reistance.  Did I even have bronchitis?  What's going on?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi!  Because many serious diseases of the lower respiratory tract causes cough, bronchitis is considered a diagnosis of exclusion. That is, only after ruling out every other possibilities can one diagnose bronchitis in anyone. What are the investigations done by your doctor before coming to the conclusion of bronchitis?   Among otherwise healthy individuals, antibiotics have NOT demonstrated any consistent benefit in the symptomatology or natural history of acute bronchitis. Antibiotics are recommended to patients with bronchiectasis (permanently dilated bronchioles due to chronic bronchitis) or COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, a chronic type of bronchitis associated with cigarette smoking) exacerbation or if purulent (pus filled)sputum production has lasted beyond 7 days without evidence of improvement to other conventional therapy.  By conventional therapy one means the use of cough medications, antipyretics (meds to decrease fever/pain), analgesics (pain relievers), chest physiotherapy, steam inhalation, etc.  In my opinion, steam inhalation is the best house-hold remedy. A steam vaporizer besides your bed while asleep would be a good idea. With the temperatures now diving in NY, much warmth and hot drinks should help too.  Now that one round of antibiotics (for 10 days) has not helped you, it would be pertinent that you discuss regarding culture and sensitivity of your respiratory secretions with your doctor, if not already done. So also a chest X-ray. A complete blood count may indicate the presence of eosinophilia pointing to asthma.  Hope this helps.  Warm regards,  Bill\n\n",

One of the best household remedies for cough that I would vote for would be steam inhalation several times a day. Over-the-counter cough remedies may be tried along with steam inhalation. Tylenol might help the fever. Do you smoke? Have you had your flu shot? Depending on the illness that you might have, your doctor may decide upon antibiotics or antiviral medicines.  In all probabilities you have a respiratory tract infection, but only a clinical examination can tell the probable diagnosis.  I hope this helps,  Warm regards,  - Bill\n\n",

After many trips to the ER and always a diagnosis of an anxiety attack and twice that 'my rapid weight loss was putting pressure on my chest', I learned to overcome the chest pain to where i wouldn't have a full blown anxiety attack.  The thing is... I get this chest pain sometimes when I'm sitting there watching tv or playing a game on the computer... not at all in a situation that would trigger an anxiety attack.  I've even gotten chest pain while i was sleeping bad enough to wake me.  I'm afraid that there may be something else wrong the doctors just haven't looked for.  I've had two EKG's done in the ER... once when I was 16 and once recently when I had broncitis. Both were normal.   I've never had any further testing done from a doctor.  Is it possible the ER could have overlooked something further testing could pick up on?  I'm scared I'll have a stroke or heart attack one day, as it runs rampid in my family and I've been diagnosed as 'obese' almost my entre life.  PLEASE HELP!  I'm tired of being scared at every pang that I may be dying.  Am I looking into things or should I request they look into this chest pain?  It goes so far as me actually having pain in my arms and neck, or where I feel 'weak' and numb in my legs.  I've noticed that when I eat healthier (going on and off diets) I tend to get pain in my chest less often.  Is this all in my head?  And if so why while I'm sleeping?  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Stormyluv, Chest pain is always a serious complaint. It seems that your doctors haven't taken it lightly either, they have requested an EKG and that came out normal. Chest pain can be caused by many things, such as diseases of the esophagus and stomach. Ofcourse, like you said, the main concern is that its caused by a problem in the heart. Usually we categorize patients with chest pain as high and low risk (risk of having a heart problem). Your age ofcourse, is favourable but your obesity and your family history are a bit scary. Your doctors have determined that for now you have a healthy heart. Your only therapy for now is primarily weight loss. A recent very large study compared 4 common diet regimes available on the market and found that all of them reduced risk of heart disease.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "mystocks, Honestly it is very difficult to judge from the story you tell. It could be a whole range of things. The urge to spit could be psychogenic as a result of throat infection or many of the other causes. If the blood comes out after repeated forceful attempts at spitting, then it could be the result of excessive force leading to small blood vessel injury. Instead of delving into the many causes of this condition I think it would be best that she be examined by an Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) doctor.\n\n",

    "title": "Possible Allergy to Exercise??????",
    "content": "Hello out there.  I really could use some help, please.  Recently, I've been trying to workout more strenuously and regularly.   At the end of last year, I got really sick with salmonella and was hospitalized for two weeks.  I was vommiting and more.  Therefore I lost an absurd amount of weight and now I'm in the process of really trying to put it back on and turn it into muscle.  Here in lies the problem. When I exercise strenuously, I seem to develop a severe headache either during or anywhere up to hours later.  It's a pounding headache that makes me feel nauseous.  Usually, I wind up vommiting violently for hours after and the headache will continue through the night and eventually go away. The exercise I'm doing isn't anything out of the ordinary, nor is it that extreme that it warrants this.  I also notice that I seem to sweat profusely from my face, almost like in buckets.  It only takes about a minute in for this to happen.  I never see anyone sweat from the face like this. I also seem to get really hot and overheated very quickly while doing any physical activity. Also, if I'm out in the heat and sun for a few hours, that sometimes does the same thing to me.  Later I will develop the pounding headache and evetually I will get sick.      I read online that this could be an allergy to exercise, but the people who have that seem to get hives or their throat constricts.  I don't seem to have that problem.    I've ignored this issue for so long, but now I feel I no longer can.  I need to know what's wrong and what I can do to mitigate it.  I just want to be able to exercise like a normal human-being and be able to go walking outside on a hot summer's day without worrying that I will be sick like a dog all throught the night just because of one half-hour.  I really would like to get myself healthy and need as much help as possible.  Please help!!!!  Thank you so very much.     -  C\n\n",

I'm not quite sure it's dehydration though because I figured the same awhile ago and I load up on water when working out, before and after.  Somehow, I still just wind up getting sick and vommiting that up too later.  I agree that my symptoms definitely fit the description of dehydration, but I'm not sure it's that because of my experience.  Again, I am very grateful that you took the time to reply to my inquiry.  Thank you.      - C\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Shoejr, Sorry to hear about the pains. Chest pain is usually a difficult task to tackle. The list of causes is enormous. The right thing to do ofcourse is to rule out the more dangerous causes e.g. heart disease, which is what your doctor did. The cause of chest pain could arise from any of the tissues that make up the chest wall or could be referred from some other problem e.g. neck problems (osteoarthrosis of the cervical joints) or it could be a psychological problem (anxiety). The list is too large that merely stating it here would'nt be so useful.  Did your doctor order a chest x-ray? if he did how did it turn up?\n\n",
