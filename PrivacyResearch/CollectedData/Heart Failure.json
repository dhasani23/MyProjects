    "content": "Hello Patrick -- While the symptoms may be coincidental, they also could be related to right heart failure, so yes, I think it would be prudent to let the doctor know about this. If he feels it's irrelevant it probably is. If not then he'll want to take a closer look. Its difficult to say from a distance whether or not this is actually related to the defective valve, but it could be, and that's reason enough to let your doctor know.   Hope this helps. Good luck to you and please keep us updated.\n\n",

Its been over a year now and i still haven't seen a cardiologist even after being diagnosed with severe TR 8 months ago. I'm still getting the occasional onset of chest pain and wary as you that this is onset of heart failure what should i do ?  Thanks Patrick Lee\n\n",

    "content": "Heart failure isn't often heralded by chest pain, but some of the other symptoms could possibly be related. However, when one develops CHF the most significant features would be profound fatigue, shortness of breath and swelling in the calves, ankles and feet. Watch out for this triad of symptoms to be sure, but the rest is unlikely to be CHF related. It's great a heart attack was ruled out, but the real concern is potentially progressive failure of that valve, which should be followed by a specialist. I'm not sure how you'd go about instigating the next level of care, since no one is looking at what should be the center of attention right now. However, absent the three major symptoms listed above, you're probably not in CHF, so rest easy for now. Again, if all three should show up -- and persist -- then by all means bring this to the attention of your doctor promptly.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -- Cocaine is highly unpredictable, which means, from a medical point of view it is impossible to tell you whether or not this attempt would be certain to succeed. What you must also understand, however, is that we are sworn to keep people well and work to preserve lives, not end them. We are not in the business of giving advice on how to commit suicide. That said, it's clear you are deeply distraught and acknowlege mental illness. This is a serious-enough situation and first off I must tell you, for your own welfare (assuming you were to go through with this attempt) that because of the unpredictability of cocaine effect on any given individual, this amount might only achieve for you what's happened with previous attempts, it may not even get you to that point, or it could, worst case, cause a sufficiently prolonged heart stoppage to leave you alive but in a brain-damaged, perhaps vegetative, state. You could well wind up conscious and aware but unable to communicate or otherwise express your feelings or wishes. This obviously is a non-starter for someone seeking to escape life's problems via suicide. The risk of failure or worse is far too great. The very fact you have been successfully resucitated in the past proves the current idea has a great chance of not only failing but of possibly making your situation infinitely worse. As an alternative I'd suggest a deal wherein you agree to a new arrangement for treatment of your mental illness (I assume you've been through therapy and other disciplines already and haven't had much success). The fact that it's called mental illness implies the potential for a cure, which could result in a happy or at least satisfactory life. I would strongly urge you to engage with us here in some steps toward finding a better solution to the pain you're feeling right now. The cocaine approach really is a wildly unpredictable one and as I said earlier, could result in a situation far worse than you can even imagine. Please do us the kindness of talking to us here about what's been tried in the past and what seems to be the central mental issue, given you have been through enough real-life stressors to make you feel despondent and hopeless recently anyway. What you must realize is that we all have things like this we deal with. Taking your own life doesn't make the world a better place. This is your challenge. I hope you'll take it up and at least consider the potential horrors of a failed cocaine overdose.  My best to you. Please stay in touch here. We do this work for a reason. Right now you are the reason.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -- While testosterone generally is safe for most people to use, given your unusual cardiac history and how you got it, I would definitely recommend you have clearance by a cardiologist before resuming use of testosterone. If this is a problem then it is really a problem, since testosterone was a companion to other hormones (steroids) which caused the very serious problem you now have \"under control.\" You can't afford to embark on any self-medication. You need to let yourself be guided by a cardiologist when considering embarking on any new chemical enhancements.  Straight up. Don't fool around. Hope this is helpful. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "I have been prescribed methylphenidate since I was 8 years old. It started a 5 mg,  and now I am being prescribed 20 mg sr and 10 mg immediate release. I am 32 years old and have basically been abusing it since I was around 17. I snort it up my nose everyday - all day. I don't take the prescribed amount; I take about 40 to 50 milligrams everyday up my nose. This has been going on since I first started college. Besides the anxiety attacks that I'm positive this abuse is responsible for, I've been diagnosed with cardiac arrhythmia at about 24. My father was a cardiovascular surgeon at that time and wasn't aware of my abuse of Ritalin. I told no one. When I was diagnosed, my Dad prescribed me Atenolol (50 mg). The only time I ever use it is when I periodically visit my GP because the nurse always checks my blood pressure (which almost always turns out to be 120/80). Although I know the blood pressure machines in grocery stores and drugstores aren't very accurate, it usually turns out to be around 175/115.I've even had an EKG and angiogram done recently because my doctor, after some testing, said I might have had a heart attack in the past.  I took Atenolol before both tests when taken again and the results turned out normal.  I write you this because I just checked my pulse today and my heart rate (without Ritalin) is \u201cskipping beats.\u201d Bump - bump - nothing for 5 seconds, then bump - bump again. I have also had trouble breathing (periodically) for years. I have to take deep breaths and hold it in for a while and exhale - although I don't if know that has anything to do with the cardiovascular system. Anyway, besides the obvious advice - stop abusing methylphenidate, do you think this is the main cause of the symptoms I've described? The breathing trouble is starting to concern me. Your time and advice is much  appreciated.\n\n",

My suggestion to you is go to your primary care provider without taking the atenolol to cover up the symptoms and be perfectly honest with him or her about what's going on with you. The only way for anyone to help you is if you are straight up and honest with them. The result of your continued use of the medication in the manner you are using it could end up much more serious than the symptoms you are experiencing. You have to take the first step in admitting that you have a problem and seriously reach out for help. For me or anyone else to say \"quit\" is easy and not the answer. I would suggest that you also call a prescription drug abuse help line in your area of residence for assistance. Best wishes! Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  First, my sincerest sympathies regarding the loss of your sister. This had to be a tremendous shock and I am terribly sorry.   What happened to your sister was that an abnormality in a renal artery, probably present early in life, caused a problem that would rarely produce any symptoms and so would not have likely been discovered except by accident or blind luck. These things are very rare, and so virtually impossible to predict. It is not a heart problem, but also not a problem of the kidney, but rather a vascular one, a defect of the renal artery that happened to service one kidney, and which branches directly off the aorta, the largest blood vessel in the body. This could be due to a familial trait of some sort, and just to be safe, any siblings, you included, should be screened by ultrasound for a possible aortic aneurysm, which is where most of these form, with the very rare exception of one in one of the renal branches.   I hope this helps answer your question and please follow up here with any other questions you may have. Again, my deepest sympathies for your loss. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "My mother, now 48, had a minor heart attack nearly three years ago.  She was not overweight, nor did she have high cholesterol or hypertension.  She was treated and released.  Ever since then she has complained of constant fatigue and a constant pain, in her back, between her shoulder blades.  Subsequent EKGs came out normal.  A few months ago she experienced an incredible amount of pain in her chest, felt faint but did not go to the hospital. During those months she has been going to sleeping around twelve or so hours a day but still wakes up fatigued. She went to her cardiologist and had an EKG done.  The office called her back and claimed everything was fine except for some plaque buildup.  A few days later her family doctor called her and said her heart is enlarged (left side) and questioned why her cardiologist did not find this in the EKG.  He prescribed lisinopril.  She claims to be feeling better, no more pressure on her chest or chest pain, but still has constant pain between her shoulder blades and on her left shoulder blade, that subsides when she lies down but persists after being in a standing or sitting position for what anyone would consider a normal or moderate amoutn of time. She thinks it could be related to work (she is a CNA) but I disagree.   I am literally at wit's end.  I worry to a ridiculous disagree about her condition and her cardiologist not catching her enlarged heart terrifies me.  She is going for a sleep study tonight and I demanded she ask her doctor about congestive heart failure and all of her persistent symptoms.   I guess my question or questions are: is she experiencing congestive heart failure? what more can be done in terms of treatment or therapy?  should she see another cardiologist? could she be experiencing the beginnings of another heart attack?

    "title": "Re: Constant back pain after enlarged heart diagnosis",
    "content": "Hi there -  Your mother is experiencing some very suggestive symptoms, both  of probable ischemia due to some coronary artery disease (that \"plaque buildup\" her cardiolgist didn't seem very concerned about, even though she's already had one myocardial infarction -- MI), and possibly of congestive heart failure (CHF) as well. While the latter is one possibility -- and with an enlarged left ventricle it is fairly likely -- the pain is  not even especially atypical (women often experience heart pain in more diffuse and  atypical ways and areas) and should be a red flag especially in someone with a prior MI.   The cardiologist's cavalier assessment (he knows she has some \"plaque buidup\" because of having looked at an EKG?) and failure to make the connection between established heart disease (which he apparently acknowleges, but hasn't tested for adequately) and new chest pain (any thoracic pain suspected of being caused by heart disease may be  called \"chest pain\" as shorthand for cardiac pain) really concerns me. Your mother's fatigue and need for extra sleep could be due to something else, but with that apparently enlarged left ventricle it's probably at least in part due to CHF, which should be treated. She  also needs to have an angiogram (even if she had one during her original heart attack) to determine the extent of her disease and to help put together a treatment plan. She should probably be on a beta blocker at least, and if she's in CHF there are more choices in terms of which beta blocker, as some work  better for this than the usual ones.  I hope this is helpful to you. I'm very glad your mother has you as an advocate. It's important,  especially since medical people are often the most likely to deny a serious problem because of their work ethic. Please do continue to encourage her to get this fully worked up. Something is definitely wrong. What it is and to what extent it's wrong is all that's left to determine. Then it can be treated.   Good luck to the both of you, and please follow up with us here.\n\n",

About 4 months ago a very minor exertion resulted in a broken bone and in the last month also a further break for a minor incident. In october she was diagnosed to have osteoporosis and given calcium that she couldn't take as it made her sick so she now stopped.  The cough, weight loss, nausea etc has continued and worsened. About november blood tests came back broadly normal but with signs of start of stones in kidney. Symptoms continued and she ended up in hospital on boxing day for a week almost comatose at first and with this nasty fluidy cough.  They now say she has congestive heart failure (CHF) and have her on furosemide and bisoprolol to which she is responding but I think the congestive heart failure is a symptom or result of a long term untreated hyperparathyroidism (HPT).  However neither she nor her doctors will look into HPT but only are treating the CHF. I understand that in 7-12 % of cases of HPT disease the patients' blood tests never show significantly elevated HPT or calcium but they are hard to diagnose. Am I right to suspect HPT? How do we get people to look into HPT as well as only looking at CHF.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  Your mother certainly does fit the profile for HPT, and has many of the collective signs and symptoms. As to why this hasn't been explored, it's difficult to know, but it is often overlooked, especially in patients who are seen as \"older\", even though your mother isn't especially old by  today's standards. Unfortunately, physical condition is often used as the measure of \"age.\" Since your mother came in already in rough condition, she may be seen as older than she actually is, and HPT may not be considered worth the effort, since the only thing that isn't being done for her now that would be done otherwise would be surgery on the hyperthyroid, which in the past was generally neglected as a therapy. It's done more often now, and though it is difficult to guess how this might affect the course of her illness, it seems not unreasonable, and  since everything else being done would be done for someone with HPT, it should be almost the default diagnosis.   All that considered, I would think the best way to get someone to consider HPT would be to be a pest and advocate for your mother and aggressively insist on a PTH immunoessay being done to find out if she has it or not. Then, if positive, the potential for surgery would have to at least be discussed.   I hope this is helpful to you. Please follow up with us as needed, and update us if anything changes. Good luck to you and to your mother.\n\n",

    "content": "My father recently suffered a hypertension stroke and underwent an endarterectomy on the right carotid 95%blockage (left side pending 85% blockage). Everything seems to be fine except for an isolated red patch under his chin about four inches in diameter.

    "content": "Hello -  This numb spot is very likely related to the endartectomy, but when it happens (which is rarely) it is usually due to injury to a nerve during the procedure and I can't imagine how it could physiologically be a vascular complication. If it is a nerve injury it shouldn't worsen, but should be checked anyway, just for the sake of making sure everything is right. There's no reason to have to deal with this sort of problem if it can be corrected (the biggest hazard I can think of is injuring one's self while shaving, due to lack of sensation in the area), but it should  be recorded anyway as part of the medical record, even if it winds up being a permanent issue.

    "title": "Re: Is it possible to Code while on life support?",
    "content": "Hello -  It is technically possible to code while on life support, although it's kind of a grey area. If the heart stops producing its own sinus impulse, eventually, over a period of anywhere from a few seconds to a few hours, the heart will stop beating on its own. \"Life support\" generally means maintaining artificial mechanical respiration, which tends to give the heart an atrial \"kick\" and keep it beating, but if the sinus node fails, and the ventricles then slowly fail also, once cardiac activity stops and is unexpected and unplanned (depending upon whether the patient had a \"do not resucistate\" -- DNR -- or not) the code is called. Otherwise it's considered that the patient simply \"expired.\" The result is the same if there is a DNR order or if the heart's electrical system simply won't respond anymore.   If there is no DNR and the patient's heart is restarted, it is a code with successful resucitation.  As I said, it's something of a grey area, as some people mean by \"coded\" that the heart stopped, which is entirely possible while on life support.   I hope this answers your question and reassures your friend.\n\n",

I have 2 questions.  1)  Is 9,000 ng/ml an extremely high level that could be serious cocern for heart or kidney failure?  2)  Based on the level of cocaine in his screening, how much cocaine could one assume he does on a daily basis (preferably in grams)  FYI,  he is 6' down to 140lbs, daily user for 5 years, progressed from cocaine to crack cocaine in past year, and drinks alcohol with crack/cocaine.  I already know that any cocaine use is cause for serious concern, and I already know he needs help.  What I don't know is he a walking time bomb?  Knowing the level of cocaine in his system could one expect him to go into cardiac arrest at anytime?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Amount of Cocaine in system cause Heart Failure?",
    "content": "Hello -  The figure you provide is necessarily taken out of context, since we can't know with certainty when the last time was that cocaine was used. I can tell you that a surgical dose (for purposes of local anesthesia) will peak at 6700 ng/ml within one hour in lab test subjects. The same dose is almost gone in 48-72  hours. So we can conclude either a nasal dose greater than 1.5 mg had been (probably) inhaled within an hour previous, or that a much larger amount was used at a somewhat earlier time. At any rate, tolerance of the drug varies from one individual to the next, and while overwhelmingly high doses can be patently lethal, any dose can, at any given time (but especially after chronic use) cause severe and life-threatening medical problems. The more often it is used, the greater the statistical risk of a coronary event or other dangerous medical situation. Sudden cardiac arrest is an ever-present risk with any cocaine user. It is more random than Russian roulette.  A good example of the unpredictability of idiosyncratic response to cocaine use would be the tragic death of college star and NBA 1st-round draft pick Len Bias, in 1986, who,  after his first use of cocaine (although it may have been taken more than once during the evening) was also his last. Some people tolerate it for varying lengths of time. Some,  however, will suffer a terminal event the first time. So every cocaine user is a potential \"time bomb.\" There is no safe limit, there are only more unsafe ones.   Since the person in question has been developing a tolerance for (or increased yen for the pleasure of) cocaine to the extent of now using the crack form, and because he is drinking with it, he is probably on a terminal course already. The various potential dangers multiply with time, increase in use, etc. An intervention would be not only appropriate but possibly life-saving.  I hope this is helpful to you in evaluating your plans to deal with this individual's problem. This is always an emergency; let us hope it doesn't become a sudden medical crisis or worse. Good luck to you. Please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 26 year-old male. Two times in the last couple of months, I experienced strange heart problems. The symptoms are the following:  - my heart once or twice beats a large one that I can clearly feel as abnormal - soon after I feel cold, like if I had a fever, but my temperature is normal - and sometimes I'm short on breath  The first time I experienced this I went to the emergency room right away, and they told me I have pericarditis. The prescribed medication kind of worked; for a long time I felt good. A few weeks ago, however, the symptoms of pericardtitis came back; with the exception that now it effects my entire left side, including my arm. Most of the time it results in a dull uncomfortable feeling around my heart and in my left armpit.   Today, however, I experienced the same abnormal heart beat and cold-sweat kind of symptoms as once before. It went away in about an hour, but it worries me if it is something serious.  Just for the record, I often feel weak, though it may be the result of the lack of proper exercise. I also have high blood-cholesterol and I am under a lot of stress. The positive side of things are that I am not overweight, and I do not drink alcohol, nor smoke. Also, I had three EKG in the past few months, since I started having problems, and all three were good.  My question is that what can cause my symptoms and how can I prevent it? Also, if someone has high blood cholesterol, can that person reverse the damage with proper life changes, or only prevent it from worsening?  Thank you very much!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Chest pain, sudden feeling of cold",
    "content": "Hi,  Sorry for a late answer but yours is a good question and I feel I can clear a lot of air here about cholesterol, chest pain and irregular heart beats.  Almost every human being on this earth gets an occasional Skipped beat or what you call a 'large one' once in a while. It is entirely benign and does not indicate any serious heart disease. So apart from its nuisance value of causing undue anxiety in the person, it is of no importance.  How were you diagnosed to have a 'pericarditis? Pericarditis is an inflammation of the covering membrane of the heart, often associated with a fluid collection too. Most common cause is Viral infection, second one is tuberculosis. The patient would be having severe chest pain, increased in getting up from bed or bending forward while sitting. There would be fever. Shortness of breath. severe fatigue. The EKG will show classic upward concave ST elevation. The Echo will show fluid collection if any. The treatment of pericarditis is a long drawn out one. Viral pericarditis involves administration of strong anti inflammtory drugs, Cholchicine, steriods etc. Tubercle pericarditis calls for 9-12 month course of anti tubercle drugs in addition to steroids.  Your high cholesterol. It is true that high cholesterol is a predisposing factor for development of coronary heart disease. However not every person with high cholesterol will have it. Secondly, the definition of high cholesterol. It is recommended that a person with a history of heart disease should have his LDL cholesterol below 100 mg/dl. A person with two risk factors but no history of heart disease it should be below 130. And a healthy person with no hostory neither risk factors it should be below 160.   So where do you fall in this pattern? Sometimes people unnecessarily get worried because of their percieved ilnesses, largely contributed by the media and in no less manner the pharmacologic industry.   An occasional 'large one' as you say will cause some transient discomfort. But it should be ignored. Try some regular aerobic exercises. This will go a long way to improve your heart muscle, your vagal tone and a generalised sense of well being.  Take care,   Apurva\n\n",

    "title": "Re: endocardial fibrosis by high-tryptophan diet",
    "content": "Hello -  The primary reason for concern regarding serotonin in sunflower seeds is the observation of cardiac valvular fibrosis in animal models. While serotonin is not in all cases free in the blood (for instance with SSRI family of drugs), some substances do release free serotonin, and sunflower seeds, based on the animal models, may be one such substance. however, animal studies are notorious for their having recieved amounts of any given substance vastly higher than what a normal human would consume. A cup of sunflower seeds daily is hardly unusual, so is unlikely to present too much of a risk. If any untoward symptoms (other than those noted by you already) should arise, you probably should discontinue the sunflower seeds, and they may or may not be causing the blood in the stool. It's certainly possible, although when taken with a regular diet (instead of exclusively), this should be moderate.  The most common substance-caused form of endocardial fibrosis, and an often catastrophic one, is associated with the once-popular diet drug combination known as fen-phen. Sunflower seeds are nowhere near as dangerous as fen-phen.  While I can't recommend ingestion of such a large amount of a single dietary supplement, I don't think it is, by itself, especially risky.   I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  MRSA will not cause sudden cardiac arrest, so let yourself be easy about that. While mitral valve abnormalities are usually benign (as in mitral valve prolapse, the most common cause of leakage), there is a small but discrete subset of patients who, for unusual reasons, do experience sudden cardiac arrest. I want to stress that it is rare, especially with MVP, but there are some cases, especially where there is a notable leakage or regurgitation where yes, this is a possibility.   Your daughter is in no danger of having something catastrophic happen because of the MRSA infection. She will  simply need to be aware of it, since it can recur, and is a nuisance more than anything else (except in the very elderly and very sick). It has nothing to do wtih the incidence of cardiac arrest, but mitral regurgitation definitely can cause this in select, unfortunate individuals. I hope your  daughter stays well and that your neice is able to recover fully from this terrible mishap.  I hope this eases your mind. Best of luck to you and your family.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi David -  The symptoms you describe do not fit the clinical picture of heart failure. Since you apparently have a history of GERD (presumed based on the Nexium prescription), the discomfort is probably exercise-induced acid reflux with possible secondary asthma. This should be explored (and now there is a test to determine if exercise is inducing either acid reflux and/or asthma secondary to exercise-induced reflux; it involves placing a tiny capsule with micro-electronics inside it, which detect and measure stomach acid entering the esophagus. A small portable monitor is carried like a heart monitor, and records the findings).  All that being said, you really should bring this problem to the attention of your doctor. While it is highly unlikely to be heart-related, it is not impossible, and if it's not you'd want to know, same as if it were. Probably more importantly,  you could find out if it is due to an increase in acid reflux  and if it is causing some asthma (it sounds very possible this is happening). Adjustment of your GERD medication might be in order.   I hope this is helpful. Please stay in touch with us. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: congestive heart failer",
    "content": "Hello happylady27 -  Your mom suffers from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); emphysema accounts for a good deal of COPD, and smoking accounts for most but not all emphysema cases. People with COPD are far more prone to recurrent bouts of pneumonia. Pneumonia also \"looks\" a lot like congestive heart failure at times, since both involve the lungs having stuff (either pus or fluid) in them that makes them not work as well. Often they can coexist as well, although CHF is usually a chronic problem whereas pnuemonia will flare up from time to time. Even there, however, the two can be confused because CHF can be well managed, then get worse suddenly.   Diabetes is not a direct cause of CHF nor pneumonia, but it can in some ways contribute to the development of either one, and either one distracts from the usual diabetic care, so diabetic patients with either will get closer scrutiny inside a hospital than at home.  By symptom description alone it is difficult in this case to tell whether your mother was having another case of pneumonia (most likely due to history) or CHF (which would be a new development). In either case getting her to a hospital was the absolute right thing to do. Hopefully she subsequently responded to treatment and got better. Managing the diabetes carefully is one big part of this complex treatment plan. Also taking care of the COPD as well as possible is another. Recognizing pneumonia symptoms early is a third important thing for her. You seem to be aware of how all this works, so she is in good hands with you, but of course it is difficult to force another person to seek medical care even if you know they need it. This poses a stress for you as part of the cargiving team, so do be sure you take good care of yourself as well, and do not worry unnecessarily. You are doing your best to help your mom and that's the best anyone can do.   Please let us know how things have gone. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello dadof6 -  I just wanted to catch up on your appended question here. While an enlarged right ventricle is not a normal finding, it is neither terribly unusual nor always problematic. Cardiomyopathy can of course affect the RV, but generally has a more serious effect on the LV. There are one or two congenital conditions involving a thin RV free wall and some enlargement, but it often causes the patient no problem, although it should be followed over time. I think the concern over cardiomyopathy can probably be safely put on a back burner for now, and quite possibly for good. Just be sure you have an occasional look taken at this. It could also be an anomaly which will not show up next time.   Hope this will ease your concerns.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a registered nurse, certified in Critical Care Nursing, and will try to give you some insight into this topic. Having a child with genitic cardiac problems, you probably already know quite a bit, but bear with me. The relative unchaging Ejection Fraction (EF) numbers you are referring to, despite the relatively high dose of Coreg that your child is taking is probably due to the fact that her mitral valve is further compromised. Until this valve is repaired (or, most likely, replaced surgically), the heart will continue to have to compensate for this leaking or regurgitation of blood at the valve juncture, no matter what medication is used. So, the fact that her EF has not significantly deteriorated further is probably a good sign, depending upon how she is physically tolerating this. Many people can tolerate even lower EF's, but this is something that requires regular monitoring. Things she should be doing to keep herself healthy include watching sodium intake (2000 mg per day is generally accepted limit), monitoring and keeping a record of her weights every morning after using the toilet, reporting any increase of 2-3 pounds in one day, or whatever her MD/NP suggests, eating a balanced and healthy diet, maintaining a healthy body weight,  and controlling blood pressure. Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 20 year old male dx mid 2006 with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and ejection fraction then of 25% , over the following year meds raised the EF to 35% and had no symptoms.  In September of 2007 I started to get out of breath very easily and began coughing had my checkup with another echo and EF was down to 18% it was then discused about a transplant.  I am now in the process of being evaluated for one but have come across some articles about left ventricular assist system which has been approved in Europe and Canada for long term use in heart failure instead of just a bridge to transplant.  Just last week there was something about a Texas woman recovering completely after having the pump in for a year. What are your views on this ?  The hospital I will be having the transplant in is doing a study /clinical trial on the use of the LVAS I don't know if I would meet all the criteria for it but when I asked my cardiologist he just said that it would be better to go with something we already know works.  I also had a defibrillator put in 1 month ago, sorry I am asking so many questions but the thought of the transplant and the follow up after really scares me and I would like them to think about another way to do this  thanks in advance for your time\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  Dilated cardiomyopathy with severe left ventricular dysfunction is difficult to treat. Even after optimal antifailure treatment with ACE inhibitors, Beta Blockers, diuretics and digitalis there remains a large body of patient with effort intolerance and decreased qaulity of life not to mention increased mortality.  Novel pharmacologic therapies therapies have evolved consisting of L arginine, Co Enzyme q 10, sildenafil citrate, etc. However hard evidnce is lacking on effectiveness of these therapies.  Next comes your heart transplant and LV assist device. LVAS was till now considered a bridge therapy in patints on transplant list. However recent evidence is encouraging as to its benefit for medium term  as a stand alone therapy.   One more option is Cardiac Resynchrinization Therapy, also known as bi-ventricular pacing. Its effectiveness has been shown in cases of heart failure who meet the criteria like EF less than 25 %, NYHA class III plus symptoms, EKG showing left bundle branch block with QRS duration more than 0.12 secs.  Its best to discuss out all these options with your cardiologist before reaching a decision. I have attached some references for your perusal.  Apurva.

Because i panic all the time and i have been to 3 cardiologists and even a elctrophysiologist and they say not to worry. they all say tis anixety but i can still feel my heart in my throat. I am scared to exercise and when i do things that cause exertion i have to take a deep breathe and my heart is beating strong. I am very scared of this strong heartbeat and always feeling it in my throat. My latest test I just had a 30 day holter monitor 5 months ago and it came out fine. and i had a chest xray done 2 months ago that was fine. I am very worried and I am scared please help. Do you think i could have heart failure now or early sings of it. Or is this anxiety from just worrying so much everyday for the last couple of years. Is it bad to always feel your heartbeat in your throat? Can worrying all the time brought this on? please not this all came from when i had a huge panic attack on new years eve of 2005 and never been the same since...\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  Many healthy young individuals do feel palpitations and strong pulse feeling, especially in thin and lean persons. Once you get a little conscious of this it causes anxiety. Anxiety will cause the heart to beat even faster and stronger. And the vicious cycle goes on.  Trace regurgitation is never an abnormality and many healthy individuals in general population have it on their Echo.  For your kind of symptoms you have undergone a battery of very advanced cardiac tests and many of this will show some irrelevant or inconsequential findings that will unnecessarily add to you anxiety. Feeling the force of pulse in one\u2019s throat is not a cause of worry.  Forget heart failure. It is a complex entity wherein the heart has lost its force to pump out the blood. It will show as low Ejection Fraction on your Echo.    A simple advice for you. Calm down. Don\u2019t be too health conscious. Remember at any given time a large majority of world population is healthy and free of disease. This is called concept of \u2018wellness\u2019. Occupy your mind with things you enjoy. Do vigorous physical exercises. Do some yoga and meditation. Forget doctors!  Apurva\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Mpmama294,  Mitral valve regurgitation is very common.  Regurgitation means leaking backwards through the valve.    If the leak is small (as is most commonly the case) it really is not a concerning issue.  It only becomes an issue if the heart begins to fail from a large leak.    It is recommended that people with mitral valve regurg. take endocarditis prophylaxis.  This means that before certain procedures that can introduce bacteria into the blood stream, such as dental work or cleanings, you should take an antibiotic.  Just one dose before these procedures is usually enough.  Your regular doctor can prescribe this for you.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Mat,  I apologize but I do not understand the notation \"O\" in your title.  It is possible for a patient in atrial fibrillation to have an S1 and S2 on their physical exam.  S1 is made by the closing of the tricuspid and mitral valves.  S2 is made by the closing of the atrial and pulmonic valves.  Even though the atria are not pumping in a coordinated method during atrial fibrillation blood still flows through the valves due to pressure of the bloodstream, allowing for an S1.  The ventricles pump normally creating S2.  If, by chance, the \"O\" refers to a gallop these are created by bloodflow so they can still be present with atrial fibrillation as well.  If I haven't fully answered your question please feel free to post a follow up.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Young age and female gendre offer protection from the most common heart disease (coronary artery disease) but does not eliminate any other cause for heart disease. Again the likelihood that you have any of these diseases is decreased by young age.  The thing that concerns me more is your description of progressive exertional dyspnea. I would follow your doctor's recommendation and seek the assessment of a cardiologist as soon as possible.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Canaveral,  I would recommend against turning off the pacemaker/ICD.  There are a few reasons.  Even though your heart isn't squeezing as well as it should, if the rhythm becomes abnormal (which is more prone to happen in cardiomyopathy) the ICD part may be able to shock it back into a normal rhythm.  Also, since the heart isn't pumping well, it is important that the heart rate not drop too low.  This is where the pacemaker part kicks in.  It can help prevent the pulse from dropping below a set point.  Even though your heart is having trouble it is still doing some work so the key is keeping it going until the transplant.  The pacemaker/ICD may be able to help this happen.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "You do not mention why you take the biotin.  Deficiency of this vitamin is rare and you should not need to take additional amounts unless prescribed by a doctor.  Your prenatal vitamin would contain all you should need and overdosing on some vitamins can be a problem so I would avoid, especially in pregnancy.  In some cases the extra vitamin is mostly excreted and it's just money down the drain, but when you are pregnant, there are unknown factors and it's best not to take any chances.  Obviously we do not test on pregnant women so we can't say that double-blind studies have shown problems, but it's best to be safe.  You definitely should not need an additional multi vitamin unless perhaps you are carrying multiples (twins, triplets)\n\n",

To my knowledge there is no other surgical corrective procedure available.  The best thing for dilated cardiomyopathies is to try to maximize the cardiac function and minimize future complications.  In some cases medical management is not successful in preventing future problems and a transplant may be necessary.  Specific issues related to your case may no fit this exactly.  This is general information about dilated cardiomyopathies.  Follow up with your cardiologist is very important.  Your cardiologist can give you better information directly related to your situation.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I have had many blood tests,x-rays,and ECG tests  these all coming back normal except for high creatinin in my kidneys in 2 of the last blood tests.My doctor said it was nothing to worry about and that the rest of my symptoms is Anxiety related.I accepted this and hoped it would go if I relaxed but it has got worse and now my Doctors wont help me as they think its my anxiety.The symptoms I have are sharp pains on either side of my breastbone, pains in my stomach/chest, when I push in the left side of my stomach area gives me sharp shooting pains elsewhere. But the worst pains are the ones in the center of my back between the shoulder blades,and spasms that are very big inside the center of my chest below the breastbone, Breathlessness and also I get very painful sharp shooting pains in my neck that make me feel nauses.I think that I might have a heart problem? or most possibly a clot in my chest or a pulmonary embolism? do these symptoms sound like anything you know of doctor??Code: Select all\n\n",

    "content": "I agree with Dr. Chan that your symptoms are not consistent with either pulmonary embolism or pain due to cardiac ischemia.  I understand your concerns as well as your frustration. However, the only way to solve this is to get a second opinion and have another doctor examine you.  Other causes of sudden chest pain include aortic dissection. That may present with pain between the shoulder blades or with renal problems depending on its location. Let me stress however, that statistically speaking this would be very unlikely to be your condition (it happens at a late age 50-70). The fact that you do not have any risk factors for dissection (hypertension, Marfan's syndrome, bicuspid aortic valve or coarctation of the aorta) make it even less likely. This condition is usually diagnosed by CT, MRI or transesophageal echo.   Please keep this post updated with your condition.  Best regards,\n\n",

Is your presence here for pleasure, or for business, or related to family choices outside of your control?  Depression can indeed cause chest pain/pressure. The process for determining if a problem is cardiac related or depression, is generally one that follows a \"rule-out\" for cardiac first - after all it is wisest to make sure the pump is working properly,  Then one can decide what emotional ailments may be causing pain. For the cardiac workup there are simple blood tests, and an EKG (electrocardiogram) that can show it there are any cardiac enzyme elevations indicative of heart damage.  Even a young man can have cardiac problems.  And even a young man can have emotional distresses that can cause chest pain.  There are community clinics in nearly every town in America that offer free or low cost health evaluations.  You may ask at the local hospital emergency room for a referral, or even ask them for a reasonable payment play and be evaluated there.  I strongly suggest you look into this as soon as you are able - better to know now if you have any serious heart problems, than to find out after suffering a major heart event!\n\n",

    "content": "I realize that these blood pressure machines in stores are not right on the money. Would I be right to believe that if I use the same one... I should have a ballpark number? Anyways I've had a history of my bp spiking and I\"m never sure if I should go to the hospital. I'm male, 35 years of age with some bp problems on my dads side.   To the point. At times (rather when my head hurts alot) I check my bp. I've used this same bp manchine for a year or so. Heres the results about a hour ago, 171/113 with a pulse rate of 123. Yes My Head Hurts pretty bad. Other than that I feel OKAY. Finances have made this hard to deal with.  The odd thing is that my bp will stay normal-high (140/90) range for months.   I know theres no set number to go get help, but when should I be thinking that way?  THANK YOU so very much for your time! Chris\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Christuggle,  High blood pressure is dangerous because if left untreated it can contribute to serious complications such as stroke, cardiomyopathy, kidney problems, vision problems, and so much more.  While it is accepted that life stressors can contribute to hypertension (the technical term for high blood pressure), it is also understood that a person with a family history of hypertension has an increased possibility of inheriting this disorder. The numbers you mention (170 + over 110+) are clinically of great concern.  Whether or not this pressure is driven up due to stress, or is elevated due to your own physiology can only be determined by a doctor, with lab work, possibly Echocardiogram, possibly stress test, and an EKG.  If you are checking your pressure as frequently as you portray, it seems you have some concerns.  Please address them to you PCP (Primary care Physician) and follow through on his or her recommendations.\n\n",

I would think it would be reasonable for you to see a cardiologist for an evaluation.  You may need a stress test to evaluate your heart condition better.  Your doctor may have a reason that he is not wanting to refer you.  I would recommend you discuss your concerns with him and see if you are able to come to an agreeable solution.  It is also always reasonable to request a second opinion.  As a reminder to all our readers, this website should not be considered a source of a second opinion since we cannot directly evaluate you.

    "content": "Dear carmstrong03, From the fact that you had an echo done 4 years ago leads me to believe you have had concerns about your health for some time.  While you understand correctly that the heart plays a large part in circulation, and that congestive heart failure can give you the symptoms you describe, there is another major organ of the body that plays a huge role in fluid retention - especially evident in dependent extremeties. (The symptoms show up particularly noticeable in legs since they are \"down\", or in a dependent position, most of the time.)  Have you had any tests done concerning kidney health?  The kidneys have the incredible task of being the garbage trucks for the body, eliminating wastes and toxins. If the body has an infection that affects the kidneys, they can cause problems like back up of fluid in the legs and hands. Having an abnormal ANA or SED rate would be worth asking your doctor for further information.  There are simple tests that may help clarify these findings.  In any event the swelling in your legs is not normal, and deserves a closer look.\n\n",

The SVTs are gone, but since then my Ejection Fraction (the percent of blood my left ventricle is pumping out) has dropped from 59% to 47%. My doctor told me, since I don't have diabetes or coronary artery disease, it must be alcoholic cardiomyopathy and ordered me to no longer drink alcohol. From my research on the internet, it sounds like you have to be a pretty heavy drinker to have alcoholic cardiomyopathy.  I drink one bottle of wine a week.   I can't imagine that little alcohol is causing such a big drop in my ejection fraction. I  wonder if it's the Toprol that has caused my cardiac output to drop.  My doctor says 25mg is too small to have that effect. Has anyone heard of Toprol XL lowering the left ventricle's ejection fraction?\n\n",

    "content": "Drinking alcohol in excessive quantities has a direct toxic effect on the heart muscle cells. Alcoholic cardiomyopathy is a form of dilated cardiomyopathy caused by habitual alcohol abuse.  Alcoholic cardiomyopathy causes poor heart function because the heart muscle becomes too weak to pump efficiently. The condition leads to heart failure. Lack of blood flow affects all parts of the body, resulting in damage to multiple tissues and organ systems.  So generally speaking the causes of dilated cardiomyopathy could be the chronic use of alcohol. It can also occur as a complication of child birth and pregnancy. In addition there are some infectious causes, including mainly viruses, and even hereditary cause and toxins like cobalt, which was once used in beer.  Long term use of alcohol can result in a number of histological and cellular changes in the cardiomyoctyes, contractile proteins, intracellular organelles, and calcium homeostasis.  In your case the use of beta blockers should be beneficial. In fact studies have shown that addition of beta blockers reduce morbidity and mortality in some cases of heart failure.  Often in patients with mild stages of CHF, congestive heart failure (meaning ejection fraction less than 50 %), when patients are given a beta blocker, they experience an increase, and improvement in the ejection fraction within a few months.  I do not believe that Toprol may have caused this decline in your ejection fraction. I believe that you probably do have alcoholic cardiomyopathy based on what I have already mentioned above and on your doctor's diagnosis. You should really abstain from alcohol use.   Thank you very much, and I hope you always feel better.\n\n",

In September I was diagnosed with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (mild) and later learned that it was due to Pulmonary Venous Hypertension, left dystolic failure. Echo shows dialated left ventricle .  The left ventricular end systolic diameter is 4.0 cm and the LVED is 5.8 cm.  Ejection fraction is preserved at 60%.  The left atrium is dialated at 4.4 cm.  My physicians seemed very unconcerned over these finding although I continue to become more symptomatic.    My question is, is this something I should worry about.  Other than diet, exercise and the meds that I'm already on, should there be more treatment?  I've been told I was ok, just diet, exercise, quit smoking (of course) and come back next year.  I'm on CCBs and read they are not good for heart failure patients.  I certainly don't feel ok and seem to be slowly spiraling downward.  I'm very concerned.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear dmamacher,  The causes of diastolic dysfunction are:  1. Hypertension. 2. Aging. 3. Coronary disease. 4. Cardiomyopathy including:     a. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.     b. Restrictive cardiomyopathy caused by Infiltration of the heart muscles by abnormal substances.  You mentioned a few things only out of the echocardiogram report, but you did not mention the left ventricular different walls' thicknesses.  If you have thick walls, this could be secondary to hypertension which is one of the commonest causes of diastolic failure.  You are already taking an antihypertensive medication. It is a combined medication with a calcium channel blocker and an ace inhibitor. Personally, i don't like combination medications because sometimes you can not tritrate up to the maximum dose of each medication if needed, but if this what your primary care provider thinks is best for you, that's fine with me. The treatment of diastolic heart failure is treatment of the cause in addition to targeting the impaired relaxation and filling.  Certain types of calcium channel blockers are not sometimes good for heart failure patients because they decrease contractility but you have a good ejection fraction so there is noting to worry about from that point.  What are the symptoms that you have been developping that are making you concerned?  Please, stop smoking all together and be very compliant with your medications and your blood pressure (if it is high) has to be very well controlled.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped and waiting for your reply.  Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for responding Dr. Mokhtar.    To answer your question, the left ventricular wall thickness and calculated mass index are normal.  What has me concerned is how I feel now.  I fear the progression and wonder how bad it can get  and still allow me to come to work.  Just several months ago I was highly active.  Even though I have been obese since I was 8 years old, I've always maintained high activity.  But...It was like a switch was turned off.  One day I woke up and all I could do was sleep.  This is not an exageration.  Even though the CCBs seem to give me some goods days now,  I am short of breath on minimal exertion have extreme weakness at times.  I also have periods of dizzyness where I feel that I will surely pass out.  The palpatitions are getting worse with periods of pounding.  Holter showed that I had PVCs with Bigeminy runs about two months ago. Also,during one 6 minute walk test my O2 went down to 81.  During the next test at a different Dr's office, my Blood Pressure rose to 175/158.  But, I completed the test with no periods of resting.  I did not ask what my respiration rate was but it was high enough to cause around my lips to go numb.  I  moved my 75 year old mother in with me 3 months ago.  SHE has more stamina than I do on many days.  She has emphysema and is on O2.    I know my body and can appreciate some changes due to aging, strain of weight, smoking etc.  But this does not seem like a natural progression in the least.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear dmamacher,  Thank you very much for the update.  The easiest explanation to your symptoms is the lotrel. It is known to cause fatigue and somnolence.  There are other explanations though. What you are suffering from might not have anything to do with pulmonary hypertension and the pulmonary hypertension might have nothing to do with the left ventricular diastolic dysfunction that you have or there may be other factors contributing to the development of pulmonary hypertension.  What you are describing is very consistent with sleep apnea which is a condition that affects a large portion of the obese population. Please, talk to your doctor about this possibility and see what he thinks.  If your oxygen sats dropped during exercise, may be you need oxygen during exercise.  Patients who have pulmonary hypertension might be dependant on blood coming back to the heart to generate enough blood pumped out to the tissues and thus feeling that you have enough energy, so the 80 mg of lasix that you are getting might be a little bit too much for you.  Palpitations might be caused by the fact that your potassium level in the blood is low even though you are getting potassium and the lotrel has a medication that might increase the potassium level in the blood. i would recommend checking your electrolytes including magnesium, calcium and phosphorus and thyroid function tests.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped and waiting for your reply.  Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Well I finally had my sleep study and although I do not yet have the offical report, the tech told me that I did stop breathing during REM sleep and that my 02 dropped to 84%. I will get the official results when I see my Pulmonologist on the 11th of January.  I imagine this explains my decline in to Left Diastolic Disfuntion and Pulmonary Hypertenstion.  I would like to pose another question.  With Left Ventriclular End Diastolic diameter dialtated at 5.8, systolic diameter of 4.0 and left atrium dialated at 4.4, does this mean the diagnosis would be dialated cardiomyopathy?  Or would it still be heart failure since my ejection fraction is normal?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear dmamacher,   Thank you very much for the update.   The upper normal diastolic diameter is 5.6 cm, i don't think that 0.2 cm is a great deal. About your left atrium, it is enlarged (most probably secondary to the diastolic dysfinction), and the only draw back is that some patients with left atrial enlargement develop atrial fibrillation (an abnormal heart rhythm) and it is sometimes difficult to cardiovert them back to a normal rhythm.  Regarding cardiomyopahty, it is a heart muscle disease associated with heart dysfunction. Distinction between various types of cardiomyopathy relies on the echocardiographic evaluation, the echo is a good tool to detect various types of cardiopmyopathy, in your case, if you have cardiomyopathy it is going to be of the dilated type since you have left ventricle dilatation. In the early stages of dilated cardiomyopathy, sometimes it is difficult for the echo to immediately spot dilated cardiomyopathy as it is usually able to. For the time being, i assume that you don't have cardiomyopathy as your ejection fraction is normal.  Having sleep apnea, causes hypertension and this in turn can cause diastolic dysfunction, so if you are diagnosed with sleep apnea, you will be offered some treatment options according to what your doctor sees of benefit and this will help in the control the high blood pressure and of the diastolic dysfunction as well.  If obesity is a problem, i think it is best to try losing weight as sometimes patients with mild sleep apnea get cured with weight loss.

    "content": "It's been some time since I've posted but I have an appointment with my Cardiologist and would appreciate some advice.  I am hoping this post will include my other history but briefly, I am 47 years old and have Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension due to Pulmonary Venous Hypertension, Left Diastolic Dysfunction.  I can add to the other posts that my Sleep Study revealed that I had extremely mild Sleep Apnea which the Pulmonologist decided was not significant enough to warrant treatment.  I've been wearing a 30 Day Event Monitor due to PVCs.  My Cardiologist's office called and said they've found \"a lot of PVCs with bigeminy, trigeminy and Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia\".    My question would be, should Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia be considered when my Left Atrium is 4.6 cm?  And would you please advise me of questions that I could ask my Cardiologist during my visit or tests that should be considered under these circumstances?  I can not take Beta Blockers due to a history of allergy to this medication.  I appreciate your time.  Diane\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Inappropriate sinus tachycardia",
    "content": "Dear Diane,  Thank you very much for the update.  i don't think that there is a relation between your mildly enlarged left atrium and inappropriate sinus tachycardia.  Chronic inappropriate sinus tachycardia has been described in otherwise healthy persons, possibly secondary to increased automaticity of the sinus node (the pacemaker of the heart) or an automatic atrial focus located near the sinus node. The abnormality can result from a defect in nerve control of sinus node.  Treatment of inappropriate sinus tachycardia requires beta blockers, but since you are allergic, calcium-channel blockers, or digitalis, alone or in combination can be tried. In severe cases, sinus node radiofrequency or surgical ablation may be indicated.  If your cardiologist is not an electrophysiologist (cardiologist specialized in arrhythmias), may be you can ask him if it is worth it for you to be evaluated by one.  If most of the arrhythmias occur by night, and if you gained some weight, may be your sleep apnea has gotten worse and you need to be treated for it.  If you have not had a thyroid profile, i think it is a good idea to have one done.  If still, a definitive cause for the pulmonary hypertension is to be found, and if you have a history of smoking, may be a lung function test is in order.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

Swelling of ankles can be a sign, worst case scenario of congestive heart failure, but it could be just too much sodium in your diet.   Do you have other risk factors such as family history of high blood pressure, diabetes or heart disease?  A stressful job is a very high risk factor, the excess cortisol produced under stress can cause blocked arteries.   You are also very overweight, and I imagine you don't excercise.  I strongly suggest you get to a doctor for a full physical, blood workups, ECG, chest x-ray, and treadmill or nuclear test for your heart.\n\n",

    "content": "During each heartbeat, the heart contracts and relaxes. When your heart contracts (systole), it ejects blood from the pumping chambers (ventricles). When your heart relaxes (diastole), the ventricles refill with blood. No matter how forceful the contraction, it doesn't empty all of the blood out of a ventricle. The term ejection fraction refers to the percentage of blood that is pumped out of a filled ventricle with each heartbeat. This measures the capacity at which your heart is pumping.  Because the left ventricle is the heart's main pumping chamber, ejection fraction is usually measured in the left ventricle. A normal ejection fraction is 55 percent to 70 percent. The ejection fraction may decrease when the heart muscle has been damaged, such as due to: Heart attack , or Heart muscle disease (cardiomyopathy), and   Heart valve problems   so ejection fraction of less than 50 indicates a form of heart failure, of course once it is the 20 range or less, this might indicate severe CHF  THANK YOU\n\n",

The main stay of treatment in congestive heart failure is: 1. Diuretics: Fluid pills, lasix for example. 2. Vasodilators: Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, lisinopril for example. 3. Beta blockers: toprol xl for example. 4. Medications that make the heart pump stronger: digoxin for example. 5. Adjuvant treatments:  a. Well organized exercise program. b. Loss of weight if the patient is overweight (if possible). c. Good and balanced diet with no added salt. d. Oxygen if needed. e. Pace maker if the patient has certain conduction defects.

    "content": "The main goal of treatment of congestive heart failure is  1) maintainance of fluid balance: and this is implemented by using diuretics: lasix, hydrochlorothiazides,  and spironolactone . these help promote water and sodium excretion.  2)maintaining a theraputic blood pressure, this is accomplished via the use of antihypertensives and/or vasodilaters: like ace inhibitors: lisinopril, or beta blockers: atenolol, metoprolol., or angiotensin receptor blockers: diovan, calcium channel blockers: ditiazem verapamil.  3)Drugs which can improve the contractility of the heart: digoxin  4)diet: maintaining a sodium balanced diet; sodium restriction, because sodium overload promotes water retention.  5)excercise  6) patients with congestive heart failures should get used to obtain their weight daily. this practice is very important, as it tells health care professionals or the patient's doctor how well your body is responding t duiretics, therefore, how your fluid status is. overall, depending on the stage of congestive heart failure (class i being the mildest, and IV being the worst), patients might be in monotherapy( one drug), or combination to reach optimal treatment.    if all medical treatments fail, patient with severe congestive heart failure, might be a candidate for heart transplantation, depending on the criteria.  it is very advisable to check with your doctor on regular basis, and discuss any issues or concerns that you might have.  thank you, and hope that helped.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Raluca  You do have many symptoms of magnesium deficiency - what do you typically eat every day?  Do you take any magnesium supplements?  Magnesium is commonly found in diabetics, I hope you had a full chemistry blood test to check for that (glucose and Hgb A1c).  Magnesium affects glucose (blood sugar), the heart and nervous system, that may be where your breathlessness, fatigue and tingling are coming from.  Magnesium also controls the calcium, severe defiency in magnesium will result in calcium deficiency also.  You should be eating plenty of vegetables (dark leafy greens such as spinach), beans and nuts every day, these foods contain the highest amounts of magnesium.    Caution:  if you have any kidney disease, magnesium supplements could make you retain too much, and if you do, it can become toxic and actually cause the same symptoms you have, so have your doctor check that, too if he/she didn't.  Talk to your doctor before you take them.  Is this the same doctor?  You may indeed be panicing due to the severity of your illness, but I imagine IF you are, it should subside when you start feeling better.  I hope you get this resolved quickly and feel better very soon.  Sincerely,  Shannon\n\n",

    "content": "Most of what I read about pitting edema seems to focus on the feet and ankles.  What about pitting edema only on the shins?  By the end of the day, the tissue over my shins is like that \"memory foam\" you see advertised on those \"space age\" mattresses.  Then in the morning, the skin over my shins feels slightly \"tacky\".  I'll be seeing my MD in three days.  I have other reasons to suspect possible CHF, but just wondering if pitting edema limited to the shins was significant.  Thank you!\n\n",

    "content": "I am 23 year old mother of one. I am overweight, am a smoker, have high blood pressure, (I don't remember which was which) but my bad cholesterol is 156.  Most of my mother's side of the family all have some sort of heart disease.  I have been having series of palpitations (which I have read a lot about on this board -- and it really eases my mind).  I went for an echo 2 years ago and in my left ventricle both my septal wall thickness and the post wall thickness were 1.1 (normal is 0.6 - 1.1).  This time my echo showed both the septal wall thickness and the post wall thickness as being 1.2.  Also that I have a MVP but that it's no big deal.  After talking to the doctor he assured me that if I ate correctly, exercised, lowered my blood pressure (with meds), lowered my cholesterol (with meds) that all would be well and I wouldn't have anything to worry about.  My question is.  If I so everything the doctor said (lost weight, quit smoking, did exercise, lowered my cholesterol and blood pressure) would the walls thin out back into the normal range or would they just not get any worse?  Also how thick can these walls get without having major complications from it?  I understand that I am not in the normal range, but it would ease my mind (A LOT) if I knew that I was still far away from having a major problem.  Thank you so much.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Left ventricle wall thickness",
    "content": "Dear Mistieroze,  You have mild left ventricular hypertrophy and since this is worsening since your last echocardiogram, this reflects the fact that your blood pressure has not been under proper control.   With weight loss, exercising, stopping smoking, sodium restriction in the diet and medications, your blood pressure will be under better control and with proper blood pressure control, the left ventricular hypertrophy will regress (go back to normal). There are certain anti-hypertensive medications that cause regression more than other medications, you can discuss the choice of medications with your doctor and i am sure he will give the best advice.  Left ventricular hypertrophy, irrespective of any other disease that patients have, increases the risk of having heart attacks, strokes and renal failure (reflecting the fact blood pressure is poorly controlled). In addition, left ventricular hypertrophy increases the risk of sudden death.   You have a very strong positive family histopry for coronary disease and you have a high ldl and your blood pressure is not under good control, all of these, in addition to smoking as well. This means that you have 4 major risk factors for coronary disease and you are at a much higher risk for suffering from an early heart attack or a stroke.  You are a young mother and you have to take this matter very seriously to be in the best of health.  The palpitations that you have are most probably related to your mitral valve prolpse.

    "content": "Two years ago I had a triple bypass. I was told told I had heart disease but no heart damage. I am 59 years old. I also have MDS and was given a transfusion during the surgery. Recently my hemoglobin dropped to 8.5.  My hematologist said I should have a transfusion.  I questioned this because I had been told by several nurses that with each transfusion my blood will get harder and harder to match. I have 0+ blood type.  My hematologist said this was not true. I then went to another city to see a MDS specialist.  He said the nurses  were right and that I should limit the transfusions, as long as the low hemaglobin is not hurting my heart. He sent me back with instructions to get an echogardiogram.  I did this and have yet to hear from the local doctor.  I've talked to his nurse and she asked me why the specialist ask this question.  I told her I was not in the medical field and I did not know.  She said if he is talking about the squeezing action of the heart, it is fine.  On top of this my intenist prescribed me beta blockers although I have never ever had high blood pressure ever!  On whatever is supposed to be 60-100, I was 80.  I would appreciate it if your doctor could answer thes questions for me. Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Dear srstep,  Thank you very much for the update.  A transthoracic echocardiogram is an ultrasound of the heart. It allows the operator to see the heart in real time and how it pumps, the sizes of its various chambers, its valves and the direction of blood flow through these valves.  It gives quite a bit of information in good hands and it is non-invasive.  If a patient who has heart disease (specially heart failure) has a low hemoglobin (anemia), he might become symptomatic due to the anemia earlier than a patient who does not have heart failure and the symptoms might be confused as these 2 conditions share some symptoms such as shortness of breath and easy fatigability.  The echo will show how strong your heart beats and if it beats normally and you are not symptomatic and you can go around doing all of your activities without problems, i don't think that you need a blood transfusion. On the other hand, if you have symptoms that hinder your daily activities, then i would recommend a blood transfusion.

    "content": "Dear Pokey,  If your mother has dilated cardiomyopathy, there is an entity known as familial dilated cardiomyopathy. The chances of inheriting it is about 25-50% depending on the type of inheritence. If inheritence is dominant, then the chance is 50%, if it is recessive it is 25%.  Since you started to have cardiac symptoms, i would suggest that you be evaluated by a cardiologist or at least get an echocardiogram to have a base line echo where the size of the left ventricle and the ejection fraction are estimated.

In addition to taking the normiten, which is just symptomatic treatment, other causes of high blood pressure and fast heart rate should be excluded before giving all the credit to methcathinone.   An ecg (electric recording of the heart beats) should be done to make sure that the heart beating is normal but fast and not an abnormal irregular heart rate.  i would suggest also that you have an ultrasound of the heart (echocardiogram) to make sure that your heart is contracting in a normal fashion.  i don't think that the drug is still in your system but a drug level in the blood could be done.

Incomplete right bundle branch block, and 2. Consider Left Ventricular Hypertrophy.  My blood pressure was 149/102.   My blood pressures usually only runs over 140/80 when under stress such as a doctors visit. After my surgery, on the 8th day while being walked by PT, I felt a crushing pain in my chest and collapsed to the floor.  My husband,who was with me at the time, said my chest was heaving as though it were going to jump out of my chest. I was told about an hour later that the cardiac ensyme test was ok and my ECG only showed Voltage criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy. During the past two years I have gained weight from 215 to 234 and I am 5'4\" tall.  I also have been sedentary as I have not been able to walk on either leg so have mainly used a wheelchair or walker.  A short walk of 30 feet using a walker will leave me winded.   Can you tell me what the ECG indicates and is there any significance of the chest pain shortly after surgery.  Both my parents died in their 60's from heart disease.  Needless to say,I am scared and could use any information you can give me on what this means and where do I go from here.  My orthopedic Dr, who did the knee replacement, refuses to discuss this with me. Thanks, Carolyn\n\n",

You did not mention whether you were on any blood thinners or not (the standard of care after orthopedic surgery is to give prophylactic blood thinners to patients to prevent venous blood clotting in the lower limbs and the lungs, these can be given either subcutaneous in the abdomen usually or intravenous and then followed by a medication called coumadin orally), you did not mention whether you had a ct scan of the chest to rule out blood clot to your lungs and whether or not you had a doppler scan of your legs to rule out deep venous thrombosis of the legs.  Your ecg picture is non-specific. Having a pattern of left ventricular hypertrophy does not necessarily mean that you have it because ecg is not the gold standard for diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy. To diagnose left ventricular hypertrophy, you have to have an echocardiogram. The incomplete right bundle branch block is a normal variant.  Regarding your weight gain and being winded with exercise, this could mean that you are just unfit because you gained all this weight. You have to have an echocardiogram to diagnose heart failure as well. It will show your heart function accurately.

    "content": "Dear Dr. Mokhtar: Thanks again for your reply.  In addition I have further questions. First of all, to answer your questions blood thinners were not used because I would not accept blood transfusions before, during or after surgery in accord with my religious beliefs.  A Cell Saver was used instead during and after surgery.  No doppler was used on my legs nor was any CT scan of the chest used after the incident mentioned. Rather I was discharged the next day from the hospital with no further tests being done.  Does this mean I probably had a blood clot? If so, am I still in danger?  Or could it have dissolved on its own?  I have been taking Ibuprofin for pain, on my own, since leaving the hospital.  Do you have any reccomendations as to further follow-ups on this?  I have not had any chest pain since that one episode in the hospital a week ago. Thanks, Carolyn\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Carolyn,  Thank you very much for the update.  Tough question, i am not sure whether there is an absolute correct answer to it.   You are not having any more chest pain, that's a good sign. However, you are having shortness of breath, and this could point to the effect the blood clot had on your lungs.   i would recommend having:  1. Doppler exam on the veins of your legs: if a blood clot is found in your legs, then there is a higher chance that the chest pain that you had was secondary to a blood clot in your lungs. 2. Echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart): to evaluate for the presence or absence of pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure in the lung blood vessels) which can point to blood clot in the lung. 3. Ventilation-perfusion lung scan: If your primary care provider thinks that this is feasible.  How about a ct scan of the chest? i don't think it would be of any benefit at this time.  The real question is: if you are diagnosed with a blood clot in the legs and/or lung and knowing that the treatment is going to be blood thinners and knowing you don't accept blood transfusions and there is of course always a risk of bleeding in patients getting blood thinners. The question is would it make a difference if we know whether or not you have a blood blot in the lung knowing that you might not be agreeable to taking blood thinners (the treatment of blood clot in the lung?).  The answer might be yes. If there is a blood clot in your legs and a blood clot in the lungs and you don't agree to taking blood thinners, there is another alternative which might not be the best on the long run but it is the only one available and that is placing a device that prevents blood clots from the legs to reaching the lungs. This device is called an inferior vena cava filter.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped and if you still have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to post them.

    "title": "Re: Right high output heart failure",
    "content": "Dear Angel,  Thank you vey much for using our website.  Heart failure is caused by the inability of the heart to pump blood to the peripheral tissues. And so, the cardiac output is low as the heart is not able to pump enough blood. In certain cases, the heart is actually working harder and pumping more blood to the tissues, but this output is still not enough for the tissues which need more, so, although the cardiac output of the heart is high (in contrast to the low output of the heart in heart failure), the heart is yet failing (to meet the peripheral tissues increased needs), hence the nomenclature high cardiac output failure. In your case, i think since you had a right heart catherterization where the cardiac output of the right ventricle was figured out, most probably you were told that you have right high cardiac output failure. Now, i am not sure how high was your cardiac output then and have you had any right heart catheterization since then for follow-up or not.  The causes of high cardiac output failure are: 1. Anemia: Looks like from your history that you had anemia at a certain point. Have you ever received blood transfusion to treat that and has the cause of this anemia been figured out or looked for? 2. Beri-beri: You mentioned that you had beri-beri because of low thiamine level in the blood. Have you had other signs of beri-beri besides the heart failure like neuropathy? Have you been treated for beri-beri. 3. Bone diseases: a. Paget's disease: With a high alkaline phosphatase. This could be a possibility. Was a calcium level and x-rays of the bones ever done to rule that out? b. Multiple myeloma: Could also be a cause but looks that this has already been ruled out. c. Fibrous dysplasia of the bone. 4. Arteriovenous fistulas: Arteriovenous fistulas are abnormal connections between arteries and veins with abnomral shunting of blood from at the level of the shunt without the blood passing through the normal channels taking less time and adding a lot of stress on the heart. These could be congenital and could be located in internal organs such as the liver and others and may not be apparent on the surface of the body. They also might be acquired like people who are on dialysis. 5. Hyperthyroidism: Have you ever had a thyroid test done? 6. Renal failure. 7. Liver failure. 8. Carcionoid syndrome: Your 5-hiaa was negative. 9. Polycythemia vera: Where there is an bnormal increase in the number of red blood cells (opposite of anemia). Which obviously is not the case in your condition. 10. Cor pulmonale: Which is right sided heart failure secondary to lung causes (no left ventricle failure). 11. Morbid obesity: How much do you weigh?  The treatment of high cardiac output failure is obviously treatment of the cause. So, you have to have a second work-up for diagnosis and then treatment started.  While in the hospital the last time, have you received only diuretics to take the fluis off or did you have dialysis?  What are the medications that you are getting so far? And do you think they are helping in terms of symptoms?  Once more, thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped and waiting for your response.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

At the time he was questioning constrictive pericarditis, but my echo looked good.  I have had no neuopathy, and A nepherologist that I see said Beri Beri isn't even around now, so I guess that it is ruled out .  He found one kidney smaller than the other on ultrasound and the report said possible renal artery stenosis.  But no one has ever mentioned it again.  My urine has all been norm except I had a high creatinine clearance of 164.  Calcium ok, bone scan showed only small amount of activity around ribs, Dr. said this was nothing, I could have bumped myself.    FSH & LH normal, TSH norm., Hep c- neg., Hep B-neg, liver functions normal C4 serum High 40,   C3 high 198,  Antinuclear Antibodies high  speckled pattern at 1:80    Spirometry showed small airway disease otherwise WNL and mild decreased diffusion capacity.    My weight was around 155 I am 5'8 1/2  and started gaining fast,  by 172 I noticed I had pitting edema .   From there I have continued to gain to about 195.  I have stayed here other than the 18lb loss after the hospital.  I feel like Im in an Eskimo suit all the time, tightly binded and full ike you have ate so much you cant hardly breath.  I am trying to drop the weight with weight watchers, but so far in 3 weeks I have only dropped 1 lb.  My husband started with me and has done lost 11lb.  I tearfully continue, and I will not give up.  I have a son and I want my life back...I am embarrassed by my appearance, I have always been 145 to 155.  Recent labs  Alk Phos H 195,  WBC 11.61 H, MCH 25.8L, RDWC 15.1 H,  Cardiac profile was norm except for Rapid MYO 15 L  Latest echo showed concentric Left Ventricle hypertrophy 13mm (6-11)norm  Never had blood transfusion, anemia unknown,  I have heavy clotting periods, They have mentioned this to be a possibility.  But Not every month is heavy.  I have never had dialysis,  only diuretics.  Currently on LASIX 80mg 2 daily, TOPRALXL 50 mg q d. (tackycardia),  k-dur, Just added Zeroxolyn, but I have not got it filled yet. Meds take off most of fluid, but I still pit mildly all the time.  Long trips, standing, cause ankles, feet , hands , legs to swell even more.   VENOUS SCAN normal.  HISTORY:  Irritable bowel syndrome, lyme, (erethema nodosum 2 times biopsy didn't reveal cause.  (age 16 & 20) when I had it.)  multiple food and drug allergies ( anaphylaxis) PSVT, hypoglycemia, Inflammation of joints still persist, it jumps around, locking, popping and some swelling of the joint that is affected at the time.  I was a blue baby so I had anemia al allot during my childhood. my mother as RH neg.    Could this be hereditary?

    "title": "Re: Right high output heart failure",
    "content": "Dear Angel,  Thank you very much for the update.  A cardiac output of 8 liters is actually not that high as the upper normal is around 7 liters. Of course, we don't know what your base line was before this.   Having concentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle most probably means that you have either chronic left ventricle stress (most probably hypertension) or an infiltrative disease of the myocardium which means that there is a substance that is infiltrating your heart around the heart muscle and making your heart appear to be thicker on the echo. Usually, infiltrative diseases have a characteristic echo picture and the heart in most of the times is much thicker than just 13 mm.   Another thing that i would like to know is what was your pulmonary artery pressure. What do you mean by Rapid MYO 15 L?   Right heart failure can be caused either as a consequence of left ventricle failure or can occur on its own. This is usually secondary to high pulmonary artery pressures, a case known as pulmonary hypertension which could happen on its own (primary pulmonary hypertension) or could be secondary to a lung disease.  In your case, you underwent lots of investigations to know the reason which has not been revealed yet.   The only thing that i have to add is to make sure that you don't have sleep apnea which is not thought of often and can give this picture. Also, you might want to make sure that you don't have hyperactivity of the adrenal gland (a condition known as Cushing's syndrome).

Concomitant rupture of the diaphragm [muscular partition between the chest and abdomen] with accumulation of blood within the abdomen has also been described with this condition. Older women, especially those with recurrent postinfarction angina [repeated chest pains in a person known to have had a heart attack], and patients with systemic hypertension [high BP] more commonly experience myocardial rupture following Acute Myocardial Infarction.

His doctor says that his heart muscles  are very weak, and is treating him with medication.  Back in Sept.2001, he had a stenth put in the main artery; both the left and right have 85-87 percent blockage, but the surgeon told us that he is not a candidate for a triple bypass, because he is also a insulin dependent diabetic and has been for about 20 years. Also, he has very narrow arteries.   My question is my husband believes that he doesn't have very long to live since the muscles are so weak. The doctor has also indicated that it could be 5 years. I  looked up some info on this, and the update is 2-5 yrs. I have accepted this might be true, so whatever you tell me will not upset me. My husband just turned 60.

    "content": "Dear Joan,   Thank you very much for using our website.   First of all, you have my deepest sympathy for your husband condition and hope that he gets well.   Congestive heart failure unfortunately has no cure except heart transplantation.   Otherwise, the patients' symptoms are treated with medications. In the last few years, there was an actual jump over in the treatment of congestive heart failure.   Now, there are some medications that actually improve survival rates if the patient is maintained on them. i do not know what kind of medications is your husband taking but i think it is very important that he takes them if he can according to his doctors.   These medications are  - Beta blockers group of medication  - ACE inhibitors group of medication   The combination of these 2 groups of medications was found to have a very strong on the quality of life and the longivity of patients in all the clinical trials that were done.   In addition to other medications such as water pills and digoxin, these 2 groups should be taken unless contra-indicated for a reason or another.   Nobody can predict how long does a patient with congestive heart failure can live, unless his condition is deteriorating as regards repeated admissions to the hospital separated by very narrow intervals together with development of other organ failures such as the kidney or the liver then i think it is few months or may be even less.   The best thing to do is try to be on the best treatment available for the time being and try to improve the quality of life that you are living right now and if you or your husband have any postponned projects to do, just try to do them.   Now, i am not sure whether anybody has mentionned that to you or not (and i am not sure where you live). But, if you are a resident of the United States, then patients who have severe congestive heart failure who are judged by their physician to have 6 months or less to live are eligible for the hospice program and it will be covered by medicare as well. The hospice program is a very good program involving people who are dedicted to soothing other people's pains and standing besides them in the worst moments. So, you could also ask your husband's doctor about that as well.   I wish that there was more i and any body else could offer but science is rapidly progressing forwards and evey body hopes to discover more that could help people like your husband.   Once more, thank you vey much for chosing our website http://doctorslounge.com and hope to hear from you soon.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Chuck and Betty,  Congestive heart failure in general has a bad prognosis if left untreated but if your mom is being treated then the prognosis improves.  If after hospitalization, your mother is feeling ok and she does not have any problems, and since she has access to medical care when needed, i would rather let her stay in a warmer place like arizona as compared to cold areas and any way, it is like 3 weeks away.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",
