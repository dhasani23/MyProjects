    "content": "Ok,  I have had this problem for a long time now, WAY to long probably..  My problem is that I do not have health insurance and can not afford it right now.  Anyway, I seem to go through periods where when I go to the bathroom I see a lot of blood in the toilet and when I wipe it seems to be mainly blood on the paper.  When I am doing the deed it feels like there is a cut on my rectum or something that just gets opened while going.  I can go for weeks with no pain or blood but then all of a sudden it starts back up again.  I have had a hemoroid, or atleast I think it was because it was a swollen vein looking thing on my rectum and it hurt pretty bad for a week or 2 but has since gone down.  I do not ever see blood in my underwear just in the toilet and on the paper.  I am a 23 year old male and I am in pretty good health with no major medical problems running in the family with the exception of a couple heart attacks which is unrelated.  I also want to add that the last couple times I used the bathroom the poop was REALLY big, but this was after I was forced to hold it in for a long period of time which might have something to do with that.  It also caused more blood then normal...  Do I have a cause for major concern here?  I am currently searching for good health insurance that I can afford so I can get a check up..\n\n",

This may not be important but the first time i ever saw blood in the toilet it just so happened to be after I had ate a lot of red jello and I thought that that was what it was, I guess that describes the color of the blood..   Also, I do not feel any pain or anything like that other then the opening of a cut feeling i get while using the bathroom...  No internal paid and no other physical problems...\n\n",

It is possible that you also may have an associated chronic anal fissure (acute anal fissures are very painful and usually cause streaking of the stool with blood).  I do not know your age.

    "content": "Hi, You have not mentioned about any pain. Therefore, i assume that it is painless.Also, you don't mention bleeding in drops or a \"splash in the pan\".  All this lends support to a possible diagnosis of a chronic anal fissure. This could bleed a little every now and then or can simply cause a \"streak\" of blood on the stool. However, although atypical, hemorrhoids can't be entirely ruled out.  You may first consult your regular family doctor who will be able to manage these conditions and then refer you (if needed) to a surgeon. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Segmental wall thickening in the colon",
    "content": "Hi, Bowel wall thickening (as reported on CT scans of the abdomen with contrast enhancement) refers to \"mural stratification\", which to a radiologist means the abnormal separation of the contrast-enhancing outer gut layers (serosa/muscularis propria) from the contrast-enhancing inner gut layers (mucosa/muscularis mucosa).    Bowel wall thickening can be  - focal (a few centimeters),  - segmental (10-30 cm), or  - diffuse (involving most of the small bowel or large bowel).   Focal thickening: Majority of neoplasms of the GI (gastrointestinal) tract commonly show up as a focal areas of bowel wall thickening. Inflammatory conditions such as  appendicitis, diverticulitis, and rarely tuberculosis may present with this picture.  Segmental thickening: usually seen in inflammatory pathologies such as Crohn's disease, intestinal ischemia, infectious enteritis, & radiation enteritis. Other considerations that may show this pattern are  lymphoma & intramural hemorrhage.  Diffuse thickening: is seen with a number of inflammatory pathologies, such as ulcerative colitis, infectious enteritis, and some non-inflammatory states such as edema associated with protein deficiency states, cirrhotic portal hypertension and low-flow ischemia.  In your case, as you seem to have had micro-perforations secondary to diverticulitis, it is probable that the segmental wall thickening that was reported could have been due to the inflammatory process in the general peritoneal cavity. However, it is mandatory that you should have yourself fully investigated (including colonoscopy/biopsy). Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, hopefully someone can give me some insight into my problem.   It started with what I thought was IBS.  I would eat, immediatly have to go to the restroom.  For a while Immodium helped with this issue.   About 3 weeks ago basiclly my system shut down.  Severe constipation.  Had two incidents where I thought I was fine and soiled clothing. After reading I suppose this is due to waste making its way around the blockage.   I tried milk of magnesia which gave me the runs so bad I was confined to the toilet for a day.   I would have the urge to go to the bathroom about every 15 minutes but would push and nothing would come out except maybe some little specks of fecal.   Also during these times when I thought I would have to go my stomach would get very warm.  Water intake is easily over 10 glasses per day. I have cut out soda and alcohol since this started. A hot bath sometimes would cause a small bowel movement.   Finally I went to see my care provider.  He gave me Miralax which after the second dose gave me four large bowel movements, which I was grateful for.    Immediatly after those bowel movements my stomach began to cramp pretty bad, figured it was just from the waste moving through.   Issue is after using Miralax and having the bowel movements I now have the urge to go but most of the time a clear mucus comes out in small amounts. This happens approx 20 times per day.  During this whole time there has been a little blood but seems to be only when I am pushing very hard to attempt to have a bowel movement.  I am now not pushing as much and hoping the miralax assists in clearing my bowels.   I am waiting for a referal to see another doc for a \"GI\".    Just curious as to what the mucus can be.  The bowels I have passed have not been watery but not what you would consider a normal bowel.  More like it is in chuncks about the size of marbles.   Any help you can give would be great.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  All your symptoms could be related to the laxatives. However, one needs exclude other conditions.  Passage of excessice amounts of mucus suggest causes such as (among others)... - Celiac disease - Ulcerative colitis - Crohn's disease  - Diverticulitis & - villous tumors of rectum. In some parts of the world, one may need to think of intestinal parasitic diseases as an important differential diagnoses.  Your overall description of symptoms tend to favour diverticular disease- 'diverticulosis coli' (the fact that you pass little blood & somewhat 'pellet-like' stools).  Considering your age, one needs to consider colo-rectal neoplasia as well in the differential.  You must consult your regular doctor first, who, after performing the priliminary examination will perhaps arrange for you to have a colonoscopy done. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Colo-vesical and colo-rectal fistulae are well known, but recto-seminal vesicular (recto-vesicular) fistulae are very rare,but have been reported.  Recto-seminal vesicular (recto-vesicular) fistulae have been reported  - as a complication of acute epididymitis, - as a complication of crohn's disease, - as a complication of abdomino-perineal resection for rectal cancers - as a complication of diverticulitis and  - as a complication of seminal vesicular cyst forming an abscess. Seminal vesiculography may demonstrate these fistulae.  Recto-urethral abscesses are also known.  Most of these present as passage of urine form anal canal or as pneumaturia, or recurrent UTIs.  Your complaint is rather unusual.It may or may not be semen that you seem to pass via the anus.  However, it may be better to consult a urologist to exclude the remote possibility of this being a recto-seminal vesicular fistula.  Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "I recently felt constipated for now apparent reason. I am a 38 year old male. I have not taken laxatives before but decided to try them. Tuesday i took 3 Magnesium type laxatives and after nothing worked i took 1 ex lax. After no results i took another Wednesday morning.  At about noon when it was apparent nothing was working i went to a family doctor and he prescribed Bisacodyl. I was told to take 4 right away and 4 4 hours later. I went a little in the evening and at 530am that morning.Both times very violently and basically pure Diarrhea. This i expected. Here it is Thursday evening and i am feeling kind of bloated and my stomach is a little crampy. The last time i went to the bathroom was about 3 hours ago.  I guess my question is that is this to be expected from the 15 or so laxatives i have taken in the last 36 hours or is this a sign of another problem? If it is normal how long till this goes away and when should i get worried? I have only drank liquids and soup as i am scared to eat as my stomach feels very weird. Should i be drinking and eating soups or should i eat as i normally do? Thank you in advance to for your answers.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Constipation, Laxatives and After Bloating",
    "content": "Hi, Firstly you need not be excessively worried, as this seems to be the first episode of constipation (however, it is good to be concerned).  Laxatives do not work the same way in all people.Have you been experiencing contipation prior to this episode or perhaps constipation alternating with diarrhea?  When one passes watery stool following intake of laxatives,it may mean either that  - there was no formed stool in the colon or - there could be 'spurious' diarrhea. This is due to very hard stool blocking some part of the colon causing an obstruction of sorts and the fluid trapped 'above' (proximal to) this level evacuates following laxative use and the hard stool remains as it is.  It may not be a bad idea to get examined by a doctor who will then be able to guide you better.  Best wishes!\n\n",

Recently, they have said that it has gone from stage 3B to stage 4 colon cancer. The only treatment that has been given is Chemo.   I read posting which the doctor had replied to a posting that Chemo alone is not going to cure the cancer. My question is what else needs to be done and why would they not give the proper treatment off the bat if Chemo alone will not prevent the spread? Do they need to do localized radiation or another kind of treatment (please advise so I can let the doctor know)?  The next question is how would one seek a second opinion that would be covered by my medical coverage (or that would not be costly) which is medicare/Kaiser if there is one?

You say that your cancer has now been said to be in stage IV.You have not mentioned the sites of spread.Also not mentioned is whether there is any local/regional recurrence.  For isolated metastasis to the liver, resection could be considered provided,the primary is adequately controlled and there are no other obvious metastasis.Radiotherapy has not much of a role in this situation.

    "content": "Hi I am 28 year old male and I am concerned about a change in my bowel habits.  A few months go, I noticed blood on the toilet paper. This only happened once and since I have had hemorrhoids before, I wasnt overly concerned at 1st. Then I also noticed a small amount of yellow/brown mucus on the toilet paper as well. Not everytime, maybe twice a week. I also had some red specks in my stool and was unsure whether it was blood or food. This caused me to start panicking.  I went to the Doctor and he said the specks were unlikely blood given my description. I had a rectal exam that was normal. He asked me to complete a FOBT and if it was positive we would do a colonoscopy. I couldnt wait for the results of the FOBT, I was causing myself too much stress worrying about what might be wrong. So I paid to have a virtual colonoscopy done privately. The results of both the FOBT and virtual colonoscopy came back fine, this was late July. My doctor said we should leave it at that and the blood and mucus was more than like due to small hemorrhoids that have cleared up.  However I have been unable to relax and convince myself that I am ok. Maybe it is because my doctor never actually diagnosed hemorrhoids and merely assumed they were the cause. Since July I have become concerned about my bowel habits. 6 months or so ago, I would have a bowel movement once daily. This has increased slightly, so now say 3 times a week I go twice and very occasionally 3 times. I havent really had any diarrhea, just a couple of times over the last couple of months where to odd bowel movement was very loose, but they have all been single occurences. I havent noticed any blood on my stool or on the toilet paper in a couple of months. The mucus is still sometimes present in very small amounts.  My question is basically, should I rely on the FOBT and virtual colonoscopy to tell me I am fine? Or should I also have a colonoscopy just to be safe? Can my stress be causing my bowel habit changes?  Thanks in advance!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  'virtual colonoscopy' (CT colonography) is a newer addition to the diagnostic modalities available for detection of colonic pathology.  There is an on-going debate as to whether it is as good as colonoscopy ('optical' colonoscopy) for diagnostic or screening purposes.  Optical colonoscopy has one undisputable advantage, that one can biopsy a lesion or perform a therapeutic manouvre(like snaring a polyp).Also,no radiation is involved.  CT-colonography is said to be not so efficient in detecting polyps smaller than 10mm and may miss 'flat' type of polyps.  CT-colonography is evolving and being refined. Therefore, some of these sited  disadvantages may be hopefully overcome in the future.Therefore, for the time being, i feel that you should undergo an Optical colonoscopy to put your mind at rest!. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: No cancer before but CEA=23 ng/ml",
    "content": "Hi, The CEA levels you have quoted are indeed high!  CEA levels may also be raised in some non-neoplastic conditions like ulcerative colitis, pancreatitis, infections, benign breast disease, peptic ulcers and cirrhosis. Benign disease does not usually cause an increase above 10 ng/ml.  The normal range for CEA in an adult non-smoker is <2.5 ng/ml and for a smoker <5.0 ng/ml.In smokers,it has been observed that the levels tend to normalize about 3 months after quitting smoking.   CEA is not an effective screening test for hidden(occult) cancer as many early tumors do not cause significant elevations. Also, many tumors never cause an abnormally elevated  levels,even in advanced disease.   Because of the observed variability between results obtained between laboratories, ideally, the same laboratory should  repeat the test when monitoring  patients with cancer.  As you have a family history of colorectal  cancer,I think you should consult your doctor again and discuss the option of repeating the test. Best wishes!\n\n",

I have been a little worried these last days, especially because I don't appear to have any of the benign conditions.  So, I have asked my first attention doctor to order a FDG-PET, which has been programed for today, here, in Barcelona.  It costs me 1,121 euros, but I think it is a wise investment.  Nevertheless, I will also do any conventional diagnostic tests that my doctor will consider, but at least, I will have some relief, if PET finds no malignancy.

    "content": "Approximately 7 years ago (or more), during sex, my girlfriend inserted a rubbery/flexible ball-type dildo into my anus.  It was not protect, and slipped inside.  At the time, I went to the bathroom, and passed a stool, but unwisely flushed before I realized that I should verify that it had passed.  I have had no symptoms since then (though 3 years ago, I had a series of bloody stools related to acute pain on the edge of my anus - which seemed to be more closely related to an anal fissure - over time, it healed, and I have not had significant problems since).  Reading a fiction book recently, it suggested that an object could go undetected and hidden, which made me think of this incident, and had me worried enough to consult here.  Needless to say, I would unquestionably prefer not going to a doctor at this point, for both the embarrassment and given the time.  My question then is this:  is it possible for the object to still be there, and how could I tell, short of an uncomfortable visit to the doctor.  I would appreciate a percentage chance of there being still an issue - rather than the blanket statement of \"seek help\", if possible.  Thank you\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Foreign Object in Rectum - Issues",
    "content": "Hi, As for your question \"how could I tell, short of an uncomfortable visit to the doctor\", the only unpalatable answer perhaps, is that there seems to be no way except to make the \"uncomfortable visit to the doctor\".  Foreign bodies have been known to remain in the rectum or remain higher up in the colon for variable lengths of time.Some may remain without producing untoward effects but quite a few are known to cause problems- at times serious(perforation,peritonitis, fistulation, obstruction etc).  First thing your doctor would do perhaps, is to perform a  DRE(digital rectal examination). If it is within reach,it may be diagnosed as such. If not, then some other tests would be necessary.  Not all foreign bodies are radio-opaque.Therefore, some may show up on bi-planar plain X-ray films. Non radio-opaque foreign bodies may be imaged by a CT or other imaging modalities. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "HI, I am 42 y/o female with rectal bleeding, so colonoscopy done and 3 cm sessile appearing polyp found in rectosigmoid junction approx 15 cm from anal verge. Appeared benign. Biopsies showed high grade dysplasia. Referred to major hospital for endoscopic removal. After removal, was determined to be a pedunculated T1 tubulovillous lesion with grade 3 cells. All scans/bloodwork for metastatic disease negative. Genetic testing negative, Also no family hx. Was referred for LAR. Pathology post surgery: no residual carcinoma identified. There is a nodule  (1.0 cm in greatest dimension) of epiploic fat showing fat necrosis, hemosiderin deposit and foreign body giant cell reaction. A single of 26 lymph nodes is positive for metastatic disease, with no evidence of extranodal extension. The colorectal surgeon told me i had stage 3 disease and gave me approx 40-60% survival odds.  I was referred for 4-6 months of FOLFOX/chemoradiation.  Back home i did my own research and found out i was actually stage IIIa and it appeared my odds were much better than what she had given me, and the oncologists have given me odds in the 90's. Do you agree with this? I am concerned about the grade 3 of 4. I always thought Grade 3 was poorly differentiated, yet my pathology on 2 different forms says the moderately differentiated grade 3 of 4. Is this a mistake or does that hospital maybe have a different grading system? My other questions are the following: How do you know how much chemo is enough? I am confused because other people i talk to are getting such different regimens. For myself, my plan is for 2 cycles chemo, 6 weeks chemoradiation, and then 6 more cycles FOLFOX. I am currently undergoing cycle 2 of the 6 having completed radiation. I know others have received the radiation plus 12 cycles of FULFOX. Is this \"enough\" for me? I am also concerned about the leucovorin shortage as my chemo center does not have it. I received one cycle without it already and at the same time had a 30% reduction in the 5FU/Oxaliplatin because of how my blood counts had been. With the last treatment i got Fusilev. Is this a good enough equivalent or should i be asking to switch to Xeloda? Also when on radiation, i did not get the continous 5FU, i got it only M-F for 4 of the 6 weeks, and now with the cycle of the missed leucovorin, I am wondering if i should do \"make up\" chemo? According to a calculator on the sloan kettering website chemo only gives me a 1% benefit..so wondering if i should even be doing it at all.. it is all so confusing. I apologize i know this got long,, but i really want to do everything i can to beat this cancer and these things are really bothering me, and i hope you will kindly answer my questions. Thank you so much.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  It is very hard to give you a prognostic assessment over the internet. It does seem that you are stage IIIa and the presence of only one lymph node in 26 is reassuring of course.   I think your doctor knows what he is doing. Yes, the leucovorin alternative is fine. I am not sure about the benefit of adding leucovorin to 5FU in adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. So missing a dose should not be a problem.  FOLFOX after chemoradiotherapy is recommended by one of the most important guidelines in the US (NCCN). However, there are some reports of increased blood toxicity - meaning decreased white blood cells, decreased hemoglobin and platelet counts.  There are concerns about the variable bioavailability of Xeloda and for this reason it seems sensible to use the IV regimen (5FU).  I hope this is useful.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you so much for your response. I did go over and look at the guidelines from the NCCN, but I am still unable to find how doctors determine how much chemo to give in the event of someone who has had radiation. It just says FOLFOX every 2 weeks..it does not say for how many cycles.  If the recommendations for me were to have 4-6 months of systemic chemotherapy in addition to the radiation..how does the doctor determine whether it should be 8 cycles or 12 cycles? Are there recommendations posted somewhere on this? Thank you\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Thank you for your question.  I think there may be a little confusion with the number of cycles here which may make things a little easier.  Each cycle of FOLFOX is broken down in two D1 and D15, meaning: what you call 12 'cycles' is actually 6 cycles and what you call 8 'cycles' is actually 4.  We traditionally stick to 6 cycles (12 sessions) for most chemotherapy regimens. Some patients at low risk can be given 4 cycles. Notice as well that this is usually related to the chemoradiotherapy regimen that you are taking. Chemoradiotherapy is delivered in many different ways and there is no 'standard' protocol.  I hope this helps.\n\n",

This is partly due to the various staging systems and treatment modalities(which are constantly changing!). Institutions tend to follow their own protocols as well. Dr.Tamer Fouad  has tried his best to clarify & answer your queries. Colonic cancers are staged according to the TNM staging system or at times the well known Duke's staging system. 6th & 7th editions of AJCC staging system have included the \"T' Category(tumor) into the stage III (IIIA,IIIB,IIIC) - this in effect, has brought some aspect of Duke's into TNM  . I am just trying to explain why & how it ends up being confusing.These changes are on-going and are primarily meant to improve the management & improve outcomes - but confusion is bound to be an inevitable side effect!!

    "content": "Hi hippiewitch, My advise to you would be... Do not try to clean the 'inside'.This is totally unnecesary.This is certain to cause harm.One of the things that may happen is injury to the rectal mucosa resulting in what is known as a 'solitary rectal ulcer' that can cause bleeding.The other thing that may happen is 'proctitis'- which is inflammation of the anal canal.  As you say you have OCD, you must consult your psychiatrist, reveal this practice of yours and get councelled. Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello  I have passed several white circular, solid masses with my feces over the passed few days. This however is not the first time, but since they have passed within a few days of each other versus a few weeks, I am growing concern.  They are relatively small and appear separate from my excrements. They are not the same texture, color, or resemble the feces. I have tried looking up what it could possible be, but I have yet to find a definitive answer.  I would appreciate your professional opinion in this matter; or, if you could direct me to the proper discipline that this would fall under.  Thank you in advance.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 54 year old male in good health other than ercent onset of constipation alternating with diarrhea and dark stools which are positive for blood per a home heme test.  I also have a first-degree relative who died from colon cancer at a young age and I was thinking of getting a colonoscopy.  I have had one horrible experience with \"conscious sedation\" ; a severe paradoxical reaction to Versed and a repeat try with Propofol was no better.  I would never do conscious sedaion again.  I'm a hospital pharmacist, so I have some familiarity with the procedure (I have watched several) as well as knowing the drugs used.  I'm willing to tolerate the discomfort of doing the exam drug-free (as is done in many countries), but when I try to schedule the exam I'm told that sedation is required.  My insurance covers this exam 100%, but I would be willing to pay cash if necessary to have it done without drugs.  I was recently the designated driver for a nurse friend who had this exam done with Versed and fentanyl and listening to her scream did nothing to reassure me that conscious sedation is desireable; but my symptoms are getting to the point where I really need to do the exam.  Any suggestions will be apperciated.  Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "I had this exam scheduled for today and they told me that they had done them without sedation and the office nurse told me that they were getting more than a few requests for doing the exam unsedated.  I did the prep, which wasn't easy because of the abdominal pain and reported for the exam and I got to meet the doctor.  At first, the doctor told me that I was doing the right thing self-referring for the colonoscopy because of my family history and symptoms, then she got quite irate when she noticed that I had requested the exam without sedation; she wouldn't discuss my previous problems with conscious sedation-I got a lecture on how busy they were and how much longer it took to do an unsedated exam (like this is my fault).  I offered to pay extra in cash if needed; but this was dismissed.  She said that they had done unsedated exams, but doing so sometimes wrecked their colonoscopy schedule.  I was again told that it was fairly imperative that I have the exam done and, upon review of my chart, conscious sedation would be a bad idea.  I did get a virtual a month ago and have polyps and an area that needs biopsied.   She left and a nurse came in and had me change into a gown, started an IV (for what, I don't know) and I laid on the gurney for about an hour.  When the nurse finally took me into the endo suite, the doctor said \"we don't like to do these exams without sedation anymore, it takes too long and it will be uncomfortable, then you  will tell others not to get the exam\".  No kidding, that's what she said , then she walked out. I asked the nurses what I should do next; they didn't know.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  A mass in the anterior mediastinum is most commonly due to a disease affecting the thymus. Thymic hyperplasia being the most common condition is entirely benign. Cancer arising from the thymus is relatively rare. What the report says is thymic hyperplasia would be put at the top of the list however, since this mass was not present in a previous scan the possibility of a tumor must be excluded.  Another common condition is a retrosternal extension of a thyroid goiter.   Metastasis in this area would be unlikely from a colon cancer. Tumors of the anterior mediastinum other than thymoma include Hodgkin's lymphoma as well as germ cell tumors.  Please keep us updated as to the condition of your wife. Good luck to her!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I am a 19 year old male. For the past two months I have had abdominal discomfort that is pretty much constant. It usually occurs in the lower left quadrant, but it also moves around to other places in my abdomen. I don't remember for how long, but I have had to strain to move bowel. I don't think it is constipation because I can go at least once a day. I also think that my stool may be thinner and sometimes flatter. I went to the doctor twice, but they said that I'm too young and that I shouldn't worry. However the symptoms have not gone away.  For the past six months my weight has been roughly around 160. However, I used to be 180 about a year and a half ago. I did not have a scale so I don't know how long it took for me to lose that weight. I wasn't trying to lose weight. My doctor says that she can only take weight loss into account if I was checking it regularly.   About a month ago I went to the ER for a strong tension headache and they did blood work and said that I did not have anemia. They also did urine test. Since I've read that abdominal pain and weight loss  only occur in late stages of colon cancer, and if I did have a late stage of colon cancer I would have anemia, I'm hoping that since I don't have anemia I don't have cancer.  My doctor says just take fish oil and I'll be fine. I have been taking it but nothing has changed.  What do think it could be? Should I just wait to see if it goes away?  Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I agree with the doctor's opinion that colon cancer would be way down the list of likely problems - not impossible; just highly unlikely.  I would concentrate on making healthy diet and exercise choices, drinking plenty of water and taking a multivitamin along with the fish oil.  Then give yourself time, trying not to worry and stress, since this can aggravate abdominal pain and GI function.  If no improvement, see your doctor again.  Meanwhile, make a journal of your weight fluctuation, symptoms, etc. so you will have a good record.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there.   I've had colitis since the summer of 2007, and have general been in remission. However, in the last month or so, i've had a relapse and have started bleeding both on the stool, and in the water and i've been experiencing more cramping which makes me go to the toilet. When i go to the toilet, it's often 'explosive' and with a sense of urgence, and sometimes i go without passing much stool.   Additionally, the stools are somtimes curled and in the last day or two, i've noticed some small black spots on the stool. Sometimes i feel there's less blood in the water, but then again, i'm still bleeding and going three times a day (as opposed to once or twice when i was in remission).   To summarise, does all this information mean something other than a simple flare-up?  Thanks.  Please write back, asap.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The symptoms you describe can easily be attributed to a flare up.  But, there is no way to be sure without having regular exams with your doctor as this condition sometimes results in the development of colon cancer. For this reason it is important to have followup care with your doctor who can monitor for complications.  Most doctors want to see their patients when they have a flare up.  You are also at risk for anemia due to blood loss so this should be monitored as well.  Be sure to follow your doctor's dietary guidelines, eat apples without the seeds or peels.  During a flare-up, move to a low fiber diet but once it is resolved resume the increased fiber.  Also, take a good multivitamin and eat a balanced, healthy diet.  Try to decrease stress and avoid ibuprofen or other OTC anti-inflammatory medications.    Good luck with this frustrating condition.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi again. Thanks for the help. The doctor suggested taking the asacol enema as he considered it a mild flare up. However, in the past, i found using made me want to go to toilet straight afterwards and didn't see the benefits. He also said i could take steroids if it got worse, but i really don't want to take them, due to their side-effects.  Therefore, i'm relying taking my current meds and a diet of baked potatoes, tuna, salmon, rice and various wheat-free and gluten-free products [meats, biscuits, etc]. I've got an appointment with my doctor in a month or two, but until then, i'm hoping i'll get better in the meantime [same thing as i did on previous flare up].  Also, i've noticed i'm going to bed earlier now, and waking up early - going to bed around 9 or 10pm and waking up around 6 or 7am. I'm getting my 7 hours sleep, but i was wondering why the change? I was going to bed around 1 or 2am and waking up at 11am or noon, before Christmas Day.  Thanks again.\n\n",

Along with this I have developed a pain in my right side behind my ribs that comes and goes and isnt tender to touch, a mouth ulcer and my stools have been a mix of diarreha and constipation and have done 1 black stool.before all this I had a BMI check which came back at 27.9 so i changed my diet to a bit more healthy foods.Im 26 male 5ft 7inches and weigh 12stones 12lbs.I have had piles before and bleeding on and off before but this time other symptoms have come into it.I also had an anal fissue about a year ago, I went to the doctor and he did a rectal examination and also felt around my stomach there is a pain when he pressed on my lower abdomen above my penis area.He arranged for a sigmoidscopy and Urine test.I left his office ina terrible state I am so worried by the thought I have bowel/colon cancer I have a 1 year old daughter who i worship and cannot bear the thought of losing my life before she gets to know me and how much i love her.  I took it upon myself at this point to visit the Hospital they gave me a Blood test and urine test he said these came back fine and seemed to think it could be a stomach ulcer, he said to contact my Doctor and request an URGENT OGD this also made me worried somthing was wrong but now I wont get seen for another week !! its making think it might be too late and the cancer will spread  Im so depressed at the minute cant help but feel this is bad.I have no history of Bowel or Colon cancer in my family thankfully I do lead a very sedantry lifestyle and bad diet for years now and im wondering if this is going to be my downfall? gave up smoking early this year also and have always had a sensitive stomach also last point I have developed a polyp before although this was a nasal polyp and has now gone by itself.  Sorry for the long post but I came here hoping for some information and  if theres a chance with my medical background with bowel symptoms I could have cancer?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  There are many causes that result in bleeding per rectum and alternating diarrhea and constipation.   In general Fresh Blood in stools are usually due to lower gastrointestinal GI bleeding.  Causes include  - Hemorrhoids or piles, they represent the most common cause of lower GI bleeding, and are easy to be diagnosed by clinical examination.  Anorectal fissures as well can result in Bleeding per rectum and are easily diagnosed.   - Inflammation of the mucosa lining the rectum or the rectum and colon a condition known as proctitis or proctocolitis respectively.  These conditions are either due to infectious diseases or non infectious disease as a part of inflammatory bowel disease (less likely and include Crohn's disease and Ulcerative colitis), they are usually associated with changes in the bowel habits (diarrhea) Diagnostic tests include stool analysis to check for parasites and protozoa. Segmoidoscopy is essential for diagnosis.  - Upper gastrointestinal causes like gastritis, esophagitis,GERD, gastric or doudenal ulcers rarely cause fresh blood in stool. These conditions usually cause dark stool due to digested blood but when bleeding is severe, fresh blood can be seen. These cnditions are associated with upper abdominal pain and tenderness and are usually related to meals. Upper endoscopy is essential for diagnosis.  - Irritable bowel syndrome IBS, is diagnosed by exclusion Commonly people who have IBS complain off  Abdominal pain or colic  A bloated abdomen  Gaseous distension  Either Diarrhea or Constipation or an alternating between both of them  Mucus or less commonly blood containing stools.   - The small intestine is a rare source for GI bleeding.  - Cancer is one of the causes to be excuded although not common at your age group. Physicians should always exclude serious causes while investigating for changes in bowel habit and GI bleeding regardless how likely they could be the cause.  Hope you find this information useful. I would advise you to follow up with your docotr, he might recommend a CBC, repeat stool analysis, and endocscopy.  Please keep us updated.  Best regards.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Colonoscopy vs. Virtual Colonography",
    "content": "Hello -  Neither type (virtual or true) is painful as a rule. If your friend, who has already had two, experienced pain (you don't say this, but I have to wonder), that would be very unusual. While a negative virtual exam is fairly sensitive, the true colonoscopy is more sensitive -- just about 100 per cent -- and allows immediate biopsy or removal of polyps, again, as a rule, without any pain during the procedure.   Both  procedures require the same prep the night before, which is the only really annoying thing about either one, but if a virtual leaves anything in question, as you've mentioned, the true procedure still has to be done anyway, so unless you feel awfully lucky or have some specific contraindication to having a true procedure done, you're better off just having the true colonoscopy done. Post-procedural pain is very unusual, and periprocedure pain is almost unheard of anymore. Also, the actual true procedure only takes about 15-20 minutes, so the time factor isn't much different from a virtual.   There are a few people who have absolute or relative contraindications to a true colonoscopy, but these are few and far between. Pain is extremely rare. I'd go with the true procedure every time it was necessary rather than risk wasting the  time of having to do it twice. That's just me, though.  I hope this is helpful to you. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Bloody diarrhea and changes in bowel habits usually occurs due to inflammation of the mucosa lining the rectum and the colon, a condition known as proctitis and proctocolitis, respectively.   These conditions are either due to infectious (e.g. parasites, protozoa) or non infectious causes like inflammatory bowel disease (including Crohn's disease and Ulcerative colitis).  - Crohn's disease and Ulcerative colitis: They have very similar pathogenesis thus give similar clinical picture in the form of bouts of watery or bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain. While, Ulcerative colitis affects mainly in the large bowel (colon and rectum), Crohn's disease can occur anywhere in the digestive tract. Patient usually lose weight and if the disease becomes active early during childhood, growth retardation may occur. Colonoscopy and biopsy are diagnostic.  Medications used in the treatment of these diseases can result in long term remission of the symptoms, but not in cure. Persistent and frequent attacks mandate medical consultation and treatment other wise serious complications may occur.  - Infections include a variety of parasites and protozoa e. g. Entamoeba histolytica. Diagnostic tests include stool analysis and culture to check for parasites and protozoa. Specific antimicrobial therapy is used for treatment accordingly.  Other causes to be looked for include: - Colon polyps and colon cancer should be excluded. Colonoscopy and biopsy are of choice.  - Irritable bowel syndrome IBS is a disease diagnosed by exclusion. Patients present with abdominal pain or colic and either Diarrhea or Constipation or an alternating between both of them with mucus or less commonly blood containing stools. Symptoms increase during periods of stress.  Other diseases to be excluded although less likely are Gastritis, GERD, and Peptic ulcer. But Blood in stools is usually occult and not fresh red.   As you can see, there is no substitution for direct clinical examination and complete history especially that your symptoms are not mild, very concerning and shared by different diseases.  I hope you can be able to contact your doctor soon. Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "title": "Abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea",
    "content": "I have a question for you.  I have been to the ER 3 times in the last week.  On thursday, the 21st, i began experiencing abdominal pain and diarrhea and thought i had a stomach bug.  on that saturday, i saw bright red blood in my diarrhea along with the pain, and went to the ER.  they did blood work and a CT scan of the abdomen and said they thought i had an infection.  i was put on flagyl and cipro.  before i got my meds filled, the pain got so bad on sunday i had to go back to the ER.  they said to get the meds filled and i would get better.  I was feeling a little better and went to my Doctor for a follow up on wednesday and was taken off the flagyl as he said i didnt need it.  the next day, thursday, i was in so much pain i went back to the ER.  another bunch of bloodwork and some pain meds through IV, and a stool sample, and the DR said he though i had C-diff, although the test was negative.  The c-diff test was negative twice, but the ER doc said that i fit the profile for c-diff, as i was on tetrocycline for about 40 days and then stopped taken it, and then the pain and symptoms came on.  the ER put me back on flagyl and ive been getting better, although the pain is still there, not as bad though. I have also been having lower back pain for a couple days now. the diarrhea isnt as bad either, and has been drastically reduced.  the 3rd ER visit was on thursday.  i went back to my doctor today and he said i didnt have c-diff and wants to take me off the flagyl again, but im hesitant cause last time he took me off of it i got worse.  he is sending me to a gastro doc on sept 19, but says to cancel if i get better.  any suggestions as to what is going on.  im 28 and this came on pretty fast.  im worried it could be something serious.  thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Clostridium difficile is a gram-positive, anaerobic, spore-forming bacillus. Toxins released after colonization with C difficile cause inflammation and damage of the colonic mucosa, a condition known as C difficile colitis.  Prior exposure to antibiotics (even brief exposure) is the major risk factor for C difficile colitis. The most common antibiotics implicated in C difficile colitis include cephalosporins, clindamycin, and ampicillin/amoxicillin. Tetracycline occasionally causes C difficile colitis.   C difficile infection commonly symptomatize with mild diarrhea, abdominal cramping and occasionally blood in stool. Sever forms of C difficile colitis results in acute abdomen and fulminant life-threatening colitis.  In addition to history and clinical examination, stool analysis is used to diagnose C difficile infection as follows: The stool cytotoxin test is the test of choice but expensive and not rapid.  Enzyme immunoassays are more rapid, less expensive, if negative has to be repeated. Stool culture is not helpful in C difficile diagnosis but is essential to exclude other organisms.   Treatment includes oral flagyl or Vancomycin for 10-14 days and symptomatic treatment . Symptomatic improvement is expected after 3 days.  Consultation of gastroenterologist and colonoscopy may be needed in complicated cases.  Your history starting from being on one of the antibiotics that are known to cause C difficile colitis and symptom improvement on flagyl is very suggestive. If the stool test that have been done was one of the enzyme immunoassays, it should be repeated and sometimes infection is discovered after three repeated tests.  Other types of infections to be excluded include a variety of parasites, protozoa and viruses e. g. Entamoeba histolytica and Salmonella. Other causes to be excluded  (less likely) include IBS and inflammatory disease.   IBS is one of the most common disorders that is seen in the clinic presents mainly with alternating diarrhea and constipation and rarely with blood in stools.   Inflammatory diseases like Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, chronic conditions that present mainly with bloody diarhhea.  I advise you to follow up with your doctor. Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 49 year old women and have over the past several months had thin (flat, but bigger than a pencil) and loose stools. I have a consultation appointment for a colonoscopy coming up this Monday.  I am driving myself crazy with fear that I have colon cancer. I don't have any pain or seen any blood in my stools or the toilet bowl.  I believe my great grandmother died of colon cancer in her 80's, no other known family history.  I haven't had the best diet over the years, but have been adding more fruits, vegetables and fiber to my diet.  I began taking a tablespoon of psyllium every day a little more than a year ago.   I don't recall having any issues with my bowels and began taking the psyllium as a way to add fiber, but found my bowel movements to be really good until a few months ago with the added fiber.  I have had 3 bouts of pain over the past 3 years in the lower left abdomin area after eating an apple.  My doctor said possibly diverticulitis.  I have had a scan of my abdominal area...they found a possible cyst on my kidney, so I then went for a CT which showed the same thing, but smaller in size.    Back to my questions, are there any other conditions that would cause thin and loose stools?   Is it possible that polyps can grow to a size that would cause a thin stool?   Also, one more question...should stools float or sink?    I appreciate any help you can give me.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Thin and loose stools -what can it be other than cancer?",
    "content": "Hello, Causes of loose stool (change in consistency) and diarrhea (increased in frequency too) include Irritable bowel syndrome IBS, food intolerance, inflammatory changes in the wall of the intestine and malabsorption.  Psyllium is mainly used as a dietary fiber, which is not absorbed by the small intestine. Mechanism of action involves excess water absorption and stimulating normal bowel elimination. One of the minor side effects of psyllium is diarrhea and loose stool, especially with sufficient water intake.  In food intolerance, symptoms occur after ingestion of certain types of food like Lactose intolerance and Gluten intolerance.  Irritable bowel syndrome IBS is believed to be due to autonomic dysfunction or hormonal imbalance that can be easily controlled by simple changes in the lifestyle, diet. Certain types of foods contain, chocolate, milk and alcohol might aggravate the condition. Stress increases the frequency and the severity of symptoms in almost all cases. Diagnosis is made by exclusion of other causes.  Other causes to be excluded although less likely: - Colitis due to infectious or inflammatory disorders, it is usually associated pain and tender abdomen. - Appendicitis, pain and tenderness usually present and in the right iliac fossa.  Changes in bowel habits are always alarming and should be properly investigated. Tumors in the colon should be excluded considering your positive family history.  Investigations include: Stool analysis and careful microscopic study . Stool culture is also important. Estimation of fat content in stools is also useful. Colonoscopy.  I advise you to follow up with your doctor. Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

After that I went and got a colonoscopy to check for cancer or anything there. They gave me medication that calmed me way down and I watched the whole procedure on the monitor. I could see the Polp's on the monitor and I could see where he was taking them off. When I went back to get my result's he said I had 2 prcancer's polyp's and 1 was benign and he removed all of them and said see you in three years.

    "title": "Re: pre cancer polyp's",
    "content": "Hello,  People who are diagnosed with colon polyps are categorized into average risk, high risk and very high risk groups according to the multiplicity, size,degree of dysplasia, their macroscopic picture, personal and family history of colon polyps or cancer.  In your condition, having multiple polyps that are proved to be precancerous put you into the high risk category. Management is colonoscopy and removal of all polyps.   Then another colonoscopy should be done within three years, if this is proved to be normal you are put into the average risk group (above 50 years old) for them follow up with FOBT annually and colonoscopy every ten years is the standard of care.  Colonoscopic polypectomy and subsequent surveillance reduce the incidence of colon cancer by 90%, compared to unscreened controls.  Low folate level is commonly seen in alcoholics and malnourished individuals. It causes anemia which presents with easy fatigability.   Some epidemiological studies showed that folate deficiency has a role in colon carcinogenesis.   It is good that you have been managed properly for both conditions, and whether correcting folic acid level or resection of these polyps improved your symptoms can not be clarified but surely they both did improved your symptoms and your general condition.  So, I advise you to follow up with you doctor and to carefully report your symptoms to him.  Please keep up us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "My 51-year old husband had emergency surgery for a ruptured appendix 3 weeks ago.  His body had formed an abscess so he didn't have peritonitis.  He's doing well and back to work.  However, when he had his stitches removed, the surgeon told us that the inflammation came from outside the appendix which is atypical.  He suggested that my husband consult with a gastroenterologist.  In doing research, I found that appendicitis over the age of 40 has been associated with colon cancer.  Is this correct?  My husband has a colonoscopy scheduled for next month, but I'm very nervous about this.  What else may have caused the inflammation from outside the appendix?   A contrast CT scan was used to diagnose the appendicitis....would that have shown any sign of colon cancer?Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  It is true that about 3% of patients over the age of 40 with appendicitis may have an underlying colonic cancer. In fact right sided tumors may cause obstruction of the lumen of the appendix resulting in appendicitis and right iliac fossa abscess although rare. Left sided colonic tumors may also present with appendicitis.  Thus, it is important to search for an underlying colonic cancer in elderly patients presenting with appendicitis.   CT imaging is not enough and colonoscopy and biopsy are essential for all patients to exclude malignancy. This is usually done within few (6) weeks from appendicectomy when the patient recovers. Other causes include fecalith (hard feces), lymphoid hyperplasia and parasites.  So, I advise you to follow up with his doctor. Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Suika, When bleeding is a result from the upper gastrointestinal tract, for example, the stomach, small intestines, etc., the appearance of blood is dark and tarry/black in appearance. When blood is from the lower gastrointestinal tract, for example, the large intestine or rectum it can range in colors from maroon to bright red. The cause of bloody stool can be numerous such as, hemorrhoids, anal fissures or tears, diverticulosis, diverticulitis, colitis, and the list goes on. Rectal bleeding can also indicate even more serious conditions. The blood loss can lead to anemia resulting in pallor, fatigue and a general feeling of malaise as well as shortness of breath. Most areas offer evaluations for a reduced fee or free which is typically based on income for people whom are uninsured. Rectal bleeding is abnormal and particularly since this seems to be a longstanding or ongoing problem would certainly warrant an evaluation by a physician. I would srongly encourage your grandmother to have an evaluation. Best wishes. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  Good that you found out the cause of your abdominal distress and are being treated for it. The other pain could be related (referred pain can often show up in odd areas, especially where the intestinal tract is concerned).  I don't see anything in your post which would suggest a cancerous growth and certainly not a prostate infection. Symptoms of prostatitis are pretty specific to the urinary tract and involve painful and difficult urination as well as fever and a profoundly sick feeling (much like flu). The pain you're feeling is probably some residual referred pain due to diverticulitis. The splenic flexure (upper left abdominal quadrant, where I take your new pain to be showing up) is a very touchy area and trapped gas or irritation from diverticula can certain cause pain there. The natural course of most stuff traveling that route would then be downward, so that all fits with my theory of pain related to the primary problem. Glad you have it diagnosed and hope the treatment will soon have you feeling a lot better. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Blood streaks on toilet tissue/clean colonoscopy 15 months a",
    "content": "Hello, This is not worrisome and most likely it is from some tissue trauma in the lower bowel/rectum.  Hemorrhoids (internal or external) are the most common cause but sometimes there are little fissures or breaks in the skin, usually caused by straining with bowel movements.  If you have been constipated, it would be wise to treat that and most likely the bleeding will stop.    Prevention of hemorrhoids/constipation: Drink lots of water, add a daily fiber supplement such as Metamucil, Citracel or Konsyl, exercise regularly (even a daily walk), and eat a diet rich in high fiber foods, whole grains, fruits and vegetables (preferably with skins).  Try not to ever neglect your urge to have a bowel movement.  Busy-ness often results in constipation when you put it off.  If in spite of efforts to reduce constipation the bleeding should get worse, see your doctor because rectal bleeding should not be ignored.  But the colonoscopy is a good sign that nothing serious is going on in the bowel.  These screenings catch early signs, long before you would notice anything.  Also blood from higher in the bowel or from the stomach (as with ulcers) is often dark or black since it is older when it reaches the anus.  Red blood is fresh and usually implies trauma closer to the outside - again suggesting hemorrhoids or anal fissures (small tears).  Best wishes.\n\n",

I have a badly damaged lumbar/sacral spine and wake up with bad stabbing lower back pains. I have been told this is due to damaged spine but my health anxiety disorder is linking the pains with the time of day that I have my bowel movements.  My Dr has tried to reassure me that my pain is from my spine and there are no reasons for me to have more invasive tests that would be extremely difficult given my spinal problems.  Should I stop worrying given the amount of tests I have had  that are all normal?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Cancer does not jump out at me here.  I think you have done a good job ruling out serious bowel disorders.  Bowel movements can put stress on a bad back so this makes sense.  I suspect most of your symptoms are related to the IBS and would not worry excessively.  You may benefit from some relaxation techiques or alternative medicine such as therapy, hypnosis or even acupuncture.  Many people who don't find help in the traditional treatments respond to these and other techniques.    If you do not take a fiber supplement, you may want to try that.  Daily Metamucil or Citracel, etc. can make a big difference.  The gas is a difficult problem to deal with and even anti-gas medication does not always do the trick.    Colonoscopy screening is recommended for everyone age 50 and over, earlier if there is a family history of colon cancer.    Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The most common cause of rectal bleeding is hemorrhoids which may be internal and you are not even aware they are there.  If you have constipation and occasionally strain with bowel movements, this is especially likely.  At your age you should have a colonoscopy if you haven't had one already.  This is a recommended screening procedure to rule out early problems that may be present.  So it would be good to see a proctologist, colorectal surgeon, gastroenterologist or endoscopy lab for a referral to someone for the screening.  A simple exam in the office can diagnose hemorrhoids.  If this is the case, you should add fiber and water to your diet, get regular exercise and use a mild laxative to avoid straining and aggravating the hemorrhoids.  Taking a daily soluble fiber supplement such as metamucil, citracil, or Konsyl can make a big difference.  You can also add prunes or prune juice to your breakfast, replace white, refined flours with whole grains and eat lots of vegetables.  These can all make a difference.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 43-year-old female in basically good health.  I don't drink or smoke, and I have no history of colorectal cancer in my family.  Last year, around this same time of year, I had an episode of rectal bleeding that lasted several weeks.  I had a colonoscopy last March, which came back negative.  I have been free of rectal bleeding with bowel movements until this past week.  Now, I have bright red blood with every bowel movement (my BMs are normal), sometimes it's just a lot on the toilet paper, sometimes it's in the bowl, too.  I do have a small external hemorrhoid, but I cannot believe anything that small is causing this much bleeding.  Should I not worry b/c my last colonoscopy was normal, less than a year ago?  Or should I go back to see my gastroenterologist?  Please advise me.  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I suspect it is the internal hemorrhoid.  Perhaps you have developed more of these as well.  Do you have a tendency to be constipated?  If so, adding fiber and using a mild laxative such as Miralax could help a lot.  If the bleeding continues it would be wise to consult with your gastroenterologist, proctologist, or other doctor just to be on the safe side.  The fact you are current on your colonoscopy and it was normal is encouraging.  Also, red blood with bowel movements does suggest low abrasions as opposed to internal bleeding.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "On Christmas Eve (what a day to have this happen), I was at work and had to go to the bathroom.  I went, and while going didn't experience anything that I'd consider abnormal.  There wasn't any pain or anything like that.  However, when wiping there was blood on the toilet paper (bright red).  That is the first time that has ever happened.  Since then I have had three bowel movements.  Of the three, two did not have any blood (at least, none that I could see) and one had a very very tiny spec of blood on the stool.  The stool itself looked more or less normal in size and color (brown), but there were a few black spots on the stool (black spots are the best way I can think of to describe it).  My question, I guess, is how concerned should I be?  Obviously, I need to have this checked out, and plan to, but since seeing the blood on Christmas Eve I have only been imagining the worst (like advanced colon cancer).  Some information about me:  Age 30, Male Approx. 5' 9 1/2 \", 185-190 lbs. Not obese or very overweight, but not physically active. No history of colon cancer in my family that I am aware of, however my father had neck cancer earlier in the year, and when he turned 50 (he's 54 now), had a colonoscopy and a polyp was found (can't remember if it was benign or precancerous).  Other than the blood, I don't believe I am suffering from any symptoms/problems.  I don't feel constipated nor have diarrhea.  No abdominal pains.  I don't feel weak or sick.  Any information or advice anyone can give me would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I'm sorry for your distress around the holidays.  Most of the time bright red blood with bowel movements is related to hemorrhoids which can occur inside the rectum where you can't even see they are there.  Your age does not put you in a high risk category for cancer, but I know this is always the first thought that enters your mind.  Most cases like yours are not cancer so don't stress too much.  It would be smart to check it out to be sure, however, so schedule an appointment with your family practice doctor, internal medicine doctor or proctologist.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for the reply, I appreciate it.  Since my first post, I've had bowel movements every day.  Some had no blood at all, but the last couple did.  It appears to be the same as the first time I saw blood.  The blood was on the toilet paper and some in the bowl, but didn't appear to be in the stool itself.  Would it make sense that a hemroid would cause bleeding for one BM but not for another?  Another thing I noticed, was that off and on during the day this week, I've had very slight cramps, I think.  The reason why I say \"I think\" is because it's so mild I don't even know what else you'd call it.  I can \"feel\" it a bit below my belly button, but it's nothing that hurts or interrupts my ability to get through my day.  Since the first time I saw that blood, I've done nothing but obsessively stress over it, and I wonder if that could be why I might be feeling those mild \"cramps\"?\n\n",

My younger sister (age 44) is in her 6th month of remission from Stage IV anal cancer with metastasis to the inguinal lymph nodes and liver.  Prior to this, she had a long-standing a history of dysmotility, stricture and constipation.  For the past year, I have had changes in bowel habits presenting in frequent movements of 4-5 per day. Movements are always soft, and either pencil-thin, ribbon-like, or triangular shaped, bulky and light-colored.  Movements are always in the morning to early afternoon and associated with eating.  Occasionally, there will be oil floating on the surface of the water.    A colonoscopy was done 6 months ago which revealed \"nodular mucosa\" in the hepatic fexure, transverse, decending and sigmoid colon and one, non-bleeding sessile polyp was removed.  Size unknown.  The report stated that due to poor prep, visualization of lesions less than 1 mm could be easily missed.  Histology reported no abnormalities in tissue samples.  The doctor recommended repeat colonoscopy in 5 years.    I would like to know what is causing these symptoms and whether a repeat colonoscopy should be performed sooner than the doctor's recommendation.\n\n",

Given, that you have no reason to doubt their expertise I would say you are as safe as we can ever know.  The presence of dymotility, stricture and constipation are all very common and have not been linked to anal cancer.  Changes in bowel habits can be caused by many things which can mostly be excluded by a colonoscopy. This leaves the possibility of functional disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This is a very common cause (the most common) of motility disorders and is a diagnosis of exclusion.  If however, you should experience any new symptoms or progression of your current symptoms then you should seek immediate medical attention.  Best regards,\n\n",

I would like to know what are the outward signs that he is in the last stage or stages of his cancer? He has a family doctor trying to manage his pain but he has no tests to see if the cancer has spread. He doesn't want hospice so my husband and I are caring for him the best we can but it is getting increasingly difficult as he is becoming very absent minded and a little loopy. He is also very weak but insists on driving which scares my husband to death. He is taking Lortab for the pain and we originally thought that maybe the pain meds were causing him to \"talk out of his head\" but we are careful not to let him take to much so I don't believe that this is the cause. He has lost a lot of weight since discontinuing treatments but he drinks ensure everyday without fail. He has lost his appetite but eats at least once a day. It seems to upset his stomach and he gets very nauseous. He also takes phenergan and Cipro 500. He has a constant headache but he is having some teeth pulled in a few days and hopefully that will help with the headaches. He is on an antibiotoc from the dentist for the few days before the extraction. I just want to know what we should expect or an approximate on the stage that he is in.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I am sorry to hear about your father-in-law's condition. Where was his metastasis and how was it treated - only chemotherapy? Can you tell me which chemotherapy regimens he took?  We do not depend on symptoms to stage colon cancer. Rather, we tend to look for more objective evidence such as CT scan (most commonly used) when we suspect relapse.  I know this is a difficult situation, but with a lot of persuasion you may be able to convince him that there is always a risk that he loose all the good that he has achieved from his long course in chemotherapy. Tell him that any advice he gets from his doctor is subject to his consent. No one will force him to do anything, but neglecting himself is not the right thing to do.  I don't think he should be allowed to drive a car in this condition. He could harm someone else as well as himself.  Even if your father-in-law completely rejects the idea of following up with his doctor (that doesn't mean you should stop trying), you can always consult his doctor and ask him for advice.  Unfortunately, patients that go this course may end up requiring medical help at a late stage, when they basically are unable to resist attempts to do so. There is also very little that can be done for them at this stage.  Good luck and best wishes.\n\n",

And then i started to notice occasional pain when i would use the toilet.  I also noticed a lump on my anus.  I have stayed with this occasionally intense pain for all this time, until last may when I went to the doctor for the first time to ask about my vaginal discharge and to do a checkup, and at the same time, I decided to ask him about what i thought was a hemorroid.  He said he sees the lump but it's not much to be concerned about. And all my blood tests came back normal.  Over the past month or two, ive been having some excruciating pain, to the point that I scream sometimes! It feels like my anus has gotten tighter and like i'm being cut with a knife!  I still sometimes find blood in my stool. It's scary to even go to the bathroom.  By the way, my mother told me that she has a long extra piece of meat hanging from her anus, and her mother has the same.  What should I do, and what could it be? What tests do i need to tell the doctor to run? I don't want my problem to go as far as my mother's..\n\n",

The other thing that commonly causes pain and bleeding is an anal fissure.  This is basically a tear in the lining of the anus that can cause severe pain.  I would recommend you see your regular doctor about this for an evaluation and treatment recommendation.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you Dr.  I saw a family doctor about this a few days ago, because the pain was too excruciating.  She examined the anal area and said she can see that I have 2 tears, one at 5 o'clock and one at 10 o'clock.  She did some sort of test to see if there's blood, and she said it's POSITIVE.  She prescribed Anamantle.  I will start using it today.  Is a tear also called a fissure?  Also, I read alot of things online about fissures, and about anamantle, and they were connecting themselves with endometriosis and other diseases.  If the doctor saw tears, should I stop looking further into this? Also, should I get a sigmoidoscopy? Also, it seems like i read that when the doctors do pap tests and they find inflammation, they can be a cause for my anal problem. (There was inflammation found by a doc 2 yrs ago, and another 5 mths).  Any input is appreciated. thank you.  kandy  endometriosis\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I can certainly understand your reluctance to undergo the type of sedation that might be used with a colonoscopy and I do not know what alternatives there might be.  I suspect there could be anesthesia that would not be so hard on you but you could have a greater awareness of the procedure and this is what bothers people the most.  As you have indicated your own anxiety about such things, I would suspect this to be the case.    They do have virtual colonoscopy now and no sedation is needed for this.  The virtual is not perfect and it shows less detail so it cannot pick up on the very small polyps.  In addition, if polyps are found, they cannot be removed on the spot as they are in the traditional test.  Therefore, a follow up would be required anyway and you are back at square one.  But in your case, it would certainly be better than getting no testing at all.   Of course it may or may not be available in your area, but you could inquire about it.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "At age 28, I underwent a colonoscopy screening due to stomach pain.  I have IBS and have had it for years (since pre-puberty).  During this screening, multiple polyps were found.  Two of the polyps detected were already of size that they could not be removed during the colonoscopy.  I later underwent a right hemicolectomy.  The following year, actually 11 months since the colectomy, 5 more polyps had grown.  My doctors remarks to my mother (whom came to drive me) were I would have to be screened every year as I developed them fast.  My question is does this lead me to believe I have familial polyposis?   From most articles I have read the number of polyps are more substantial than what I have had, but still I have quite a few and they develop so fast and tend to grow large if unchecked apparently. My next question would be, does this mean at some point I will have cancer, no matter if I receive my screenings once a year?    Age now: 30 (next test next Feb.) Female Diabetes, colon polyps, more things diagnosised than I know what to do with. Surgeries:  TMJ surgery, 2 D&C's, Gallbladder removal, tubal ligation, tubal reversal, right hemicolectomy, Lap. abscess removal, 2 septoplastys, FESS, T&A, turbinate reduction   Family history:  no family history of this or colon cancer from what I can find.

If any polyps are seen they can be removed in an effort to reduce the risk of future colon cancer.  I am not aware of there being an association between lymphoma and polyps of the GI tract.

    "content": "Dear Coookiie, There are many things that can contribute to constipation.  It would be helpful to know more about your medical history, any underlying medical problems, and routine medications that you take.  A young person with constipation may signal one type of problem, an older person with co-morbidities may have other contributing factors.  Pain medicines have an unfortunate side effect of \"slowing\" down intestinal motility, and can be responsible for serious constipation problems.  Dehydration can also contribute.  Changes in eating habits, decreasing fiber in the diet, or eating binding types of foods excessively can also be the culprits.  Certain medications will slow the bowels as well.  It is always the best way to go when self-diagnosing to weight all the factors in your lifestyle and health habits.  The best solution to an acute problem is to identify the source of the problem and eliminate or change it.  If all else fails and you need to address it to a healthcare professional, I recommend you first talk to your primary MD.  Your problem may be easily addressed at that level without the need for intervention from a specialist, which by the way would be a gastro-enterologist (meaning a specialist in  stomach/intestines).  Don't underestimate the knowledge base of your primary MD!  He/she could pleasantly surprise you!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Your symptoms can be associated with many diseases of the colon. Most commonly they are associated with irritable bowel syndrome. However, the most dangerous cause is colon cancer as you mentioned.  In clinical practice it is important to exclude the most dangerous possibility. This is done using an analysis of symptoms, a physical examination and if necessary some diagnostic and screening tests.  Given the limitations of the internet we are only able to assess your symptoms, however, the fact that you have been to a doctor should also be reassuring.   Exclusion of cancer starts by assessing the patient's risk and the presence of any alarming signs. These alarming signs include age over 50, dysphagia, protracted vomitting, anorexia and unexplained weight loss (>3kg) as the presence of signs of gastrointestinal bleeding and a palpable mass on examination.  Regarding irritable bowel syndrome, there are valuable clinical criteria which help in our assessment. One such set of criterias is known as the Rome II Diagnostic Criteria for Irritable Bowel Syndrome. Given that there are no alarming signs and the Rome Criteria are met, it is safe to follow the patient at a later date.  Best regards, and let me know if you have any further questions.\n\n",

I really feel like passing it out & it pass little only(liquid form) and feel that is so hard and can't pass out. At about 2am, I try my best to pass it out & small size stone(Sh*t) came out. When I try to wash it away(on the floor) because I forced it like hell, it took several seconds to be wash up because the thing is really like a stone...  I have not been passing out about 1 week because I'm on diet so don't really go to the toilet. But when I started to eat alot yesterday, this things happen. It is really pain whenever at my back and hard for me to sit down or lying down.  I have been to the doctor this morning and the doctor only checked and pressed my stomach and gave me medicine \"Liquid Parrafin\". I don't know whether it is going to cure or not. I can't stand the pain and hope anyone can help me with it whether is going to cure quickly or few days...  Hmm....Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Look, this is really embarrasing.  I have a place between my legs that looks like a swollen mole.  When I'm at work I sweat alot.  Along with that this mass is exactly where my legs rub together.  The mass has been there before from the same thing.  To be honest with you it hurt so much I simply pulled it off.  It was only hanging on by a small piece of skin.  It was a little bigger than a pea.  It did not bleed when I pulled it off, nor did it hurt that much.  Now it is back and gets very irritated when my legs rub together for a while.  About the same size as last time.  Was just going to remove it, but got curious as to what exactly it is.  Kind of scared.  By the way I am 35 and no family history of anything like this.  Please email me and let me know what you think.  Thank You.  billo73@msn.com\n\n",

There are several possibilities as to what may be causing your bleeding.  You may have hemorrhoids (enlarged veins) that have begun to bleed.

I understand your hesitancy with not having insurance; however, persistant rectal bleeding can be very concerning and should be evaluated.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I'm currnenly not stressing about it because 'if it has to be done,  it has to be done' but i do find the thought of having my bum and 'acompnaying areas' exposed. I am very self contious about 'this particular test' and would like any information as to how 'exposed' i will be. I'm not worried about my bum being exposed really just the 'other area'. I know i will have to wear a gown - so i have read on the internet. But i can't find any of this type of information on the internet. Like:  can i still wear underwear? etc and how exposed i'll be.  If i can get any information on 'this' part of the procedure i woudl be very grateful.  Thanks Bindy\n\n",

    "title": "Blood in stool, constipation, some pain in left abdomen",
    "content": "Hi, I am a 22 year old white male.  On February 15th I had a mild case of diarhea which the following day turned into a week of constipation.  Over the week pain formed in my lower left abdomen as would be expected from normal constipation (when I have pain recently it has been in the same location).  During that week the lymph node under my left arm was also rather swollen but has since gone away.  Now my bowel movements are rather infrequent and are of of small quantity so to speak.  They do contain dark stripes of blood in them, though I am uncertain as to if this is just on the outer portions or continue through.  I do occasionally notice some brighter pink spots as well, again, uncertain as to if this permiates the matter itself or is only on the surface.  Before I realized that I was constipated I strained rather hard for a day or two because the pain was rather intense for a short while (potentially fissures?).  Currently I still have to strain to a milder degree, but still more-so than is normal for myself.  I have been are rather sleep prone individual my whole life, but recently I've been sleeping upward of 12-14 hours and still feel exhausted all day.  I have had a rather large amount of gas as well.  My eating habits  have changed recently (lessened to two meals, though very close together to the point I would almost consider it a single meal) which could be a distinct factor in many of these symptoms.  Lower than normal intake of fluids as well averaging around 1L a day.  I know the following symptoms are most likely unrelated, however I have noticed a slight degrade in my vision, sometimes unable to focus properly at first (which is possibly just due to the fact that everyone in my family wears glasses and has needed them around this age), and had a shortness of breath.  I have recently gained about 2kg back since noticing I had dropped from 57kg to 55kg.  I have not had any past diagnoses of serious illness, though at one point when I was 13 a doctor suggested I have a mole removed from my leg suspecting it to be cancerous (though several other opinons disagreed with this and I still have it).  My grandfather on my dad's side had cancer, though I am uncertain as to what kind and I seem to recall it being environmentally related to asbestos.  My aunt on my mothers side has leukemia and her mother (my grandmother) was found to have what my aunt calls \"stage 4 ovarian cancer\" after her death (died during bypass surgery) though I am uncertain as to correct terminology.  I am relatively sure that one of the first suggestions is going to be \"visit a doctor\", however, I am studying in Japan until August.  Before coming here I recall having an examination.  I know one of the key factors to detecting colon cancer early is anemia...would this be a typical test performed with routine bloodwork?  My experience with doctors here isn't exactly thrilling and I (and friends) have been told \"I don't know what is wrong, but here, take this medication\" for past examinations.  Any assitance is greatly helpful before I have to attempt to navigate this minefield of hit/miss with doctors in this country.  Sorry for the length of this post, I wanted to include as much potentially relivant information as possible.  My fear is the worst thanks to watching so many medical shows, but my hope is that such sudden appearance of symptoms work in a positive favor.  Thank you for your time. -nakago\n\n",

    "content": "There are a few thoughts I have on your symptoms.  The blood in your stool quite likely is due to a fissure.  Fissures very commonly occur due to straining from constipation.    There are many causes of constipation also.  This is where visting a doctor comes in.  I'd recommend seeing a doctor as soon as available.  Your doctor can help in determining the cause.  In the mean time, doing things such as eating more fiber, being sure to drink plenty of fluids and drinking some juices such as prune juice can help with constipation.  If needed, there are some stool softners that can be helpful.  Anemia can cause fatigue and this should be evaluated for; however, given your swollen lymph nodes its likely that you had a recent cold that is causing your fatigue.  A simple blood test can evaluate for anemia and is probably warranted since you've been bleeding  You may also consider an evaluation for high lead levels.  It's fairly rare now, but can cause abdominal pain, constipation and anemia with fatigue.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 66 yr. old male who has been battling colorectal cancer for 11 yrs. After 16 surgeries, 2 rounds radiation (plus one radiation during surgery) and chemo, the cancer has matastacized to 2-3 tumors in one lung as well as a few tumors at the sight of the original cancer in the rectum. The chemo has consisted of Lavamisol, Lucovorin, zeloda, Camptazar, 5fu, orylaplatin and erbitux. I am on a brief break from tx with the last 5 due to infections of my finger and toe nails.  I am told this is the last chemo line available to me as Avastin is only last ditch resort because of a prior blood clot on blood thinners) to the lung. Oxylaplatin did cause neuropathy. Otherwise I am in \"excellent health\" meaning I would't know I was sick if they didn't tell me so. Being so highly treated, I would expect it to be difficult to match with a clinical trial. My oncologist said that most people at this point just go home and make the most of the remaining time. By talking to friends in other parts of the country we have learned of the cyber knife and other treatments which points out that doctors here either do not know of other avenues or do not mention possibilities which they can not offer. I am a retired pilot who thinks globally and can go most anywhere. In addition, I have found it extremely difficult to research alternative methods of treating cancer. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!  I welcome all comments. Heartfelt thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I would still think that you should not close the door on clinical trials yet. Although, most trials are conducted as the first or second line of chemotherapy, that isn't always the case.  One way you can research this is by visiting the following page: Click here!  There you can search current and prospective trials as well as call them up and ask for help and advice about your case.  Regarding the role of radiosurgery in your case, I do not have enough experience or data to give you advice. However, I think that although you only have 2 or 3 lesions in the lung besides the local recurrence, it may not be of great benefit. If it were one lesion or if they were in the liver there may have been a better role. Then again that is all speculation since I do not think that there are any survival data about using radiosurgery in this setting since the technique is relatively new.  Are you being treated by a specialist in rectal cancer? Have you considered consulting with an expert in the field? At this stage and especially given your good general condition this is worth considering. I could try to ask around for you if you want.  Best of luck!\n\n",

Family history includes a paternal uncle who died years ago of colon cancer (before they had today's screenings and improved treatments.)   Can you please (1) define the term \"precancerous\" and compare it to \"cancerous\"; (2) provide statistics on patients diagnosed with precancerous polyps; (3) what percent of those diagnosed develop cancer; (4) offer health choices that might help prevent further development into cancerous polyps.  I was told that I shouldn't be alarmed...that this is very common and I just needed to be screened again in 3 years rather than 5. But then when I went to apply for a different health insurance, they want to exclude any conditions related to colon and ileum indefinitely, and will consider a review in a year if I have no procedures whatsoever related to the colon. (A colonoscopy which is due next year is considered a procedure, therefore they would continue to exclude it!) Now that the insurance company has seen fit to be alarmed about it, I feel alarmed even though my doctor stated I shouldn't be. Won't the ability of insurance companies to exclude conditions in this manner make people less likely to follow up with their needed screenings? I trusted my doctor's evaluation and remained calm...now I feel alarmed!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  It would be helpful if you can send us the results of the pathological study for the removed polyps. It would be also helpful if you can inform us about any other tests done for diagnosis of your case like genetic studies.  Aadenomatous polyps are premalignant (precancerous). It is a condition in which cells show changes which do not signify malignancy (cancer) but are potentially moving towards cancer or malignant behavior.  Consideration for those with intestinal polyp is recognized in the young, 2 or more polyps, when colonic carcinoma before 40 years, and with associated extraintestinal manifestations.   A variety of polyposis syndromes can affect the GI tract and are divided as: - Familial inherited (autosomal dominant) or - Non familial.   The inherited polyposis syndromes  are further divided into  -Adenomatous:  (like the classic familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP)). Patients usually present with polyps at age of 35. Colonic cancers usually develop in all patients with FAP within 20 years after the diagnosis.  Current recommendations for follow up include colonoscopy, and small-bowel follow-through every 2 years after diagnosis.  - Hamartomatous: (like  juvenile polyposis syndrome). Family history may not be present,(is more likely to be your diagnosis). The average age of presentation  is 20 years.  Recommendations for patient with Juvenile Polyposis include an upper and lower endoscopy every year, If no polyps are seen the examinations can be done less often (every two to three years) since the risk for cancer in small although significant.  Keep us updated.\n\n",

So if I am almost sure to develop cancer later on, what do I do now other than keep up with my screenings? Does changing ones diet really significantly change the outcome? Do I continue to take my low dose hormones (PremPro .45/1.5 mg)? Or could that increase my chances to develop cancer?   I will contact my doctor and request a copy of the lab report.\n\n",

    "content": "[b] Dear physician,  I am very concerned.  I am a 24 year old male who is otherwise healthy.  The other day I felt something unusual in my left testicle.  I immediately went to my GP.  She said it feels bening.  Its a soft scrotal mass at the top of the left testicle and she said they are common.  She sent me to ultrasound and the radiologist said there were no testicular tumors and the exam was beningn and only significant for a left epidytimal cyst and two small hydroceles.  The said these are very common and that I should worry.  After doing a google search on epyditimal cysts I cam accross a 2005 case report that said these cysts can be a sign of colorectal cancer.  In the past two years I have had very infrequent (2 months - 3 months apart or so) anal pain that woke me up at night but after applying warm water to the anus it went away very quickly and never hurt otherwise.  I am a pharmacy resident this year and very stressed.  My diet is irregular and I have gained abdominal weight and weight in general, I believe due to poor diet.  As a result my stools are sometimes thin and I know this can be a sign of colorectal cancer.  I also have alot of gas these past 7 months on a daily basis.  Do you think I have something to seriously worry about?  [/b]\n\n",

The weight gain, increased gas, and changes in the stool may very well be diet related. I hope by this point you have changed you diet to a healthier one and you symptoms have subsided.

    "content": "First off, I don't think I have colon cancer but I am really hoping you can help me with my problem.  Since January I have had an extremely foul odor coming from my rectum area.  At first I couldnt tell where it was coming from but now I am sure it is the rectum.  I can assure you that it is not body odor as I have never had a problem with something like this before.  This is really effecting my life and my job.  It gets extremly bad at certain points and I am helpless trying to control it.  Since January I have seen my physician, a dermatologist, 2 emergency hospital doctors, and 2 colon surgeons.  First they said it was a jock itch or yeast infection but I didnt think that it was that because I don't believe they realize how bad it smells.  I used several medications for that and nothing cured it.  Then I noticed something, it looks like a really small hole above my rectum hole.  This is exactly where my discomfort is coming from and the smell.  I then went to the emergency room to get checked.  The doctor diagnosed me with a fisuta (sounded like I finally found my answer) but when I got a colonoscopy they said I didnt have it.  Although they kept checking for damage inside (me and the doctor saw it outside).  I expressed to them you really have to look but they didnt seem to think that was the case.  Is it possible I somehow have a small hole above my rectum that is causing discomfort and a foul odor?  If so, what could of caused this and what can I do to fix this problem which has taken over my life? Thanks for your help....\n\n",

    "content": "Dear patient15,  Since you have described in your posts, a  history of repeated attacks of skin infections and lesions that were diagnosed to be of either eczema origin or as an infection with candida.  A possible scenario could be that one of these deeply seated infected lesions (abscess) was not adequately treated, as a result a chronic abscess was formed. Repeated activation was  followed by sinus formation which from time to time discharge this foul odor secretions. Most bacterial, fungal, anaerobic or mixed infection, give rise to bad odor discharge. Ttenderness and discomfort in the perianal area is usually felt where the lesion is present.  To investigate this problem more, the discharge from this sinus should be sent for cytological and bacteriological study. Complete blood picture CBC will be of help.  Exclusion of other suppurative perianal lesions that form fistulas which do not open inside the anal canal should also be considered, these lesions include: \u2022Hidradenitis suppurativa  \u2022Infected inclusion cysts  \u2022Pilonidal disease.  It might appear a remote possibility, but some forms of sexually transmitted diseases give similar clinical picture.  Complete detailed history and physical examination are very important in the diagnosis of this condition. I advise you to continue your investigations and to keep on follow up with your consultant.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Sqirk13,  According to your description, The possibility of hemorrhoids (external) is very high.  The main causes of haemorrhoid include: Chronic constipation and straining as well as prolonged sitting, they result in improper blood circulation around the anal area and weak muscle tone. As a sequence, blood vessels will swell and become engorged forming swellings of vascular tissue that can be seen and felt in the affected area. Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases are more prone to have haemorrhoids.  The symptoms of external haemorrhoid include: Pain in the perianal area and external bleeding that is more frequent with strain during defecation.   Only by complete history, physical examination and investigations, the correct diagnosis can be reached. I advise you to be checked by your doctor.  In mild forms of haemorrhoid's treatment include:  Avoid constipation by increasing dietary fiber,  fluid intake, and physical exercises . Topical treatments like suppositories and cream can help alleviate the pain. In sever forms, Surgical approaches are considered when conservative treatments fail to improve the condition..

    "content": "Dear johno,  More than  5 percent of patients with ulcerative colitis are at risk to develop colon cancer.   The risk of cancer is directly related to the disease duration and to the anatomical  extent of the disease. For example, when the lesions affect the entire colon there is about 32 times increased risk than normal.  The presence of Dysplasia is an additional risk factor for colon cancer and the management in these cases depends on the detailed histological diagnosis as follows:  High grade dysplasia in the colon of patients with ulcerative colitis is an absolute indication for total colectomy.  Low grade dysplasia (LGD ) in a flat lesion in the colon of patients with long lasting ulcerative colitis is a strong indication for colectomy in many studies. Some studies, advised total proctocolectomy  to all patients with flat LGD.   These lesions indicate a concurrent or a future colon cancer.  Low grade dysplasia in a mass lesion, that  does not represent a typical sporadic adenoma or  symptomatic stricture, or  is not easy to bypass during endoscopy,  is another indication for surgical consideration.  Indications for colectomy include also, patients who did not respond to maximum medical treatment and those of severe colitis.  You physician who is more aware by your medical history and the details of the results of your investigations, would provide you a better understanding for the reasons of this treatment decision. You can also discuss with the surgeon in more  details the medical aspects of your disease before doing the surgery.\n\n",

The colon needs to be very clear for a good colonoscopy, as even a small amount of waste remaining will affect the results.  This is the reason many centres have their own regimens of colon preparations, which they believe, if properly followed result in complete washing out of the colon.   If I were running the centre, doing 4-5 colonoscopies per day on my preparation, I'd of course know that the preparation I use is working or not.   You should go by the centre's rules.

    "content": "Hello,  I'm really worried about change in my bowel habits, and as I saw a lot of information about cancer on the internet i started to worry that maybe my symptoms can be a cause to worry. I'm sorry if I'm just being paranoid, but I'd be really thankful if you could evaluate them and say if I should visit a doctor.  I'm 23 years old female. I started to have problems with my stool four months ago. In June I had diarrhea caused by exam stress, which lasted a month and thats usual for me. But afterwards things hadn't returned to normal as they did in the past. I started having intermittent hard small stools (about 2 sm in diameter) few times each day and really soft normal sized stools (which look like mild diarrhea and have foul smell and some undigested food in them); sometimes I have normal sized hard stools which appear to be made of small pieces glued together. I hadn't have one normal stool since that time. Today after I passed a hard stool I noticed some clear discharge on the toilet paper (i think it was mucus). So now I'm really worried about what it may be. I have stool everyday. I have no pains, indigestion or other symptoms. My bloodtests, which I did not long ago for other reason, are normal except for slightly elevated indirect bilirubin levels which I think doesn't have anything to do with my question but still I list it.   So I wanted t ask if I have to see the doctor with this problem, or am I just being paranoid and should wait till it resolves itself on it's own? I'm just ashamed to ask him since maybe it's a minor problem and I'm just inflating things. Thanks in advance for answering. I'll really appreciate your help.\n\n",

    "content": "The other day I had to go to the bathroom so I went. I had severe pain coming from my butthole. The poo that was trying to come out was so dry. I couldn't think of getting it out. I thought it would hurt way to much. So long story short I  didn't let it come out till around 12:30 this morning. When it came out it hurt so much. I couldn't stop it, it just came out. Now today whenever I move or cough or do anything I have pain. I had to go again and felt that it was soft soft poo but it hurt as much as it did yesterday. I don't know what to do. I'm trying to clean my house and I can't because whenever I move it hurts. Please tell me what to do. I've tried to look up suggestions online but so far have not found any. Soon I'm going to take a shower to see if that helps and then I'm going to put some baby oil in and around my anus. Hopefully something will help. Please let me know if you have any other ideas. Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "I've been experiencing flattened stool for many months and I have been concerned because of all the stuff that I am reading. I am a 39 year old male with a history of high blood pressure and kidney stones. I recently started taking a medication for reducing the size of my prostate called uroxatrol. For a while I though the narrowing of my stool was the effects of taking different med (blood pressure, prostate) but after reading about colon cancer I am very concerned. But to be honest that seems to be the only symtom I am experiencing. I get the occasional \"loose stool\" but its mostly the flatted stool and it about the size of my finger. I have no blood that I could see, I go regular once every day. I have no weight loss, the color is not black or dark. I am not fatitiged (no more than everyone else) I have talked to my doctor and she said we will keep an eye on it. She scheduled an appointment six months from now. Could this be anything else? My diet kinda stinks. I eat alot of junk food (I've slowed it down lately). I don't eat alot of fruits or veggies. If I change my diet and add more fiber, can this help? Should I do something else?  Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  My name is Melissa.  I found this site recently and just read this thread.  I am a carcinoid patient with the associated carcinoid syndrome.  Please contact me by email if possible, as I'm concerned that your symptoms may be indicative of POSSIBLE carcinoid symptoms.  I am in no way saying you have carcinoid, simply that I would like to share some information for you to take to your doctors.  Carcinoid can cause intestinal problems, red facial flushing, or even flushing of the trunk, espcially after surgeries, procedures or while under stress, palpitations, excess stomach acid production and much, much more.  I have some wonderful resources I can share with you and as I said you can discuss this with your physician.  Unfortunately (as appears to have been indicated on this thread) carcinoid patients are mis-diagnosed with anxiety or panic disorders because so many of the symptoms of carcinoid can appear to be anxiety related.  There are tests that can be done to rule carcinoid in or out.  I have learned all too often that many (not all) medical professionals are in a rush to say something is anxiety or all in a patient's head when they can't find the answers.  But just because they can't find them doesn't mean there isn't an answer.  A physical one.  I am an EMT and I firmly believe that patients know their bodies better than any doctor.  I am not saying that genuine anxiety or mental disorders shouldn't be considered in cases with these symptoms, however, I have seen MANY cases where issues that were blamed on the patient's mental issues turned out down the road to be physical and just wasn't apparent at the time.  My situation is one good example.  I was in and out of ER's with bronchospasm, palpitations, syncopal episodes, etc and told many times it was either panic attacks or asthma.  Neither of which was true.  And I knew it at the time, but the doctor's had nothing else to call it, so it was labled as psychological.  So anyway, email me bousme@woh.rr.com and I will be happy to share what I have so you can at least have this possibility considered by your doctor.\n\n",

    "title": "Colon cancer?or maybe something else?",
    "content": "I thought I posted this today but I don't think it went through. Hopefully this time it will. I am a 32 year mother of two children, ages 2 and 8 months.  6 years ago I had some rectal bleeding and with a colonoscopy they found and removed two polyps from my sigmoid colon which were benign. For the last 7 months i have been having bleeding every day, bright red with clots, filing the toilet bowl and on the paper. It does not appear to be in the stool itself.  Some nights I do have itching in that area as well. I saw my GP a couple of days ago and he said with my history he wants me to see a specialist and have another colonoscopy, which won't be for 5 weeks. He also asked if there was anything down there and I said nothing I was aware of. Well yesterday I took a really good look and there is an extra flap of skin between my vagina and rectum(about a centimeter) and there is a mass of something that is right beside my rectum(grape like texture). I had a full blood work up done 3 months ago which showed no abnormalities so at this point I am wondering if it sounds like cancer or maybe hemmorhoids or polyps. 5 weeks seems like forever. My stools are not pencil thin, and I have no diarrhea or constipation, and I am definitely not losing weight. In fact I am at least 20 puonds overweight still.  My father has ulcerative colitis as well as medulay thyrois cancer so this has me pretty concerned at this point. Any info or feedback would be greatly appreciated.  I am hoping that cancer can be ruled out because wouldn't my blood, platelet count etc shown something abnormal 3 months ago? Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Jodster,  When you went to see your GP the other day, didn't he examine you?  Did he really just ask you if \"anything was down there\"?  If he didn't, he really should have.  Your description sounds to me like a hemorrhoid, the grape like texture you describe.  They do itch and bleed, but usually not every day for months.  Have you tried some Preparation H or any steriodal cream?  That will take some of the inflammation and itching down. Try it twice a day.  While you are waiting for your colonoscopy, make sure you are getting plenty of fiber in your diet, like whole wheat bread, oatmeal, whole grain cereals, and lots of vegetables like broccholi and spinach.  Lots and lots of water is important too.  Lack of fiber causes constipation and/or hard stools.  When you pass these, they can rupture some of the blood vessels and cause a hemorrhoid.  Also, straining to have a bowel movement can contribute also.  Try drinking some Citrucel in water 1 or 2 times a day.  Metamucil works well, too, but can cause bloating and gas.  Your symptoms really don't sound like cancer, but with a history of polyps you really should be having a colonoscopy done about every 5 years just to be safe.\n\n",

My GP did not examine me because he said that he would save me the embarrasment as the specialist would be doing a lot of examining before the colonoscopy.  I am glad it sounds like a hemmrhoid(lol). Never thought I would say that. Could the extra flap of skin be one too. I know it's hard to say because you haven't examined me either.  I will take your advice with the prep.H and the diet.  as for the bloodwork, if there was cancer, would abnormalities have been present 3 montsh ago in all the results??

    "content": "I should correct myself - I meant there was no BLOOD TEST for colon cancer - of course there is a way to diagnose it - a biopsy!  You may have a condition called gastroesophageal reflux disease - (bad heartburn).  Tums probably won't be of much use for this - get some zantac (generic) or Prilosec OTC.  Take it every day; it may need a couple of days to start working.  Your stomach is producing too much acid, and these medications don't just neutralize it like Tums, they stop the overproduction altogether in most cases.  If you were bleeding from your stomach, you would most likely be noticing a blackened stool, not bright red blood.  You do need to tell your doctor about this, however, because there is no guarantee that what you have is reflux.  It is a common ailment, and is made much worse by stress.  Your doctor needs to rule out an ulcer - very important.  Smoking, drinking, coffee, tea, chocolate, and fatty foods all make reflux much worse, try to avoid these things if possible.\n\n",

Just curious. I have all these questions that I forget to ask and that are in my mind and that keep me awake with worry these days.

    "content": "Hi Jodster  First of all, you had a colonoscopy 6 years ago.  They removed all polyps and anytime anything is removed, it is automatically biopsied to rule out cancer.  It was obviously negative at that time.  It is HIGHLY unlikely you have cancer, the polyps first have to form and it takes many years to develop in to cancer.  It is a very slow growing cancer, true.  Even on the very slim chance it would be, Stage 1 is around 95% survivable.  The odds of you having it are slim, if you did, it is totally treatable.  Of course, I can't sit here and tell you you don't have cancer, that would be totally unethical.  Anything is possible, as you know.  Why not ask your doctor for something to treat your anxiety before it makes you sick as well.  It is common for people with anxiety such as yours to develop all kinds of symptoms that they read about and diagnose themselves as having, that are severe diseases.  Please take me seriously on that one.  As far as the bleeding I am sure you have hemorrhoids, they are actually caused by constipation and straining as you said you do.  More than likely, THAT'S where the blood is coming from,  not the colon.  Hemorrhoids that bleed always produce bright red blood as you stated.  Do get more fiber in your diet, like I recommended, and take a stool softener every day, so it won't irritate and make the hemorrhoid worse. If you don't, the hemorrhoids won't heal.  Relax!!!! Your chances of colon cancer are practially nil!  Especially with no family history of COLON cancer.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello there. Just me with a small update and of course some more questions lol!!!  I did see the specialist last week and I am having the colonoscopy next Monday morning. He looked at my history and listened to all my symptoms and said that he thought it was unlikely that it was colon cancer but of course wants to take a look to see. He mentioned hemmroids as well and said that if that was the case, he could band them while he was in there. I saw my GP a week before that for the upset stomach and abdominal discomfort and he put me on Nexium which has done wonders until the last few days. I have had lots of abdominal cramping and general flu-like feelings of feeling tired, and headaches. I am hoping it is just some bug I've picked up but with everything else going on, of course...well you guessed it...my mind starts to wander again and I am here thinking that if it is cancer, the  it must be spreading or maybe it's stomach cancer etc. I am currently taking an anti anxiety agent which has helped and I try not to dwell on it or read too much because you stand absolutely correct when you say that it makes us feel worse. I am wondering if teh colonoscopy will show my stomach area as well and if my symptoms still sound like hemmroids. Never thought I would welcome hemmroids. I still am not constipated or having persistent runny stools. They are soft and teh same as usual. Still blood but still bright red and still some mucous clots. Anyhow, thank you so much for taking teh time to read and respond. Yours very sincerely..jodster\n\n",

    "content": "I was wonderig if the colonoscopy will allow the doctor to see in to my stomach as well, or does it just do the colon and intestinal tract?? Because I am sure that something has to be causing this abdominal discomfort, and the Nexium should have taken care of anything related to GERD or even an ulcer, or is that not true? Just wondering if hemmroids would cause all this abdominal discomfort or if its just something completely unrelated. Wow...I wish instead of a teacher, I had become a doctor lol!!!!  You guys really provide a really amazing service here. I am very grateful!!!! Thanks again...Jodster\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Jodster!    First, I apologize for not getting back to you right away.  For some reason, the computer didn't alert me that you replied; I don't want you to thinking I was ignoring you!  I am so glad you got to see a doctor.  The abdominal cramping and headaches may be a side effect of the Nexium; call your doctor and tell him, there are other medicines very similar he can try.  The medicines in that class (proton pump inhibitors) can have those side effects.  Also, they of course won't help abdominal pain, but the stomach discomfort you complain of they will.  And yes, they are a partial treatment for ulcers.  Also, if it was stomach cancer, your symptoms would be very severe to the point of frequent vomiting, and excrutiating pain in the stomach.  I'm (almost) positive you don't have stomach cancer, besides it is not common.  The colonoscopy will show only the small intestine and colon.  To see the stomach (and esophagus) you would need an endoscopy.  You may even be experiencing colitis or Chron's, more likely the former.  They are treatable, not fatal.   The hemorrhoids would not be causing your abdominal pain; that is a seperate issue.  Nexium would be relieving your stomach pain, but not the abdominal pain, and as mentioned before, can make the cramping worse as a side effect.  You are entirely welcome for the replies, and again I apologize for the delay this time.  Let me know how your colonoscopy goes; and ask your doctor about an endoscopy as well.  Good luck and try not to dwell, hon. And stay off the net, except to write to me, lol!\n\n",

All I remember is teh doctor walking in and saying \"goodbye\" before he stuck the needle in my arm and I was asleep until just after the procedure. I have NO idea what he saw or found, if anything as I slept through it, all I have is a note that says that I had a colonoscopy and some banding and that I need to see him in 3-4 weeks. Soooo, I am assuming....and I know that assumptions aren't always teh greatest thing, that perhaps it was roids, because there was nothing said about polyps(or written), and if it was something that looked like it could present a problem, wouldn't I need a sooner appointment than that?? And it didn't say anything about biopsy or anything, mind you, who knows what his notes were!!! Anyhow, I will keep you posted. Thank you so much for all your support so far.(HUGS)\n\n",

    "content": "Hello there...glad you asked because let me tell you I have never felt anything like this before!!!!! And what a day...I am only finally starting to feel some relief. the grogginess(sp?) wore off about 10 last night and I sware to you that I was in the worst pain I( have ever been in ever in my life all night long. It was a combination of pain and severe pressure in the rectal area, almost like there was a watermelon or someone sticking a fist in to me all night. I didn't sleep, just took tylenol and paced and tried the tub, the pool, lieing every which way possible with no relief. Finally at 6am when my son woke, I took him with me and went to the ER where they said my BP was high due to pain and I was even sweating from it. So the doc took a look but wanted the surgeon to see me , so he gave me a shot of torredol because I had my son and had to drive, and told me to take him to day care and that the hospital would call me as soon as teh surgeon returned his page. Anyhow, long story made as short as possible. After 2 hours, the med finally gave about 20% relief and no call back from hospital so I called the sugeons office and they told me he was away for a few days as of last night and that I should see my Gp to make sure no infection , so I call my Gp's office and they say they can't see me today or prescrobe anything because I was already seen at another place(hospital)and that they can't put a billing in if theres one already so they tell me to call teh hospital back who tell me that I should go back down BUt because the doctor that saw me left at 8 am I would have to wait probably all day to see teh on call surgeon because he would be in surgery and that I would have to go through all the registration again etcetcetc . So I call beck the surgeons office and explain to them and they say that i should still be seen because teh pain is not supposed to be this severe as all that was done was teh colonoscopy and one banding, no polyps, etc, but that I could hold off till tomorrow if I wanted to wait for GP. So here I am waiting for the pain to kick in again and the torredol wear off adn I have no idea why so much discomfort. I have had bandings in teh past with minimal discomfort and I usually have a high pain tolerance. After both my csections I refused any pain med but tylenol extra strength, and they couldn't believe that at the hospital. But this is the worst pain I have ever had. I am wondering if it's just because maybe due to teh fact that I was asleep, teh procedure might have been a bit painful and I didn't feel it then or that the banding is somehow coming undone?? I have no other symptoms, just the incredible pressure and pain in the rectum, like I am giving birth to a watermelon lol!!! I had some hot flashes and sweating last night, but I am sure that was from teh pain. Anyhow, I am going to hope for the best tonight and will see my GP in the AM who may send me to the on call surgeon to take a look up there(I can't imagine how with this soreness though), if not, maybe he'll just give me some pain relief. Could this be normal???What could be causing this??? I have never felt this afterwards before, wonder why this time. I know the roid was internal if that helps. So.....sorry you asked how I was feeling???? lol   Thanks in advance\n\n",

I personally have never heard of someone being in such pain afterwards.  I also don't understand why it is so hard to get something oral to take for pain relief while you wait until tomorrow, from your GP.   That doesn't make any sense at all to me, but if you have socialized medicine, I'm not sure how that works.    I truly don't know why you are in such pain.

    "content": "Hello, sorry it's taken me so long to update but it has been a crazy two weeks. I ended up having to go through the whole colonoscopy a second time 2 days after the first because of the pain and intense pressure I was feeling which was unlike anything I've ever felt before. I've never had discomfort after any of my previous colonoscopy's but I guess that the banding was on a bunch of nerve vessels from what they told me, so the doc gave me two AB's as a precaution and all was well for about 2 days. Then I ended up back in hospital because I had an allergic reaction to the cipro and a bad side effect reaction to the flagyl so I was taken off both. Then about 3 days later I started having hot flashes, pain  in my abdomen and these fluttery contractions in the area just under my bra strap and at first I thought maybe it was anxiety or panic but it wouldn't subside. And with the panic attacks that I had after my son was born they wouldn't last hours straight as this was. So back to the hospital where they did xrays and said I was full of stool and that the doc thought it was wierd since I had just had 2 colonoscopys that week , but he gave me a shot of buxopan to relieve the contractions that he said were in my intestine and had me take a laxative which did nothing. He told me to see the surgeon within a couple days who was away since my first colonoscopy so had no idea all that had gone on but didn't seem concerned regardless and said if it was an obstruction(as I had been having BM's after colonoscopy up til a day prior) then I would really know it and that if by chance it was, then we would have a couple weeks before it got serious. So, I took some more laxatives which worked and relieved pressure in stomach area, and pain pushing up and all has been okay I suppose. I was very scared that night at the ER as I have had panic issues in the past but they have always gone away as soon as I am near a hospital and feel safe. This didn't stop(the wierd sensations in my chest, radiating to my back, etc, and the fear) til 7am the next morning.Think it could just be all I went through in teh two weeks?? Anyhow, the good news is that the colonoscopy's were negative for anything serious, although I am still having the discomfort in teh area from my brastrap to my belly button, and nexium doesn't always do teh trick. I suspect an ulcer maybe as you suggested but am wondering if it can be diagnosed with something less invasive than an endoscopy??  I am trying not to think cancer beacuse as you said the symptoms would be far more severe. Right?? It's wierd because I have not let this consume me, and been stressed out over it all lately , but maybe in my subconscious there is still panic and dreadful feelings. I have an appt. with my GP next week. Should I ask to be tested for an ulcer??I had those fluttery contractions again last night for a bit, but I didn't get all panicked and was able to fall asleep. And I am hoping that I am not backed up with stool again as I have been using teh bathroom daily.  So....what do you think of it all now???lol   Anyhow, I would like to furthur discuss my anxiety(if it's anxiety), should I post in the other forum or continue in this thread????  It's not all the time but in the last couple weeks it has been significant and a couple scary episodes that I can't tell apart from symptoms. If you read my posts prior about my epitaxis you might understand why I had those panic attacks 2 years ago lol. Anyhow, thaks in advance as always. I really, honestly do appreciate the time you take to read and respond to my questions.  Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Jodster, I do apologize for the delay in answering your post.  It does sound like you really ought to address your extreme anxiety/panic disorder.  I think at this point it may be your main problem.  I suggest you refer yourself to a psychiatrist, which IMO would be a better choice than having your family doctor address it.  While many GPs do prescribe antidepressants, it may take more than just an antidepressant to treat your disorder as it is more complex than simple depression.  Most insurance plans do not require a referral from your primary care physician.  As far as diagnosing an ulcer, an endoscopy is the most accurate way.     I do hope you feel better soon; I think once you are treated, you will be very glad you did.\n\n",

Rectoceles can be common in menopausal women, but it's not a requirement, occasionally they occur in men too   Rectocele is the wall of the rectum on the other side of the vagina is weakened and has collapsed, but they don't  really hurt, so that is probably not it.  There is also anal fissure, a tear in the rectum due to constipation, hard stools, and/or straining to have a bowel movement.   These can heal on their own, with lots of fiber in food and something like metamucil and a daily stool softener.    There are internal hemorrhoids, which are also caused by constipation, as above.  They may  bleed, and may also heal on their own the same way.  Then there is the possibility of rectal cancer.  The first three don't involve the abdomen, the last one can.  There is no way to even speculate as to the cause of your abdominal pain. Myriads of possibilities from GYN to colon problems, among others.

    "content": "I am a 38 year old male and I have (what I HOPE to be) IBS symptoms but I am still scared to death that its not. I also have anxiety and have been diagnosed with OCD, therefore I go to the doctor a LOT for things which turn out to be nothing and I really hate to do that again so I thought maybe you could help me out.  OK:  I have abdominal pain in my lower left side along the belt line. It ranges anywhere from a mild aggravation to somewhat severe pain. I haven't noticed any blood in my stools before, but I have noticed quite a bit of 'red' in my stool the last 2 days (none on the toilet paper) but I  also had watermelon the last 2 nights. This doesn't happen all of the time but does frequently and lasts for several days to a week each time it does. During this period it seems that my bowels move more frequently (although not diarrhea). Defecation does relieve the pain momentarily but it will shortly flare up again. I pretty much feel the urge to defecate all of the time whether I go or not. During extreme flare ups I also feel quite sick to my stomach, although I haven't vomited.  Less than a year ago I had a CT Scan of my colon (where I had the dye put in my veins) with a barium enema and they said everything looked normal.  I have had bouts with severe constipation for about 3 years now and have been drinking Metamucil every day since then. My bowels will NOT move if I miss the Metamucil.  About 1 week ago I bought some \"Oxy Powder\" on line and did a 7 day colon cleanse. I have noticed since that time that I do not have to take as much Metamucil in order for my bowels to move. I drink 1- 8 oz cup of water with 1 tablespoon of Metamucil every night now as compared to 2 or 3 before.  I stopped the colon cleans 4 days before this started up this time.  I always have a mild abdominal discomfort in the same place that I am having the more sever pain now, but it is usually really mild and hardly noticeable, and my stools aren't nearly as frequent as they are now with this flare up.  We did go to the lake the day before this flare up and played on a ski boat and I drank quite a few beers, (but I usually drink 3 or 4 beers nightly anyway)  Does this sound to you like it could be IBS or should I be concerned of something more serious? Please help me if you can.  Thanks in advance; Coop\n\n",

I feel the cold much more than I used to - but I also swing from too cold to being too hot. - pain in the upper left abdomen (from under my rib cage to round to my waist), Pain on movement (eg in car) and when applying pressure.  I recently had a sigmoidoscopy - which came back 'evidence of inflamation - suggested proctitis'. I also had an ultra sound - which showed that I have gallstones (but I think this may be incidental to my symptoms) I have also had a gastroscopy which confirmed gastritis (still waiting for results of test for bacteria).   None of the Drs/consultants I have seen have been very helpful - it has taken two years to get the three tests listed above - but still no help/diagnosis/medication has been given.

    "title": "1/2 way through 5fu course-nasty chest infection or????",
    "content": "Hi, first a quick explanation as to where I'm at currently:  Diagnosed with bowel cancer October 2004 aged 33. Subsequent right hemiocolectomy removed growth with no spread to lymph nodes (26 tested and all clear) though it had gone into muscle of bowel wall.As the margin between healthy tissue and diseased was only approx 1 millimetre my specialist advised a 6 month course of chemo-5FU just to make sure everything nasty had been eradicated.  First 3 months went fine except usual diahorrea and occassional nausea which I believe is fairly commonplace. Also gained back weight I lost prior to surgery. Anyway the last 5 weeks or so I've been having chest pains in the lower left area of my ribcage on my left side coupled with a burning sensation there, a cough and night sweats. Oncology doc diagnosed a probable chest infection and put me on a course of Amoxycillin for a week. Felt a bit better but then the pain returned about a week later. This time also noticed  blood in my nostrils and sinuses and seemed once to cough up a little mucus streaked with blood. Subsequently had 2 chest xrays and an ECG monitor and both were clear, was prescribed further Amoxycillin and also Erythromycin for two weeks and a 2 week break from chemo.Once again started to feel a little better until I had my chemo shot last Friday and the chest pain, cough, left shoulder pain has started again.  Now being a smoker my main concern was lung cancer though my oncologist says it's highly unlikely. However this recurring chest problem is really starting to worry me as I've had no problems like this before in my life. I'm well aware that chemo can compromise your immune system but is it usual for infections of this nature to stick around for so long (i.e roughly 5 weeks)? Plus I've heard that chest xrays won't always pick up traces of lung cancer anyway. Is it worth hassling my oncologist for further tests or should I just sit it out and wait for a few weeks longer. I'm well aware that anyone recently diagnosed with cancer will naturally always assume the worst whenver they get any aches and pains so I'm in a bit of a quandry with this one and how to proceed.Any advice would be appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for posting your question here at The Lounge.  5-fluorouracil chemotherapy can at times cause heart rhythm problems, but such usually occur, if they occur at all, in older people and if the 5-fluorouracil is given as a continuous infusion over along stretch of time.  Are you getting leucovorin chemotherapy with the 5-fluorouracil?  I have had a few patients develop various side effects from the leucovoin, although leucovorin is for the most part well tolerated when given to people.  If you have not had a CAT scan of the lungs/chest, then I would consider that in order to get a good look.  Sometimes an MRI of the chest can hlp look at the chest wall/ribs (it does not look well at the lungs), especially if you can localize where in the chest you are getting your pain.  If your chest pain is at the bottom of the ribs, then one may also need to image the abdomen to make certain that something is not going on there that could be giving you chest/rib pain.  - Jeffrey A.

Although you are \"young\" with reagrd to colon cancer issues and current standard colon cancer screening recommendations indicate routine surveilance colonoscopy starting at age 50 years (younger if there is a srong family history of colorectal cancer), perhaps it would not be unreasonabl for you to undergo a colonoscopy to b thorough.

    "title": "Rectal pain and skin tags",
    "content": "I'm currently 20 years old.  At the age of 16, I began to experience pain during a bowel movement.  The pain was at the entrance of my rectum.  After doctor examination, they said I had several anal fissures.  I also developed skin tags around my rectum opening.   The doctors gave me a test which I had to take laxatives a couple days before and drink a white chalky liquid.  The test results showed I had Crohn's disease.  The doctor prescribed these drugs: Sulfasalazine, Flaggyl, Pretesone (sp?), and Zantac.  I took these drugs for a while along with using a creme for my fissures.  The fissures didn't really go away and the drugs gave me weird feelings.  My mom wasn't too happy with all the drugs and she asked the doctor to slowly take me off.  I experienced pain (the fissures) for about 6 months when all of a sudden, the pain went away.  The only problem that remained was narrow stools.  I used to have normal size stools pre-age 16.  Now, they're about 1/2 inch wide and they're really short (but there's a lot of them).  Narrow stools are a concern, but not my biggest concerns.  I turned twenty years old 4 months ago, and for the past couple weeks, I've been passing bright red blood and mucous.    This is REALLY concerning me.    I don't have any adominal pains (but I've been feeling much more gassy).  I still have a good appetite and my energy level hasn't changed.  I also don't feel bloated.  I don't notice any other symptoms.    But this problem is becoming a pain.  Now, when I have the urge to pass gas, I need to guess if it's going to be mucous/blood or normal gas.    What is going on?  I also don't eat any vegetables or fruits (I know that's bad).  I mostly eat chicken, beef,  pork, fish, rice, potatoes, noodles, etc.  To compensate for my lack of veggies and fruits, I take multi-vitamin (capsules) and fiber capsules (Psyllium Husk).  Sometimes when I feel the urge to move my bowels, only blood and mucous will come out.     What can cause this blood/mucous (expecially without any other symptoms)?  What can cause narrow stools?  Can Crohn's Disease cause any of this (I know that Crohn's Disase patients can be symptom free for years)?  Basically, I want normal size stools and the blood/mucous to go away.\n\n",

    "title": "IBS?  HLA-B27 Positive",
    "content": "Dear Doctor,   I am a 47 yr. old female, 5'4 & 150 lbs.   Hx nervous stomach around age 16 and around age 33.   Developed 2 hemorhoids in 85 after birth of child.   In 1996 or 97 I was having some gastrointestinal symptoms and a ct of the abdomen revealed a suspicious mass on the pancreas.  I went to a gastrointestinal specialist in Houston who reviewed the ct scan films and he said that the radiologist hadn't read them right, and that my pancreas looked normal. He said if symptoms continued, I might be developing irritable bowel disorder.   Three yrs. ago I had reflux & heliobacter pylori which were treated with antibiotic & acid inhibitor regime and xrays showed completely resolved. I had the whole gamut of xrays i.e. barium enema, upper gi, lower gi.   Hx. asymptomatic small gallstones 1 year ago (via ct of abdomen).   Hx constipation in younger years, but in the last 3 years I have had normal bowel movements. However, in recent months my stools have become orange color frequently and are rather loose and sometimes I get diarreah the last several months.   Now today I developed frequent orange diarreah and then by afternoon it was mixed with fresh blood and fresh blood was on the toilet paper.   I have stopped eating for 3 hours now and am only drinking water.   To sum it up, it's a hx of orange type stools, sometimes clay color, recent diarreah, and now onset of blood with stools.   Could this be a gallbladder or pancreatic problem, or is it probably related to the lower colon?   I didn't go to the ER tonight, but am concerned as have never had rectal bleeding before. I've had occult blood testing previously and they were negative.   My recent diet of last few weeks included a bunch of elderberries--very high in fiber as very seedy. I cleaned them thoroughly and ate pie, jam, etc. A couple days ago I had some cough syrup I made from it (juice, spices, sugar, no alcohol). The elderberries do cause one to get diarreah but they are sooo good! Anyway I wonder if I overdid the berries and now it irritated my colon?   Yesterday I ate a bowl of cereal, a sandwich, pretzels and lemonade.  Today I had a lot of coffee in the morning and then a bowl of macaroni and cheese and a red slushie. I don't think the red dye from the slushie drink caused the red in the stool.   I'm having no pain but noticed last couple days a little tenderness in my lower left abdomen like a tendon or something was pulling and it caused me a little pain.   In the past year I have noticed on and off a \"heat\" sensation over this left lower abdominal area but my doctor dismissed it.   With both parents having diabetes (dad type 1 at 52, and mom type 2 in 60s), I get blood suger checked regularly and have normal level.   I've had recent blood tests i.e. chem 7, thyroid, liver function, etc. and all were normal, but cholesterol is 210 and was higher before.   I am waiting to see if diarreah stops tonight, I hope I'm not making a mistake by not going to the ER. I plan to try and see my doctor tomorrow.   please give me your thoughts or email me at healing_hands@wapda.com  P.S.  I had genetic testing when my son was born and it showed I have HLA-B27 marker.  I do have a history of achilles tendonitis 1978 and bone spur on heel 1999.  P.P.S.  As a young child I had pica and picked up pieces of coal and ate them (we had a coal stove).  P.P.P.S.  I am currently recovering from hand surgeries for repeat carpal tunnel syndrome and new condition of trigger fingers and thumbs.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Guest,   If you are not having heavy bleeding, i don't think you have to go to the er and you can wait till you see your doctor in the morning but if for any reason, he is not going to able to get you in, you have to go to the er or let him admit you to the hospital.  The red color in the stools could be caused by something as simple as hemorrhoids but can prove serious as well, that is why you have to be evaluated.  If the bleeding increases at any time, you have to go to the er.  With irritbale bowel syndrome, you should not be having any bleeding. i am not familiar with elderberries and what they can do to one's bowel habits.  Having clay color stools with blood on top with a history of pancreatic mass may be indicative of someting serious such as pancreatic cancer. But for pancreatic cancer to cause clay color stools as well, there should be some obstruction causing jaundice.  You could also have an obstruction caused by a gall stone that passed and caused some inury but usually this is not the clinical presentation. Clinical presentation is usually a right upper quadrant pain followed by jaundice and then relief of jaundice when and if the stone passes and then if the stone is large enough to block the passage of stools from small to large intestines, it will cause a small bowel obstruction (a condition known as gall stone ileus).  My recommendation is to have the ct scan repeated, may be get an mri and/or an ercp or mrcp if available where you live.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

There are of course benefits and drawbacks to each. But let's not cross the bridge before getting there. Why don't you go to your doctor in the morning and see what he thinks.

    "content": "Hello, As Dr. Yasser said your bleeding issue should be addressed as soon as possible. If it turns out that your bleeding is caused by something as simple as hemorrhoids then you probably won't need any further investigations. If however, the cause is not clear a search for a cause will include evaluation of all your GI system including re-evaluation of the suspicious pancreatic mass (possibly by another new CT scan).   In your case I wouldn't worry about it being an aggressive cancer (adenocarcinoma) since the median survival for this disease without treatment is no longer than 3 months and it usually does not pass so calmly. Again I agree with Dr. Yasser's assertion that for pancreatic cancer to cause clay color stools, there should be some obstruction causing jaundice, which does not seem to be the case.  That said however, it should be stated that there are many other (less harmful pancreatic tumors) which can stay for years with minimal symptoms. The so called neuroendocrine tumors are a clear entity whose biological behaviour has no correlation with the pathology. Some of these pancreatic tumors secrete hormones while others do not. Median survival without treatment can be as high as 10 to 20 years or even higher.  Best regards,\n\n",

I am eating a lot every day, and yet my stool is always narrow, and it is hard for me to believe that all of that food ends up in such a small amount of waste. previously, even when I ate normally, my stool was always at least the size of a bannana, and maybe even bigger, but I have not had those for a while. I do feel occasional abdominal pains, but they are always in the upper left abdomen. I am still regular. Anyway, what is causing my recent narrow stools, and how could I \"fix\" this?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Do you have constipation? Do you need to strain during passing of stools? A change in bowel habits may be sparked by a change in eating habits. If I understood you correctly your concern is that your stools have become thinner not less in quantity. Thin stools could be a concern some times especially as Dr. Yasser mentioned when accompanied by warning symptoms. Diseases causing obstruction to the normal flow of stool in the rectum can lead to thin stools. Of major concern is cancer however, other causes could be large hemorroids or benign polyps.\n\n",

I am looking for a quick fix, and I don't think it's cancer. I experience no bleeding, the pain is only occasional(limited to just one spot), and I do not feel excessively tired. There is one change in my diet, I eat less sweets and junk food, just for they sake of trying to be healthy. Actually, I eat close to none, because I didn't eat that much junk food to begin with. I counter that by eating bannanas, and carrots for snacks, and consuming larger meals. Could this change in diet cause my narrow stools, or do you think it is something else, and if it is a benign polyp, will it go away?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Floss, Adjuvant chemotherapy for Dukes C colon cancer (lymph node involvement) is well established. However, the benefits of chemotherapy for Dukes B tumors is not known. Trials have not shown a benefit in terms of survival for those with Dukes B colorectal cancer who have received chemotherapy. That said however, there is a strong possibility that a subset of patients with Duke's B staging may benefit. We don't know the what the profile for this subset is, so the trend is for many doctors to evaluate each patient with Duke's B cancer individually. Those with poor prognostic factors will have a higher incidence of recurrence. Hence, many opt to give these patients adjuvant chemotherapy on a rather emperical basis. In your case some would consider age <40 years as a poor prognostic factor warranting chemotherapy.  Other poor prognostic factors include: Cancers that have obstructed the bowel,  Cancers that have perforated the wall of the colon, or  Cancers that have adhered to structures outside the intestine.   Another important factor is your family history. Approximately 5% of all colon (large bowel) cancers are directly caused by inherited genetic abnormalities. These hereditary colon cancers often feature colonic polyps or growths that eventually become cancerous. There are several kinds, including familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and a variant called Gardner's syndrome. Another type, hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (HNPCC), features few if any polyps. Relatively rare hereditary conditions such as Peutz-Jeghers syndrome and juvenile polyposis are not cancer or precancerous conditions but confer on the patient a greater than normal risk of developing colon cancer. Many families with higher than normal rates of colon cancer have one or more of these conditions. While non-hereditary (\"sporadic\") colon cancer rarely occurs before age 40, hereditary colon cancers often occur in younger people.   FAP has been associated with poor outcome as compared to those with HNPCC.\n\n",

    "content": "I think that this depends on what the doctor meant.  Some will use incorrect terminology.  In the Dorland Diction (Merck Website), nodule (nodulus) means a small knot or node.  That sounds relatively solid to me.  It also means a minute collection of tissue.  Polyp means a morbid excrescence, or protruding growth, from mucous membrane; classically applied to a growth on the mucous membrane of the nose, the term is now applied to such protrusions from any mucous membrane.  This description gives me the impression that it is mucinous or much more flexible physically.  I am a cancer advocate, working for an organization that helps pediatric patients and rare adult cancer patients.  What I am doing is showing you how confusing some of this can be in the cancer world.  Terminology and nomenclature can get a little 'mixed up' to say the least.  So, the best thing that you can do is to call that doctor and ask him/her what they meant when they used those words.  That would be the simplest solution and would alleviate the worry that you must be feeling right now.\n\n",

    "content": "Lynette,  Thanks for  your post to The Doctor's Lounge.  Usually cancers that develop in family members when those family members are elder are of less a risk factor than if those cancers developed in patient 50 years old or younger.  The standard colorectal cancer screening guidelines concerning colonoscopies (\"real\" ones, not \"virtual\") is that for the average person, colonsocopies should begin at age 50.  If there are first-degree family members who developed colorectal cancer ata young age, then screening can begin earlier.  In this case, a more detailed family history pertaining to cancer is in order.  If there is only one family member who developed colorectal cancer below the age of 50 years, then one could consider doing a screening colonoscopy before the age of 50 (i.e.- at age 40 years).  This is an issue that should be discussed with your husband's physician and if need be, an opinion from a Gastroenterologist (these are the spcecialists who usually do colonoscopies,  although some General Internists and Surgeons do them as well.\n\n",

    "content": "Caregiver,  I cannot fully respond to the decision to use chemotherapy because I do not have all of the details of the surgically removed colon cancer.  It is good news that the cancer was removed with margins being clear of cancer.  It is also good news that the colon cancer was not found to have any associated lymph node spread.  From the subject heading of your post, I gather that the colon cancer was staged as Stage II or what is also referred to as Duke's Stage B.  There are a few items of importance that I would like to know:  1.)  How deep through the bowel wall did the ccancer invade? 2.)  Were there any associated findings of bowel obstruction or bowel perforation?  If a decision is reached to give adjuvant (post-operative ) chemotherapy, then a standard chemotherapy regimen would include 5-fluorouracil (this can be given in several different ways).  Off of a clinical research study, I do not use capecitabine (tradename is Xeloda).  Although capecitabine behaves like a continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil, its use is not standard and as far as I know, has not been compared head to head to 5-fluorouracil in the adjuvant treatment setting of colon cancer.  However, I am aware of colleagues of mine who have used it in just this setting, as opposed to its more standard use in adbanced stages of the disease, where it has been compared in a randomized study to 5-fluorouracil..  In my practice, I recommend a follow-up colonoscopy at 6-8 months from the surgery (usually this occurs after a 6-8 month course of adjuvant chemotherapy has been given), then I recommend it in another 6 months, then on an annual basis.  However, there is no one standard practice recommendation, and different practice patterns exist.  I prefer the initial colonoscopy at 6-8 months in order to check the surgical anastomosis site in the colon.  If the pre-operative CEA level was eleavted, then I follow it after chemotherapy.  Sometimes, chemotherapy can artificially elevate its level, so I don't check it during chemotherapy.  However, a post-operative level should be checked before chemotherapy so as to check that an elevated pre-operative level has normalized.  If it remains elevated post-operatively, then I am concerned about residual disease or another undetected site of disease.  Beware that cigaretet smoking can artificially elevate its level.  I obtain a CAT scan (and sometimes also a PET scan) after chemotherapy is done, then in another 6 months, then just on an annual basis there after.  Hope that this helps.\n\n",

If a colon cancer is found, then scans (CAT scans and bone scans; sometimes a PET scan) are done to identify as best as possible where the cancer is and where it isn't.  If the cancer can be removed, then the surgeon will remove nearby lymph nodes to see if the cancer has spread there.  The surgeon will also take a look inside the abdomen/pelvis to check for evidence that the cancer has spread.   I have seen patients with early stage colon cancer present with severe abdominal pain due to the cancer blocking the colon.  Ihave also seen patients with wide spread disease present with very few symptoms.  Take care.  Jeffrey A. Gordon, M.D.\n\n",

In the U.S. there are two standard chemotherapy regimens using 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin chemotherapy to treat colon cancer that has spread to the regional lymph nodes (Stage III or Stage C): 1.) the 5-FU and the leucovorin are given five days in a row every month (the leucovorin is low-dose at 20 mg per meter squared) and 2.) the 5-FU and the leucovorin are given once a week for 6 weeks in a row every 8 weeks (theleucovorin is high-dose at 500 mg per meter squared).  Although in Europe continuous infusion of 5-FU is given more often than is used in the U.S., even then the leucovorin is usually high-dose in nature.  The two different 5-FU and leucovorin regimens that I mentioned above (termed the Mayo regimen and the Roswell Park regimen, respectviely) are equivalent to each other in their effectiveness, but do have somewhat different toxicities.  I find, as do many Medical Oncologists who treat patients with colon cancer, that the Roswell Park regimen is tolerated better than the Mayo regimen, especially in older people.  There has not been a formal comparison of low-dose versus high-dose leucovorin when used as part of the Roswell Park regimen in the post-operative setting of Stage III colon cancer, as far as I am aware.  I am aware of a British study that compared high-dose leucovorin to low-dose leucovorin as part of chemotherapy treatment in the setting of metastatic or advanced Stage IV disease.  In this one trial, it appeared that there were no differences in the effectiveness of the chemotherapies.  There seemed to be less side effects with the use of low-dose leucovorin.  However, there are other studies that report more effectiveness by using the high-dose leucovorin compared to the low-dose leucovorin the Stage IV colon cancer.  In treating Stage III colon cancer, I use the published Roswell Park regimen that uses high-dose leucovorin.  Without any other data about using low-dose leucovorin in Stage III disease, I would stay with a published and time-tested chemotherapy regimen.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 56 year old woman who has been generally in good health until a few monnths ago. I had what seemed to be a gastro-like flu with diarrhea and aches over Thanksgiving. Since then, almost like clockwork, about every 4 or 5 days I get stomach cramps, sorenss in right lower abdomen, diarrhea (very soft stool but not watery), accompanied by lower back pain, fatigue, and occasional headaches and aches under my underarms. During this period I've also had muscles aches on my right flank.   What's so strange is these symptoms last for about 2 to 3 days and then I feel fine, but then they'll return 4 or 5 days later.  For your information, I was diagnosed with stage 1 breast cancer in 1994 and continue to be monitored by my oncologist. When I told him of my symptoms he arranged for an abdominal CT, a bone scan, and MRIs of my right brachial plexus, thoracic area and cervival and lumbar spine. Everything turned out unremarkable. My blood tests were also in the normal range including tumor marker tests.  I also went to see my gynecologist who did a pelvic ultrasound as part her exam as well as a fecal blood smear and pap. All negative.   Three years ago I had a colonoscopy which showed no polyps or other abnormalities.  Do you have any idea what could cause these symptoms to appear for a few days, disappear, and then return on a weekly basis?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Bene,  Thank you very much for using our website.  What you are describing could be related to a couple of things.  1. Irritable bowel syndrome especially if you are eating ok, not loosing any weight and you have relief of the abdominal cramps with the bowel movements. 2. Malabsorption as a result of diarrheal disease that you had at the begining. 3. Low grade colon infection. 4. Some type of food allergy or intolerance that you developped recently and could be related to the diarrheal disease that you had.  My advice to you is: 1. Try to link this to a specific type of food if you could. 2. Do a screening test for stool infections called stools for white cells. 3. Talk to your doctor about prescribing you a medication for irritable bowel to try and see its effect on your symptoms.  Once more, thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: diarrea and blood in stool",
    "content": "Dear Feather,  This sounds more to me like an infectious type of diarrhea meaning that you had food poisoning from the food that you ate. The infectious agent is usually a virus. These infections are usually self limited and should not cause any harm unless the diarrhea is so severe to the extent of causing dehydration.   Blood in the stools is an alarming symptom. My advice is that to see a doctor if the blood in the stools does not go away after the diarrhea is gone. Blood in the stools with diarrhea usually means that the inside of the colon is inflammed from the infection.

    "content": "Dear VK, sorry for your father but in reality I am so concerned about his general condition since he is 78 years old. I have explained in the same section about this disease and in particular metastaic and advanced cases. In general patient of colon cancer with metastases that are potentially resectable should undergo definitive surgical resection of the primary tumo. Consideration should be given to preoperative therapy. In such cases, conversion to resectability has been seen in up to 75% of cases.Then the patient should be reassessed for respectability and further management.this is in reality the only way to acheive a possible 5 year survival in such cases for more tahn 20%.  Other wise in cases of inoperability due to general condition or extensive metstatic disease treatment is of palliative role. Palliative surgery, RT, and palliative chemotherapy are of considerable approaches according to the situation. 5-FU remains the mainstay of chemotherapy treatment for colorectal cancer. However the increased response rates and prolonged progression-free survival seen  with the combinations of 5-FU, leucovorin, and either irinotecan or oxaliplatin has introduced new options for the treatment of this disease. patients should be encouraged to participate in well-designed clinical trials involving new regimens whenever possible. Best regards\n\n",

    "content": "Dear dido  the informations you wrote are very deficient to give you an answer about the possible line of therapy he might be eligible for.  I would like to know what  kind of chemotheraypy regimens did your patient received and is it a metastatic disease or there is a local disease in addition. Also are theses metastatic lesions resctable or not(anatomic site, size, their number in addition to the patient general condition).  since surgery is the only universally accepted potentially curative treatment for colorectal cancer, surgical resection for primary, recurrent and or metastatic lesions is to be considred whenever possible. The 5 year survival for resection of solitary or combination etastases exceeds 20%. However, this is a general approach to patients with recurrent and or metastatic siease:  1. Surgical resection of isolated metastases (liver, lung, ovaries).  2. Palliative surgical interference for primary and  secondary sites (for bleeding & obstruction).  3. Palliative Chemotherapy. Clinical trials evaluating new drugs and biologic therapy should be considered for those patients whenever possible. 4.  Radiation therapy to the primary or metastatic tumor to palliate bleeding, obstruction, or pain Local control therapy: Patients with limited (3 or less) hepatic metastases, resection may be considered with 5-year survival rates of 20% to 40%. For those with unresectable, cryosurgical ablation has been associated with long-term tumour control. Other local ablative techniques that have been used to manage liver metastases include embolization and interstitial radiation therapy.  Hepatic intra-arterial chemotherapy with floxuridine for liver metastases has produced higher overall response rates but no improvement in survival when compared to systemic chemotherapy. The use of the combination of intraarterial chemotherapy with hepatic irradiation, especially  focal radiation of metastatic lesions, is under evaluation. Patients with limited pulmonary metastases, and patients with both pulmonary and hepatic metastases, may also be considered for surgical resection, with possible 5-year survival in highly selected patients. Systemic therapy: In metastatic and recurrent colon cancer, chemotherapy has been used for palliation, with 5-FU-based regimen considered to be standard  treatment (can be used as either single agent or in combination with leucovorin and irinotecan).  Irinotecan (CPT-11) is a topoisomerase-I inhibitor with a 10% to 20% partial response rate . It is now considered standard 2 nd line therapy for patients with metastatic disease who do not respond to or progress on 5-FU.  Oxaliplatin, alone or combined with 5-FU and leucovorin, has shown promising activity in previously treated and untreated patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and in patients with 5-FU refractory disease  Tomudex, is a specific thymidylate synthase inhibitor which has demonstrated activity similar to that of bolus 5-FU and leucovorin.   Capecitabine, an oral fluoropyrimidine carbamate, has been compared to 5-FU plus leucovorin in a phase III study. The drug has a higher response rate , although survival, duration of response, and time-to-disease progression were similar. It may serve to substitute for 5-FU plus leucovorin as a less toxic single agent or in combinations. best of wishes\n\n",
