    "content": "Hello,  I attempted suicide about a month ago by ingesting about 30 antidepressant pills (Lexapro). I've since started an aggressive regimen of Effexor and Abilify as well as individual and group therapy.  I'm concerned, however, that even if I didn't sustain kidney and liver damage immediately following my overdose, I can expect kidney damage in the long term that will require dialysis. The paramedic who arrived at the scene of my overdose stated that I may have to undergo dialysis in 10-15 years, and my attending nurse corroborated that.  Is there anything I can do (e.g., lifestyle changes in diet) within the next 10 or so years to reduce the odds that I will eventually require kidney dialysis? This of course assumes that I will overcome my suicidal tendencies, and I'm working hard to do just that.   Thank you, and I look forward to hearing from you.  Best,  isapr5\n\n",

According to the Lexapro Official FDA information renal failure is a rare complication of a Lexapro overdose. That certainly is not meant to imply \"Never\" but rare. Some of the causes of chronic disease are uncontrolled hypertension and diabetes, large quantities of over the counter pain relievers, large quantities of caffiene, etc. Eat a healthy diet, exercise and continue your treatment for your depression.

    "content": "Hello,  Women of childbearing age do not often get pregnant whilst on dialysis because the high level of waste products from renal failure interfere with ovulation and the menstrual cycle. Do you still get your perdiods? If a woman becomes pregnant while on dialysis they often develop high blood pressure which almost always causes problems leading to premature delivery.  In one study performed in the United States, 1.5% (between one and two in a hundred) of young women on dialysis became pregnant in a two year period. Half the pregnancies resulted in the birth of a live child. There were many miscarriages in early pregnancies, and some stillbirths. All living babies were born prematurely.  I think it would be better if you wait till after a kidney transplant. While there are still risks, the likelihood of a successful pregnancy rises to over 70%.   You would also be better able to care for a child if they had a kidney transplant, rather than being on dialysis.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

Of course, pregnancy on PD is very rare, but it is possible. The percentage in Croatia (my country) is 1-2%, I think. No more.  In our Case Report, pregnancy resulted in the birth of a live child.

    "content": "Hello -  As strange as it may seem, the coil staying put is less likely to cause a problem than going in to get it, largely because it is made of material intended to dwell in the body's tissues, so it's unlikely to cause a problem unless it eventually moves into a spot where it is blocking something. This is also unlikely, because of the coil design, which will likely cause some scar tissue to grow into and around it, holding in still. Going in to remove it when it's not causing a problem could actually be a lot more traumatic. Of course, if some problem, as unlkely as it is, should develop in the future, then removal would have to be decided upon by weighing risk vs. benefit. It should cause no problem where it is, however.   I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you and your mom.\n\n",

Voice changes are not typically a common complaint that I have encountered after dialysis treatment. The faint feeling may be related to hypotension (decreased blood pressure). I would strongly encourage you to make the team aware of your symptoms so that if a programming adjustment to the machine is required to adjust the amount of fluid removed it can be done. This may assist with alleviation of symptoms. Best wishes. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Cantante, Without visually inspecting the arm, I can say that yes, frequently \"knots\" can be noted along the placement of the scar.  An AV fistula (arteriovenous fistula) or shunt, is a surgically created shortcut or bypass from an artery to a vein for the purpose of dialysis.  The anastamosis (joining) of the two vessels can be felt as scar tissue.  The important thing is that there is a strong bruit or \"thrill\" felt along the scar line which indicated that the fistula is working. I am delighted on your mom's behalf that she has had renal recovery and the only caution I will remind you is that she should never have blood pressures or lab work done on that arm from here forward. The next time she has followup for the surgery, ask the surgeon about the \"knots\".\n\n",

Perhaps he knows something I don't, maybe he already knows the organism from a prior episode or from a gram stain. In general Ancef is a wonderful antibiotic but it works best when combined with an \"aminoglycoside\" for initial treatment. In other words I would have chosen teo antibiotics, one Ancef and then another to complement Ancef.   The fact that your mom's peritonitis is not better in six days further supports the theory that the antibiotic choice is not correct altogether. However, one must consider two other scenarios. Perhaps your mother has a fungal infection or an infection that is so strong that it requires removal of the catheter. At this point I would probably remove her catheter and add a second drug if not antifungals.   The key to this case seems to be the initial culture and cell count as well as proper identification of the organism. If these were blurry I would opt to expand coverage to more antibiotics or remove the catheter depending on the patient's condition.   Mark LaGatta\n\n",

I am very concerned with possible health risks. I have consulted with a tattoo removal M.D. But  I  was not satisfied with the answers to my questions, so I was hoping someone could answer them. My main health concerns include risk of possible liver damage, cardiovascular damage, ( arteries, heart, and lungs ) and even brain damage.  The reason for this is because I chose to have my tattooing done with a special type of compound which contains iron oxide. ( this prevents fading of the tattoo ) Tattoo removal is done with a short beams of laser that break up the tattoo pigments into fragments.  Then they are removed by your The body's immune system. My main concern is will the iron oxide posse any risk( as it travels through my blood stream.) to my arteries, liver, heart, or brain? And if so are these risk serious?? - Mike, CA\n\n",

Tattoo inks are not regulated by the FDA or any other watchdog. This means that not many studies (which need sponsoring, organizing) have been conducted to evaluate the risks which you have outlined. In short, no one can give you a concrete conclusion as to the long term effects of tattoo removal.   A good place to start researching is to perform a medline search at The National Library of Medicine.   Click here  Type in keywords such as iron oxide and heart disease and it will return all the studies performed using those keywords. If you find anything it would be best to return here and post it as not all published abstracts have the same credibility and the process of evaluation would best be left to an M.D. / researcher.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Mike,   How big of a tattoo(s) are we talking about? And was this iron used in all the colors of the tattoo(s) or just a few drops here and there?   If it is not that big of a tattoo(s) and it is not really in an obvious place(s), i would suggest for you to remove it surgically. i.e. Remove the part of skin where the tattoo(s) is present and this way you will not have to worry about the side effects of iron.   Iron can have detrimental effect on the health system if it chronically accumulates over a long period of time like in patients who need chronic blood transfusions or in patients born with an in-born error of iron metabolism called hemochromatosis.   Personally, i do not really think that the amount of iron present in the tattoo(s) that you have will pose any health threat, putting in mind that i am not a specialized person in tattoo removal. If you still have any major concerns, the best type of doctor to ask all these questions about iron would be a hematologist (a doctor specialized in blood diseases).   Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",
