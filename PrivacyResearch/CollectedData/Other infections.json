    "title": "Swelling of the membrane around right palatine tonsil",
    "content": "I suffer from canker sores occasionally and the day before yesterday I had two pop up, one on the inside of my lower lip and one inside my right, lower gum toward my third molar (so lodged between the gum and my tongue). It was causing soreness and stiffness on that side of my mouth and jaw, which is normal when I get one in a sensitive area like that, but then I started noticing more prominent soreness in my throat further back by my tonsil, so I decided to check it out. The odd thing is that neither tonsil is enlarged, but the membrane beneath my right palatine tonsil is enlarged and has odd impressions in it. It's still flesh colored, but it looks like a bunch of red blood cells squished together in a ball (its round, flat shapes with depressed centers), and my right lymph node is enlarged also, but not tender or sore. My tonsils have been enlarged from pharyngitis before, so i know it's not the tonsil itself that's enlarged, as odd as that sounds. I don't have any other symptoms other than the soreness, and, of course, the sudden appearance of two cankers. It doesn't look like tonsillitis, either, plus I've had no fever or cold symptoms, and I was tested for Mono about a year ago, so it probably isn't that. Any idea what it is?\n\n",

I also have various other symptoms: migratory joint pain, vision problems, recurrent/resistant/or opportunistic infections.   In March, I had the Lyme ELISA done. It came back negative - 0.28.

    "title": "Re: ELISA - neg, Western Blot - pos: meaning?",
    "content": "Hi, The ELISA test for Lyme disease tests for the presence of IgM isotype antibodies against B. burgdorferi (Bb). As it has high false-positive rates, it is typically followed up with a second test using a technique called Western blotting. It is reported as a single number that refers to the relative quantity of antibodies.  It is still used as a screening assay as it has specificity rates of 90-100%. The test is fully automated.   IgM  isotype class antibody (IgM WB) is the first to appear following the infection , followed by a predominantly IgG antibody synthesis after a period of weeks. Moreover, after B.burgdorferi exposure, early (even inadequate) treatment can render an affected individual permanently seronegative. Therefore, in early or treated patients, seropositivity may not indicate 'active' Lyme disease. After successful teatment, if a patient is monitored serologically, IgM would show a rise for about a month, followed by a slow decline. However, it may remain positive in a considerable number of individuals for greater than one year. Therefore a persistent lower levels of IgM do not always imply persistent infection.  (Lyme disease - United States, 1993. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 1994;43:564-71).  Unfortunately, the sensitivity of the ELISA  varies considerably (ranging from 55% to 90%) depending upon the clinical manifestations and duration of infection.  A single number is reported that reveals the relative quantity of antibodies in the patient\u2019s serum against the agent of Lyme disease.   The western blot test detects and measures the levels of the IgG isotype class antibody. Since the antibody response develops slowly, during the early stage of the disease the test may have a sensitivity of only 50-75%, meaning that the test only detects the disease in 50 to 75 percent of those who truly have it.  (American Family Physician; Diagnosis of Lyme disease; Depietropaolo, Powers et al.; 2005).  However,in later stages of the disease, false negative results are uncommon and so,the test sensitivity in late stages of the disease averages over 95 percent. ELISA/Western blot can also return false positives.  Criteria vary for the interpretation of Western blot in the United States and in Europe. Earlier, the interpretation needed  visual inspection of the intensity of certain \"bands\" by expert technicians. Presently, automated machines are able to perform this and thus, minimizing the chances of \"subjective error\". Within the US, the Centers for Disease Control advocate a standard method for evaluating the Western blot as positive: 2 out of 3 bands (23, 39 or 41 kD) on the IgM or 5 out of 10 bands on the IgG (18, 23, 28, 30, 39, 41, 45, 58, 66, 93). One drawback of this method (despite its advantage of providing uniformity) is that, the listed \u201cspecific\u201d bands do not include certain other bands known to be specific for Bb (ex.,31 kD and 34 kD).  Thus, diagnosing Lyme disease based solely on the interpretation of the test values poses many problems. It has therefore been recommended that  the diagnosis should take into consideration the \"pretest probability\". The more closely the patient's symptomatology matches and the more endemic the disease is in an area, the higher the pretest probability of the disease becomes.  It appears that you are concerned that your \"Parkinson-like\" tremors could be as a result of Lyme disease.  For early neurologic disease (facial and other cranial nerve palsies, and radiculoneuropathy), a CSF/serum ratio value of 0.5 for IgM and IgA in paired serum and CSF antibody testing, is considered significant.   For suspected late Neurologic (CNS and Peripheral) type of Lyme disease, serology is an essential. These patients usually have positive serologic tests, unless they had been previously treated or immunosuppressed. It is extremely unlikely to have CNS Lyme disease in the context of negative serologic results. A positive finding in paired serum and CSF antibody testing generally diagnoses CNS Lyme disease. By antibody capture ELISA, a positive result is defined as a ratio of CSF to serum IgG antibody levels of 1.5 or higher.   PCR testing on CSF is available but not highly sensitive in this setting and seems to have a lower sensitivity than antibody levels or ratios. In the setting of negative serology and negative CSF antibodies, it is highly unlikely to see a positive PCR in CSF. A positive PCR result does not indicate definitively that current infection is present, but it only strongly suggests current or very recent infection.  Parkinson-like tremors can occur in another condition known as 'Essential Tremor Syndrome' (ET).

    "content": "I am a 33 year old female, with no past medical problems other than being diagnosed with Poly-Cystic Ovary Syndrome in 2002. I awoke from a nap on August 2nd, 2010 with a fever, which has yet to go away. On August 9th, I was diagnosed with pneumonia, however neither a course of Augmentin nor Azithromyacin did anything to relieve the symptoms. I have undergone numerous tests since (blood work, blood cultures, CT Scan on brain due to severe headaches, 2nd chest x-ray), all of which came up negative, with the exception of the chest x-ray, which I was told showed the bottom lobes of both lungs to be partially collapsed. I am not experiencing any chest pain, however I do have occasional slight shortness of breath. My heart rate has been elevated as well, as high as 120bpm that I can recall.  My red and white blood cell counts are normal, as is my platelet count, and I was told that no tests showed any bacteria or reason for an infection or fever. I have now had a fever for 20 days, ranging between 99-103 degrees daily. I am also experiencing terrible sweating fits daily, to the point where I sweat though my clothes at least once a day. I have no appetite, and have lost 9 pounds in the last 20 days, and sleep very irregularly. I am unable to work, and I can hardly function on a daily basis. Can anyone assist me in determining what I should suggest my doctor test next week at an appointment I have scheduled? My doctor has discussed doing a full body scan to check for tumors as well as doing a spinal tap. Thank you in advance for your assistance.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I am currently in nursing school, and a recent incident has been troubling me for about a week now.    I entered the room of a patient with contact isolation for MRSA, and I was planning only to talk to the patient from the doorway.    After minutes, the patient asked me to help her unwrap the toothbrush, which she had been holding in her hands since I first walked into the room.       I'm ashamed to say I must have forgotten the contact precaution at this time, so I walked into the room, took the toothbrush from her hands and unwrapped it, WITHOUT WEARING GLOVES.    Quickly realizing my mistake I left the room, used an alcohol-sanitizer, then still feeling guilty I washed my hands with soap and warm water, making sure to scrub all the way to my elbows (as I was wearing a short sleeved scrub-top that day.)    Even later, when I got home from work I cut my finger nails making special precaution not to cut or break any of the skin surrounding my nail beds.  In all honesty, I am both quite anxious and guilty feeling for my rookie-mistake, and I will continue to assess the 2 red dots, but my question is,  should I be more alarmed?  Should I get myself tested?  & if so, how much does a MRSA test cost assuming health insurance doesn't cover it (as of now, I have no idea if this is covered by mine.)\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Casual Contact with MRSA Patient",
    "content": "Hello, You have taken all the precautions that should be necessary.  Unless you developed an infection somewhere in your body where the bacteria could grow, you will not get it from casual contact, especially with good handwashing.  Gloves and other precautions are helpful for sure but the hand washing and/or sanitizing is adequate in most cases.  You would have to have a route of entry for the infection.  Our skin is a normally good barrier.  If you did become infected somehow, there would be symptoms of infection.  MRSA just indicates it is a resistant strain of bacteria (resistant to the usual antibiotic treatments).  This is only a problem if you actually get infection in your body somehow. Does this make sense?  Just being exposed to a person with this infection does not mean you get it, especially if you are healthy and using normally good hygiene.    About 1% of the population have this bacteria in their noses without ever getting infection from it.  The risk is the greatest in a person whose immune system is depressed and due to illness, etc. they are unable to fight the bacteria.  They are already weakened and therefore susceptible to the bacteria.  This is usually the case with hospital associated MRSA.  If you are to be a nurse, you will be exposed to many infections.  Make it a habit to use good hygiene, regardless of gloves and other protection.  It is important for you not to obsess over every exposure but to use reasonable good sense and judgment.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Acinetobacter Baumannii is not part of normal flora in healthy individuals.Individuals in certain situations may become colonized with this organism(heath care settings-esp,patients in ICUs and health care workers).This organism can live both on dry as well as wet surfaces for weeks. A. baumannii colonization is usually limited, except during epidemic situations.It does not cause disease in healthy individuals.  It appears that you have somehow acquired a carrier status (detailed history unavailable). Multidrug resistance in A. baumannii is on the increase. Therefore, it will be wiser not to use too many systemic antibiotics, which may lead to antibiotic resistance. For the time being, you should avoid visiting ICUs, other critical care areas or very ill individuals, and if circumstances are unavoidable, you must inform the health care personnel about your carrier status so that precautionary measures may be undertaken.  The A. baumannii grown in your nasal secretions should be serotyped and its sensitivity to antibiotics determined. It is also important to make sure that you are immunocompetent. Your local hospital will be able to guide you regarding this. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,PUO is diagnosed if a paitent has more than 38C in several occasions in 3 weeks and inability to diagnose in 1 week of inpatient treatment after investigations. Most of these ultimately turn out to be either infections,cancers or  autoimmune disorders.Bacterial causes would include abscesses,tuberculosis,urinary infections,HIV,Brucellosis(History of contact with cattle),tick bites(lyme disease)Drug fever(Betalactams),collagen disease,etc. In your case tuberculosis still needs to be ruled out despite normal xrays.Mantoux test,early moring gastric aspirates,culture of urine for AFB may be required.Also many patients with PUO over 50 have been diagnosed with connective tissue disorders thus needing ANA testing.Lymphomas need to be ruled out too. In tropics the first to ruled out would be tuberculosis. Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I just cut myself while trimming the fat off of some raw pork ribs. It is a small cut near the tip of my finger. I washed off the cut, but continued handling the pork once it stopped bleeding. I minimally wrapped it in a paper towel and did not disinfect my finger...I just avoided touching the pork with it as much as possible.  I am concerned about potential infections such as streptococcus suis and MRSA.  How should I proceed, should I go to a doctor already? I am not presenting any symptoms (and, realistically, I might be perfectly healthy), but I am not sure what the proper procedure is in this case. I am aware that early treatment of streptococcus suis is important so I definitely don't want to let it progress to a point that is dangerous for my health.  Please give me some advice as to how I should proceed. I have disinfected the cut with alcohol but have done nothing else.  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The risk of this infection lies mostly in those having contact with wild boars, livestock, butchering, etc.  where sick animals might be involved. People processing the meat are those who have been at risk; not the end consumer. This is not so likely in the U.S. but has occurred in some countries such as China.    You have handled the first-aid procedures well and unless you show signs of infection at the wound site it is extremely unlikely you would have contracted this.    Raw meat should always be handled carefully but I suspect this will not result in a problem for you.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Blue Fish,  Hepatitis A is a highly contagious infection of the liver by the HepA Virus.  It causes inflammation that affects liver function.  Hepatitis A does not have a chronic stage, isn't progressive or cause permanent liver damage.  The person with Hepatitis A is very ill during the course of the disease.  Symptoms include jaundice (yellowing of skin and the eyes), fever, pain in the abdomen and/or sharp pains in the upper right abdomen, nausea, diarrhea, weight loss, fatigue, itching, dark amber urine caused by bile, and  light colored feces due to the lack of bilirubin in bile due to inadequate liver function.  Hepatitis B is also a contagious infection, caused by the HepB Virus.  It also causes inflammation of the liver, known as hepatitis.  Symptoms include malaise or a general feeling of ill health, nausea, vomiting, body aches, fever, loss of appetite, dark urine, and jaundice.  Itchy skin can also occur.  The illness lasts for several weeks and usually gradually improves.  It can be totally asymptomatic and be unrecognized, though complications can still occur without symptoms.  Some people have a more severe infection, which can lead to death.  Chronic Hepatitis B may lead to cirrhosis of the liver and to liver cancer.    Both Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B can be prevented by vaccination.  Persons who have had the disease(s) develop antibodies which prevent reinfection by the viruses, although they may already have developed complications from the initial infection.    Laboratory test results are usually given as \"positive\" or \"negative\".  Reference ranges can vary by laboratory and type of test that is used, when serum amounts are given.  If a person has had vaccination for either or both diseases, a serum amount given will usually mean it is positive for successful vaccination result.  In your case, I would interpret your results as that you have been successfully immunized against Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B, as in some laboratories the high normal level can be as high as 800.  If you have been given a laboratory result on a sheet of paper, it should include the normal reference range for the test given and I would expect that the numbers you were given would fall into the normal reference range.  If you are confused by the reference range numbers and the relationship of your numbers to them, you can provide them to me and I'll help you understand them, or if you prefer, you can ask for clarification from your doctor or even from the laboratory.  If you suspect that you have an infection despite vaccination (which would be extremely unlikely!), please see your doctor right away.  I hope all this information has been helpful to you and that I've covered the information that you need.\n\n",

There is also a condition that comes to mind, if the above has been ruled out, called balanitis ( yeast infection) that causes redness, swelling etc.  which occurs more often in uncircumcised men. If it is simple skin irritation that has caused this then a creme such as hydrocotisone would take care of the problem. However, I would suggest and encourage that you be evaluated by your physician to rule out any other causative factors. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Every drug, before being approved for clinical use undergoes a series of tests. This generally starts with testing in animals, followed by phase 1 to phase 4 trials in humans(phase 4 being post-marketing studies).During  post-marketing studies, information on adverse events continue to be gathered(an ongoing process).  The following or some of the nervous system and eye-related adverse events that have been allegedly reported(in less than 1% of patients) during post marketing surveillance of Cefpodoxime (This is not in any sense a complete list of side effects and others may occur).  Nervous system side effects have included headache (1%), dizziness, insomnia, somnolence, anxiety, irritation, shakiness, nervousness, cerebral infarction, change in dreams, impaired concentration, confusion, nightmares, paresthesia, vertigo, tinnitus, hallucination, hyperkinesia, syncope, and somnolence. Some cephalosporins have been associated with seizures in renally impaired patients.Ocular side effects have included eye irritation.  Extraocular muscle palsies(external ophthalmoplegia) are among the known ocular manifestations of typhoid fever.These are believed to be caused by either direct invasion of tissues by the organism or due to a hypersensitivity phenomenon.  Cefpodoxime is a oral third generation cephalosporin and thus one among the relatively more recent additions.The diplopias that your cousins are experiencing, may or may not be related to their use. However,they should consult an ophthalmologist urgently.  I urge you also,to have these manifestations reported to the concerned authorities (such as the FDA in the US) in the country you live in. Every such report is vitally important in identifying adverse events. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Swelling of skin on toe after ripping off a deep hangnail.",
    "content": "Hi, Your history strongly suggests an acute paronychia.  Paronychia is a soft tissue infection which arises close to the finger/toe nail.It is caused by damage to the nail's cuticle which normally acts as a barrier between the skin of the nail fold and the nail.  There are two types, - acute and - chronic.  Predisposing factors: Diabetes mellitus, immunocompromise, constant wetting of fingers(certain professions, homemakers, nail biting/sucking fingernails, ingrown nails, improper technique of nail manicuring, drug therapy(steroids) etc.  Infection usually starts at one of the collateral nail folds or proximal nail fold. If untreated, it can spread around the nail or even under the nail.  Most common causative organism is staph aureus but, other organisms may also be involved.  Early cases are managed non-operatively (Warm water soaks, elevating the limb, oral antibiotics and analgesics).  More advanced cases may go on to form an abscess that may need incision and drainage.  In your case, you need to see a surgeon and get it sorted out. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "On July 3 I went into the ER to get my R side of my hip sutured up from an accidental knife stabbing...the doc said I stabbed myself in a pretty safe spot and could have been alot worse etc. told me to watch for infections and get the sutures removed in 7 days. Everything has been fine with it...I started to walk again for the most part without crutches until last night, I was sitting down and my wound became extremely swollen and felt like extreme muscle tightness in my hip so I tried to raise my hip as much as possible. When I awoke this morning it still hurt but the pain was tolerable but still with severe swelling, thinking the problem could be my sutures since its been now 9 days since they went in(I wanted to make sure my wound was fully healed so it wouldn't split open) I removed the first 2 with no problem but once I removed the 3rd it opened up a little bit again and this(what seems to be fat)really dark substance came out....I continued to push a little bit because it seemed to relieve pressure in my leg but it started to hurt a little bit so I stop thinking I maybe hurting it more then helping it. The pain has mostly went away now though after removing some sutures and pushing some of that dark ooze out. So my question is what is up with this extreme muscle tightness and swelling? I clean my wound daily, check out infections, I clean it in the shower with hot water and small amounts of soap, also before re-applying a new bandage I apply Hydrogen Peroxide to the area and over the wound, and then of course neosporin last. Also what about the black ooze gunk? Should I continue to push it out to relieve more swelling or leave it be? Any questions from you please ask to help out more I will be standing by.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Problems with stab wound...possible infection? Black Ooze?",
    "content": "Hi, From your history, it appears that there had been a hematoma deep within the sutured stab wound. The blackish fluid that came out is probably the old clotted blood perhaps mixed with some fat.  Ideally you should have consulted your doctor rather than managing on your own. It is possible that some of that collection is still there (inadequate drainage). This may need to be fully drained. An inadequately drained collection is prone to continuing infection.No amount of cleaning and dressing with topical antibiotics or even using  parenteral antibiotics is likely to be of any help when part of the collection remains un-drained.  I urge you to consult your surgeon immediately and get it treated adequately treated. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Low neutrophils & high lymphocytes",
    "content": "Hi, While performing a differential leukocyte count, 100 cells in a stained peripheral blood smear are counted and reported as percentages. If the lymphocyte % is increased, others have to decrease proportionately out of a total of 100.This is known as 'relative' lymphocytosis.  What is more accurate is \"absolute\" count of each of the different leukocytes.  In subjects >12 years of age, lymphocytosis is defined as an absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) >4,000/\u00b5L (also expressed as >4,000/mm3 or >4.0 x 10(9)/L). ALC's are higher in neonates and young children(counts as high as 8,000/\u00b5L).This is known as \"absolute\" lymphocytosis.  Lymphocytosis is a fairly common occurrence and is seen at some point of time in most people's lives, usually in association with viral infections.  Lymphocytosis is commonly short lived, and extensive investigations of such cases by is both unnecessary and unrewarding.  There are many other uncommon causes of absolute Lymphocytosis which include, - viral infections (infectious mononucleosis, cytomegalovirus infections, hepatitis) etc, - protozoal infections(toxaplasmosis,trypanasomiasis), - acute bacterial infections(pertussis), - chronic intracellular bacterial infections(brucellosis, tuberculosis), - acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and - chronic lymphocytic leukemia.  What your differential count showed is relative lymphocytosis. Apart from the minor viral illnesses already alluded to, there are some other conditions which can cause relative lymphocytosis such as, - Addison's disease, - thyrotoxicosis, - splenomegaly with sequestration of granulocytes, and - connective tissue disorders.  I hope this information is useful to you. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Low neutrophils & high lymphocytes",
    "content": "Hi,  Thank you for keeping in touch. I am terribly sorry, i concentrated more in the differential count!  Normocytic/normochromic (NC/NC) anemia is one in which the average size and hemoglobin content of the red blood cells(RBCs) are within normal range. Usually microscopic examination of the red cells shows that they are much like normal cells in size and depth of staining in a peripheral smear.  Usual causes include sudden blood loss, sepsis, tumor, prosthetic heart valves, chronic disease, certain drug therapies or aplastic anemia. Chronic disease and drugs are perhaps the commoner among the causes.  It was a common practice to report normochromia based on the depth of staining of the RBCs in the peripheral smears. The red cell indices now-a-days, also help to determine this.  Sometimes, there may be marked variations in size and shape of the RBCs, but these happen to be such that they tend to equalize one another, thereby resulting in a apparently normal average(normocytic/normochromic).  This possibility may be suspected by scrutinizing the RDW(red cell diameter width) value, which is normally included as component of complete blood count. RDW is a measure of the variation of volume of the RBCs.  One notable example are the Sideroblastic anemias. They are anemias characterized by inadequate marrow utilization of iron for Hemoglobin synthesis despite the availability of adequate or increased amounts of iron (iron-utilization anemias). Although hypochromic RBCs are produced, increased RDW results in the picture of a normocytic/normochromic anemia (as per the RBC indices), if one overlooked the RDW value!  I hope this information is helpful. Best wishes!\n\n",

I've always had frequent and bad attacks.  i take 800mg of aciclovir daily for maintenance, but still get break through infections.  i have always had some nerve pain at the site of the attack and usually down my leg/buttocks/ankle and this feels like small electric shocks, sensitivity to the cold and very sensitive to touch in the area of the nerve pain.  This normally only lasts 2-4 days just prior to and during an attack.  This particular time the nerve pain is totally excruciating, going not only across my buttocks and down my leg (causing me to limp with pain) but also up through my armpit, down my arm and into my hand.  all EXTREMELY sensitive to touch that i can hardly bear to have clothing touch my skin.  This has been going on for 2 weeks now and is making me extremely depressed.  i am sure i have post herpetic neuralgia (PHN) but am told that this can only happen if I've had shingles (which i haven't, but when i was 3 my doc said i had the chicken pox so badly that if i was an adult he would have called it shingles).  i have asked my doctor for pain relief from this terrible nerve pain, but have been told that gabapentin/neurontin will not be prescribed unless I have had shingles and he says it's PHN, which obvisouly he won't.  I understand that a combination therapy of gabapentin and morphine is the best for nerve pain, but i can't get anyone to help me.  CAN severe genital herpes CAUSE nerve damage?  i can't imagine why else i would be suffering such nerve pain otherwise.  please if anyone can give me some advice i'd be very grateful as this awful pain is getting too much and the doctors don't' want to help.\n\n",

    "content": "The well-known complications of genital herpes are recurrent painful genital sores and psychological distress in persons who know they are infected. Nerve damage has not been documented as a complication.  Post-herpetic neuralgia is a complication of herpes zoster, commonly known as shingles. Herpes zoster is not the same disease as genital herpes. The former is caused by the varicella-zoster virus; the latter is caused by the herpes simplex virus.  The excruciating pain that you are experiencing in the buttocks and radiating down the lower limb to your ankle is very suggestive of a lesion in the lumbo-sacral spine affecting the lumbar or sacral nerves.  You must have an MRI scan of the lumbo-sacral spine under the management of a spinal orthopaedic surgeon. Treatment will depend on the findings. There are certain drugs that are very useful for neuropathic pain, but I do not prescribe on the internet. I am sure that the spinal surgeon will assist you in this respect. An MRI scan of the neck region is also indicated to investigate the pain in the shoulder radiating to your hand.   I am very concerned about the remarks you made that doctors do not want to help you with your present complaints. Did you consult  your primary care physician?

I never had these pains until i got herpes when I was 18.  For some reason my profile says I'm in the USA but I am actually in the UK and our public healthcare system would never allow for an MRI scan and it would cost me thousands and thousands to have it done privately.  i did consult with my GP but all i was given was dihydrocodeine, which I already told him i have tried, and know it does not work for nerve pain, and he jsut told me it was out of his area and to go to the genito urinary clinic, for which i have an appointment on 1st june.  however, they would not refer me for an MRI either.  also i think that because i had an episode of clinical depression some 5 years ago, most doctors presume any pain i have is psychosomatic.  Thank you very much for your comments, and i will investigate how much it is to see a private orthopedic surgeon, although I'm sure i will need a referral from my GP and he doesn't seem interested.\n\n",

    "content": "i've had herpes for about 20 years with outbreaks happening once to twice a year; lately, i've developed the same pain in one buttock, very sharp and enduring; it never goes completely away, but grows in intensity just before an outbreak; i visited a neurologist who prescribed Clonazepam (\"Rivotril\") which relieves the pain for about 12 hours; it's very addictive though so i only use it when the pain is really bad.  it seems to me there's some research needing to be done on this issue; long time sufferers of herpes do seem to develop nerve damage with resulting pain in the legs and buttocks; i have never been injured (in these areas) so getting an MRI seems unnecessary; i was wondering----has anyone thought of accupuncture?\n\n",

    "title": "nerve pain from GH",
    "content": "I am 46 years old, female, and have had GH for about 25 years.  My lesions occur less frequently now but I still experience nerve pain and sensitivity usually going down the back of my left leg and to my feet.  This usually happens when I'm a bit run down or my immune system is taxed for some reason.  I believe my neuropathy worsened when I had a bad flu almost 4 years ago.  My immune system was really stressed because of the flu and I began to have all types of nervous system problems.  I would stop breathing when I started to go to sleep, my heart seemed like it was struggling to work, I had nerve pain in the tips of my fingers, teeth and the bottoms of my feet that I'd never had before.  As I was starting to get better and walking around my feet actually inflamed on the sides and I could hardly walk from the neuropathy.  As my strength returned this got better but by the end of the day I could hardly stand.  I went to a neurologist but he couldn't find anything wrong and said it must have been due to the flu virus and that I should recover.  When we returned to the U.S. I was referred to a chiropractor and began treatments on my spine.  This is what began to aleviate my problems.  I believe the manipulation of my lower lumbar was what took the pain away.  Now we are back in Brazil and in a city where we have no chiropractor and my symptoms are returning.  I occasionally have sleep apnea again and heart pounding and am having nerve pain in my feet.  The typical pain and sensitivity that I have in the back of the leg us usually helped with ibuprofen and it ususally helps diminish the severity of the GH.  I believe that it was the herpes virus that attacked my nervous system while I was so sick with the flu and caused the damage, not the flu virus itself, because it persists and happens along with the accompanying nerve pain in the leg.  I would recommend that anyone try chiropractic treatment for the relief of neuropathy caused by GH.  I wonder too if GH virus has something to do with the MS like symptoms that some of the posters have had, muscle weakness and lack of strength.\n\n",

    "content": "I have noticed these symptoms worsening in the past 2 years...i had and outbreak last week and have been developing symptoms of MS.  It started 2 years ago with the sharp pain shooting through my left buttock...down the hamstring...the back of the knee...calf muscle...heel and toes.  The pain wasnt helped by ibuprofen or asprin, only the anti-viral medications would decrease the duration.  My sister got GH from her boyfriend in 1997. She has been complaining of the same severe...almost unbearable buttock, leg and foot pain.  Im not an MD, but I think that we are on to something...could it possibly be some sort of HSV-2 mutation?? Is there a link between Multiple Sclerosis and GH?  Could this virus be damaging the Mylein lining of the nerves..causing the immune system to attack the Mylein while trying to suppress HSV-2???  I know my hypothesis my sound strange to the MD's that are here.  One more question...do any of you suffer from any allergies?  I have more food allergies than anyone that I know...I think this may also play a role concerning these new symptoms.  I have recently had many symptoms of MS. It stared with the symptoms you all are having...then i would have strange sensations in my left leg like...numbness, burning, pins and needles...feeling like something was crawling inside of my leg.. also random jerking of my leg.  Last week upon waking I was completely numb and weak on my entire left side from the chest down..after placing my left contact lens in I could not get it to focus...everything was blurry.  My left eye has been burning for a week, I also have terrible stabbing pain behind my left eye.  I have also had twitching of my eye and eye lid.  I will be seening a neurologist soon. I hope someone follows up on my post.  This is really serious!!!!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there, this is the first time I have joined any type of blog or forum...but reading the above stories compelled me to write. I am 30 years old and I was diagnosed with hsv 2 five months ago. My initial outbreak was excrutiating. I had only one lesion, but my lymph nodes in my genital area were extremely swollen, I had numbness from my unmbilical to my knees, sharp stabbing shooting pain that would travel down my upper leg. I had pins and needles in the bottom of my feet making it painful to walk, the \"nerve pain\" in my legs and buttocks made it extremely painful to sit, to where clothes and even goose bumps were painful. I also suffered extreme pain with urination, that I was worried would lead to urinary retention. I have had an outbreak every month since, thank goodness not nearly as painful or debilitating as the first primary outbread. The reason I am writing this is because I wanted to share the fact that I also still get \"nerve pain\" causing numbness, shooting/stabbing pain down my leg, aching, and its extremely painful to touch. This does not occur with every outbreak, however I do not get a lesion every time I get the nerve pain either. I know my body, and I know that this nerve pain WAS caused by the herpes simplex II virus. It is undeniable. Whether I have lesions internally or whether my first outbreak damaged my nerves I have no idea...im not sure how that works. However this nerve pain NEVER occured prior to my infection and it WAS terrible during my first outbreak and now continues to bother me occasionally. I am SO tired of visiting doctors offices and being told that herpes does not cause nerve pain such as this.....I want to know answers...how does the virus cause this?? Just a side note...I have heard that the drug tramadol/ tridural is very effective in treating nerve pain for those of you that cannot seem to find a remedy.\n\n",

    "content": "First, I have been diagnosed with GHS since about 2007, although my first \"tiny\" lesion near the bottom of my right labia appeared about mid 2005. BUT what wasn't tiny at all was the very severe low back pain and anterior thigh pain down to my knee that came before ( it is always before !! at least with me) the show of the tiny lesion. At first I did not put the two together, NOT AT ALL and I am a highly skilled anesthesia provider. Really I had been married so long, the thought of GHS was not a reality for me......such is life !!  I went to my OB/GYN showed him the spot and he said no it doesn't look like it. About 9 months later, again the pain BEFORE and the tiny lesion (for some reason my lesions do not look like what you might think, and at that point I had never seen a pustule or blister)and again not a real connect since my job is a very physical one, and agian the OBGYN said no it wasn't and suggested a biopsy (yes he is a good one). I said let's wait and see what happens over the next month. OK 3rd round.....the same tiny lesions, pain before....I started to see a pattern (I have a calender that I use to track these events) and I went to see OBGYN, and this time he agreed and we did a blood test and culture...blood test postive, culture negative ( not unusal). I was upset, and worried all the time, was this an outbreak ??? He offered me Valtrex  and I have to admit it helped. Being the little researcher that I am, I took myself off the valtrex after about 9 months to see what happens. NOT  a good idea. OK and this is the present time we are talking......SEVERE anterior lateral thigh, above the knee, around the inside of knee, and down to the front of my leg TERRIBLE pain, I was having to take 800 Motrin twice a day and do lots of interventions, and called a neurosurgeon friend thinking I had slipped or bulged my lumbar disk (the pain follow the L5 tract) BUT really I thought this was a pure physical mechanical event and did not except to see a GHV outbreak. he diagnosed me with L5 nerve root inflamation, put me on a steroid dose pack and I start PT in two days BUTTTTT then on the 4 th day of the predisone, a GHS outbreak and this time I actually think it looks like a more classic herpes. SOOOO now I am looking at the last few years, and I have 12 years of medical training......YES there is a clear and direct relationship. I am very glad to have found at least someone else who can discuss this and do plaan on an open talk with my Doc, but I aslo wonder does anyone know who is a leading expert in Herpes and other transmittable diseases that have the potential to affect the neuro paths and so gravely, one's life.....the tiny blisters are NOTHING compared to the pain, at least for me. Thank you for listening.....I have NEVER written on a blog before.\n\n",

I have never had an outbreak as bad as the one I am currently experiencing nor has an outbreak ever been accompanied by butt leg and foot pain.  The pain is absolutely awful!  It hurts even to have my cotton sweat pants swish over the skin on my legs.  I do not have any known injuries but 2 weeks prior to this outbreak I started exercising with weights very strenuously.  I was targeting the mid section including the abdominals, the side muscles, the lower back, the butt and the thighs.  I did no aerobic, foot ankle or lower leg work.  (actually I did use the leg press two of the ten days but with fairly light weight) I was working out between 1 and 2 hours five days a week.  I might add that I also do web development work so I sit in front of a computer all day in a chair which reclines leaving my legs almost dangling.  I had thought that maybe this was cutting off circulation and causing it--but this is not a new chair and it is very new very irritating pain.  This pain is aweful and I want it to go away.  Could it be nerve damage?  I know hsv lives on the nerve.\n\n",

    "content": "I too have been having the same problems with extreme muscle pains but I wasn't diagnosed with Herpes 2 until July 2010 although I was having symptoms of genital lesions showing up and disappearing after a week or two and not reappearing for months. I went to several doctors over the years but they all assumed I couldn't have a STD if I had stopped having sex. I don't study medicine but I know enough to know that just because I stop having sex doesn't mean that I am automatically cured of any STD I might have caught when I was still having sex. I explained that I was raped years ago and I assumed that they tested me for everything when they did a rape kit. When I didn't get a phone call back then I thought I was fine. When the outbreaks came later then I assumed it was just some type of temporary infection. When the lesions went away I didn't think nothing of it. When they returned months later I assumed I must have gotten an infection again somehow. I began to wonder if I ever was tested for STDs after being raped when one of my two children, my daughter, started having the same problems as I was having in 2007. I thought surely there is no way doctors would not test me for stds when I was pregnant. It seemed to be a common sense thing to do from my perspective. Finally in 2009 and 2010, the doctors supposedly tested me for Syphilis, Gonorrhea, Chlamydia, Hepatitis, HIV which all came back negative. I asked for to be tested for Herpes all the time but was told that I didn't have anything to worry about if the other tests were all negative. When I finally was able to get an appointment at the time of an outbreak the doctor tested me for Herpes and it came back positive. It took 20 years to finally find out what these outbreaks were. I have extreme muscle pains all over my body including my legs and buttocks, headaches, dizziness, and problems staying asleep. I suggested to my primary care doctor if the Herpes virus is the cause for all these symptoms but she said no it wasn't. After reading posts on this site I have to disagree with her. I was always told to speak to a psychiatrist regarding my symptoms because doctors always assumed I was just under stress or depressed. I told them I had nothing in my life to be depressed about other than the fact that I was having trouble finding out what was the cause of all those symptoms.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The kinds of illnesses your caregiver is fighting are not contagious and do not put you at risk.  In addition to not being contagious, infections do not travel via a caregiver who practices normal good handwashing and procedures, even if they handle other infectious patients.  The normal route of travel for infection is from one sick person to another; not carried by the caregiver who is not infected herself.  In victorian times before modern medicine understood disease, doctors were known to go with bloody hands and coats from one patient to another.  This could and did spread disease but now we know better.  While both of you are immune suppressed and susceptible to infection as a result, you are not at greater risk from this caregiver than from anyone else with whom you come in contact.

    "content": "Hi,  A week ago, I with indoors for more than six hours with a friend whom i'd hardly seen before then. She told me that she had a persisting cough and other symptoms which sounded very much to me like tuberculosis. I advised her to go to the hospital and the next day I offered to go to the hospital with her. I was with her there for about 4-5 hours while she waited to see the doctor. Well, the symptoms and her x-ray made the Dr strongly suspect tb and she was kept in the hospital. Tests have since been done to confirm tb but they didnt start her on meds till after 3 days in the hospital. She is HIV negative I have been to see her (in an isolation room) on three different occassions since her admission, usually for not more than 1-2 hours. I always wore an N95 respirator mask though she didnt wear any. Two days ago (four days after our first prolonged hang-out), I developed a slight cough which hasn't gone away. I have been to the doctor who says to come back in a couple of weeks for the ppd test. I am really worried now. Is it possible I could have caught it and the symptoms would be appearing so soon? Or am i just being paranoid? I hardly ever fall ill (I don't have HIV and my lifestyle does not put me at risk). Is it possible to have such a bad immune system that you could catch tb and express symptoms in less than a week? I'm quite scared. Please tell me what could be happening (or not) and what to expect.  I have read a lot about tb - incubation period, symptoms etc so please I would really appreciate an answer that is specific to my concerns. Thank you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Tuberculosis in less than a week?",
    "content": "Hi, Firstly, let me thank you for this thought-provoking post.   When persons with \"open\" pulmonary tuberculosis cough, sneeze, or speak, they emit tiny droplets of less than 25 \u03bcm in diameter, which evaporate instantly, leaving particulate organisms( each droplet containing roughly 10 bacilli). Once inhaled by another person,the droplet nuclei are then deposited within the alveoli lung. Macrophages then arrive and upon encountering the bacilli, they ingest and transport the bacteria to the regional lymph nodes.  The bacilli then have several potential fates:  1) They may be destroyed by the immune system,  2) they may overwhelm the defences, multiply and go onto cause primary TB,  3) they may remain  dormant and remain completely asymptomatic(even for years), or  4) they may begin to proliferate after a latency period (reactivation).  There is one very interesting study that is very pertinent to the question posed by you.  This is a study wherein the incidence of clinical tuberculosis and clinical leprosy among household members of tuberculosis and leprosy patients in Sri Lanka was studied.The study period was approximately 20 years (January 1981 to December 2001) and the total number of patients and contacts were 325 and 968 for tuberculosis and 726 and 3066 for leprosy, respectively.  This study concludes thus: \"These data show that in populations of comparable socio-economic, environmental and geographic locations, tuberculosis and leprosy show very different transmission patterns. In general, in tuberculosis household contacts, in spite of exposure, infection did not proceed to clinical disease. In contrast, a significant number of leprosy household contacts developed clinical leprosy. These findings have implications in the design and implementation of control programmes for these two diseases\". (http://www.tropicalmedandhygienejrnl.ne ... 7/abstract).  Thus, based on these available facts, i will try to answer you as follows:  Assuming that your friend has \"open\" cavitory pulmonary tuberculosis,  assuming that the droplets from her very first cough (in your presence) contained droplets harbouring viable tubercle bacilli,  assuming that you indeed inhaled these droplets,  assuming that the bacilli indeed reached your alveoli...........  the further fate of these bacilli will still remain an open question.  Going by the evidence, the chances of contracting clinical tuberculosis in a situation such as yours appears very small, although theoretically NOT IMPOSSIBLE. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Many types of flies are known to bite animals as well as humans. Bites can be very painful (ex; horse fly, sand fly) and may cause an allergic reaction to the salivary secretions released by the insects during the bite. Some of the flies can be vectors for certain diseases(ex; sand fly for leishmaniasis).  As you are pregnant, and as you have no idea as to which particular type of fly (or some other agent) is involved, it may be better to seek medical attention. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Tetanus Infection?",
    "content": "Hi, Almost all reported cases of tetanus occur in persons who either have never received the primary series of tetanus-preventing immunizations, or those who had completed a primary series but have not had a booster vaccination in the 10 years before the diagnosis. A booster dose is recommended every 10 years.   A new combination vaccine, called Tdap, (protects against tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis) has been introduced, and is recommended to be used in persons between 11-64 years of age instead of Td (tetanus-diphtheria vaccine). Td is advised for adults 65 years and older.  Wounds such as ones contaminated with feces, soil, dirt, or saliva, punctured wounds, crush injuries, avulsions and wounds resulting from burns, missiles, or frostbite may be classified as \"tetanus-prone\" wounds.  One recommended schedule for wounds is as follows..   If a person had received  3 doses of adsorbed Tetanus Toxoid, - for all wounds (if < 5 yr since last dose)- no need for Td, Tdap.  - for clean, minor wounds,Td or Tdap should be given (if >10 yr since last dose). - Tetanus-prone wounds, Td or Tdap should be given (if > 5 yr since last dose).   If the immunization history is unknown or had received < 3 doses of adsorbed Tetanus Toxoid, - for clean, minor wounds, Td or Tdap should be given.  - for all other wounds,TIG should be given in addition. - Adolescents and adults who have never received immunization against tetanus (If the immunization history is unknown), should continue the 3-dose primary series.   As you have not mentioned in detail, your past tetanus immunization history, it will not be possible to offer any recommendation. Best wishes!\n\n",

I tested positive on the elisa and WB for active infections (I specifically met like band 41 and 23 of the IGM (whatever is the one that indicates active lyme disease) the one that I guess all doctors agree on bc 3 doctors looked at my test in the office and said there was no doubt I had active lyme. I had all the joint pains, muclse aches, ect. I've been hiking recently. I went to a lyme specialist 4 weeks ago who also thinks I may have co-infections. He put me on 400mg of Doxycline (I am getting better, but a few symtoms are not responding, but most are) and I go back on Monday for a review of the co-infection blood test, he suspects 2 other infections (babesia, bartonelli I think). However I had over looked having general blood work done for my yearly physical until yesterday. I just go the bloodwork back and I noticed 3 red blood cells values were out of wack. Red and White blood cells were fine. Last year my values were all normal. I have been craving iron for a while and that's not me. I guess my question is can Lyme disease do this?

    "title": "Re: Red Blood Cells Lyme Disease",
    "content": "Hi, Going through your labs, the CBC results appear to be a bit confusing.  Macrocytic/normochromic anemias (associated with vitamin B12 and folate deficiency) usually show  - a high MCV(mean corpuscular volume), - a normal MCHC(mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration) & - a raised MCH.   In your case, the MCV is just above the upper limit of normal laboratory reference range, the MCH is normal & the MCHC is just below the lower limit of the normal. Usually the terms macro and microcytic are based on the MCV. Terms hyper, hypo and hypochromic are based on the appearance of the Red blood cells on a peripheral smear.This kind of a confusing picture may occur when a combined deficiency exists (vitamin B12/folate + iron deficiency).  Associated iron deficiency may cause the MCV being normal, in which case two types of red blood cells (macro & microcytic) may be seen (a dimorphic blood film). The ferritin level should be checked if such a picture is seen.  One other aspect needs explanation.When your CBC is showing these abnormal values, why your hemoglobin is normal?. It is well known that in megaloblastic anemias, the MCV sometimes increases much before the anemia appears.  Therefore, in your case, it may be better to have an opinion of a hematologist.Also it may be useful to fully investigate for vitamin B12/folate & iron deficiencies.  Your craving for the iron perhaps indicates an iron deficiency, as craving for many non-food items(Pica) is well known in this condition.  I am not sure if all these problems are related to the Lyme disease. A good hematologist may be in a better position to unravel this picture. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "For the last 3-4 days, I have been experiencing not a severe but rather uncomfortable pain in my lower right abdomen. It doesn't occur much when I'm standing but almost constanty when I'm sitting. It also doesn't see to occur while I'm sleeping or alteast not enough to wake me up or keep me up. I can't say for certain, but I think the pain is close to or near my right kidney. The pain isn't getting worse. It just feels like the same routine everyday. I read about the symptoms of kidney infection. The list I read included fever, chills, pain, upset stomach, low back pain, vomiting, a constant need to urinate or an inability to urinate at all, blood in the urine, and pain or a burning sensation during urination. I have not experienced any of these symptoms but I still don't want to rule out kidney infection just yet.  Some more information includes that the pain I have is not constant. When sitting, the pain will have a very small sting that is sudden and last for less than a second. It will do this about every 10-20 minutes of sitting down. While standing, a strange feeling tells me that problem is still there, but I have no stings while standing except for maybe 1 or 2 times over the 3-4 days I have had this problem.  I will try to give more information as time passes. In the meantime, does anyone have an idea of what may be going on with me?\n\n",

    "content": "About 6 days now and the lower right abdomen pain is still present although it does seem to have gotten better as as of the last few hours it hasn't been near as bad as it was the past few days. Another thing I noticed is minor stingnig pains similar to my lower right abdomen pains started occuring in my lower left abdomen yesterday. The uncomfortable feeling is in my lower right abdomen but the random stings I also have in my lower right abdomen are the same I feel in my lower left abdomen except there is no uncomfortable feeling in my lower left abdomen. But as of 2-3 hours ago the lower left abdomen stings have stopped.  Right now I still feel the uncomfortable feeling in my lower right abdomen. The random stings that used to occur every 10-20 minutes seem to have stopped or atleast the pain is now not as bad as it was in the past few days. It actually feels as if whatever is wrong with me is healing.  I would like to ask a question about lower back pain that I think may be involved with my abdomen pains. I noticed if I sit down for long periods of time I will have lower back aches when I go to sleep and lay down flat and on my sides. The lower back pain will be intense for a few seconds to sometimes about 1-3 minutes and then it will have the low relief heal and then I will fall asleep. This has been happening for quite some time, months even if not over a year if I remember. The pain was nothing ever serious to me because I knew why it was happening and it never caused me to have any problems during the day or night. But the aching pain in my lower back seems to be lingering a little over the pst few days along with my lower abdomen pain. Could this be the cause of my lower abdomen pains and what should I do or can I do to see if these lower back aches are the cause of my lower abdomen pain?\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for the update.  RLQ pain can be a number of things.  The one most people think of is appendicitis.  It is possible that this is what is going on with you; however, given the time frame it is less likely.  Usually (not always) appendicitis begins to produce more and more pain.  In some cases the appendix can burst and the infection can be walled off by the body.  In these cases, the pain may be minimal or slowly seem to resolve.  Another common reason is a gastrointestinal infection that is causing some inflammation of the colon.   If your abdominal pain does not get significantly better in the next few days or if it gets worse you should see a doctor for an examination and possibly some imaging studies.  I suspect your back pain is unrelated.  Your description fits that of some muscle tension that builds up as the day goes along then causes some pain while the muscles are relaxing.  The tension often builds because the muscles are compensating for things such as poor posture or uncomfortable chairs, etc.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I placed a couch pillow on it to compensate but since the pillow was also heavily used it completely flattened out within a couple months. I have just recently placed one of my bed pillows in my computer chair which is new and much thicker. I did sit in the flat seat computer chair for a few months before applying extra cushion.  More information with my abdominal pain is that there are some moments that last anywhere between half an hour to an hour where I feel completely normal. The abdominal pains seem to be at their best while sitting. I found walking around my yard helped relieve my lower spinal pain and while walking I didn't feel any of the stings. On the other hand, the abdominal stings do seem to have gotten less and less frequent and less painful over the past 2 days.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Lower right abdomen pain",
    "content": "I am a 28 yr old female that is experiencing lower pain in right abdomen.  On 04/23 I was lauging and felt a sharp pain in lower right abdomen associated with a burning and stinging sensation.  I had an appendectomy on 04/2000 & an incisional hernia repair in 04/2001 due to the appendectomy.  The pain was similar to that of the hernia and I had experienced bowel troubles along with vomiting.        On 4/27 I went to my doctor and was told that I did not have an obvious hernia and that my bowel sounds/movements were very quiet and could not be heard.  I was scheduled for a CT scan with and without contrast to lower abdomen and pelvic area.  It came back with no sign of hernia, but doctor stated that part of right colon did not show signs of movement and that they thought it was just a pulled muscle or maybe a tear in the mesh or tear at the corner of the mesh and possible adhesions on the colon or from the hernia surgery exactly 8 years prior.       I was scheduled to see the surgeon that performed my hernia repair and he ruled out a hernia, and said that he thought it could be a pulled muscle but not for sure and is scheduling me for a gallbladder ultrasound to check that.       What I more concerned about is the constant nausea and vomitting along with the sharp, burning, stinging pain in one specific area of my lower right abdomen. My bowels were dark in color and had experienced consipation (which I have never had before) and are better now that I am overloading on fiber along with epsom salt & water.  I am also unable to bend over because it feels like something in my stomach prevents me from doing so.      Any ideas on what I could be experiencing?  Doctors/specialists that I have been to so far have not been able to give me a direct answer and still experiencing pain and vomitting.\n\n",

The pain does subside the next day but Im not sure if antibiotics causes any pain.two days ago I took a 500g zoxil and today a headache tablet adcodol 500g.  I did do some light excercise,but when the pain started,my tummy bloated  I am not sure if my pain is due to irritable bowel syndrome  as I do get constipated at times but this time I don't feel constipated.Is my pain linked to Gastroenterology or Gynecology or Oncology Thank you\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I am a 19-year-old male. I was exposed to a child with TB while being babysat as a very young child (~1 years old). I was put on medications (INH suspension) for a year. I have been told that I cannot have a PPD skin test due to the presence of antibodies and that I have to have a chest x-ray instead.  I just wanted to get a second opinion on the veracity of antibodies staying in my system for so long. If at all possible I would like to have a PPD test instead of a chest x-ray, as I will likely have to have one or the other annually for the rest of my life (entering the medical profession). Is this possible, or will I always test positive?  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It is true that you cannot rely on PPD for TB screening after having been treated for infection (not active) in the past.  States vary on their rules regarding follow up for professions such as health care.  Overall the CDC does not recommend annual chest x-rays but only if medically indicated such as with symptoms.  You have to follow the state law in this matter even if it is not the same as CDC guidelines so if your state requires it, right now that is your only option.  I'm sorry I can't give you a better alternative.  Best wishes and good luck in your career.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  There are many causes for mesenteric lymphadepathy which include T.B., malignancy, other infectious diseases, and inflammatory diseases.   Certainly T.B. would be high on the list with a positive Mantoux test and a history of previous T.B. Fever of unknown origin can be very challenging to diagnose. Did your doctor discuss the need for a CT? obtaining biopsy specimen?  The size of the lymph nodes is not alarming, however there may be other features in the CT / US image that the radiologist could definitely comment on. Although not definitive it would certainly help make the case for TB. TB nodes present with lower attenuation values by CT near the fluid or fat areas in the node. Additionally, they may demonstrate peripheral enhancement on contrast.[1,2]  REFERENCES: ============ 1. Yang ZG, Min PQ, Sone S, et al.

Consider the pros and cons of a seasonal flu vaccine, and remember that all injectable flu vaccines still contain thimerosal (mercury) and that's something you want to stay away from with young children.  If you feel strongly that you must vaccinate your children for H1N1, I would advise that you use the inhalable mist and make sure it does not contain thimerosal.  Consider also that an enormous amount of people have already contracted H1N1 and recovered without complications.  It's not really much more serious than seasonal flu.\n\n",

    "content": "I've had a cyst on my thigh for @ 20 years . It got infected once, swelled up and resolved itself, but the cyst remained.  Dr.s tell me there is no reason to worry about it if doesn't cause a problem  @two weeks ago, it started hurting. I thought it was just because of my monthly cycle as a similar one under my arm tends to get sore around that time.  I used heat over the first weekend to try to get it to come to a head, but it didn't. By the time I got to the doctor on monday, they said i should have gone to the ER. It was that swollen and infected. I actually saw a PA who numbed it with novacain, opened it and some fluid came out. They sent off for a culture, drew blood work and gave me Bactrim, expecting that it was Staph. I ran a fever of 100.5 that evening and then back to normal.  The next day she wanted to see it agian. She thinks it is not the cyst. Just coincidentally next to the cyst?! Hmmmmmmmmm. It wasn't getting much better and she wanted to try to squeeze it out...without anesthetic??!!?!  Noooooooooo!!!  I was barely able to walk as it was and I had been reading that you should not squeeze them. I mentioned that my bladder was also sore and she told me that the bactrim would take care of that also.  A few days later, a core started to appear and actually popped out when I pulled the skin tight around it....about the size and appearance of a large hominy grit....  http://images.search.yahoo.com/images/v ... =12nlshfp0 ....and then a smaller one the next day. After that, it did start to drain better and the swelling started going down. I think it was plugged like a cork. I have pics of it sticking out of my leg, but I don't know how to post it here. Did I mention this thing smells bad?  When the culture came back, it was not staph....it was enterocuccos. The blood work was ok. I looked enterocuccos up and saw that it seemed to be a bad one also and asked a nurse friend of mine about it. She told me to ask for the report and see what it is suseptible to because it was not treatable with Bactrim. So I called to ask if I needed a different antibiotic since enterocuccus is not suseptible to Bactrim. I also wanted to know if it was VRE. (voicemail)  When I didn't get a call back, I went to the office and asked for the PA. Her aide said the PA was out, so I asked her to take it to one of the DR.s and ask. I also asked for a copy of the report. A Dr. came and looked at it, saw that it  was still draining, said it was not Vancomycin resistant and prescribed Vancomycin.  I got the report which said it was (S) suseptible to Penicillin and Vancomycin. I thought I was good to go now, but, my nurse friend said it wouldn't work because is isn't absorbed well in the intestines. And she questioned why they would use Van instead of a first line antibiotic.I also read Vancomycin must be administered intravenously because it is not absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract  and  Antimicrobial Resistance in Enterococcus spp  Penicillin should not be used; use Ampicillin if MIC indicates (S)susceptible   because it is only suseptible  to Pen in vitro...not in humans.  I am now wondering if I should be on Van. Since it is not absorbed well and little will actually ge to the infection site, am i just increasing the chances of the infection becomeing VRE? Does a local boil?cyst enterococcus infection merit IV Van?  Q.1: Should I ask for Ampicillin instead?  I read an article about enterococcus that said it had been transmitted through infected persons sitting on chairs.   \" ** The chairs believed to be the source of the problem were coated in a fabric that was very hard to clean. The hospital has set aside $50,000 to buy new vinyl chairs for the renal ward and the liver transplant unit, the areas where patients are most vulnerable. It will progressively get rid of thousands of chairs throughout the hospital. The new chairs have been delayed and the hospital is hiring vinyl chairs in the interim.\"    Q. 2: Am I being overprecautios having my Husband use our other bathroom and shower?  Q. 3: Can I spread this infection by using public toilets as the infection is on my inner upper thigh? Q. 4: I know it isn't VRE, but isn't it just as easily transmitted even though it's not resistant? Q.5: Should I get a urinalysis to see if there is entrococcus in my urininary track. I am still sore....though not excruciatinfgly as with cystitis. Q.6: I see where Staph can live in nostrils. Does enterococcus do this as well? Should I use an antibiotic in my nose? Like I said, this stuff smells bad. Q. 7: The doc does not intend to see me anymore. Should I have any follow up bloodwork or other testing done to see if I still have colonization or VRE after this round of Van? The original bloodwork was done before the draining and squeezing. Can that make it move to the bloodstream? Q.8: Also, I was diagnosed with Lymphoma in 2005. Is this a factor in my immune system that would make a difference in how agressively the infection should be treated?  The Doc is not gonna listen to all these questions. He already gave me a weird look when he saw my leg wrapped,(in plastic shrink wrap-I saw it somewhere on the internet) but my dressing gets saturated and the edges pucker after I've been walking and moving around and make little openings that can leak. **He should be glad I stood while I was in the waiting room.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Tammy,  mrsa stands for Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus which is a bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus) resistant to an antibiotic (Methicillin) to which it is normally sensitive. Some strains have become resistant to this antibiotic because of its wide spread use in treatment of Staphylococcus aureus infection.   Some of the strains of the Staphylococcus aureus are normally found on the skin.   mrsa is usually a bug found in hospitals rather than in homes. People can get colonized with it, meaning that it can be found in their bodies at certain places like the nose (most commonly) where they are not usually found. You might have got it from your late husband.   Where was your husband's mrsa grown from? Blood, lungs or urine and what kind of medical problems did your husband have?  Why were you tested for mrsa though? And where did the heavy growth come from?  And when you mentioned the lab report did you mean your husband's lab report or yours?  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped and waiting for your response.  Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you Dr. Mokhtar for your reply , here are the answers to your questions.   My husband had a skin infection (on the inside of his left arm) in Aug of 02 that was treated with antibiotics but not diagnosed as MRSA. In Oct of 02 he had an infection on his scrotum that was diagnosed as MRSA. He was admitted to the hospital and given clindamicin IV for 5 days and released. 7 months later he thought his back was out and the pain was coming around front causing difficulty breathing. That was Wed. He stayed home Thurs and Fri, and Sat told me he was spitting up blood so I called the ambulance. His vitals were good, slightly high pulse rate and no fever, but they said since he was having a hard time breathing he should get checked out so they took him to the hospital. There they admitted him with pneumonia and said he would be in for 3 or 4 days depending on the antibiotic. Less than 24 hours after admission he was dead. His death cert. said cardiopulmonary arrest, sepsis, and aspiration pneumonia. Because no one would tell me why  this happened to a healthy bricklayer by trade and so fast, I started looking myself. I got his records and lab reports and started going over everything step by step. Not understanding most of it I would use the internet and look things up. There on his lab report was MRSA, remembering he had that in Oct. I looked it up and there it said can cause lung abcesses, pneumonia, bone infection, blood infection and death. It still took me awhile to find out if this is what could have happened to him. It was confirmed by the Director of Infectious Disease at the hospital my husband was in that the MRSA was found in the fluid around the lung, thus MRSA contributed to his death. We were told nothing of MRSA when he had it only that it was a staph infection. I was even told I didn't have to put on the gown and gloves etc. by his hospital room door even though it said \"isolation\" nobody had to put anything on, me, his mom, his friend, noone not even staff.     Since his death I have had 4 skin infections. 2 came at the same time, one on each breast. The doctor said they were boils and put me on augeintin. When one burst open and looked just like my husband's, I called the dr. and asked for a culture. It was a couple of days before he could get me in and by that time the antibiotic had made it look much better, I still asked for a culture, told the dr about my husband, and he told me I was overreacting, washed his hands and never touched me again. I have gone to that dr since I was 16. No culture was done.    Then behind my right ear where I had some minor surgery (in office) the incision kept getting infected, once I went back to the dr and it wasa  suture (sp) but it continued to get infected, so they other day I went back to that dr, told him about my husband and the muliple infections I have had and he ordered a culture. That is where it showed heavy growth of MRSA. The questions I asked about on the lab report are mine. It said NO WHITE BLOOD CELLS SEEN NO ORGANISMS SEEN.  It  showed susceptiblity to rifampin and vacomycin and resistance to everything else on the list .          My husband's health other than the MRSA was good, he did smoke. But like I said he was a bricklayer and laid block day in and day out.    My health has been really good most of my life, I also smoke.  Recently I have been fighting a bad cold for weeks, I'm tired ALL the time, my temp goes from 96.1 to99.2 this last week. I have alot of congestion and a cough. I had a chest x ray and it didn't show anything.   Thankyou for your time,   Tammy\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Tammy,  Thank you very much for the update.  i won't be able to comment on your husband's case. mrsa lung infections are usually aggressive especially if treatment is delayed as it sounds from your husband's case as he waited three days before seeking medical advice. Also, your husband's profession most probably contributed to his lungs being most probably unable to handle the mrsa infection because of the dust that he is exposed to.  About your first breast infection, if it were mrsa, i do not think that it would have responded to augmentin unless the thing that made it better is the fact that it opened up and the pus was drained.  Regarding your recurrent ear wound infection, it sounds to me more like you acquired the infection from the doctor's office where you had the minor procedure more than getting it from your husband. To treat this infection, you should have had received the appropriate antibiotic which in this case is vancomycin (intravenous) or rifampin.  No white cells and no organisms on the lab report means that when they took a look at the drainage or fluid that they took to analyse from the wound of your ear under the microscope they could not see any white blood cells (which are a sign of an infection) and no bugs.  i would encourage you to have your nose analysed for the presence of mrsa as this is the part of the body the most colonized with mrsa. And if you have it in your nose, you can treated with a local antibiotic ointment and then get recultured to make sure that the colonization is gone.  Once more, thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "title": "MRSA",
    "content": "Dr. Mokhtar,   Isn't it possible that the augmentin healed the wound on my breast so the MRSA found the next weak or tender area in which to show infection, that being a new surgical site? MRSA continued enternally in my husband's case even after treatment with clindamicin for 5 days.   I apologize for taking up so much of your time but as you can imagine I have ALOT of questions. I have read, and am still reading everything I can on MRSA. so I do know something about it. (I have also been on kind of a band wagon with State and County Health depts trying to get the word out. We have had many cases of MRSA in our area). It's not even on the \"reportable\" list, so it's not being tracked and counted. They are  trying to get it on the list next year.   Before I ask my questions, let me give you alittle more history. My 5 year old nephew is also being treated for a staph (they have not named yet) and fungus. The husband of the women that owns the daycare where my nephew goes has also been fighting a staph and the same fungus as my nephew. This man was in and out of the hospital for 8 weeks including ICU.,but from what I understand is home and still being monitored.   I know that 30% of the population are carriers of MRSA (most never showing any signs) and I know that it was first found in hospitals and long term care facilities. So was it the healthy healthcare worker that infected the patient who probably had an open wound,catheter, surgical site etc.? If that is the case why am I being told it is contact from infection to open wound. Where was the infection from the healthy healthcare worker? Understand my question? Are we really positive we can't transmit it by casual physical or even intimate physical contact? I haven't seen my grandbaby since last Nov because I am scared to death I could spread it to her.   Another question I have is, after being treated for MRSA is it gone? Or is it once you have MRSA you always have it, and if that is the case how do you know it is not doing serious damage enternally,like my husband's case?   The doctor I have been seeing this time told me to put silverdene cream on it for a week and then come back. Not that I can afford the other antibiotic's that come in IV form. I lost my insurance when my husband died. I know of another man in our area that died just as suddenly as my husband, who also had MRSA. And a 10 year of girl died here, they said from the flu, but she also had MRSA although I don't know if she had it before or contracted it while being treated for the flu.    I truly appreciate the time you have spent with me.   Thanks again,   Tammy\n\n",

    "title": "Re: mrsa",
    "content": "Dear Tammy,   Thank you very much.  mrsa is a very resistant bug and it is not sensitive to regular antibiotics like augmentin.  You have not said how far apart was the breast infection and the ear infection but common things are common. mrsa is not a bug that one can catch in his own house, it is usually a bug that is caught in a hospital unless one comes in direct contact with patients who have mrsa or with people who work in hospitals. So, i think there is a higher possibility that you caught the mrsa ear infection from the doctor's office where you had the minor procedure. Is there a possibilty that you were colonized with mrsa and then infected yourself, yes of course, but, i think the probability is less.  Regarding your husband's being treated for his scrotal infection with clindamycin, clindamycin is an antibiotic that is usually given for people with cellulitis (infection of the skin) that is caused by regular bugs not mrsa so if your husband, at that time, was cured from this infection just by taking clindamycin and even though it was said that he had mrsa, i would strongly suspect that he really had it. Staphylococi constitute some of the skin commensals (bugs that are normally present on the skin) and some of them are inherently resistant to methicillin rendering them mrsa (by nature), and since they are normally present on the skin, if the skin is cultured, they are going to appear in the culture as mrsa thus confusing the situation. That's why many of the infectious diseases specialists don't get any wound cultures or skin cultures when there is a skin infection, they just treat it with the antibiotic that they think is going to be effective according to the type of skin infection itself. If the infection does not get better after the first day or two of treatment or if the patient has history of mrsa infections and this skin infection is suspicious for mrsa then they start treatment against mrsa, otherwise, it is just regular antibiotics like clindamycin or augmentin.  Regarding your nephew's case, once more Staph is a member of the bugs present on everybody's skin, so it is kind of expected that if a patient has a skin infection, it could be Staph. The same thing applies for fungi as well. But, i agree with you, this could be a patern and has to be investigated. To make sure that the same bug is causing your nephew's skin infection and that of the day care owner's husband, a dna typing could be done to see whether the two bugs have the same genes. Also, it is important to know whether anybody else in the day care has skin infections and whether any one of them has come in contact with any patient lately or has an acquaintance that works in a hospital (does not have to be a doctor or a nurse only).  mrsa was first found in hospitals only but now and it is unfortunate, but we are starting to see patients who come from the community with mrsa.   It is really difficult to answer your question about how the first infection happened, so i am not even going to speculate. Whether knowing how the first case happened is important in spreading the infection or not, i can not really say but, best thing is to make sure that if there is a patient who has mrsa and you want to come in contact with that patient, make sure that the instructions for isolation are followed and to wash your hands thoroughly after coming in contact with him.   After a patient has been treated for mrsa, he has to be tested for its presence and the most common site for colonization is the nose. If patient tests positive then he has to be treated for the carrier state as well.  Regarding your grandbaby, i would encourage you to be tested for the presence of mrsa in your nose as mentioned before and be treated for it if you are positive.  Where i work and in so many palces in the united states, mrsa has become a very big concern as it is a very big real problem that is causing a tremendous burden on health care costs. And many palces have policies regarding mrsa isolation and treatment and testing patients for carrier state. So, it is a very good thing that you are doing now by trying to warn people against the dangers of this bug.  Regarding the case of the 10 year old who died from the flu but also had mrsa, if a patient develops pneumonia from the flu virus, it is a well known complication that some people develop Staph abcesses in their lungs and these Staph might be mrsa i guess, so, mrsa could have caused a complication in context of the flu.  Tammy, your questions are always welcome, and hope to hear from you soon.  Once more, thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.

    "content": "Sorry, but I'm still confused. I already had a pretty good idea that the clindamicinIV for 5 days was not the correct antibiotic (of course I didn't know anything about MRSA while my husband was being treated) and I'v had a pretty good idea 5 days was NOT nearly enough ( I've believed for a while if I had known what I know now about MRSA he would still be alive today).Learning this and the fact that my husband had MRSA in the fluid around the lung when he died PLUS the confirmation that MRSA contributed to his death, my understanding is that there are just some people, let's call them \"high risk\" canidates (such as the patient with the open wound, low immunity, catheter, or even mulitple infections)) that when MRSA activates with them, and is not properly treated, like with vancomycin IV for up to 4 to 6 weeks, it just continues until it damages an area that causes death.,lungs, heart, complete body shut down. Remember my husband died in less than 24 hours after being admitted. When he was admitted his blood pressure was 120/? that was around 3pm on a Sat. when I left him that night around 8pm it was still there, when I returned Sun am around 7:30 it was 40/20 and he was in a non-medicated, unresponsive state, he died at 1:40pm that day.   I am pretty sure I got it from him (being as how we were told nothing about precautions) And I'll put this in order.       Aug 02-------Paul's first skin infection, the inside of left arm. (not diagnosed as MRSA but put on HEAVY doses of antibiotic's some of which he had to return to the ER for injection)     Oct 02---------Paul's second skin infection, on scrotum, diagnosed MRSA, admitted to the hospital, given clindamicin IV for 5 days(possibly other med's but I don't have his records with me at this time).      May 03-------Paul having a hard time breathing for 3 days goes to the hospital, is admitted with pneumonia, dies the next day.    Aug 03-----My 2 skin infections appearing at the same time, given augmentin.     Nov 03----my ear infection (previous sugical site)----sutured pulled out and topical antibiotic given    Jan 04-----my ear infected again--didn't go to the dr--it continued to infect or just ooz until I went to dr this last time. Culture done, positive for MRSA.     Around Jan of 03 I was having some dental work done and some plastic surgery so I was antibiotics for awhile.    Even with the lengths you have gone to try and explain all this, I still don't feel like I can be around my granddaughter, what I'm saying is I am not convinced, and with the history above, I feel I have good reason.    I have not been convinced that because the MRSA was improperly treated in Oct it allowed the MRSA to continue enternally. I think the wrong antibiotic's can heal the wound but because it  does not work on the MRSA, the MRSA continues,,  with more skin infections until it does damage enternally. Why else would my husband die from it?   My husband being a \"high risk\" canidate because of his mutiple skin infections and possibly his smoking.    I am not a total dummy, usually I pick things up pretty quick, but this I just can't seem to get. The way I  get it is some people can have MRSA and never know it. Some can have it, have a skin infection and never anymore problems, yet there are those, the \"high risk\" canidates  that have problem after problem and if not monitored can cause death. Let's say my husband had been treated with Vancomycin IV for 6 weeks, I would have had him monitored regularly there after because he was a \"high risk\" canidate. Instead, we thought he was ok, and infact, he was not. If only I had known then what I know now.    Again thank you for your time,    Tammy\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Tammy,  Thank you very much for your update.  i understand your concerns about why don't want to see your granddaughter and they are genuine concerns, but all i am saying that mrsa can be treated and eradicated from the body if you get tested for its presence and if you test positive be treated and then restested again to make sure that the treatment worked and that mrsa is gone. So, then you can see your granddaughter without or with less fear that you are going to give it to her.  i feel a that you have a guilty sensation regarding your husband's death, or at least angry at yourself. Am i correct? If this is the case, there is no need to feel guilty about your hunbad's death as this was not your fault that you did not know then what you know now because it is not your job to know about complicated medical problems and how to deal with them.  i can not comment on your husband's condition or the cause of death in his case because it is difficult to know unless involved personally in his care then but it seems from what you are saying that he was really sick and this is most probably in favor of a very aggressive infection. i could not understand whether an autopsy was done or not but surely mrsa can cause that as it was found in the fluid around his lungs which is an indication that the pneumonia that he had was caused by mrsa and it was severe.   If you mean by mrsa growing internally, that your husband was colonized with it, this could be the case as proven by his previous skin cultures. But mrsa does not cause internal damage over a period of months silently, it is an all or non rule. Meaning that the person is either a carrier (carries a bug, but he is not sick and the bug is not doing anything under healthy circumstances) or a patient (sick). When the immunity of a person is decreased, it is certainly a golden chance for the bug to grow then and cause disease and with a bug as aggressive as mrsa, this could happen over 3-4 days like in your husband's case if not treated early enough.  You have to understand that this might become an obsession, but you have to live your life making sure of course that you don't hurt the people you love but if this is going to keep you from seeing and enjoying the comapny of those same people you love, you have to stop and think a little bit about it. i don't want to sound like i am telling you what you are supposed to do...

    "content": "Dear Tammy,  Thank you very much.  If your ear wound has healed, and you are not suffering from any other infections, you could be a carrier of mrsa. What will happen to you is unpredictable. You might be cured from this carrier state without any intervention or you might continue to have this carrier state as long as you are not treated. If you continue to be a carrier and your immunity level is lowered for one reason or another, mrsa then could become a pathogen and you might get an infection with mrsa, might.  i would strongly encourage you to get tested and if positive treated.   i am not sure whether what i am going to say is right or wrong but are you trying to punish yourself for your husband's death by not treating yourself and not trying to enjoy your life?  Being sad is understandable but don't be overwhelmed. Try not to whip yourself with feelings of guilt and anger at yourself that are not warranted. You are not responsible for your husband's death. And even if you knew then what you know now, who told you that your husband would have been alive now, it is a hypothetical question. May be if you knew then and he died you might have been feeling a lot worse now.  Loss of a loved one is a terrible experience espeically if unexpected like your husband's. Death and loss of a loved one usually has a great impact on one's feeling especially if you have been together for a while or passed through a lot together.   Please, go get tested, treated if needed and go see your granddaughter and i will not tell you how amazed you are going to be, kids make us think of nothing but life even if it is a short-lived experience and i think that this is going to be the help that you are going to need to get over your feelings of guilt and anger which i think are secondary to your grief reaction to the loss of your husband. There is nothing wrong with enjoying life without your loved one after he passed away (what the reason might have been).  You are not responsible for conducting research about mrsa, there are already lots of people out there with huge budgets and labs doing this. You have done more than anyone else would have done. i understand your feelings but it has been a year now since your husband died and i know it is not enough to grief for some people even for the rest of one's life but it is time that you start living your life once more.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and you are always more than welcome.  Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

Remember I talked about him before. Well, he's been in and out of the hospital this week running fevers of 103. He is taking in LOTS  of fluid and eating yet has drop almost 2 1/2 lbs this week.They are afraid of internal bleeding. They have put him on an antibiotic that starts with a \"z\"  possibly zithromax (my sister thinks). 1/2 teaspoon daily/ They are running cultures but say it will be Mon or Tues before they are back............ What do you think? You know the history can you give me an idea?      Again, thankyou,     Tammy        PS there is a new \"sore\" or skin infection this week The doctor has also mention  possibly misdiagnosis of MRSA.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Tammy,  Regarding your nephew, i guess most probably the results of the cultures are back. In children, the most common infections are usually ear infections especially if the child has recurrent sore throats and infections of the tonsils. So, it is of utmost importance that the child's ears are checked If the child develops a fever and a sore throat, always check the ears. Antibiotics for ear infections have to be given very punctually and for the full course and the ears have to be checked at the end of the antibiotic course to make sure that the infection and inflammation are gone.  If the child develops, i think, 3 ear infections within a 6 months period, a tube is inserted in his ears.  Usually, ear infections are caused by a certain bacteria that the antibiotics that is given cover it and the other bugs that cause the infection rarely.  About these recurrent skin sores, i would suggest that you have a skin biopsy from the lesion, not just a culture.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "title": "MRSA",
    "content": "Dear Dr Mokhtar, I was diagnosed with MRSA too. I actually got this information of the dr's lounge from Tammy! I had not gotten the MRSA from Tammy though!  My question is if coming in contact with a person infected with MRSA is the way this disease spreads how come the Dr told me that I can go to work? I am a cashier in a retail store & even though I don't touch the area of my infection, seeing it's on my belly and covered by my t-shirt,  I might touch it, not thinking, and touch someone, and then that person might catch the disease from me.  I work with a guy who is a fireman and when I told him that I had MRSA not a spider bite he wouldn't even stay in the same room as me. He had said that he has seen people, in nursing homes mostly, with MRSA and he was sooo afraid of catching it that he had disappeared for the whole day.  I had gotten an infection on my belly and everyone thought that it was a spider bite. ** I had gone to the hospital and they gave me Keflex and it cleared up, somewhat. Then another lesion appeared on my belly just 3\" (or so) under the first one. I had gone to my dr and she gave me another round of Keflex. I really thought I should have it cultured seeing I was supose to go in for surgery in September. So I went to a dermatologyst and as soon as he looked at my belly he said you have MRSA. He did a culture, told me to stop the Keflex, and to start taking Levequin, which I did and a week later, (today), I got the culture back and it came back positive for MRSA.   ** I do have to back up for a moment though. When I had gotten the first lesion I had gone to my dr, but I had forgotten to tell her about it seeing that I had Conjunctivitis in both eyes. Which is a staph infection and my Dr said that I probably got the conjunctivitis from my belly infection. Is that true?  I now have another, (couple of), questions ... I was told by my dermatologyst that once the infection is gone the MRSA is gone out of your body, now my husbands Dr just told him that it stays dorment in the body's system. Which answer is correct?  How long do I have to wait to have my surgery? I am having a hysterectomy.  Do I have to tell them, (which I probably would anyway), that I have (or had) MRSA? - My GYN knows I have it, I mean the caregivers in the hospital. Also my daughter was sick with a cold & fever, (and being a good Mommy I usually take the sickness away from her  8^) ,but now with the MRSA and knowing the story of Tammy's husband my lungs are tight when I breathe, do you suguest that I should have a chest x-ray to see if anything might be going on in my lungs?    I think I have asked enough questions for now!! Thank you for ALL of the information that you provided on this subject.  Eve\n\n",

    "title": "Re: mrsa",
    "content": "Dear Eve,  There are some strains of Staphlococcus, called coagulase negative Staphylococcus epiderpimidis living on the skin normally. They are inherently resistant to methicillin but this does not make them mrsa, they are methicillin resistant coagulase negative Staphylococcus epiderpimidis. If a culture of the skin is taken, they grow in the culture. Some people do not make the distinction, and once the word methillin resistant appears on the culture, the bug is labelled mrsa and this is what the patient is told and obviously it is not true.  i would recommend asking your doctor that question. If the bug turns out to be really mrsa, if you still have the infection, you have to be isolated till the infection is controlled. Once the infection is controlled, i don't think that isolation is required.   You don't have to worry about the infection being transmitted to your daughter through droplet transmission because you don't have a lung infection otherwise you would have been really ill as mrsa pneumonia is a very serious and severe illness.  Regarding when to have the surgery, this is a question i can not answer, either your surgeon or an infection disease specialist has to answer.  Regarding whether the mrsa remains in the body or not, both possibilities may occur but i don't know the exact stastitics regarding how many cases completely disappear and how many cases, the mrsa stays dormant in the body, a condition known as colonization, bug is present and is not causing disease.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

I have almost obsessively researched the internet for answers. this site is the only one where i have found them. VIA your straight to the point questions, and Docs answers. THANK YOU BOTH !. my questions are: if i have had a MRSA infection and have been treated with vancomyacin ( 3 IV treatments  ), then SMZ/TMP oral ( bactrim) for 10 days. i want to know do i still have MRSA? will i always have it? is it dormant or is it ERADICATED? i have been tested ( nose culture) once and it came out NEG. i have to go back 2 more times for same culture 5 days apart . hopefully all will be NEG. The site of the infection ( on my inner thigh, started like a spider bite, hospitalized 5 days, 14,000 wbc and low blood pressure entire time in hosp), was not cultured as the wound where they cut me open to drain it has healed and there is no drainage. I was cut opened twice, once in ER Dec 27, 04 and 4 days later when the infectious desease  dr saw me. That morning i was put on vancomyacin. from ER admittance on, i was on ancef until culture came back. i was given 3 bags intraveniously and then released on the oral bactrim. Now get this... my husband got an infection on his stomach ( looked like a pimple at first, and he squeezed it) approx a week later and went to ER. He was given Vancomycin IV in ER immediately as i told him to tell ER about me and my MRSA a week earlier. He did. Intuition told me to have him insist on a culture and Vanco in ER. Dr's listened. his tests came back MRSA pos. 4 days later. He was treated with one dose of vanco , cut openand drained  and released with a Rx of bactrim for 10 days. the wound was packed with medicated gause. he saw the dr. the following day. he has been tested once since, via wound site and nose culture. both were NEG. but the doctor never told him to test two more times. i just got my results today and they told me to come back 2 more times, 5 days apart. and if i get Negs. then it's Eradicated.  My husband and i have different dr's but they are both in practice together in the same office. I still want to know if i have 3 negs, what are the chances or percentage of reoccurance . and is it higher because i have had it before. we have used lysol around house, separate towels, utensils, .everything. we wash with hibiclens daily and atlease 20 times a day, wash hands with alcohol based instant hand wash.  I have had a rash on my back, neck and lower hairline for some months now. the dr issued clindamycin fluid to apply daily. she said it was dry skin and from change in hormones i am 45. it has not gone away. i was diagnosed with ring worm in the summer, it lookeds like lymes, i think it was impetigo. all of these including the celluitis on my leg i believe are and were sighn of MRSA . or a pre sign of it's presence. some web sites mention symptoms. the above are. i have purchased Tea Tree oil which is fron austrailia, i have read that it is a natural antibiotic that it sensative to MRSA. the US is not doing any medical research on it as it is not regulated by the FDA. also there is no money  to be made medically. it comes from a tree . it works wonders on many infections but cannot be tasken internally. only topically.  i used this on my wound site ( thigh) it healed quickly. i told my DR. he never heard of it.  please know the above is my experience. i am not a doctor. i am a person who has been affected with MRSA and am doing everything i can to prevent it from spreading to my children, those i love and my close friends. every time i go to a store i wonder if the dollar bill i just gave or received is transfering MRSA.  this is a DEADLY desease as you Tammy have unfortunatley learned the hard way. know that your husbands death is not in vain. you have touched and educated this one person and i am sure many others you don't know about.

    "title": "MRSA",
    "content": "Hello.  I was diagnosed with MRSA in May, 2005.  I have a wound that still won't heal.  My background is as follows:  I had a tummy tuck in February, 2005, and healed just fine.  I went back to work (in a jail that has a major MRSA outbreak) for two months when my abdomen started blistering right at the spot that I fasten my pants. Within days,  that area of my abdomen broke down rapidly to medium size lesion that was pretty deep.   When I went to the Dr and he cultured it, it came back positive for MRSA.  The culture was a deep culture.  After 23 days of Levaquin, I was cultured again (just a swab of the wound) and it came back negative.  I have had the wound cultured again about two weeks after that last test, and it still came back negative.  In the meantime, I have this lesion on my abdomen that won't heal even with repeated visits to wound care with Silvadene cream, then Promogran and Silver Cell.  There was a small improvement with the Promogran, but at my last visit the Wound care doctor said he thinks that it is behaving like a MRSA wound, and that I may still be infected.  He has recultured (he scraped the wound for the culture) and the results should be back on Monday.  Needless to say I am quite discouraged.  I have a few questions.... Why have I have been given a nasal culture, and why have I not received the IV treatment?  The reason I am asking those questions is because the standard treatment of the inmates is that they have all had nasal cultures, and alot of them have been put on IV therapy.  What other tests/cultures can be run?  Can MRSA ever be completely eradicated from a person, or will I continue to have troubles?  With my job, I will be constantly exposed to MRSA, as they are not able to eradicate it from the jail.  Also, I am wondering about the way the cultures were performed.  When they did the deep culture, it was positive, yet the surface swabs were negative.  Does this mean anything?  Like maybe I have it in my bloodstream?   I have been feeling really lousy now for months and I just want to get better and be able to get back to work.  Thanks in advance for your time.\n\n",

    "title": "New MRSA treatments?",
    "content": "My husband has been fighting MRSA for almost two years.  He had a successful knee transplant but fell about a year later necessitating a fix of the quad tendon.  He got sick with MRSA  about four weeks later.  He has had three spacers put in during this time while being on Vanco.  Every time he comes off the antiobiotic, he gets sick.  The last time it was five days before a scheduled knee implant.     He now has nothing in his knee and the ortho doctor doesn't want to touch him again if he can stay well.  He was on Vanco again for nearly 10 weeks and has been on oral antibiotics since then (maximyocin? is what he is taking now).  We have switched to a large reseach hospital and we adore the infectious disease doctor but I was wondering if there is anything else he can take.  I find it quite disconcerting that the only way to find out if the MRSA is gone is for him to go off the antibiotics and wait and see if he gets sick.  In this day and age of space travel and cloning, I find it hard to believe that there cannot be a better test than this.  He gets violently ill and it is a terrible thing.  We are filled with terrible fear when he stops the antibiotics.  Help!!! Thanks.\n\n",

    "title": "MRSA Question",
    "content": "Thanks in advance for your time. My main question is, how far can MRSA go?  In late April/early May, I had an MRSA-cultured diffuse skin infection in left armpit, on stomach and on back. Was treated for 3 days with oral bactrim, then for 7 days with oral Zyvox as well as 4 weeks with topical ointment both at boil sites and inside of nose. After the week on Zyvox, I became short of breath and extremely fatigued and also had some left-side weakness. Liver enzymes were temporarily elevated but went down. By June, boils had resolved but I was still tired, somewhat short of breath and had some rapid heartrate. A breathing test at my GP showed some minor obstruction, and I was given an inhaler to use as needed. By July, the shortness of breath was better but I developed sudden muscle fatigue and pain --especially in upper thighs, and ultimately tremors. I've had a pretty thorough neuological work-up. My question is, can MRSA go to the muscles or nerves and cause these symptoms? I still have strong pain (this is not like mild muscle aches and even docs don't think it is fibromyalgia) and there are no clear answers. Would a blood culture or more antibiotics help?  WBC is normal and I have no fever but have read that staph can become sub-acute in a condition like osteomyelitis. Thanks again.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Tammy,  I came in comtact with MRSA after having 3 back surgeries. I am 40 yrs old and have been the picture of health until 12-03-03.. after the 1rst surgery i had a spinal fluid leak was going back to dr. office at least once a week for fluid to be drained off spinal cord.  Drs. went back in to patch leak, put drain tube in. After that i begin getting worse. while i was in hospital my husband begin seeing WARNING SIGNS on door and wash hand alerts. when we ask about them an assistant od surgeon told me that i had MRSA> I was so sick i was near death. came home with pic line and Vancomycin IV antibiotics. temp. would go up and down, begin haveing terrible headaches so bad i was scared to move my head. was put in ICU> in another town by my OBGYN>>> I was dieing and nobody knew why!! SO, my hisband took me out oAMA and drove me to J-ville Fla. to mayo clinic. When i got there i was told i had Bacterial menn. along with the MrSA and abscesses on the brain along with micobacteria fortuitum a non-active TB in my spinal cord.. the dr. at may begin numerous testing and founf all the above bacterial infections in spinal cord. I was within 2 weeks of death.   I had lost my daddy and 30yr old sister all in the last 4 yrs. I was already so deep in depression i couldn't handle anymore.  Thanx to the Drs. at MAYO i am here today. I can barely walk at times. and the pain is unreal but I thank god everyday to be alive. i am on some of the strongest antibiotics anyone could take. have been taking them for a year and drs. are saying he is affraid to take me off from them . scared that the abscesses on brain will come back along with the other bacterial infections.  I can sympathize with what you have been through. It is a terrible diesease and the sad thing is for the past 2 yrs it has been one thing after another happening to me. it is a UTI, now they have found i have Neurogenic bladder. I have only been married to my 2nd husband for 19mnths. I love him so much he married me while i was so very sick, now all the hospital bills and me being sick all the time is keeping me so depressed i can't be the person i was when he feel in love with me. Sometimes i wish i had never went to Mayo, and I would be with my daddy and my sister in heaven. and not here making him miserable.   The menn. has affected my memory i can't remeber nothing. it is my short term memory.  he has never dealt with anyone being sick. he has been right by myside every step of the way. BUT, i feel lie i am not beinf fair to him.  I am sorry i just got so much built up in me when i begin talking i can't stop.    Just hold your head up and say a prayer, because he is the one with all the answers. I know this may not be an answer to the question you submitted , but i had  to respond   God bless you, lilamae\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 45 year old male, April 2005 I had large red growth on my right hand and severe swelling. The first day I thought I had an ordinary pimple or bug bite, I just three days my right hand was swollen and in sever pain. The swelling was getting so bad that it was no longer possible to see my wrist bone. I went to the  ER where the doctor cut and drained the area and inserted a drain gauze. At this time he prescribed and Antibiotic and also gave me a Iv antibiotic, I was instructed to come back for the next two days for follow up and more IV antibiotic. I do not know what the IV antibiotic was at this time. On day two the examining physician took a swab and sent for a culture. Day three I was examined and recieved my last IV antibiotics. I was told at this time I would be fine. The wound where the hand was drained was taking a very long time to heal and I had reservations about this as I usually heal fast. Two weeks later I developed another large boil on my right buttocks. It was very painfull and I immediately called the hospital and inquired if this could be related to the hand situation. Then nurse said she had to pull the records and call me back. She called back several hours later and instructed the I needed follow up care immediately as I had a very dangerous staph infection. She instructed me that the previous antibiotics have no effect on what I had and went on to say I had MRSA. She immediately had the doctor call in a prescription for different antbiotics and I should get them right away and then seek follow up care from my PCP. I took the medication as indicated for the time prescribed and the boil eventually came to a head popped and drained. Two weeks after this incident I had another boil on the left side of my buttocks, identical to the one on the right. I immediatley made with myd PCP and had him look at this situation.  He stated the it was nothing but a common boil. I should soak this and apply hot packs to draw out the puss. I am not satis fied with the findings of my PCP and went to another with the documents from the hospital to verify what had previously taken place and they didn't have any concern at all. I made them run a few blood test against their recomendations that it wasn't needed. I followed up and they said I had a clean bill on health. I have since had pain in my neck and most of my joints, pain in areas that I had previous injuries over 20 years ago. I have shortness of breath sometimes my chest when I take a deep breath sometimes feels like a lot of pressure is being applied. both right and left arms when raised have pain from inside through armpit and into torso. I have been very healthy previous to this and have had no medical problems. Recently my wife (last week my wife developed this same boil on her left buttocks. We need a good reassuring opinion on what could be going on here. Please advise. Thank you.[/list]\n\n",

    "content": "I have been traveling a lot, and I would be very surprised if I hadn't been exposed to any parasites along the way.  In fact, just in the last two years I have had both typhoid fever and dengue fever, so I am obviously at risk for a slew other infections too. Where I am now, they give everyone DEC and albendazole once a year to control filariasis, and I plan to take it.  So I guess my question really is, should I bother getting an ova and parasite exam when I go home?  I would think the albendazole would treat other helminths (although I have no clue whether the dosages are appropriate for that).  And I have no GI symptoms.  Is it even worth treating parasite infestations if they are asymptomatic?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,Filariasis is a problem affecting many people in India,africa ans south asia and pacific.The mosquito breeding and microfilaria in blood ultimately lead to elephantiasis.WHO has taken this up on a war footing in endemic areas and a single dose of albendazole and DEC administered together every year has been found to lower the parasitic load on the community. The other parasites susceptible would include round worms and hook worms.The dose required in tapeworm is higher and giardiasis and amoebiasis need different modalities. It is best to get a stool examination and get treated for these infestations and infections.Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I have two questions, Are you circumcised? Have these lesions and the inflamed penis  improved on the antibiotic treatment?  This sounds like a complicated non improving inflammation of the skin of the penis. The changes you have described are commonly seen in severe infections of fungal or viral origin.  -Irritant dermatitis when not treated properly cause same form of lesions and eczema's changes.  - A form of inflammation near the glans penis is known as Balanitis.  Balanitis, it is inflammation of the glans penis commonly seen in uncircumscribed men. It usually causes redness and/or a blotchy rash on the glans. Mixed infection with anaerobic organisms and Candida infection appear to be the most common cause of disease.   Treatment is based on antibiotics / anti fungal treatment, improved hygiene and treatment of eczema . Circumcision may be needed in some cases.   The ibuprofen is not a treatment for infections , it is just a form of analgesic.   If you have been improving on the antibiotic prescribed by your Doctor, and you have just forgot a dose, you can restart the same treatment till you visit your Doctor.  If t did not help at all I would advise you to contact your Doctor as soon as possible to prescribe you another antibiotic treatment.    Mean while avoid any contact with a possible skin irritant, follow local hygienic measures and a local antibiotic may be useful to avoid secondary bacterial infection and further complications.  I advised you to seek a direct clinical examination to reach the proper diagnosis. Best regards.\n\n",

This morning I found mouse droppings in the worst place of all, the silverware drawer. I immediately removed everything, scrubbed it all with dish soap by hand, then washed them in the dishwasher. My concern is, I fed my 2 babies (11 months & 3 yrs) breakfast off utensils from that drawer & also ate breakfast myself BEFORE I discovered the mouse poop. I'm in tears even thinking about the fact that my babies ate off utensils a mouse may have touched. I am FREAKING OUT that we may have been exposed to Hantavirus.  What are the chances of being exposed to it from a \"house mouse\"? Is there any way to be tested or anything right away? Please help.  Thank you\n\n",

The colour of sebeceous cysts varies in peoples depending on their skin colour.In dark skinned individuals, it appears skin coloured.In fair skinned people, it appears rather bluish.  In any case, when we excise sebaceous cysts, the cyst wall very often appears bluish after the skin incision is made. I am not aware of your skin colour.I am only generalizing. Cheers!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Mommy2jacksy, Obviously you have a soft-tissue infection (perhaps sub-cuteneous).  This is a well known local complication in IV drug abusers.It needs early antibiotic therapy and drainage if an abscess has formed.The problem may not be as simple as that in IV drug abusers.  Some studies have shown that in the context of community aquired MRSA infectios (CA-MRSA), the proportion of addicts with MRSA colonization (and/or infection) was significantly higher than non-addict patients. MRSA colonization was found to be associated with infection in 58% of MRSA-colonized addicts.   The MRSA nasal carriage in the addicts was also significantly higher than non-addicts. Increasing duration of addiction resulted in a significant larger increase in CA-MRSA colonization in opiate addicts. Both inhalational and intravenous drug users had significant MRSA colonization.   There have been case reports of injection needle tips being found under the skin leading to abscesses in intravenous drug users.   Another special situation involves addicts who administer dissolved tablets intra venously. This may lead to serious consequences, including sub-cuteneous abscesses, or sub-fascial infections leading to compartment syndrome, or limb amputations. Vascular and soft-tissue imaging may help in the diagnosis. Prompt drainage of any abscess and fasciotomies for management of compartment syndrome may be needed.  So, it is advisable that you should get yourself examined by a doctor as soon as possible and there is no need to be embarrassed to go to a doctor.  Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  Depending upon just how long the current problem has been going on it could be that your body is fighting off a peristent acute viral infection or if it's been going on for, say,  several weeks, this could be Epstein-Barr/mono, which is fairly chronic in its acute phase (sounds contradictory,  but is acute so long as it keeps acting up, then finally goes dormant). Much of what you describe could  very well be EB/mono, and if it's been going on for two weeks or more there's a good chance that's what's happening. If this has been a week or less you're probably just having one of those passing viruses that can't quite get off the ground, or recurrent reinfection by exposure to someone at work or in the household who's either infected or carrying it.   If this has gone on at least two weeks you should be seen and have bloodwork done, including a monospot test done, as well as CBC and blood chemistry. If it is mono/EB,  knowing this you can know what to expect (a drawn out, intermittent syndrome such as you're experiencing, followed usually by an equally long period of fatigue and energy dropouts) and can plan to concentrate more than usual on good nutrition, rest, planning  shorter activities, etc. This is helpful because not  knowing you can continue to be caught short as the infection flares and energy falls off. It can make life miserable for a month or more, with sometimes several months of slow improvement.   I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

I went to the hospital and they lanced, drained, and packed them and (i was put on bactrim twice a day for a couple weeks) then i had to follow up wit my doctor. Since then I've had 5 more outbreaks another bunch of lumps in my armpits, then ive had 2 single abscess one on each hip (i had one a couple months ago and i have one now that just reciently got lanced), i also had 2 outbreaks on my penis. which really concerns me i don't know what to do. the 1st time in got it on my penis was a couple weeks after my 1st hip occurrence. It started off as a raised red area (on the botttom part of the head and tip of the shaft) and i quickly turned into a very painful rash like thing. When i 1st say it i was freaking out, so i went to the hospital nd they juz sent me home with a perscription for some cream and bactrim (again twice a day for a couple weeks). When i started to using the cream every thing seem to get wore before it got better: the red spot quickly turned dark (darker than my regular skin tone) and after a few days of using it the dark spot began to peel and this is where it got EXTREMELY sensitive and painful and it eventually healed and went back to normal. I the cream suppose to make it worse before it gets better?? Well now mrsa is back again on my hip and penis (this time i got it simultaneous)! I was just at the hospital a couple days about and had my hip drained (they placed me on bactrim twice a day for a couple weeks nd cleocin four time a day for a couple weeks) but i didnt notice it on my penis until the next day when it started to itch. I couldnt find the cream i used before, but i found the cream for mersa bump my niece had on her but. It should be essentially the same thing right?  Well this time it ever wore than the last time (last time it was located in a litle area of my penis) this time is completely all around my penis on the bottom of the head and the top of the shaft. Im using the cream my niece used on my penis. I seems to be getting worse, is it gonna get worse before its better like before? Right now the dark spots have developed on the hear and started to peal, the skin on the shaft and foreskin had started getting really raw its gross like something eating away at it and there is a think layer of puss produced on the shaft. Its really thick, gross, and sticky i kinda yeallow/whiteish colored and smells funky (its got the consistency of mucus ) and my foreskin pusses it out throughtout the day and it get stuck to my underwear. What should i do??\n\n",

As it  crossed inside the knee and across the shin bone you can see the red track and is particularly painfull at these two sites. It travels around an inch everyday towards my foot. My two neighbours have identical symptoms although  1 guy who has had it for around a month is particularly ill. I have been given dioxyciline, pencillin and painkillers that is not having any affect. All our water comes from the mountain streams I feel like it is a parasite but there was no forum for parasites?  Anyone have any ideas? Any Tropical medicine experts here? All replies or advise would be appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, There are a few causes that could result in the kind of picture you have outlined...  - Congenital hypertrophy of th labia: Usually observed at puberty. This condition is believed to be an anatomic variant rather than an actual congenital malformation. Rarely, it occurs as a result of lymph stasis or chronic physical pulling on the labia.  - Congenital arterio venous malformations of the labia.  - Plexiform neurofibromatosis (a type of neurofibromatosis   wherein the skin is hypertrophied and thrown into folds). Some studies have shown that congenital malformations were slightly commoner in the infants of primigravidae; in the infants of mothers >41 years of age, the incidence was increased threefold.

A whitish lesion in the throat has a number of differential diagnoses(leukoplakia, candidial infection, oral sub-mucus fibrosis etc).  Ideally, any suspected adverse event must be reported.I urge you to report your symptoms to the relevent authorities.

I'm going to suggest to my boss that I shouldn't be scheduled with this girl anymore because of the effect it might have on her baby if I would happen to spread the VRE.I'm not sure if I should be dealing with food either. Am I able to get rid of this VRE or is it something I'll have to live with for the rest of my life?  Should I still work with food? Would ever be able to get pregnant myself and have a healthy baby of my own?  Should I be worried about spreading this to anyone else I work with or is it not such a big deal like the nurses lead me to believe?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Is there any way to get rid of VRE?",
    "content": "Hi, The enterococci are bacteria that live normally in the intestinal tract and in the female genital tract. Most of the time,they cause no problem.  One must be aware that there are several different Enterococcus species.  In a nosocomial setting, and when there are risk factors such as advancing age, immunocompromised states, critical illness,antibiotic therapy etc,they become pathogenic   E. faecium and E. faecalis  are most often associated with disease and nosocomial transmission. There are other enterococci which are not pathogenic(and vancomycin resistent).   The 'other' species of Enterococci (e.g., gallinarum,casseliflavus )  are intrinsically resistant to low levels of vancomycin. These are less likely to be pathogens, their resistance has never been observed to transfer to other bacteria, and they do not require isolation, as do other VRE.   Thus, from your description...\"the nurses told me that I was a carrier of VRE and was led to believe it wasnt anything to worry about\", it is likely that the enterococcus that was isolated in your case was perhaps one of the vancomycin resistent but, 'non-pathogenic' species.  I really appreciate your concerns about the pregnant lady who you are working with.  It may be better to first find out from your hospital exactly which species of enterococcus was grown in your case so that you may formulate a  plan of action (in consultation with them) to limit spread to others (if necessary). Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "I woke up today with many 'whitehead' like pimples around my mouth.  This is out of the norm for me and occurred 24 hours after performing oral sex on a woman.  They do not itch or hurt at all, and otherwise appear to be normal pimples.  The only thing potentially different about them is that after they are popped, they reform as whiteheads very soon (maybe an hour).  I understand that this could be herpes.  My question here is whether or not it is possible that it is normal acne caused by bacteria or perhaps a Ph extreme in the vaginal fluid?  How long should I wait before seeing a doctor?

These \"pimples\" are fairly infrequent, popping up somewhere on the border between face and lips. and never numbering more than 2 or 3 around my mouth at once.  They have a resonable lifespan, often lasting several weeks as i can recall, and are red in color, sometimes nearly blending in with my lips.  They don't resemble some of the pictures I have found online which more closely resemble whiteheads, nor do they look harmful/painful, but they do not \"fill up\" with puss as typical pimples do.  Is something so beign in appearance and little in number a concern?  They first appeared sometime when I was 15- the same year I had my first oral sex experience, though it seems that if it was herpes it could be traced to many more things.  Any advice or feedback is greatly appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Thank you for that information.....But, you might have misunderstood what is meant by 'ipsilateral' lymphadenopathy.It only means that the lymphadenoathy develops on the same side as the pustule/papule that usually develops after a contact with the animal. It does affect usually one group of lymph nodes... cervical or axillary or inguinal.It does not mean however, that lymph nodes in one half of the body will be involved.  Skin infection in any part of the body (apart from the midline of the body and the zone immediatly on either side of it) will tend to cause 'ipsilateral' regional lymphadenoathy. Infections in the midline of the body and the zone immediatly on either side of it would tend to produce bilateral lymphadenopathy.  I think it is only a minor misunderstanding.  I must thank you for the very intersting post of yours. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: HPV",
    "content": "Genital warts are the most common viral STD and are caused by HPV. Over 35 different HPV types primarily infect genital epithelium. Of these, certain types (HPV 6 and 11) cause genital warts while others (16, 18 and 31) are strongly associated with severe forms of genital dysplasia and carcinoma.  HPV DNA has been identified in 6 percent of men and 10 percent of women with no clinical signs of infection. HPV infections are transmitted by direct sexual contact with a partner who has a clinical or subclinical infection. The risk of infection rises with increasing numbers of sexual partners. Nearly two-thirds of sex partners of individuals with genital warts develop the disease after an average incubation period of 2-3 months. Genital warts in sex partners are often inconspicuous and careful examination may be needed to identify them. Some, perhaps most, individuals with genital warts never become aware of their presence.   To answer your question, there is a 6-10 percent risk of contracting HPV from your partner if he had no clinical signs of infection and a 66 percent risk if he had lesions but was unaware of their presence. I would therefore recommend that you visit a Genitourinary Clinic (also known as STD Clinic) where a colposcopic examination of the vulva, vagina and cervix can be performed to identify lesions that are associated with HPV. Where clear macroscopic or colposcopic evidence is lacking, HPV DNA tests may be conducted by a more sensitive test known as polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Negative findings will be most reassuring to you.   Dr Anthony Solomon MB BS DTM&H DIP.VEN FRSM Consultant Physician, Tropical & Genitourinary Medicine\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Is it possible for me to have a normal pap smear and come back with a HPV positive screening?  I'm in my mid 30's and have always had a normal pap and the HPV has come back negative.  The only thing different this time around was that I was on my menstruation that day.. it was day one.  I asked the doctor if it was ok, she said as long as I didn't have a lot, I did not and infact before the test she put a swab in my uterus to take some blood out. Sorry if this may seem gross, but I'm now very concerned. When the doctors asst. called me she said i tested positive for HPV but the pap came back normal.  She then said, this is not the first time, correct?  I was like yes and it was the first time I was seeing this doctor.  She then told me that the doc. wanted to see me in 6 mths and that to eat lost of fruits and take vitmains to get rid of the HPV.  My concern is that this is the first time I have heard of a way to get rid of this virus.  Also, is it possible that by me having my period, could this have caused a false reading?  Thank you in advance for you answer.  I sincerely appreciate it.  Jada\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, With all due respects,it will not be proper for a  patient with a history of snake bite to dictate what needs to be done for him/her in a ER(busy or otherwise).No ER doctor would have stitched his wound (as requested by 'the man' in the script) for the simple reason that it is contraindicated in cases of snake bites.  If an ER doctor,took what 'the man' said for granted(\"He doesn't think the snake was poisonous\"), he would have been wrong(obviously he did not do so).  It was upto the discretion of the ER doctor to decide if the snake was perhaps poisonous or not (whatever the victim of the alleged snake bite indicates).  Snake bites are always given due priority, just like any other life-threatening emergency.The patient will be observed/treated as the symptoms dictate.  If the victim of the alleged bite ('the man') presents as you have described, he/she would receive polyvalent snake anti-venom + acute care management as per local protocols. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "WHITE VAGINAL DISCHARGE - WHAT COULD IT BE?",
    "content": "Hello Amandaw,  Thank you for contacting The Doctor's Lounge.   You have not stated if you had protected sex with your partner. Your complaint is that of a profuse, whitish vaginal discharge that is persistent and is associated with vulvar excoriations and discomfort. There is no offensive odour and no vulvar irritation.    Vaginal discharge may be normal or abnormal. Normal vaginal discharge is usually physiological and causes no discomfort. Abnormal vaginal discharge may be caused by infections or lesions in the cervix (cervicitis) or in the vagina (vaginitis or vaginosis).   Cervicitis is more serious if due to an infection and it is therefore more important to exclude it to prevent complications such as Tubal Infection and Pelvic Inflammatory Disease. Cervicitis of infective origin is commonly due to STDs such as Chlamydia, Gonorrhoeoa, Mycoplasma, Ureaplasma, and Genital Herpes.  Non-infective causes of discharge from the cervix may be due to cervical polyps and intrauterine contraceptive devices (IUD). You have not stated if you have an IUD.   Abnormal vaginal discharge may commonly be caused by trichomoniasis (TV),  bacterial vaginosis (BV),  and vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC).  TV and VVC usually produce additional symptoms such as vulvar irritation, redness, rash, swelling, and discomfort.  In the case of TV and BV, there is also an offensive odour which is not listed as one of your symptoms. VVC is characterised by a combination of any of the following complaints: vaginal discharge, vaginal soreness, vulvar irritation, vulvar excoriations, vulvar burning, and painful intercourse. The discharge is typically cottage-cheese-like in character but may vary from watery to thick. Odor, if present, is inoffensive and minimal.   I strongly recommend that you subject yourself to tests at a Genitourinary Clinic (also known in some countries as STD Clinic, Venereal Disease Clinic or Sexual Health Clinic) where the cause of your discharge can be confirmed. As I have explained, the list of possible causes is long and diagnosis cannot be made without an examination in a proper setting.   I must further advise that vaginal douching is not recommended because it is linked to increased incidence of upper genital tract infection due to the fact that organisms are forced up into the uterus by the pressure with which the douche is applied. In addition, vaginal douching is associated with a high incidence of Bacterial Vaginosis.  Please let us have an update after undergoing the recommended tests.    Dr Anthony Solomon  MB BS DTM&H DIP VEN FRSM  Consultant Physician, Tropical and Genitourinary Medicine.\n\n",

    "content": "I am presuming that the previous conditions which you stated in your profile have been treated successfully and tests of cure were conducted. Also,  that your sexual partner, if applicable, was evaluated and treated.   It is possible that your discharge is physiological, if there are no associated symptoms such as:  itching on or around the vulvar skin offensive odour, change in colour or consistency of discharge, rash, redness or swelling of the vulva, painful intercourse,  pelvic pain.  A physiological discharge is a normal discharge and can only be diagnosed by exclusion of causes of abnormal vaginal discharge.  Abnormal vaginal discharge is commonly due to vaginal and cervical infections caused by sexually transmitted diseases as detailed in my response to the primary post.  The management of vaginal discharge is dependent upon accurate diagnosis, appropriate treatment, partner evaluation (and treatment if appropriate) and careful follow-up. Examination of women complaining of recurring or persistent vaginal discharge must include a speculum examination and appropriate laboratory tests on vaginal and cervical specimens to exclude STDs in the specialized setting of a Genitourinary or Venereology Clinic.  If you have not been examined as such, it is advisable to do so now.   Dr Anthony Solomon MB BS DTM&H DIP.VEN FRSM\n\n",

Over the last 2 weeks I have started douching with white vinegar every other day to keep the discharge at bay, and it seems to be working, though I'd rather just take a Rx to keep the problem away.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, My sister had the right half of her thyroid out on 10/15.  There was one small cancerous nodule so the left half of her thyroid was removed on 10/23.  On Sunday, 10/25 her neck was puffy and a little red.  On Monday 10/26 she called her ENT's office and told them the problem..they didn't need to see her but called her in an antibiotic (cephalexin (sp?)).  She went to the ENT's office on Thursday 10/29 to have her staples removed and the doctor took her straight away to the ER for emergency surgery.  An infection had set in.  She was hospitalized on IV antibiotics until Sunday evening.  They sent her home on levaquin and clindamycin.  She saw her ENT today and he told her that the culture showed that she did indeed have MRSA.  She was advised to not work this week or next week (she's a dental hygeniest).  The ENT removed her drain tube and she is terrified that the infection will come back in her neck or show up elsewhere in her body.  What are the chances of this happening, and also is she contagious to others at this point?  Meaning, is she now a carrier of MRSA?  She had a c-section back in November 08 with no complications so it looks as if this is indeed from something that went wrong at the hospital.  Is this something she will have to worry about for future surgeries?   Thanks so much for you time.  A very concerned sister!\n\n",

The bump was bald of hair with a small hole in the center that the pus came out of.  Two or so days later, the bump was significantly smaller.  I picked at where the bump had been and picked off what felt like a scab, but was really a larvae-looking thing.  I screamed and flushed it down the sink before I got a good look at it, so I'm not 100% sure it was larva--but it was white and I swear it moved.  I checked my head and the area where the bump was was still bald with the hole in the center.  Is there a chance I have some kind of parasite?  Will my hair grow back?  Do I need to see a doctor?

The difference between Paraphimosis and Phimosis is this.    A Paraphimosis is a surgical emergency where the foreskin is pulled back behind the head of the penis and causes the penis and the skin to become swollen and extremely painful, reducing Blood supply and excesive pain.  A Phimosis is a term used for any other cause that means the foreskin is behind the head of the penis but does not cause any problematic smptoms.  If you cant get the foreskin to return to its original position then you will have to seek medical help.  Let me know how things go.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I scared the raccoon away, then picked up the apple and tossed it aside.  Only as a second thought did I wipe my hands off, but they were still a little wet.  I then proceeded to eat a sandwich, I think it is likely that whatever was on my hands (like the saliva) made it on the sandwich and then into my mouth and stomach.  I have no idea if the raccoon was infected or not.   Stupid move I know, but should I be worried about this?    Thanx for the help,  ConfusedInCali\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Rabies From Saliva?",
    "content": "Hi ConfusedinCali, The transmission of rabies typically occurs from the bite and saliva of an infected animal. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \"Non-bite exposures to rabies are very rare. Scratches, abrasions, open wounds, or mucous membranes contaminated with saliva or other potentially infectious material (such as brain tissue) from a rabid animal constitute non-bite exposures. Occasionally reports of non-bite exposure are such that postexposure prophylaxis is given. Inhalation of aerosolized rabies virus is also a potential non-bite route of exposure, but other than laboratory workers, most people are unlikely to encounter an aerosol of rabies virus.Other contact, such as petting a rabid animal or contact with the blood, urine or feces (e.g., guano) of a rabid animal, does not constitute an exposure and is not an indication for prophylaxis\"[1].  Since you really do not know whether the animal was infected, signs and symptoms of an infection may include malaise, fever, and neurological symptoms since the virus targets the central nervous system. I would encourage you to notifiy your primary care provider and inform him or her of the incident. Best wishes! Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN  Reference: 1. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

    "content": "Hello,Herpes simplex1 does not favour the location of back and even if you have an infection extremely rare to be symptomatic,or cause recurrences.The commoner would be herpes zoster or shingles,but there will be previous history of a single dermatome getting involved.If you have pain on both legs or occuring alternatively again could rule out hepes zoster.Only examination of the blister fluid could give some clues.As of now with your history the chances are most unlikely.Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 52-yr-old female.  I found a tick on the floor and think it was on me, possibly a long time since I'd slept in my clothes (my life is a disaster right now); thought had scraped back of knee, and pulled off what seemed very-stuck-fuzz from sweatpants.  Worried re. Lyme disease (am in northern VA) and saw a doctor who put me on doxycycline \"just in case.\"  It was already day number 4 by time I got to her and there were NO symptoms; didn't save the tick but it seemed larger than the descriptions of deer ticks, even the adults.  (I have no insurance).  I started the antibiotics but I don't want to take them because it seems VERY unlikely that I got Lyme-disease bacteria and I'm very concerned about building resistances in my own body and also about side effects like increased photo- sensitivity and colitis since I'm already quite vulnerable to both of these things.  It seems silly to put such a serious drug into my body for a phantom illness.  The risk decision is up to ME, no?  My QUESTION is is it bad to stop the antibiotics now that I've started them?  I don't see how if that bacteria is not inside of me, but I'm not sure and don't want to contribute to making any superbugs in the world or in myself; the doctor only said (through her nurse) to keep taking it and call if there are any complications when I asked the next business day.      Also, am I being too worried about the effects of taking it?  I never take any kinds of drugs or drink or smoke or anything and I hate to put unnecessary things into my body.  (I know that the huge problem re. antibiotic overuse relates to using it wrongly but if I have such a small possibility of this infection,  isn't that also overuse?)  Last night I took dose 5 of a 14-day course.      Sorry this is so long!  Thank-you much.\n\n",

I stopped the antibiotics since 2 1//2 days now and it's a big relief not to worry more than I already do about the sun and my colon.

Still I wish a doctor would tell me if I messed up by stopping partway through, though again if I lack the disease I can't see the harm.  I hope I don't HAVE it because then it will be harder to treat; I had zero symptoms and I doubt it was a deer tick.\n\n",

    "title": "War against H1N1 likely to be fought in intensive care units",
    "content": "War against H1N1 likely to be fought in intensive care units  By HELEN BRANSWELL The Canadian Press Mon. Aug 31 - 11:45 AM  TORONTO \u2014 Intensive care specialists who fought to save desperately sick swine flu patients this spring and summer have a warning for hospitals that haven't yet dealt with an influx of these difficult-to-treat patients.   Prepare. Now.   Experts predict ICUs are likely to be the main battlefield in the war against a pandemic virus which so far doesn't appear to have much of a middle ground.   The vast majority of people suffer through a typical bout of flu. But of those who become sick enough to be hospitalized, a significant portion \u2014 maybe as high as 15 per cent, the World Health Organization says \u2014 end up in ICUs for weeks, hovering between life and death.   ``I've never seen this,'' says Dr. Paul Hebert, editor of the Canadian Medical Association Journal and an intensive care physician in Ottawa who has treated several of these patients.   ``As an ICU doctor, it's very, very, very rare I can't deliver enough oxygen to someone to keep him alive. They die of other things, right? They die because their organs fail.''   ``In this case, we can barely oxygenate them.''   The worst-hit hospitals talk of having been on the brink of not being able to cope. They describe nearly running out of specialized equipment and the skilled staff needed to monitor these highly unstable patients in their high-tech hospital beds.   Public health officials need to look for ways to keep novel H1N1 patients from getting this sick and help hospitals access enough key drugs, equipment and even staff to cope with an expected surge of cases in the fall and winter, says Dr. Anand Kumar, an intensive care physician who has treated dozens of these patients in Winnipeg.   Kumar was so concerned about what he saw in the city's ICUs earlier this year that he has been agitating, in medical and political circles, for stepped up pandemic preparations for the country's hospitals.   ``I want the public health people to understand: If we breach ICU capacity, a lot of people are going to die,'' he cautions.   ``What I've been telling everybody is: `You've got to think about the ICU because the ICU, for these kinds of events, is your choke point.'''   Kumar's warnings appear to have been heard. The Public Health Agency of Canada has convened a meeting this Wednesday and Thursday in Winnipeg designed to bring together critical care and public health experts to brainstorm on how to prepare for the next wave of illness.   The scientific director of the agency's National Microbiology Laboratory says one of the goals of the meeting is to try to figure out what leads to severe disease, in the hopes some such cases can be averted. But it's also about alerting intensive care specialists who haven't yet dealt with these types of cases about what to expect. What works. What doesn't. What problems might arise.   ``My understanding from talking to the ICU docs across the country, but mainly in Winnipeg, is that there are some particular challenges with managing the people who have severe pneumonitis (inflammation of the lungs),'' says Dr. Frank Plummer. ``Understanding that and exchanging that information between intensive care doctors is important.''   ``It's not just about more ventilators, although that probably will be part of it. But I think it's about the actual techniques and technologies that were required to keep these people going. They needed really advanced respiratory support from my understanding.''   That's not all they need. Kumar notes these patients require high doses of sedating medications for long periods of time, so they don't struggle and actually fight against the ventilators being used to keep them alive.   During Winnipeg's outbreak the hospitals treating severely ill swine flu patients went through a year's supply of the sedating drugs in just two months, Kumar says.   ``For some reason \u2014 and we don't know why yet \u2014 these patients are incredibly agitated and require incredibly high doses of sedation,'' he says, adding he's asked federal officials to alert manufacturers so they can step up production.   Winnipeg treated about 50 confirmed swine flu cases and another 15 who looked just like them but didn't test positive for the virus.   Kumar thinks the recommended test \u2014 a swab inserted deep into the nose \u2014 isn't reliable in severely ill patients. He thinks other specimens, from lower down in the respiratory tract, should be searched for viruses.   He's warned his ICU peers that patients who look like swine flu cases probably are swine flu cases and should be treated as such. ``Look, guys, the test may say that it's negative, but think about it.''   At a recent meeting of the U.S. Institute of Medicine exploring the question of what equipment health-care workers need to protect them during the pandemic, an intensive care specialist from Salt Lake City, Utah, warned two-thirds of his hospital's 60 or so ICU patients with swine flu developed acute respiratory distress syndrome or ARDS, a condition that is very difficult to treat.   These patients weren't old, said Dr. Russell Miller, medical director of respiratory ICU at Intermountain Medical Center. In fact, the median age was about 30 years old.   One day the hospital nearly ran out of the dialysis machines needed to do the work of failing kidneys. And it came close to having a shortage of ICU nurses. Miller suggested hospitals preparing for the fall and winter need to think about how they will allocate resources and the difficult issue of triaging care.   Kumar agrees that hospitals need to plan for how they'll cope if ICUs become over-burdened with pandemic flu cases, something that nearly happened in Winnipeg.   ``Had the situation persisted much longer, we would have been looking to shift ... (non-H1N1) patients to other cities, basically, in order to concentrate on dealing with our own guys. And we would have had to formally cancel surgery.''   Other things hospitals and local and provincial authorities need to think about is whether legal arrangements are in place that would allow for the shifting of resources \u2014 people and specialized medical equipment \u2014 across provincial and territorial boundaries, Hebert said in a recent editorial in the Canadian Medical Association Journal.   If Saskatchewan needed more ventilators and Alberta had spares, could they be transferred? How could Alberta be assured it could get the ventilators back when it needed them?   Kumar says ICU specialists are experts at thinking outside the box \u2014 finding something else to try when standard approaches fail.   That's a skill they'll need with these patients, he suggests, noting some places used extra-corporeal membrane oxygenators or ECMOs \u2014 devices like the heart-and-lung bypass machines normally used in heart operations \u2014 to oxygenate the patients until their lungs could recover.   He says planners need to look at expanding their supplies of a range of medicines and disposable medical equipment. And they need to be preparing for the fact that while flu works its way through a community, ICU staff may end up sleeping in the hospitals.   No one knows what this new flu virus has in store for humans. But health-care professionals who've dealt with the sickest pandemic flu patients say it makes sense to prepare for tough times.   ``I always say that the one thing I don't want to do is in a year look back and say `I could have done this' or `I should have done that' kind of thing,'' Kumar says. ``I'd rather look back and say: `Man, I really over-reacted.'''\n\n",

    "content": "When I wipe my anal area after finishing my stool movement in the morning, I've been noticing some strange objects.  There have been some really small (about 1mm in diameter) seedlike \"pellets\".  Sometimes it is accompanied by yellow mucous-like fluid.  This morning I noticed the same thing, only this time it was bigger, about 3/4 cm in diameter, along with the yellow mucous.  This problem started ever since my perianal area began to itch 3 weeks ago (on the same day that I started to itch, I developed flu-like symptoms: soar throat, fever.  I thought it was a coincidence.  My doctor suspected pinworms, and that the soar throat and fever were unrelated).  After taking my 1st dose of Mebendazole the itch subsided, and I've taken my 2nd dose today.  But the strange objects continue to be in my stool, and I'm wondering if I have another kind of parasite infection.  I do occasionally feel like something is moving in the perianal area.  Since I'm taking the medication for the pinworms, I'm not as concerned about them, but I'm more concerned about whether I've got some other parasitic infection and the seedlike pellets are a symptom of that.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello B20Summer,  It is unlikely that your symptoms are related to getting the cleaner in your cut.  Most likely, getting some cleaner on a cut in your skin is likely to feel like it is burning but is unlikely to do much damage if the cut is small and the exposure is limited.    When any household cleaner gets on the skin the best thing to do is rinse with plenty of water to get it off.  Generally, contact with the skin is relatively harmless but can produce a nasty contact irritation occasionally.  This, of course, is a generalization and there are specific chemicals that are more dangerous than others.  If you are ever in doubt I recommend you contact your physician or your local poison control.  In the United States, poison control can be reached at 1-800-222-1222.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I was working in a coastal region of Colombia last month and contracted cholera.  I was diagnosed, given intravenous fluids, and recovered a week after symptoms began.  I feel fine, but my stomach, which became distended while I had cholera, is still distended.  I am not constipated, am not experiencing gas, and do not have diarrhea.  It is a little bit uncomfortable, but not painful.  At first I thought it would go away after a few days, but it has now been three weeks since I recovered and there has been no change.  Is it possible that I still have some infection?  Or is this normal?  Since I got back to the US, it is hard to find doctors with experience with cholera and have had trouble finding good medical advice on this.  Thanks in advance for whatever help you can offer.\n\n",

    "content": "My little girl, who is a little over a year old, woke up one morning with a yellow, dry crust in her eye. The eye was also swollen. We brought her in to the Pediatrician immediately fearing it might be \"Pink Eye\". The doctor told us it was and prescribed an antibiotic eye drop for her. He informed us that this drop would clear things up and it did. We used the drop for about 4 days. It seemed to work great, but about a week later she awoke with the same symptoms. We feared we didn't use the drops long enough, so we continued the drops for an additional week. During this time we were sanitizing everywhere she had touched and changing her sheets, etc. The infection looked much better and we were out of drops so we thought things had finally cleared up. After her eye had been clear for about a week and a half it came back for the third time. We've since gotten some more drops. This is getting frustrating and more than that I really feel sorry for her, even though she doesn't seem affected by it. What can be causing this reoccurring eye infection and how can we get this thing licked for good? I really appreciate any help I can get.  Thank you.\n\n",

Somewhat of a mystery to me is that it is only affecting one eye though.   Children normally will rub one eye, then touch the other at some point and infect both eyes in that manner.   Pink eye (conjunctivitis) is highly contagious.  Does she go to daycare where she may be continually exposed to the infection from another child? Please do see the doctor again.  Perhaps he can find something to help clear it up better.  Maybe even an oral antibiotic.   Another concern is that it may actually be some other problem rather than pink eye.  Consider an opthamologist also. Debra Van Ness RN\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I am 23 years old.  Last Sunday I went out to eat at an Italian restaurant and had the Caesar salad.  Within two hours my eye was swollen. A little while after I saw red bumpies on my wrist.  My armpits and groin area felt hot as well and when I removed my clothes it was red, but it felt better when I removed the clothing.  My eye also went down within 4 hours.  Then on Monday I was moving some boxes at work when my wrist, back of hand and inner elbow got really red and rashy.  It did not hurt or itch, it seemed to be getting better a few hours later.  Later that night however, I decided to run on the treadmill (I do this 5-6 days a week) for one hour.  I felt fine while walking/running, then I got off and noticed that I had that slightly raised rash back on my wrist back of hands and inner elbows but it was bigger this time and it extended all the way up behind my fingers, as well as on my lower inner arm.  My neck was slightly red and hot, and my inner thights, my knee and around the groin was rashy, red and hot too.  I went to bed and it was gone by the morning.  I also live in Arizona and when it started it was about 110 degrees outside.  The strange thing is that it keeps reoccurring.  I haven\u2019t exercised since that Monday night because I am too scared to witness the angry red rash, but whenever I exert myself even a little I will get at least one red bump on my wrist mostly, but I got one on my lower outer leg one day too.  In addition, my joints feel really weak and seem to be easily strained.  I went walking my dogs and my toes were protesting, but not intensely.  The pain I feel in my joints (wrist, ankles, toes, fingers mostly) can be described as intense shooting pain without the full intensity.  Like on a scale of 1 to 10 it is like 3.  Even typing write now, my fingers and wrist feel strained and achy. Then to top it all off, I feel very lethargic.  I would truly appreciate it if someone can shed some light on this.  Thanks :-)\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  While  you are, statistically, at somewhat greater risk of contracting MRSA from close contact with your brother, it is by no means a certainty. MRSA is extremely common in the general population and your brother may have had it prior  to admission to the hospital. The best thing you can do is simply be aware of any unusual symptoms which may develop, and these would include either persistent upper respiratory infection or skin rash which doesn't go away within 48 hours. If either should happen you would then need to have cultures taken to determine if you have, in fact, developed MRSA. So many of us are exposed to it routinely that it is most often transmitted in the hospital setting simply because hospitals have a lot of sick (and so already weakened) people in them.   I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you and I hope your brother is well  very soon.\n\n",

I am concerned about what I have read about MRSA infecting the eye, and my eyes have been feeling more watery and \"goopy\" than normal all day-as if I have just woken up. It is allergy season, but my eyes did not feel this way yesterday. Should I get tested, and if so, what kind of test should I ask for? Thank you very much in advance for your advice. Em-sage\n\n",

    "content": "I had my ear sinus removed since it was infected-called a preauricular pit that was secreting pus for 20+ years and probably was infected with Staph. GP put me on cephalexin to clear up the infection prior to surgery. I was also having muscle pain descending directly from my infected ear to my neck, shouder, arm and elbow and the cephalexin seemed to not only help with the infection but also the muscle pain. I did 5 cylcle of 40 pills 500mg each taking them every 5hrs (and I weigh 105lbs). After my surgery I started experiencing major joint pain and joint snapping sounds in my elbows, wrists, ankles, feet, and shoulder blades.  Could this be from the antibiotics? And could the muscle pain relief from the cephalexin be because bacteria from the infected sinus drained into the side of my body? I stopped taking the antibiotics in Feb and I am still experiencing the joint pain and snapping.  The muscle pain is almost unbearable but I do not want to take the antibiotics. It feels as though the ear infection has drained downwards and the pain also presented itself in the order of going down from the ear. Thank you for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "HI there --  Cephalexin was probably responsible for resolution of whatever cascading problems there were due to the ear sinus infection, including descending pain, whether from bacterial  migration or pressure on a nerve structure. This you can probably attribute, indirectly at least, to the Cephalexin. The subsequent joint pain is most likely not attributable to Cephalexin use. Whle it is remotely possible you've experienced some unsusual rheumatic reaction to it, there's nothing in the literature that would suggest this, so it would be extremely unsual. On the other hand, you can always have more than one thing going on at the same time, and the stress of the infection and surgery may have triggered an autoimmune response which is now affecting your joints. You also could possible have somehow picked up rheumatic fever, although again that is extremely unlikely. In any event you probably should be seen by a rheumatologist to try and determine what's going on with your joints and why. It's highly unlikely it's even indirectly connected to the ear problem, but not impossible. It still seems rheumatic/autoimmune in nature. I'm going to refer this to the rheumatology team here just to see if we can get any additional insight into this. Please check back in a day or so to see if anyone is able to advance any additonal ideas that might be helpful.  Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear all of you......  My first concern would be whether you have had true strep throat. this isbecause  Viruses such as rhinovirus (the cause of the common cold) are more typical causes of sore throat than strep.   my questions to you all, Did you have cultures of your throat during these episodes? Even if all of your episodes resulted in positive strep cultures, you may not have had strep throat each time. It would be a little unusual for an adult (or a child, for that matter) to develop strep throat so frequently. You might have had a single infection that lasted a long time, but that is not very likely because strep throat is usually a self-limited infection that does not recur even without treatment.   Another possibility is that you developed strep throat three different times with three different strains of the bacterium.   A sore throat might be strep throat (an infection caused by Streptococcus pyogenes bacteria). Or it might be pharyngitis (throat inflammation) caused by viruses. Telling the difference can be difficult, because the two may have overlapping signs and symptoms. Strep throat usually involves fever, a yellowish exudate (coating) on the tonsils and enlarged lymph nodes in the front of the neck. Normally, patients do not have a cough or a stuffy or runny nose. When viruses cause sore throat, the person may have a cough or nasal symptoms and enlarged lymph nodes in the back part of the neck, but usually has less fever and no exudate on the tonsils.  The preferred diagnostic test for strep throat is finding strep bacteria in a culture grown from a swab of the tonsils and throat. However, up to 10 percent or more of healthy people carry strep in their throats. That means if you are  a chronic strep carrier, you may have had frequent viral infections that were misdiagnosed as strep throat, based on a positive culture.   To tell the difference, you should have a throat culture performed when YOU ARE feeling WELLl. If it is positive, then you are indeed a chronic carrier. In that case, there is usually no need to try to get rid of the strep from your  throat because it usually does not cause much trouble.   Regardless of your  history of strep, It is hard to say, but it's possible you have as i said above  a viral infection. There are many viruses that can cause sore throat, and some of them can also cause body and joint aches. Influenza is a possibility. The common cold (rhinovirus) can cause sore throat, but fever and aches are not prominent complaints, adenovirus, and  also, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), the cause of infectious mononucleosis (mono), can cause sore throat, fever and headache. It can even cause exudate in the throat, as well as muscle and joint aches.    i hope you always feel better thank you\n\n",

Every 6 months or so I will develop a white spot on the back of my throat, either on the left or right side. My doctor called it a laceration and didn't do anything about it but I've had these sore throats for a while now. I use over the counter medicine to try and clear it up but nothing seems to work and the spot usually goes away on its own after a bit. I don't have any other symptoms besides the sore throat and I've never officially been diagnosed with anything. My first guess was a form of STD but I've been having these sore throats long before I'd ever had sex with anyone. Please help!!\n\n",

    "content": "I have just returned from holiday in Tunisia.    Whilst there we were eating a meal on a street cafe, and my children were feeding a very hungry stray cat small pieces of their food.  They were not touching the cat, however as my 6 year old daughter held a piece of food out to drop it for the cat, the cat jumped up and scratched her hand in an attempt to take the food.  The cat had previously been eating the food off its paw, so there was potentially saliva on it.    The cut drew blood.  I immidiately rinsed it under the tap with some soap and water and then put a plaster on it.    The cat appeared health (skinny and under fed but they all look like that there).  This happened one week ago, and the cut has pretty much healed up.  I didn't think much of it until I mentioned it to a family member on my return home (to the UK) yesterday, who thinks my daughter could be at risk, and Im now very worried.  Many thanks for any advice.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It is possible, but extremely rare to get rabies from something other than a bite from a rabid animal.  A non-bite exposure such as a scratch is sometimes treated but it would be impossible to say if this was one of those rare situations where it is indicated.  The fact that your child has not had symptoms (usually early symptoms occur within days of exposure) and the animal did not appear to be diseased or behaving strangely leads me to think her greatest risk was infection and it appears she did not become infected since the scratch is healing well.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I've never posted here before so I don't know if I'm doing this right.  I was bitten by a small dog 9 days ago on my leg. I received a tetanus shot (on day 3), but it was never suggested I receive rabies, nor did I bring it up. Starting on day 6 I suddenly got very light headed and then extremely dizzy. The light-head/dizzy feeling has hit me at about 2pm for the last 3 days and stays all night. When I wake up in the morning and get going (I walk for a living) I get progressively better as the morning goes on and feel pretty energetic and clear-headed, but then when I sit down after work it all starts again. Also have had problems staying warm, especially my hands. Mostly I just feel very tired and light-headed and when I lie down I feel my pulse and blood flowing, sometimes pounding in my head, back of the eyes, my stomach. The veins in my arms are all of a sudden very thin (could this be the cold hands things?) My eyes are blood shot and I do have pain behind them on and off. Also my blood sugar highs and lows are very exaggerated. No congestion of any kind. No muscle pains, or pains at the bite site (scabbed over now.) I know that's a lot of info I just don't want to leave anything important out.  I read about incubation periods online and it said the earliest was 10 days (mine started at 6) and that the farther away the wound is from the brain, the longer it takes (mine is about as far as you can get - lower calf). I just wanted to know your opinion to know if I should get the shot, or if I'm just being completely paranoid and have an unrelated virus, etc.   Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Jessss, Your question does not sound dumb by any means. When a person has mono, sometimes their spleen does enlarge and it is usually palpated (felt) by the physician. It may cause tenderness on the upper left side of the abdomen (near the ribs). If there is abdominal injury especially if the spleen is already enlarged it can cause rupture. This creates severe abdominal pain and may be life threatening. As for the symptoms of spleen enlargement itself, this causes abdominal tenderness but not severe pain. I hope this answers some of your questions. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

The pain went away,but the swelling didn't. The following week I went to get the lymphnode biopsy done(this past Wednesday)I got the cat done,and a sonogram.The radiologist that did the sonogram,told the doctor that was doing the biopsy that it would be a nodule biopsy on the right side,So he comes in,and does a sonogram himself,and tells me that my lymphnodes on the right were only slightly larger than the left.He then tells me that he didn't think that I needed a biopsy of my lymphnodes,that my parotid gland was swollen,and it could be a stone,or something else,and that I needed to see an ENT,and that I would probably end up coming back for a different biopsy.I have an appt. Mon. with the ENT and Tues. with the hematologist.The pain still hasn't come back but the swelling is still there.I have been tested for lupus,and many,many more things.I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia a year an a half ago,but that doesn't cause any of this other stuff.My family doctor thinks Lymphoma,but I didn't get to do the lymphnode biopsy to prove or disprove it.So,after hearing it all,what do you think?  Oh,thanks for getting back to me so soon Dr.Fouad\n\n",

They have already started her on Bactrim in case.  My question is if the test is positive, will she always be a carrier of MRSA?  If yes what does that mean, that it bascially lays dormant in the system unless there is a cut or wound of some sort or is it active in her body forever?

    "title": "Re: Test positive for MRSA, do you always have MRSA?",
    "content": "Hello -  MRSA is a group of strains of staphylococcus aureus (\"staph\"); about 30 per cent of the general population is colonized at any given time, and a substantial portion of that group carries a MRSA (methecillin-resistant staph. a.) form,  usually in the nasal passages. The vast majority don't have any infection or symptoms, but can always pass it along to someone else (almost always be direct or secondary environmental contact) who might become infected. It is not necessarily a permanent,  latent contamination, but can stay \"on board\" for exteneded periods of time. If treated, it can be killed, but it's so common in the general population that it's likely to show up again at some point anyway.   The greatest help in dealing with MRSA or other staph contamination is to treat infections when they appear, and to take appropriate precautions to avoid exchange of the microbe when there is a known infection (which is usually present on the skin, but can,  especially in the elderly and debilitated, invade the respiratory tract and other organ systems). It's not, by its mere presence, a remarkable problem, but has garnered a lot of public awareness because of its having caused so many problems in institutions, especially hospitals (where there are already large populations  of sick people who are automatically more vulnerable to any microbial  infection anyway). The overuse of certain antibiotics has been blamed for the apparent increase of certain resistant strains, but they've always been out there, and are always adapting.  MRSA is not active in one's body forever, or even necessarily ever, although it may be present at times. It is usually not tested for unless there's reason to suspect there may be an infection  of if there has been exposure to someone who is infected or colonized. Most of us have some form of staph on  board at some time or other, but it usually passes eventually, only to return some other  time. We may never know unless we develop an active infection, but that can  be from a totally new and different crop.  In short, your daughter isn't part of a \"carrier\" subset, she just may be colonized currently, in which case appropriate precautions can be  taken until  she no longer tests positive. She'd only need to be treated if she showed signs of active infection.  I  hope this is helpful.\n\n",

I am concerned that her pediatrician is taking a lackadasical approach in treatment such as no followup after treatment to even determine if she was colonized and for this bought of MRSA they are not even recommending oral antibiotics only Bactroban on the site.  We are swabbing all of our noses this time around, but how do they know if the first treatment eradicated the MRSA or maybe it is still in her system and that is why she got it again so soon?  I am concerned about it getting into her bloodstream but I cannot seem to get her pediatrician to even do a blood tet.  They just seem to not be concerned about it at all.

    "content": "Hello again -  While the MRSA problem is a major annoyance in general, it is mostly a big problem in institutional settings, which may be why the doctor is taking an overly laid-back approach. I'm rather surprised, since it (MRSA) isn't something anyone wants or needs circulating in a household, either, and it's such a simple process  to test for colonization. The failure to at least do that really is perplexing, since it could easily be eliminated, at least for this time around, and you all could be saved a lot of aggravation, trips to the doctor, time off work, etc. Maybe a second opinion would be worthwhile. At least perhaps the nasal culture could be done and then you'd know if the bug is there or not, so that you could maybe get some sort of pro-active attention.   It's not generally a terrible thing, but if it can be eliminated, that's obviously all the better. There's such a thing as a doctor being a little too laid back about a problem. It's still health vs. illness. You'd think that would be a no-brainer. Ah well...  Thanks for your follow up.  I'd definitely press the issue and/or seek a second opinion. Good luck with this,  and please do stay in touch.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello again --  The fact that the cellulitis has resolved but you still test positive for MRSA is not surprising. Most of us who have been exposed are either colonized or become recontaminated because this bacterium is everywhere. Countless thousands of people are walking around with it dormant. Sometimes something allows it to stir to life, other times it's passed to someone else, but mostly it just sits around doing nothing. Knowing you have it is helpful, and allows you to decide what sort of precautions you might need to take. Most of what you're doing now is probably useful,  same as someone in the healthcare industry who's exposed on a routine basis might do: careful and appropriate hand washing, use of hand sanitizer, etc., is likely the most you can reasonably do without driving yourself crazy. I don't think you need to freak out at every scratch or scrape. Just do what you're doing and be aware that the thing could start up again. If you're observant you can likely catch a nascent infection before it advances to cellulitis (if this should ever happen, which is only slightly more likely for you than the next person at this point) and handle it appropriately. This should not now be an unusual situation nor a reason to live as though walking on eggshells, in a state of high  alert.  I wouldn't banadage every break in the skin, just clean those and be observant, as anyone really ought to be.   No one who's had cellulitis wants to go through it again, and most don't.  You're in good company. You're doing everything right,  so I think you can  start thinking of yourself as a normal healthy person who is painfully aware that this problem is out there, and so just be a little more aware and careful to avoid it. We should all be so aware.  Good luck to you. Please stay in touch with us and update us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  It is not impossible to pass staph via a snakebite, but it isn't the most popular vector for it. Some snakes, in the wild, can harbor bacteria in the mouth at least temporarily, but a domesticated snake probably wouldn't maintain that status, since the infection won't go systemic in a reptile. Still, because your friend is now known to be infected with staph, you've been exosed as he is currently a carrier. A huge proportion of the general population are either colonized, infected, carriers or a combination of the above, so,  having been exposed to your friend on a presumably regular basis, whether the friend's infection is respiratory or on the skin, you probably should be tested just because you've been exposed. You may not develop the infection yourself, but you can at least take precautions, if you do have it, to keep from sharing it with  others. And I don't think I'd blame the snake. :)  Hope this is helpful. Good luck to you. Please follow up here as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Strep throat and Scarlet Fever",
    "content": "Hello --  Having had toxoplasmosis likely has nothing directly to do with your ongoing low immunity, but may have been the first sign that you are more vulneralble to microbial infections for whatever reason. The trick now is to discover what's causing the compromise, whether it is simple lack of some essential nutrient, or if there is an actual disease which is causing your immunity to be lowered. There are a number of diseases and disorders which can cause this, and they often are overlooked due to the attention focused on the acute infectious disease. It would help for you to have a consult with an immunologist, who can order the appropriate tests to isolate and identify the causative factor so it can be attacked at its base. Once this is accomplished you're likely to have far fewer illnesses.   Some examples of what might be causing this are: any of a host of autoimmune diseases (including mixed connective tissue disease), MS, fibromyalgia, inflammatory GI disease, celiac disease, Ebstein-Barr virus, or even chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). If one or more of these (and it is often more than one) can be identified it can be treated or at least managed, and your immune system boosted via the appropriate therapy for the disorder. No one  just gets sick this often without some underlying condition, even if it is something subtle that on its own doesn't cause many obvious symptoms but merely undermines the immune system.   This could take a while, and a good,  interested internist as well as possibly an immunologist, could help bring this to a good conlusion sooner, give the appropriate lab tests, which need to be ordered by an MD.   This is a deliberately vague answer, because the problem is vague by its nature. There are so many possibilities and they need to be ruled out one by one. Getting started is the key. I hope this is helpful to you, and please do follow up with us here as needed. Good  luck to you and  please stay in touch.\n\n",

    "title": "MRSA is ripping my family apart.  My infant is involved.Help",
    "content": "Hello.  I Need some advice and help.  Last March (8 months ago) my brother had an outbreak of dermatological MRSA on his abdomen.  Please note, I do not live with him.  He was treated with oral, nasal and topical antibiotics.  At that time, he got a nose culture which presented with staph but not MRSA.  A couple of months after my brother's outbreak, my stepfather (who lives with my brother) had 2 consecutive boils in his underarm.  When he went to the doctor, they said it was not MRSA and did not test him.  So today, we do not know if these 2 boils were indeed MRSA.  They resolved on their own.  I had a baby 4 months after my brothers outbreak in July and while I was in the hospital I asked the doctors if it was safe to allow my brother to have contact with the baby.  They told me that he shouldnt hold him.  Why did they say this?  We were all heartbroken.  Right there, this was the beginning of the end for my family.  We all got paranoid and decided to get cultured.  We were all negative except for my stepfather (who lives with my brother).  He was positive as a carrier of MRSA, but never had an outbreak (except for the 2 underarm boils which we do not know about).  Please note, at this time my brother got tested and no staph were present at all.  Could this be due to the treatment for his outbreak?  So, like my brother, my stepfather got treated with 2 weeks of oral and topical antibiotics and washed with the special soap.  Ironically, we noticed a pustule in the diaper area of my 3 week old son, brought him to the doctor (who lanced it and told us to apply Bactroban for a week).  A culture proved it to be MRSA.  I am so paranoid about this situation that since my son's pustule, nobody from my family's household (mom, brother, stepdad) have seen the baby.  I saw how easily my son contracted it and my stepfather only held him once and NEVER changed him.  This makes me think it was simply \"carried\" to him from my mother who was changing the baby, and she tested negative.  I am deathly scared about my son gtting it again, especially at such a young age.  I am also terrified of becoming a carrier myself.  Would I have to stay away from my son just as doctors are directing my stepfather to do?  That would be a tragedy.  My questions:  My stepfather and brother have both had negative cultures since their treatments and MRSA episodes.  My brother's negative culture was taken 5 months after his infection and my stepfather received 2 negative cultures- once 2 weeks after treatment and once a month later.  Are they cured?  Can they spontaneously recolonize from within their bodies or would recolonization only involve being exposed to the MRSA again in their external environments?  I am so scared that they will recolonize without anybody knowing, contaminate their household again, and that the MRSA can be carried to my household and baby (now 3 months old).  My mother is an innocent bystander because she is negative but can serve to simply \"transport\" the MRSA (as had been done with the baby's first episode).  I know his MRSA came from them because he did not leave my house and everybody else who had contact with him tested negative.  Right now, my whole family is very mad at me for keeping the baby from them.  I feel like I lost my family at a time in my life which is supposed to be the happiest...the birth of my first child and the first grandchild.  Please help me.  I am heartbroken along with the rest of my family.  However, I cannot and will not take a chance when it comes to the health and life of my son.  I lost twins a year ago due to twin to twin transfusion syndrome and I would not be able to deal with another tragedy.  Please, please help.  Thank you so very much.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) is a type of staph that is resistant to conventional antibiotics like methicillin and other penicillins.  There two main forms of MRSA  infections which are healthcare-associated MRSA  mainly in those who have weakened immune systems and a community acquired CA-MRSA infections.   CA-MRSA infections occur in normal individuals not exposed to health care facilities like dialysis machine, or are hospitalized for other causes.  CA- MRSA infections typically presents with skin infections, like pimples and boils in healthy individuals. Spread of infection is by direct contact with the person infected skin or indirect by contact with his personal items like towels he or she used to dry areas of infected skin. This likely to happen in places where close contact is possible like at home and schools.  It is important to know that contact with MRSA infected skin or towels does not mean you certainly would catch the disease, to occur it needs a broken skin barrier like cuts or scrapes.   This means that there are ways to defend our body and skin from catching infection by sticking to good hygiene and regular cleaning with soap and water or alcohol containing washes. Covering any area of skin damage is very important as well as avoiding the use of any others personal staff.  If your family members are tested negative for MRSA including yourself, you may safely allow them to contact your child but it is better that all of you follow strict hygienic measure e.g. simple hand wash with water and soap before contacting your child, this will reassure you and them.  And good news is that the majority of CA-MRSA is non invasive skin infections and can be controlled efficiently.  There are many instructions provided by the CDC regarding this issue, so for more information you can follow this link.  http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dhqp/ar_mrsa_ ... anage.html  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "I am only responding because I don't think the doctors are where they need to be on MRSA, I don't think they have yet figured out exactly what causes it. So I wanted to let you know our experience with it. My family lives an hour away and my brother used to get MRSA a lot, so did his daughter. When I say a lot it was nothing for my niece to have 8 or 9 at a time. My brother either. Then my nephew started to get them, lived next door to them. My mother is not the cleanest person. Yet she never got one, my Dad never got one,my SIL never got one, my other brother never got one and two of the other kids never got one. The ones that did kept them for a little over a year, they would go away then come back. Here is how they live: well water from a shallow well, not very clean people (they don't wash hands very often or sterilize anything). Now let me tell you about the family down the street.. This is how this family lives: they are clean and looking at them you would think higher middle class. Her son got one and then it spread to her other son, neither parent ever got one but they too kept them for a long time, a little under a year. When they would get one she would clean the tub out with bleach after every bath, sterilize the house, use the nose meds for every person in the hosue, and antibiotics for the ones with MRSA. So I don't know how it spreads.. But I don't think it has to do with cleanliness. Then one day my son got one so I carried him to the doctor and he lanced it and sent us home with meds. Next day he fell and it caused the infection still in there to pop up into another bump so I carried him to the ER, they hooked him up IV antibiotics, he was allergic so they gave him benedryl, he was allergic, they knocked him out. Next day they carried him in to surgery and cleaned the whole thing out, yes surgery. He had never had it since, 5 years ago. Then in January I came down with MRSA on the inside, no visible sign on the outside until I got up hurting by next day I couldn't move, they thought I would not be able to walk again at first. Never had surgery , had not been in a hospital for any reason, so they have no clue how I got it. They did say it can happen to people who get MRSA over and over again so I wonder if when a  person gets it repeatedly if there isn't a point where it infects deeper than the outside, like mine through the blood and bone, then when they are treated they are only treated for MRSA on the surface which heals faster and with much less meds and because it is deeper they aren't getting rid of it completely. I was in the hospital on 3 antibiotics for a week, two antibiotics for two more weeks, then finally down to one antibiotic for another week then sent home with it in IV for another 2 months to get rid of the MRSA on the inside.  I have yet to touch a person with MRSA and catch it though.  As long as your family washes ther hands I do think it will fine to hold the baby after all when I was in the hospital they let my 3 year old, 10 year old, and 12 year stay with me for a month. They didn't all stay at the same time but would take turns staying the night with me, expect 3 year old stayed the whole last two weeks not leaving my side. If it were that unsafe there is no way they could have stayed in my room. BTW, not one of them got the MRSA. So I really hope you will relax with your family and just keep an eye out for the little one because if she had MRSA she will probably get it again but as long as you have her treated she will be fine. Just be sure the doctor knows if it is something that recus often and speak to them about it getting into her blood.\n\n",

    "content": "I am 22, female, and have been suffering from a sore throat, red bumps, swollen tonsils and lymph nodes accompanied by a fever of 99.6 since the begining of November of 2005.  Two weeks after my symptoms started I saw my doctor.  She ordered that I be tested for Mononucleosis and Strep.  Mono. came back negative, strep came back possitive(but not type A?).    After being on Amoxicillin for 8 days, the symptoms were no better.  I called my doctor and she took me off of Amoxicillin and started me on Cefprozil.  After finishing 5 days, no improvement.  I went back in to see my doctor and she had another throat swab done that came back with a result of, \"no abnormal bacteria\" and  then referred me to an ear, nose and throat specialist.  He said it was a bacterial infection and placed me on Cephalexin for 7 days and scheduled me for a Tonsillectomy immediately following antibiotics.  However, after 7 days were up, nothing changed in my throat, though my throat wasn't quite as sore and I felt better in general.  He then gave me 7 more days of Cephalexin, but, nothing changed.   After that, I saw the specialist again and he said he could not put me on any more antibiotics but told me to gargle with Citris Listerine twice a day.  I have been doing this for two weeks now and nothing is changing other than I am feeling slightly worse.  I called the specialist today and was told to try Chloraseptic.  The tonsillectomy has, of course, been postponed.  It looks like there are bumps and a couple of almost flaps of skin or growths of some sort in the area around my tonsils.  I feel somewhat helpless and wonder if my specialist is doing all that is needed.  I would greatly appreciate your input.  Thanks.  :)\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Kermster,  Most cases of sore throat are due to viral infection e.g. as part of flu and cold attack. Bacterial infections on the other hand represent  a smaller number of cases. Usually there are other associated symptoms and signs that can point to the possible causative agent.    Viral induced sore throat usually subsides in week with rest and plenty fluid intake. Bacterial infections (group A streptococci is the commonest) causing sore throat need to be treated with antibiotics.   Infectious mononucleosis is a type of virus EBV induced sore throat that lead to recurrent sore throat with swollen tonsils and lymph nodes in addition to other specific symptoms and signs. Streptococcal pharyngitis and EBV infection are usually difficult to be differentiated.  If you suffer from recurring sore throats, it's also possible that your toothbrush needs to be changed as it may transmit the infection for you after you have recovered from your first attack.   Experts says that a sore throat that lasts for longer than a week is often caused by allergies, or exposure to humidity, smoking, irritation from heating and cooling systems.Repeated pharyngitis can also happen seasonally or all year long most commonly due to allergies and in this case usually the allergic individual wake up early in the morning with sore throat.  A sore throat that does not\u2019t improve or repeated with a short period of time should be investigated properly. By complete history and proper examination your physician can evaluate the cause of this recurrent sore throat and recommend treatment.  Recurrent pharyngitis is the most frequent indication for tonsillectomy. The goals of surgery include amelioration of symptoms, avoidance of sick days and reduction of complications such as peritonsillar abscess, streptococcal cervical adenitis and the immunologic sequel of streptococcal infections  Best regards,\n\n",

Upon doing some research I have learned alot of my symptoms could possibly be the two above mentioned conditions.  Now to my question, with Lyme Disease, do you necessarily have to have a red irritated area that becomes swollen in order to have been bitten? I understand their is a simple routine blood test that can be preformed to check for it. Could you also give me a general list of symptoms associated with it.  My next question regarding Mono is do you have to necessarily have swollen glands and a fever with this infection? Can you get it again after having it once (10 years ago or more?) I did have this illness already and all that I remember is being extremely tired and having golf ball size neck glands that had become swollen. Is your doctors office able to preform a general blood test or culture for this as well?  Thank you in advance for taking the time to answer my post!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  The answer to your first question is YES, but the typical skin lesion may go  unnoticed in about 20% of patients.  The first finding is a bite site on the skin which is a flat or slightly raised red rash. This  red lesion enlarges progressively within days to form an expanding circular lesion with a distinct red border and partially clearing centre. The centre may become thickened or blistered.    The PCR blood test is the preferred confirmatory laboratory test as it detects the DNA of Borrelia burgdorferi, the organism that causes Lyme Disease.   Lyme Disease is a complex illness involving many organs in the body. The symptoms depend on the stage of the disease and some stages overlap.  In Stage 1, the infection is localized to the site of the bite and this is seen as a red, progressively expanding circular lesion as earlier described.  If untreated, the infection is spread through the blood stream to other sites in the body and this is known as Stage 2. Symptoms at this time may include a combination of the following: fever, chills, headaches, weakness, intolerance to light, secondary skin rashes, carditis, meningitis, cranial neuritis, radiculoneuropathy, and migratory pain in joints, tendons, bursae, muscles or bones.   Stage 3 is one of persistent infection and is manifested by *arthritis of large joints, especially knees *encephalopathy   *advanced atrophy of the skin of the upper or lower limbs known in dermatology as Acrodermatitis Chronica Atrophicans (ACA). In the endstage of ACA, the skin becomes so atrophic that the superficial veins and subcutaneous tissue become prominent and are easily lifted and pushed into folds.  Your last three questions are in respect of Infectious Mononucleosis. This is an acute illness usually caused by the Epstein-Barr virus and characterized by fever, malaise, sore throat, enlarged lymph nodes (especially in the neck) and an enlarged spleen. So, the answer to the first of three  questions is YES, swollen glands and a fever are essential components of this acute infectious disease.  Prior infection with the virus usually provides long-lasting immunity. If the illness was diagnosed 10 years ago by clinical and laboratory findings, it is unlikely to have the disease again.   The MONOSPOT is a simple slide test for Infectious Mononucleosis that can be performed by your doctor and it usually becomes positive within 4 weeks after onset of illness. A more sophisticated and accurate test is the PCR for EBV DNA which can confirm the disease in immunocompromised patients who may not produce a typical antibody response.   I hope this information has been helpful.    Dr Anthony Solomon MB BS DTM&H DIP.VEN FRSM Consultant Physician, Tropical & Genitourinary Medicine\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there, I have a questions regarding mono and Lyme. My daughter (6yrs old) was diagnosed with Mono but she didn't have typical symptoms except the mountain size glands on her neck and she would get very tired very quickly. They also tested her for Lyme which came back positive but I was told that it could be a false positive due to the fact she was positive for Mono. However, they did decide to treat her for the Lyme. As for now, she is much better then when she initially got sick which was over a month ago however she still has some symptoms that have continued and new symptoms. These include: humming and states it makes her throat feel better, slightly swollen glands, still gets tired with activity, turns pale and states she feels funny but now she has started complaining of also being achy all over. My  first question is is there anyway to test or distinguish if she really does have Lyme or if it is a false positive due to the Mono?  My second questions is could she have gotten the Lyme first and then with her immune system being down could she have caught Mono?  Thank you, needanswers2\n\n",

    "title": "Long Term Effects of Toxic Shock Syndrome/Sepsis",
    "content": "In early January of this year I was brought to the emergency room and was told I was in septic shock and they later determined I had Toxic Shock Syndrome.  It was not related to tampon use - they attributed it to cutting myself while shaving and then going into a hot tub as I had a swollen lymph node in my groin and hadn't recently had my period.  My blood pressure dropped so low and I was having such a difficult time breathing that I spent four days in the ICU (they couldn't determine what specific bacteria was causing the infection so they put in an internal jugular line for numerous antibiotics) and then remained at the hospital for another three for monitoring.  I was prescribed clindamycin and suprax upon being discharged.                                      I recovered well (however my liver enzyme count was elevated until late February before returning to normal).  My question more specifically is what are the long term effects toxic shock syndrome and sepsis entail?  My skin already peeled but I am now experiencing hair loss (it comes out in handfuls but there is no scalp showing yet - after some research i concluded it is or at least resembles telogen effluvium).  It has been shedding for a week now and I was wondering if this is typical or at least what i should expect - how bald will i get?!   Are there any other possible side effects that can surface from my experience?    Side note - I have a scar that is a noticeable red and feels like a knot in my skin - over the spot where they placed the internal jugular line, will this scar ever go away and is it even supposed to be there?  Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, You have experienced a serious infection and you can consider yourself fortunate, lucky or blessed to not have had more serious consequences.  At this point you should just continue to heal and I would expect a full recovery unless there was some specific organ damage with the infection.  I suspect the loss of hair may be your body's response to the shock.    Hair is considered disposable to your body - something to be sacrificed if needed while conserving energy preserving the vital organs.  In most cases this would come back, though there's no way to predict how much loss you may experience.  Systemic infection like this can affect each person differently.  When it comes to infection there is nothing that is \"supposed\" to happen since the very nature of dis-ease is that it is NOT normal. I'm afraid we can't predict your response or even whether or not the symptoms you have noticed are related to the original infection.  You should discuss this with your doctor.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Your risk is quite minimal.  The virus that causes this is present in many people at any given time.  It is just your girlfriend's bad luck that her exposure to the virus resulted in meningitis.  This means that the virus spread to the meninges, surrounding the brain.  Another person (even you) could have the virus and have no symptoms at all, or perhaps a slight infection such as a cold.  Of course you don't want to spread any viral infection so caution is always wise, but chances are your own immune system will protect you.  There are meningitis vaccines available that help reduce the odds of some strains of meningitis.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I'd say the risk of an infection via this route is next to nil.  Hope this is helpful. Good luck to you.\n\n",

The dog was vaccinated then , that was valid for one year only and was not given  through any licensed animal doctor. (even that vallination expired around 5 months back  and i didnt vaccinate him yet)  Now yesterday, i recieved a very small cut from a sharp wooden piece on my hand, a  single drop of blood came out and i washed that with water, that wound was like 1 mm  of size or you can say 5 paper pin points wide and in depth it was like that the layers  of skin was just cut and blood came out along with showing a little redness of the flesh.  After half an hour i went to the dog to give him food, at several occassions my wound  was very close to his mouth, thus recieving his breath and may be saliva vapours.  After 5 minutes of that , i washed my hands again.  I will really appreciate if u can give me an advice, what to do so now, bcuz i was thinking that even the dog seems to be normal , it may have rabies virus in it's saliva, Which may  enter through the wound of mine, A person i know said that if the dog is normal,  means acting normal and your wound exposed to it, then its no problem bcuz it didnt  have any rabies virus , but if it does have even a single rabies virus , then it will die  within 15 days , no matter it bitted you or not. He also said that after half an hour blood  clots are made in the wound and the virus cant enter the wound, and if even the virus  enters, then the vaccinations of verrorab i took 1.5 years back will be enough to fight  them.  As it is a very serious matter , infact of death and life, therefore i request you to give  me an advice, i will be very thankful of yours.   Thanks Goldberg\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Goldberg, Let me go through a few facts about rabies:  Rabies is uncommon in dogs, cats, and ferrets in the United States. Very few bites by these animals carry a risk of rabies. If the cat (or dog or ferret) appeared healthy at the time you were bitten, it can be confined by its owner for 10 days and observed. No anti-rabies prophylaxis is needed. No person in the United States has ever contracted rabies from a dog, cat or ferret held in quarantine for 10 days.   If a dog, cat, or ferret appeared ill at the time it bit you or becomes ill during the 10 day quarantine, it should be evaluated by a veterinarian for signs of rabies and you should seek medical advice about the need for anti-rabies prophylaxis.  The quarantine period is a precaution against the remote possibility that an animal may appear healthy, but actually be sick with rabies. To understand this statement, you have to understand a few things about the pathogenesis of rabies (the way the rabies virus affects the animal it infects). From numerous studies conducted on rabid dogs, cats, and ferrets, we know that rabies virus inoculated into a muscle travels from the site of the inoculation to the brain by moving within nerves. The animal does not appear ill during this time, which is called the incubation period and which may last for weeks to months. A bite by the animal during the incubation period does not carry a risk of rabies because the virus is not in saliva. Only late in the disease, after the virus has reached the brain and multiplied there to cause an encephalitis (or inflammation of the brain), does the virus move from the brain to the salivary glands and saliva. Also at this time, after the virus has multiplied in the brain, almost all animals begin to show the first signs of rabies. Most of these signs are obvious to even an untrained observer, but within a short period of time, usually within 3 to 5 days, the virus has caused enough damage to the brain that the animal begins to show unmistakable signs of rabies. As an added precaution, the quarantine period is lengthened to 10 days.  I hope that has helped to ease your worries.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,   I am very familiar with the VERORAB vaccine, which you should have received in six doses: on Days 0, 3, 7, 14, and 28 with an optional dose on Day 90. This was given to you as a post-exposure treatment because, according to you, the animal was looking  very ill  then (\u201clike a rabid animal\u201d, according to you).  If the vaccine was correctly refrigerated at 2-8 degrees centigrade and correctly administered, it should provide protection for 2 years. In fact, humans at high risk of contracting rabies (such as veterinarians, gamekeepers, hunters, forest rangers, slaughterhouse personnel, taxidermists) are advised to take a prophylactic dose of Rabies Vaccine on Days  0, 7 and  28  (3 doses only) with booster doses every 2-3 years. This is the recommendation in the British National Formulary, March 2004 Edition. In your own case, you received six doses, which should provide an equally good protection for two years, assuming again that the vaccine\u2019s potency was not affected by poor storage and it was properly administered.  I am very concerned at the statement you made that the dog was not vaccinated by \u201ca licensed animal doctor\u201d. Who supplied or administered the vaccine? Vaccine failure is common if the product is not properly stored or administered.   If, as you claim, your dog is \u201cnormal\u201d at the present time, it could not be harbouring rabies virus in the saliva, so there is no possibility of contracting rabies. Are there cases of rabies in Singapore? Post-exposure prophylaxis depends on the level of risk in the country, the nature of exposure and the individual\u2019s immune status. In respect of your cut, I am more concerned about your tetanus immunisation status. Please ensure that this is up-to-date.  The WHO recommendations for rabies prophylaxis are clear and straightforward:   for a live, non-suspect dog or cat, place the animal under veterinary supervision for a minimum of 10 days  and postpone rabies post-exposure treatment for the patient;  for a live, suspect dog or cat, place the animal under veterinary supervision for a minimum of 10 days and commence rabies post-exposure treatment for the patient immediately. Treatment is stopped if the supervision invalidates the initial doubts, otherwise treatment is continued.  Thank you for contacting our website. I hope I have answered the questions you raised in your second mail.    Dr Anthony Solomon MB BS DTM&H DIP.VEN FRSM Consultant Physician, Tropical & Genitourinary Medicine\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,      A few days ago I was playing with my dog when suddenly she pressed down on my hand with her teeth, I don't know if it was neccessarily a bite, since there was no bleeding, she just left a very very small hole that she had made with one of her teeth.  I ignored it since I didn't think it was a big deal.  A few minutes after that happened, my hand started feeling numb, but again I let it go.  The next day, my hand started feeling even more numb like if I had slept on it for a long time, I even had the tingly \"ant\" sensation.  Also, my right leg started feeling the same as my right hand, which was the hand that my dog had pressed down on.  It just felt very numb, and at night I have a hard time sleeping on my right side because I start feeling the tingly sensation on my hand.  I did not go to see a doctor because my dog did have her rabies shot and at the time I didn't know if it was significant enough for me to go see a doctor.  Please, can you give some advice on what I should do, and why I'm feeling what I'm feeling.\n\n",

I have taken the full dose of the Verorab vaccine from 23, June to 21, July, 2008( 05 shots on the Day 0, 3, 7, 21, and 28). But on November, I was exposed to Rabies again, and my doctor advised me to take 02 shots on the Day 0 and Day 03( in 11th, November and 14th, November)  I would like to know how long does Verorab protect me from catching Rabies if I am at risk again? I am worried because I was licked on the wound by the stray dog some days ago. And I do not want to take the Vaccine again, I think that Verorab could protect me for a certain months or years. Please give me the advice.  During the time of taking shots, I did not have any beer, but I also had some beers after the last shot ( 06 weeks from the last shot), does the beer affect the work of the vaccine?  Thank you,\n\n",

You don't mention any medications having been taken during the recent seige. Is this a possibility? If not, you probably should be seen by a doctor and have blood work done, as this sort of rash accompanies some potentially serious infections. It's difficult, because of the great number of possible causes, to pin this down further for you, but given the way it started and the type of rash, I'd definitely have it looked at, and sooner than later.   Hope this  helps. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

But now 6 weeks later, my palms are red and I am experiencing swelling in my hands and feet with pain in the joints of my hands, feet and knees.  I should mention that during the initial illness, the rash was accompanied by swelling hands with a red rash on my palms so I think this is still related.

    "content": "Hello, Probably the most likely route of transmission is direct airborne from sneezing, coughing, etc and touching items such as door knobs used frequently.  Papers would be low risk unless they were newly sneezed upon, touched, and then the hands were put in the mouth.  So, using good, normal hygiene including hand washing or using hand sanitizers would be preferable to annoying the entire office personnel with smelly sprays.  This person would do just as well to keep a bottle of antibacterial gel at her desk and use to her heart's desire.  It sounds more like a bit of a compulsion and it is definitely bad office etiquette to be so thoughtless of others.    Of course it is also bad etiquette to bring viruses to work so especially in the first few days of a cold, ill personnel should stay home.    Good luck in dealing with this issue.  It is appropriate to let her know that her  practice bothers you, probably not unlike her worry of germs worries her (though much more typical a concern).  I would also be bothered by the spray and I'm sure if there are others in the office environment you are not alone in this complaint.    Best wishes.\n\n",

Before she was put into isolation we, her children and one grandchild, spent several hours in a hospital room with her. She had no visible sores on her so I assume the MRSA is in her lungs. I am concerned because we don't truly know if we were exposed to it or not. She coughed while we were there, but she coverd her mouth and spit into a tissue. She washed her hands after toilet visit. None of us touched her or her tissues. Is there a need for us to be checked for MRSA or is it easily spread from her cough by us just being in the room with her? I have bronchitis at this time and have a cough but I beleive it to be related to that. My husband had the flu and pneumonia last week and I was in close proximity to that. I also have a son in a wheelchair that was not around my mother, but was around me after my visit with her. Should I take any kind of extra precaution for him. He does have some upper respitory problems and I try to be careful with him when it comes even to the common cold.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: MRSA Pneumonia",
    "content": "Hi there -  Your concerns are understandable, as there is a good deal of confusion about MRSA, how it is communicated and how best to prevent contamination.   Your mother's infection is unfortunate, but is not the most readily exchangable form. While it is prudent and expedient to have visitors gown up for superficial (skin) infections, since the bacteria are living on the surface of the patient, pulmonary MRSA is handled a little more easily, and your mother did the exact correct thing by coughing/spitting into a tissue. This is one of the main measures used to prevent spread of the bacteria, which may colonize but not actually infect other people. Medical attendants who will be in close proximity to a patient for purposes of airway management, etc., should wear a mask. Otherwise, respiratory MRSA is fairly easily managed in terms of contagion.   Since you have a son in a wheelchair, and this puts him at a slightly greater risk of pneumonia in general, some awareness of the potential for sharing of the bacteria is useful, but about all you can do is remember to wash your hands and observe the usual precautions when visiting. So many of us are already colonized it's difficult to realize how widespread MRSA is, vs. actual infections.   I think you should  be in fine shape so far. I hope your mother enjoys a full recovery. Best of luck to you and your family.\n\n",

This might require a simple, minimally invasive repair, but can save a lot of pain and  grief down the road.   Also,while the antibiotic probably won't do any harm and may serve a prophylactic purpose, I cannot (needless to say) endorse self-treatment, let alone self-diagnosis, let alone sharing of prescription drugs. Enough said on that subject.   The real concern is possible inguinal hernia, which does need to be ruled out (or in) fairly urgently. I hope he'll get this done at once.

Thanks so much for ANY opinions on this..Im really lost and still kinda scared.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Can shingles cause an autoimmune system to emerge?",
    "content": "Hello, Autoimmune disorders can develop at any time but it would not be caused by the shingles.  A person gets shingles when the virus that formerly caused them to have chickenpox and then lays dormant, becomes active - sometimes due to immune system deficiency, stress, etc.  but if there is an autoimmune disorder that caused the person to be susceptible to the reactivation of the virus, that disorder most likely came first.    Since a person is more apt to get infections when the immune system is depressed, it is often the case that they develop more than one illness as a result.  Shingles can also be present in the throat, ears, eyes and other areas of the body - typically only on one side so this could all be related to the same virus along with a disturbance of the natural body balance of bacteria, both good and bad.    Your mother's doctor will probably recommend pain relievers, anti-inflammatory medications and antiviral agents to help her get through this painful ordeal  Best of luck to your mother and you.\n\n",

    "content": "I have been battling MRSA since August in my left ankle.  I originally got MRSA there last September (2007) after surgery.  It came back from the inside with no known cause.  I was just tested in my nose 2 weeks ago after a couple of months of suffering with terrible bloody discharges of nasty stuff and bloody pillow cases etc.  In 2 days the doctors office called and said my culture came back positive.  I was put on a cream antibiotic I put up my nose for 5 days 2xdaily.  I just finished my 3rd round of doxycycline.    Anyway, because my WBC and another count was still up I had a bone scan done.   Right between my eyes showed up hot, and the heel bone of my left foot.  I was told my left foot is normal because of the surgery I had a year ago.  The spot between my eyes over my sinuses they are going to just ignore, that isn't really what they were to be looking at I think.  One of the doctors is a foot surgeon and the new one is a referral and is an infectious disease specialist.    The problem is I can't contine to function like this.  Should I go to see my neurologist who I trust and has treated me through my headaches and is still treating me or go to my sinus doctor who did nose widening surgery this spring without coming near the bone that is a hot spot.   Or anything else I am missin?\n\n",

    "content": "The neurologist said the infectious disease doctor knew more than he did about the bone scan so he did nothing about it just like the other doctor.  The only person who seemed concerned about it was the radiologist who did the scan or whatever the title of the person was.  I am now on my 4th week of Vancomycin 2g in 200 ml  in an infusion every 24 hrs by PICC line.  That should take care of the bone scan hot spot I should think.  But the MRSA on my ankle is not going away.  QUESTION NOW IS should I let them go in and cut out the MRSA area and see if it will heal from the inside out with clean tissue, or is the risk of just spreading the MRSA worse?  I have had this MRSA this around since Aug. and I have had 3 or 4 rounds of oral antibiotics and 4 weeks of IV antibiotics.    I am allergic to sulfa drugs. and I take cortisteroids and have horrible tendon reactions to levaquin.  I didn't know what the reason I felt like someone was, to quote me at the time, \"trying to pull my tendons out of my toes with a pliers,\"  was until the black box warning came out for the levaquin family.    Any opinions would be greatly appreciated since I really don't see any alternatives.\n\n",

    "title": "Constant Lower Abdominal Pain",
    "content": "For the past 2 weeks I've been having constant pain in my lower abdomen. It started out as a burning sensation in what felt like my appendix. It's grown worse since, and is now a dull aching feeling in my lower abdomen, all around my waist to my lower back. I thought I felt a lump in my testicle so I went to the doctor and they said they didn't feel anything and sent me home. Since the doctor checked my testicle, it's been real tender and it hurts even when I barely touch it, but the other one (the left one) is fine.  When it first started, I had a burning sensation in my penis for about 2 days, and a slight clear discharge but it went away pretty quickly. I had been to the doctor prior to that and they did a chest x-ray (because I was having chest pains) and they found that I had a lung infection, and they put me on Levaquin antibiotics. I was given a Rx of 10 pills, 1 a day, and there's only a few left. Since I was on the antibiotics, the burning sensation went away, and so did the discharge but the abdominal pain has gotten worse.  It feels like getting kicked in the balls but it's constant and it's all around my waistline. I'm a 19 year old male, no cancer running in the family, not very active but in decent health I guess.  Any ideas on what might be wrong? Just to summarize, here are the symptoms I've been having:  Constant lower abdominal pain and all around waistline to lower back (dull/aching feeling)  Tenderness in right testicle  Pain on the top of right thigh (not often and doesn't last long)  Sometimes nausea and loss of appetite  Just the other day my 'stool' was almost completely black  Most of the time my urine is a little cloudy  Sometimes slight muscle spasms in random parts of my body   Thanks for any help.  Edit: I forgot to mention, I had a UA (urine analysis) and it came back clean.\n\n",

    "content": "Daniel, you may possibly have a couple of things going on.  The black stools are not related to your testicle pain, did you take any Pepto Bismol several days before that happened?  Did your UA show negative before you started the Levaquin?  Since the burning sensation responded to the medication, you may have had prostatitis; it can cause all your symptoms including the lower abdominal and back pain.  Did your doctor do a full exam on you (inserting a finger in your rectum to feel the prostate)?  Did he do a UA after he did that?  Some men have chronic prostatitis, either bacterial or not, or a condition called prostatodynia that is not bacterial, but has the same symptoms.  Either way, we obviously cannot diagnose you over the net; you don't want to mess around with testicle pain, even tho there was no lump.  I recommend you see a specialist (genitourinary MD).  If you did not have any Pepto Bismol in the days prior to your black stool, you need to get to a doctor (GI) for that also, especially light of your abdominal pain.  Abdominal pain can be from many, many things.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) can be lethal and also difficult to detect.  It is often misdiagnosed as cellulitis; and the skin can appear fairly healthy with the exception of some erythema.  What is occurring under the skin however is another story as the infection eats away at the subcutaneous tissue and spreads rapidly.    Diagnosis of NF can be made with exploratory biopsy and CBC. Treatment includes debridement and IV antibiotics.   Since you have been previously diagnosed with NF, it is important to have the leg evaluated in the ER as soon as possible.    Let us know how it goes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi ,  At the end of october after having a root canal that took 3 weeks,At which point i found i had a small scrap behind my ear & i started getting a cyst right behind my ear ,it was so big it went from down near my lobe up to my mastiod bone.  Very painful & it would get bigger and smaller. I went to the doctor and she put me on a high dosage of Cylindamycin . and Two weeks passed and the cylindamycin didnt do anything & i went to the ER, they said i had cellulitis and drained it. Well it healed up , but started getting bigger again! So i went to the Doctor, She has put me on ciproflaxin, she test me for MRSA, came back negative. Now 2 days ago, i have what feels like another cyst but on my lymph node in my neck, very painful. The ciproflaxin isnt helping me at all expect making me feel sick and thristy. My doctor cannot think of what it could be. Any ideas Please?  If it helps; In 2004 , i was admitted to the hospital for Renal failure, had mono & strep at the same time. They did a biopsy on my kidney. They thought it might be lupus, but got more negative test then postive. I still cannot handle Milk, orange juice, or anything with alot of calcium or phosphates. In the last 3 months ; Been to the ER 3 times, First to have my cyst drained [ no test were ran] , then un packed. Two weeks later i had to go 2 the hospital for HORRIBLE kidney pains & non stop throwing up [ this is a usally thing  for me, if my kidneys hurt, i cant stop throwing up until i get a IV , even if i don't eat or drink for 2 hours I have been given medicine that is supposed to help with nausea but i throw it right up.] And at that point they said i had a UTI which spread  to my kidneys & trichomoniasis [ i have one sexual partner]\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Cut from Broken Jar of Bad Canned Food",
    "content": "Hello, Treating any fresh laceration with irrigation and compression is wise.    Botulism is rare.  Mode of transmission include ingestion, topically through wounds, and inhalation.  The botulism bacteria (Clostridia botulium) thrives in low oxygen environments however in food, the spores have already produced their toxins.    According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), 110 cases on average are reported in the US each year. - 72% are infant botulism (most are from inhaling dust containing botulism bacteria spores) - 25% are food borne - 3% are from wounds (usually IV drug users - heroine)  Monitor for wound for signs of infection (warmth, redness, pain, swelling, and pus); also monitor for flu like symptoms and paralysis of the face, limbs, and respiratory muscles.  If botulism is seriously suspected, this is an emergency and seek immediate medical care.    Again, botulism would be very unlikely.  I would be more concerned about tetanus.  Tetanus vaccination shot should be given every 7-10 years.  Every 5 years for potential exposure.  If you haven't had a tetanus shot in 5 years, see your physician.    Hope this helps.  Let us know if you have any more questions.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 19 year old male from Minnesota. Around mid-october I noticed I had a small lump on my jaw on the left side, near the muscle. I saw the doctor and he said it was nothing to worry about, just a swollen lymph node reacting to fighting an infection, and that it could take weeks, or possible many months to go away.. However, since then It has gotten a little bigger-not much bigger, it is probaby about 5 mm in diameter compared to about 2 mm before? anyway.  Since mid-november, I have gotten numerous colds, a bacterial throat infection, and a weeke after that for about 4 days I had flu-like symptoms, it could have been the flu or just something with symptoms like it.  I now have had a cold for two weeks, and my throat has been sore in the same spot for about a week. Today i discovered that right under my chin is very tender, near the left side. I Guess my real question is, is the swollen lymph node causing my sickness possibly? If so, what would you advise? If not, what is a good way to get rid of the damn thing anyway? thanks, -Jake\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Most acute diarrhea (less than 14 days) is self limiting.  Replenishing fluids and electrolytes is mainstay of therapy.  Traditionally, we also suggest a BRAT diet until stool becomes more formed and regular.  BRAT = Bananas Rice Applesauce Toast  As far of cause of acute infectious diarrhea cases, in the developed world, the majority are caused by viruses and sometimes bacteria and least due to protozoa.    It is important to ascertain the quality and quantity (ie the severity) of the diarrhea to determine whether to test and treat the infection.  Is there mucus (white stringy material) or blood in the stool.  How often is the diarrhea.  How many days.    Also: is there any fever, any signs of dehydration.  What is the general health status of the sick person.  How old are they.   Answers to these questions will help our approach to treatment and if the patient needs hospitalization.  If symptoms worsen or do not improve or if any doubt about what to do, then see a physician for history and physical exam.    Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  Basically the infection is confined to the site, but since MRSA lives on our skin, and since you are infected with MRSA you'll have quite a challenge in keeping the infected site adequately covered as well as avoiding skin contact with anyone -- or any thing into which anyone might come in contact. This is especially touchy in the food service industry, so you probably should discuss this with  your employer in order to find out what sort of protection would be most appropriate for your particular job. You are probably actually more safe in bringing this to your employer's attention than if you conceal  it, since there are often accomodations that can be made for someone suffering from MRSA infection and employers in many industries (especially food and healthcare) are required to be educated about these matters.  I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck to you and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Our 25-year-old healthy son made an international flight from South Korea to Seattle on 12/11/08.  On arriving, he developed severe sore throat, fever, chills, malaise, and slept on a friend's couch for a few days and suffered through it (no treatment). He then flew on down to our home (parents) in Idaho on 12/14 and was complaining of continuing sore throat, but claiming to be okay.  He still slept quite a bit for a few days, which we attributed to jet lag and/or the illness.  He has not had cough or other symptoms, but spits out some mucus now and then and says he has a somewhat sore throat or dry throat, but claims to be fine. (He's not a complainer).  However, he and my husband and I made a trip to another state for Christmas, and one day after arrival, I became extremely, acutely ill with a severe sore throat, high fever, chills, coughing up large volumes of bloody mucus.  My throat was beefy red and I could barely take in liquids - no solids and could not even get out of bed to participate in any activities.  Also, my neck swelled with large glands all around the sides and front - just one big hard massive lymph gland conglomeration, it felt like.  On the 3rd day of this, my family took me to a minor emergency clinic.  We are self-pay and that is why a throat culture probably wasn't done, and there were a lot of patients and they were running them through as quickly as possible.  A PA came in and checked me.  He said \"your glands are monstrous\", which they were.  I asked about strep, and he said he didn't see any white pus pockets, but that it was likely bacterial and he put me on Ery-Tabs.  He said they were slightly expired, but had been stored properly and he felt were probably still effective.  I have now been on the Ery-Tabs for 4 days.  I am improved systemically.  Fevers and chills gone, I'm up and about the house.  The throat congestion has decreased, the lymph glands reducing significantly, although yesterday they were two large white patches on the back of the throat (first time I had actually looked except for on the first day) - only patch one today.  They almost resemble more of an aphthous ulcer than pus pocket, but am not sure.  My husband thought they looked more yellow than white.  The pain is still quite significant and at one point did remind of me of an apthous ulcer with a kind of stinging and radiation to the ear.  I have had to take some leftover Vicodin to alleviate the throat pain, and I think whether there is also a viral component, that this probably was indeed Strep and is slowly improving.  I said all that to lead up to my main question here.  I am not sure if my son had a Strep infection also, but I had no other sick contacts except him and came down with this.  Our symptoms were very  much alike, except I'm 53 and he's 25 and he pretty much recovered - or at least to his satisfaction.  Can the strep do damage to him if he had it and did not treat it?  He will be flying back to Korea on 1/8 (and 'lost to followup' by mom, LOL) and I am not sure whether to strongly urge him to be looked at.  If everyone had insurance and plenty of money, it wouldn't be so much an issue, but he also thinks he's fine and is invincible, so doesn't worry about anything.  I would like your advice on whether you think it is likely these illnesses were the same and whether he can go on and not worry about it or does strep even behave like this and are there consequences if not treated?  Thank you.  I am a medical transcriptionist/service owner for 20+ years, so if I sound medical, that's why.  Sorry for the length.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Of course this could have been the same infection but since it was not cultured there is no way to know for sure.  Untreated strep does have the potential to cause other problems - even scarlet fever which can do damage to the heart.  This is not common and definitely does not occur in every case of untreated strep infection.  Sometimes the body does heal itself even of bacterial infections without antibiotics though this would not be encouraged.  However, it sounds like your son has recovered and if his symptoms get worse he should see a doctor.  If he continues to gradually improve, chances are there is no long-term damage.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 22-year-old male with persistent eye pain and irritation (sometimes an \"eye headache\"-type pain, sometimes more of a \"foreign object\" feeling).  Always accompanied by dry eyes and photophobia, and occasionally also by redness.  This has existed for 4 months so far.  Pain/irritation fluctuates, but overall is the same or worse than when it began. Attempted treatment for allergic conjunctivitis and iritis with no improvement.  Currently taking steroid eye drops (for iritis, with no effect), artificial tears, and an antihistamine/redness-reliever.  (Would like to discontinue, as have been using for a long time and fear adverse medication effects such as conjunctivitis medicamentosum.) A female of same age and identical symptoms was diagnosed with and treated for yeast after 4 months (no yeast seen on any of my examinations, but my eyes are very sensitive and would react to even an infection that might not be easily visible).  She also received Restasis*, an eye drop which apparently quickly relieved all symptoms - but is contraindicated in the case of infection (contains cyclosporine).  Currently taking Diflucan (fluconazole), again without effect (but have only taken for 5 days).  What should I do?  * http://www.restasis.com/default.htm?x=Restasis\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, the history of irritation,forein body sensation, pain, photophobia ,etc. are more in favour of dry eyes due to any cause rather than infection and allergy. I think you should get the cause treated first for the dry eyes ,or rather avoid the triggering factors, whatever might be. Take some good tears supplements- may be preservative free . At the same time go for lot of water intake every day , lot more raw vegetables, fruits and avoid on oily, fatty foods, junks and fast foods. Protect your eyes when you go out, with goggles/glares. At the work place avoid continuous eye strain by giving occassional rest and  relax your eyes in between. Get your eyes tested for any power glasses prescription-Refractive error. Avoid too many drops instillation for a long time. I hope these suggetions might help you soon. Regards, Dr.Ramamurthy M G\n\n",

    "content": "I will keep this as brief as possible. I have been sick in some way for the last 3 months. It started with white patches on my left tonsil, sore throat, and a blister or two in my throat. ENT saw a cyst behind my left tonsil too(i can see it now as well). Anyways I took amox for awhile, keflex, then cipro and I never got better, just worse. I lost 25 pounds quick from diarrhea and then became constipated. Now I have the sore throat still & if i use a straw or drink a milkshake, my throat seems to swell. Anyways, went to the ER & my WBC was 15.6 one night. Thats when they gave me Cipro and Bentyl. i think all the antibiotics messed up my intestines, but the main thing is...immediately after the Er(next day)i noticed the big vein that goes down the middle of the penis(top side) was swollen from the base to almost near the head, with another smaller vein over it and going right. I also have discomfort in my left lower abdomen(about left side of bladder), left leg discomfort, and sometimes after I urinate(30 seconds later even) I have leakage(uncontrollable). The pain in the left lower ab or left bladder area feels like it goes from that area to the testicles. My parents are saying anxiety, but since the \"strep throat\"(ER did no throat culture and antibiotics didnt stop the throat problems) I have been sick in one way or another. I used to before this work out 2 hours a day/5 days a weeks and then some, now I can barely push out 25 pushups a day. Someone please help, i have no insurance and fear my health may be getting worse and my body is trying to tell me something. The thing i am most concerned with is the numbness/discomfort in the groin/penis/testicular area. left leg discomfort, and the swollen vein(it was not there before even though one doctor said i probably never noticed it, well its tripled in size and my wife noticed after i did). Please help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi.  I am an OT and had worked in a rehab inpatient hospital for 6 years.  During that time, I had multiple UTI's cultured as MRSA, throat bacterial infection cultured as MRSA.  I know all of us health care people probably are a carrier of MRSA.  About 6 years ago, I continued running low grade fevers, very tired, achey, etc.  After about a month, IM doc hospitilized me to figure out what was going on.  CT of chest revieled \"black stuff in my lungs\" originally thought by pulmonoligist as infection from bat feces.  Clot very easy.  Clotted 4 (DVT's and couple of small PE's) during this hosp stay while on hepirin drip.  Pulm did bronch wash and cultered sputum.  Came back MRSA positive.  In hospital for about 1 month with IV antibiotics.  (Had worked with patient about month prior with trach who died from MRSA in lungs).  Because I kept clotting, Inf Desiese doc decided more dangerous to stay in hosp to get vacn drip b/c clots.  I worked with a patient about 4 weeks ago who was positve MRSA in lungs.  Tested again yesterday and patient still positive, not colonized.  I have been running the low grade fevers, achey, tired, nauseated, etc. for about a week now.  Am I at higher risk of developing MRSA pnuemonia again since had it once and didn't go thru entire 3 mos vanc dirp?  Worth going to IM doc for bloodwork?  And if MRSA, would any results with bloodwork come back not WNL? Thank you so much for your help! Just a little nervous. Stacey\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Stacey -  As you say, we've all probably got it. MRSA acts like many viruses in the sense we can have it and not \"have\" it, but it puts us at a greater risk of having something sooner or later. Since pneumonia is peculiar in its tendency to \"save up\" irritants and infectious agents in the lower lobes of the lungs, having had this infection puts you at a statistically somewhat greater risk of getting it again, but you're equally likely to not have that. You could have it show up in some other body system, but the lungs are very popular with MRSA anyway. You also may never have another active infection. It's an extremely random problem.   I think it would be very wise indeed to be seen by an IM doctor for bloodwork, and if positive you will need to do the whole nine yards this time, especially because you put yourself, given your overall history, at risk of other, secondary problems if you wind up hospitalized for another MRSA infection. The more you can stay out of the hospital (at least in the role of patient) the better for you.   I hope this is helpful and that everything turns out fine. Please update us, and follow up with  us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "This is rather embarrassing, but after reading a few posts about this topic I just want to get feedback for my own situation.  I have a cyst on my butt and it's painful when I sit.  I tried putting hot compresses on it in order to have it drain but so far everything I've done has been unsuccessful.  So I took it upon myself to attempt to drain it.  I got a needle and boiled it in salt water for about 30 minutes.  I got a bowl of hot salt water and clean cloth and a cup of hydrogen peroxide.    I put a hot compress on it for about 5 minutes until I could feel the center of the pocket and I discovered that the cyst is in sections.  It's about the size of a quarter.  I pricked 3 holes in different areas of the cyst and drained what I could.  What drained appeared to be a clear, thick, bloody substance and I was surprised that I didn't see any pus.  It's still there, I don't believe I opened up all the sections to it, but I was tired of pricking myself.    After I was done I washed it with salt water, wiped it down with a cotton ball drenched in peroxide and applied an anti-biotic ointment to it and loosely put 2 band aids on it so that it could drain and that the band aids would catch most of the liquid.  I keep reading about the possibility of getting a staph infection from this and I want to know how much am I at risk?  Is there anything I should have done differently or could do?  I didn't want to go to the doctor because it's embarrassing and if I could drain it myself I don't see a point in letting a doctor doing it.  I think I was being careful.  Any thoughts?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Draining My Cyst",
    "content": "Hi there -  Well, for a do-it-yourself project I think you did it as well as anyone possibly could. Unfortunately, too many people find certain areas of the body embarassing (trust me, the doctor has seen everything and really doesn't care, just wants you to be OK), and sometimes this can result in infection or other damage. You did this, as I said, as well and carefully as a layman could, but it's not going to be complete, and so not likely to resolve on its own, although you may have gotten a little temporary relief from the draining you did. What came out, by the way, was a form of pus. Blood and lymph, the main constituents of pus, often come out clear and blood-streaked as you describe. That's often what you'll find in a cyst or abcess. There's more, though, and you're really better off letting a professional finish the job and make certain you don't have (or develop) a more severe infection. Having done  this yourself, even though you were very careful, still places you at greater risk of bacterial infection, simply because when you pierce an encapsulated infection, you turn loose bacteria that's walled off in there, and it may travel into the bloodstream, even though a lot of it drains out. Any that makes it into the bloodstream can grow and go systemic on  you. It only takes one or two surviving bacteria to start the cycle all over again. Also, you really need to follow up with antibiotics to kill them off.   I hope  you'll see a doctor about this, have it drained by someone actually trained to do this sort of thing, and  who can also prescribe an antibiotic to help keep infection from spreading, even  as it kills  the localized remainder.  By the way, cysts and abcesses in this area are extremely common,  and most doctors, in the course of treating abcesses alone, have usually seen many in this location -- not to mention a lot more peculiar  stuff you can't even imagine. It's part of being a doctor, nurse or medic.   Best of luck to you with this, and please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

Given your background and exposure to animals, this may well explain your recurrent symptoms. It would certainly be worth testing for it.

    "content": "Hello, Sorry for the delay in the reply. Definitely this is a serious situation and is known as septicemia. Septicemia is a life-threatening infection that arises when infectious organisms travel inside the blood to cause infections throughout the body. Different organs can be affected including the lungs, abdominal organs, and the kidney as well as central nervous system (meningitis).  Septicemia results in fever and chills. The bacteria or their toxins results in septic shock in the form of hypotension, rapid heart rate, pallor, respiratory difficulties, excess sweating and renal shutdown. Mortality rate may exceed 50% if no early diagnosis and prompt treatment of the patient occurs. Prompt initiation of antibiotic would minimize the mortality rate, the degree of organ damage and the presence of comorbidity would affect her prognosis.  Staphylococcus aureus (gram positive) is not the commonest organism responsible for septic shocks (gram negatives are more common), but is usually seen after interventional procedures.  Hospitalization, IV antibiotics and IV fluids are important parts of the treatment. Specific antibiotic administration would improve her prognosis and excluding affection of the heart is essential which would make prognosis worse.  Hope you find this information useful. Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

Took Musenex D and Tylenol, yet the headache pain persisted for 4 days.  Went to work after that and primary care doc took head xray and indicated no bleeding (am on Coumadin).  Following weekend ended in e room due to intense headache which Delantin (?) helped but pain persisted once returning home.  Yesterday finally had a good day for 10 hours then the pain returned in the same area.  Lymph nodes still swollen.  (For several days, my throat in the larnyx/thyroid area was numb and limited taste sensations.)  Today, after 2 weeks + the pain in head started back but now after Tylenol has subsided.  Am worried about the pain as it hurts, but am more concerned about the cause and the lymph glands.  By the way, they have been swollen but not lumpy.  Blood tests initially showed elevated white count, but last week all tests normal/negative.  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Sorry for the delay in replying and hope you are better now.  It would be more helpful if you can inform us about the site of these enlarged lymph nodes, their size and any associated symptoms like being painful, tender, or hot. It would be more helpful also if you can inform us about the current status of the thyroid functions and if you can give more details about the previous history of melanoma.  They could be reactionary lymph node to infection in the throat, sinuses and the upper respiratory tract. These enlarged nodes are painful, mobile, and soft to firm; they then regress in size once infection is controlled but remain palpable but less than 1 cm.   Increase in the leucocytes count may occur during infections as part of the body defense mechanism and the differential count is helpful. Lymph nodes that do not regress but increase on serial clinical examination are alarming and should be investigated properly. Biopsy may be done if the node is considerably large, hard, fixed or in constant growth.  Sinusitis causes sever headache that is mainly occur early in the morning and subsides during the day. But it is very important that your doctor excluded brain hemorrhage since you are on anticoagulant therapy.  I would be also helpful to check the ESR, LDH levels and do consider doing MRI is symptoms persist.  Follow up with your doctor is essential, update him with your symptoms and discuss with him your concerns. Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  There are some seeming inconsistencies in the story of your father's illness which, if cleared up, might be helpful. First, am I correct that your father had begun running a fairly high fever on 10/18,  then five days later underwent a colonoscopy? If so, what was the purpose of the colonoscopy? Was your father still running a fever when this procedure was performed?   More questions: was the vein between  the  liver and intestine where the clot was found identified? Also, could you please elaborate more on the location of the other clot \"above the heart\"? Where, exactly, was this clot located?   Has your father been tested for clotting disorders? Even if e. coli had been introduced during the colonoscopy (which would almost certainly have been a systemic infection caused by perforation -- unless the entire procedure was contaminated) the clots would seem to be a different matter.   There is much to be clarified here.  I understand the doctors probably haven't made things overly clear, but any additional information would help greatly in leading toward a potential explanation  for what's going on now.   Thanks in advance for any additional information you can provide.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you so much for attempting to form some sort of opinion.  You are correct that Papa began running a fever on 10/18, then five days later underwent a colonoscopy? It was routine preventative & prescheduled The fever was intermittent that week & they felt he was fine to have the procedure.   The vein between the liver intestine where the clot was found was not explained? We were told it was causing problems with the liver & intestine & could have caused the intestine to die had it gone unchecked. Less was explained with the other clot except to say it fed the brain and was somewhere above the heart.  We were told the e-coli probably caused the clotting as he has no history of clots.  He has never been tested for clotting disorders.  Other than high blood pressure (140/80 average) since he was a teen, and beginning medication for this within the past few years, he has never had any health problems.  I agree that there is much to be clarified here. Since being released on the new antibiotic IV he has improved and stopped running a fever but still very weak and tires easily. Tomorrow is his last IV & they intend on removing the PIC line next week. He wants to start golfing again to rebuild his stamina.   I will post some of the most recent test results in the next post shortly and maybe they can be helpful.  The doctors are really at a loss as are we. I'm afraid of a relapse if the cause can't be pinpointed.  La Vaun\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  This actually is quite helpful, and although the clotting needs further investigation, it would seem your father is doing pretty well now, and probably did suffer sepsis as a result of some unusual complication of the colonoscopy, which perhaps should have been postponed until he was completely well again. However, I know some centers will proceed if a febrile illness seems routine.   I'll contact you via email to see the test results and try to figure out if anything can be drawn from that. Thanks for all the followup and I'm glad your father is feeling as good as he is! Other than this new clotting tendency (which may have been a passing thing), it sounds as though he's definitely on the mend. It would be nice to know just what happened, however. Maybe those results will yield a clue or two.\n\n",

It was so difficult to see Papa so weak at Thanksgiving today. Usually he makes the gravy and carves the turkey but today he slept through that part.  I would be interested in knowing what you might make of some of the tests, they're greek to me.

    "content": "You're too kind. It's my pleasure to try and help.  After having sifted through all the test results and the findings during his visits, it seems your father may have had something going on in his liver -- some variety of cirrhotic disease caused by something, either chemical or perhaps bacterial -- which is resolving now, but has left him with diminished capacity to metabolize things properly (which would account for the weight loss and lingering weakness). There's nothing in any of the results to suggest cancer. There's a finding of what is probably chronic diverticulosis, and that may even have been where all this began, in a pouch in the intestine, where something may have found a temporary home. All his other blood work is normal or close, although his electrolytes were low during the peak of his illness, something curious but not entirely surprising.   The clot-as-scab explanation is a good one and makes sense.   He'll have to be followed now, mostly via blood tests, unless some new set of symptoms emerge (especially loss of appetite and, especially, any appearance of jaundice). There is one other test that could be done that might be telling, but it's fairly invasive and should be held off unless he fails to bounce back. The liver is the one organ that can, given proper circumstances, regenerate itself, although that doesn't happen overnight. Hopefully you'll see slow but steady improvement in him. I hope you'll stay in touch and keep us updated in any event.  I wish there was more to tell you, but this seems to have been something of an anomaly in your father's case, and hopefully one that will fade into the background now.   Best of luck to you and to your dad.\n\n",

The glands had actually increased and decreased within the year. They did some bloodwork on him, and found that he had at some point in time had mononucleosis, and that his blood platelette count was high. The doctor decided to send us to an ent, who suggested a lymphnode biopsy be done. Test results all came back normal fromt he biopsy. Two weeks after his surgery, his neck abcessed out, and we were back in the hospital. They opened up the wound, drained it, and kept him for 3 days on i.v. antibiotics. All was going well, but after about 4 weeks, the surgical area became red and swollen again. He was put on antibiotics again, and blood was taken again. This time the test is showing positive for salmonella 0 type vi, and his titer was 1/160. The ent does not know anything about salmonella, so he sent us to a pediatrician. He is suggesting that we see a infectious disease specialist. But, he said that you cannot trust blood culture for showing a true positive salmonella result. I am just a worried mom who needs some answers. My son does not have diarrhea, but is unusually tired, and has been for a long time. He also has frequent headaches, eye pains, and leg pains. We spend alot of time with a heating pad on his legs. Please let me know your opinion on the blood culture. Also, fyi, we are going to have a stool culture done. This is the only test that he has not had done yet. Thank You!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: positive blood culture for salmonella",
    "content": "Hello -  It would seem your son has had a particularly nasty bout with infectious mononucleosis with extensive lymph node involvement. Since mono can be rather insidious at times and missed entirely until some cause for blood work reveals the antibody, it can, in some cases, linger, as can the enlarged lymph nodes. This can, rarely, cause a compromise (temporary) of the patient's immune system, during which time opportunistic infections such as varieties of salmonella and other farily common and short-lived bacteria can establish themselves in the bloodstream, causing symptoms different from what one might ordinarily expect. This could be the case with your son. If this is the case, prolonged antibiotic therapy might be required,  but first the infection must be positively identified, so an infection disease specialist would certainly be appropriate for ruling this in or out. If the infection winds up being ruled out, then your son will require additional testing to determine what's going on with his lymph system, as there are a few disease processes which can also find a home there, and they are serious enough to warrant tests for problems other than simple infection. Hopefully the  salmonella will prove to be the culprit, as  it is easier to treat, although when systemic, as this instance would appear to be, it can be more stubborn than when confined to the digestive tract.  Please update us once your son has been studied further, or if you have any new information or questions. Best of luck to you and your son. Hopefully this will resolve soon.\n\n",

If the swelling and the right-sided symptoms don't resolve in a day or two (since you seem to have been doing everything according to the book) then you'll need to see a healthcare provider, who may want to test you for a bacterial infection and perhaps prescribe an antibiotic.

    "content": "Since Sept. 2004, I have been having abdominal pain (at the waist area), fevers that come and go (usually under 100) and night/day sweats.  I have had an abdominal ultrasound, 2 abdominal and pelvic CT scans (both showed mesenteric adenopathy with \"extensive\" lymph gland enlagement), endoscopy, colonoscopy, etc.  The gastroenterologist sent me to the oncologist after the first CT scan.  He did not think I had lymphoma but put me through a number of blood tests.  When I tested positive for antimitochondrial antibodies, he called in another gastroenterologist and an infectious disease specialist and I was hospitalized with a tentative diagnosis of primary bilious cirrhosis.  After many more blood tests, another CT scan, a gallian scan,, etc. the gastroenterologist was confused since my liver function was normal.  So it was decided that I should have an abdominal lymph and liver biopsy.  This was done and I have a 10 1/2 abdominal scar to prove it.  The good news, no lymphoma or cirrhosis.  The bad news, after 6 weeks, the biopsies did not grow anything.  So we are back to square one with my having daily abdominal pain, intermittent fevers and night/day sweats.  The infectious disease specialist is at a loss and now says I need another CT scan in a month and to see him in 2 months.  I STILL HAVE DAILY PAIN AND WOULD TAKE ANY DIAGNOSIS THAT HAS A NAME AND TREATMENT!!!!!  My husband, co-workers and I think I should be getting another opinion but I don't even know what kind of Dr. to go to.  I just don't know what to do and am concerned with being on pain medication forever.  HELP!!!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Have you been investigated for Intestinal Tuberculosis? Have you had a radiological survey of the lungs? Have you experienced any weight loss? Any HIV test done? What was your Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Tuberculosis is primarily a lung infection, but it can infect other areas of the body such as the intestine. Intestinal tuberculosis may result as a complication of lung disease, or be caused by the ingestion of the  bacteria in unpasteurized milk.  Clinical features of intestinal tuberculosis include chronic abdominal pain, low-grade fever, night sweats, weight loss, obstructive symptoms, diarrhoea, and enlarged abdominal lymph nodes. It appears that you have four of these features, but that does not necessarily mean that you have the disease. It is not always possible to obtain bacteriological confirmation of the disease by culture., but detection of the tubercle bacilli in biopsy specimens by a method known as PCR is now the most sensitive diagnostic procedure.  I would advise you to go back to your Infectious Diseases specialist to be investigated along these lines, if not previously done.   I hope this information has been helpful, and thank you for visiting our website.   Dr Anthony Solomon MB BS DTM&H DIP.VEN FRSM Consultant Physician, Tropical & Genitourinary Medicine\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for responding.  Yes, while I was in the hospital, they did a skin TB test and the cultures did not grow anything. Also, while in the hospital (16 days - 7 days before surgery and 9 days after), they took blood several times a day and ran tests like crazy.  Before I went into the hospital, there were stool samples/testing done as well.  There were biopsies done with the endoscopy and colonoscopy as well.  The oncologist, gastroenterologist took lots of blood as well.  If the Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate is a standard sort of test, I would suspect mine came back within the normal range.  The only blood tests that came back abnormal were the antimitchondrial antibody and M2 antibody tests.    I have lost about 45 lb. since last summer and, at this point, I don't eat much because of the pain.   All of the time, I have this aching pain but it intensifies periodically every day.  I thought that, somehow, it was tied to how much I ate and how my stomach enlarged.  Like it was pressing on something.  I tested that theory and it doesn't always work that way.  However, I am afraid to eat too much - eat little bits a couple times a day.   I did have a chest CT scan in December that was negative/normal.  I believe an HIV test was done at some point along the way but there really isn't any way I could have HIV.  The gastroenterologist and the infectious disease Drs. were speculating on TB but they don't seem to think it's a possibility now.  I will ask about the PCR test.    Do you additional suggestions?  Does it make any sense to get another Dr. involved?  I am just so frustrated.  MJo\n\n",

She said they do them for HIV and for hepatitis.  I do have an appointment with another infectious disease Dr. on the 22nd of March and am having another CT scan on the 10th of March.  I do not know what, if any, subspecialty this new Dr. has.   On another note, I have a friend whose cousin is a nurse for an oncologist in Boston.  She has talked to the oncologist and given him the information I provided here.  His comment was  that it was \"puzzling\" and he wanted to know if I had been sent to a rheumotolgist and if I had a PET scan.  The oncologist I had seen spoke to a rheumotologist to see what blood tests he would want since it is very difficult to get an appointment with a rheumotologist here.  It was in those blood tests that the antimitochondrial antibody positive showed up.  He also said that he would be willing to give a second opinion and that I should have the lab results and slide pictures sent up to him.  I will probably do that after I see my first infectious disease Dr. in April.  I will give the information you have provided to the Dr. I am seeing on the 22nd (for the second opinion) but am not hopeful that he will provide much.  I would really appreciate it if you could give me some additional questions I should ask and/or tests I should ask for.  Thank you so much for your input and caring.  MJo\n\n",

He had most of the records from my hospitalization and said that I tested borderline for histoplasmosis.  He also said that it is very difficult to grow/identify in a culture.  So he gave me a prescription for it.  He also said that the last thing he would try would be to treat me for TB.  He said that is because I am not in a high-risk group for TB and that TB does not always grow in the culture which is what you already told me.  I am, for the moment, going to stick with this Dr. and cancel the appt. with the original.  He also said that I should have the CT. scan (day after tomorrow) to see if the lymph nodes are enlarging, shrinking or staying the same.    I looked at the histoplasmosis stuff on the web and don't think I have that but at least this Dr. is doing something.  Will keep you posted.  Thanks again. MJo\n\n",

However, almost immediately, I started experiencing pain in both shoulders and both knees.  This joint pain has been increasing and is severely impacting my sleeping (can't get comfortable).  My infectious disease Dr. gave me a prescription for Mobic to be taken for arthritis pain.  I don't think I have arthritis since it is always both shoulders, knees, hips, elbows, wrists, etc.  I am taking Rifampin, Isonazaid, vitamin B6, Uniretic, and Hydrocodone for pain as needed.  Since you hit it straight on with the TB diagnosis, do you have any ideas about this?  According to what I've read, the joint and bone pain could be caused by the Rifampin but it didn't say what could be done about it.  Thanks, MJo\n\n",

    "title": "ANTI-TUBERCULOUS TREATMENT",
    "content": "Tuberculosis is treated in two phases - an initial phase using at least 3 antituberculous drugs and a continuation phase   using two antituberculous drugs in fully sensitive cases. The use of at least 3 drugs in the initial phase is to reduce the bacterial population as rapidly as possible and to prevent the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria. The treatment of choice for the initial phase is the daily use of rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide (preferably given as 3 medicines in a combination tablet) and ethambutol for 2 months. After the initial phase, treatment is continued for a further 4 months with rifampicin and isoniazid, preferably given as two medicines in a combination tablet.  I note from your prescription that you have been receiving only two antituberculous drugs right from start of treatment. The drug \"Uniretic\" which you are prescribed is a blood pressure medication - are you hypertensive? Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) is prescribed to prevent the common side-effect of peripheral neuropathy associated with isoniazid.    The commonest side-effects of rifampicin are gastrointestinal disorders and liver toxicity. Bone pain, muscular weakness and muscle pain are reported but are less common. I am more concerned that you did not start treatment correctly for the first two months, unless this was an error in your post. For the pain, I would suggest simple analgesics, but if unbearable, see a rheumatologist for an opinion. I am delighted that  you are experiencing an improvement in your condition, and that at The Doctor's Lounge we can sometimes help to suggest a diagnosis for the patient without physical examination.

    "content": "Well, the initial test at the California lab was positive for Crohn's but, when they did the more discrete test, it wasn't.  The GI Dr. said that \"before we go half way across the country\" he and the Infectious disease Dr. would \"reluctantly\" put me on Prednisone.  After being on it for 2 weeks, on the 4th of July, I went into the hospital with several partial small bowel blockages.  They called in the surgeon but she thought that it was due to inflamation and didn't want to slice and dice.  So they kept me for 4 days with lots of antibiotic and pain medication.  They did the upper GI barium thing at 3 days and the small intestine was normal.  I was sent home the next day and have another colonoscopy (going to get a small intestine biopsy from there).  After that, the GI Dr. said that he may have the surgeon go in and look around.  After that, it will be going to Mayo for some new kind of scoping with balloons.  Since I came home from the hospital last Saturday, I've lost an additional 8 pounds and seem to be running a constant 99.5 or so fever.  The GI Dr. said that I will need to do something if it gets over 100.  Haven't had any breakthrough pain for a couple days.  I'm on 90 mg oxycontin (30 mg 3 times a day) and have hydrocodone for breakthrough.  I'm on Flagyl and some other antibiotic.  Still on 40 mg of Prednisone a day for another 10 days and then I start dropping it by 5mg a week.  The GI Dr. said that he has a \"working\" diagnose if Crohn's but really isn't sure.  MJo\n\n",

The surgeon wanted to remove a portion of my small intestine at the same time but, since I'd been on the table so long by that time, he didn't.  I just got the staples out today.  I am moving to Texas in a month and the surgeon said that I should find a good GI as soon as I get there.  He believes that I have crohns disease and have had it for some time.  The GI Dr. doesn't really know what to think.  Suggestions/ideas?  Thanks, MJo\n\n",

    "title": "Should I go to E.R.for MRSA testing?",
    "content": "I am 34 year old female and had total thyroidectomy July 15th. Several days later I had to go to hospital for I.V. antibiotics because my incision was severely infected (swollen, bright red and oozing puss). I do not know if they tested me for MRSA, I would have to go to medical records tomorrow and find out. The incision got better but shortly after, about a week, if that,  I started to have a SEVERE, HORRIBLE yeast infection that lasted over 2 months (after 4 rounds of antibiotics it has finally eased up in the past couple of days, The itching at times was literally unbearable) Over the past 3-4 weeks I have had 6-8 \"boils\" appear on both my sides (under arm on side of chest), on both legs and on my stomach. All of them have seemed like pimples to begin with but last longer and then bruise once they are popped or have drained. The one on my stomach has filled with puss every day or so since it appeared about 2 weeks ago and continues to be clearly visible. Over the past couple of weeks I have been having sudden lower back pain when I do simple things such as sweeping the floor. I have had excessive facial sweating as well, to the point where I carry a paper towel if I am going someplace like church to ease the embarrassment and discomfort. The sweating has eased up but comes and goes. Most recently, over the past 2 weeks I have had SEVERE fatigue, not functioning AT ALL like normal. 6 days ago I started to have respiratory symptoms, coughing and congestion and my voice is very raspy. I went to doctor today and my doctor non-chalantly mentioned MRSA, she took a swab and I guess the results will be back in 2 days. She started me on Levaquin as well. My question is- should I go to E.R. and be tested for MRSA or just wait for the 2 days? I've read so many horrible things about it, I don't want to take chances, but I also don't want to over-react. Your opinion is greatly appreciated. Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Greeting jodannymt:  The sample (swab) your doctor took will be sent to a lab to be cultured.  The results take a couple of days because it has to be allowed time to grow and develop and then be tested for resistance to commonly used antibiotics.  Your doctor will receive a report from the lab that will tell them whether the antibiotic you are currently taking will clear up the problem.  You should always make your doctor aware of any new or worsening symptoms.  Make a list and bring it with you to your next appointment and mark them off when they are addressed so you know you haven't missed anything.  (it is a good idea to let the scheduler know that you have multiple issues to discuss so they can allow enough time to address them at your visit).  Unfortunately going to the ER will not speed up the process.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I agree with Shelly, your doctor will receive the results of the culture and sensitivity in few days. This will allow selection of the proper antibiotic that hopefully will eradicate the infection.  And as Shelly said which is actually a very good idea, you better make a list of concerns and address them with your doctor at your next appointment.  One of these concerns you should focus on is your latest complaint of excess sweating, generalized weakness, cough and respiratory problems. Your doctor might also recommend a blood culture to make sure that bacteria did not enter into the blood which is a serious condition and should be managed promptly.   She may also recommend new CBC, chest X-ray and Echocardiography based on the results of clinical examination and through history. You better be checked also for your thyroid function and blood sugar level. If the back pain persists a plain X-ray on the lumbosacral region will be helpful.  It is possible that you have a mixed infection (different types of organisms) or a resistant type of organism (e.g. MRSA), so your doctor may also consider infectious diseases consultant referral.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Normal values for while blood cell and its elements in adult are:  White blood cells :4,500-10,000 /mcl. Neutrophils: 40% to 60%  Lymphocytes: 20% to 40%  Monocytes: 2% to 8%  Eosinophils: 1% to 4%  Basophils: 0.5% to 1%  Band: 0% to 3%   So, your total count and the neutophil count are within the normal range. You have mild lymphocytosis which can be seen in many conditions of chronic disease like arthritis and in infections.   Some medications may also cause lymphocytosis and Prempro (as well as other estrogen plus progestin therapy) is one of them although rarely reported to do so.  In adults, absolute lymphocytosis is defined as an absolute lymphocyte count is greater than 4000/mcl, so by definition your condition is not alarming as your doctor told you.  Follow up with your doctor is essential to exclude blood diseases. I hope you are also aware by the benefits and the risks of long term hormone replacement therapies. Try to always discus with your doctor your best treatment alternatives and your best breast cancer screening program.  Hope you find this information useful. Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: swollen nodes in groin area",
    "content": "Hello,  These are probably lymph nodes (inguinal) as they occur in a lymph node region, however this must be confirmed by your physician. The inguinal lymph nodes are situated in the crease between the leg and pelvis.  They drain the vulva, vagina, perineum, gluteal region, lower abdominal wall, and lower anal canal.   Common causes of enlargement include infections of the leg or foot, STDs (eg, herpes simplex virus, gonococcal infection), lymphoma, and pelvic malignancy.  Nodes are generally considered to be normal if they are up to 1 cm in diameter; but inguinal nodes are generally considered abnormal when they are larger than 1.5 cm .  I would first want to exclude malignancy based on the description you provided about these swelling, your general symptoms and your past medical history (cancer in the cervix).  Some medications like Lamictal may cause lymphadenopathy that is usually generalized. Other causes like infections, autoimmune diseases should be excluded too.  I would also advise you to contact your doctor for direct clinical examination and investigations.  Hope you find this information useful.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  There are a number of potential causes of this symptom. Usually there is some fever or at least local heat at the affected joints. This seems to be of fairly sudden onset, so is not likely arthritis, but could be rheumatic fever -- which doesn't always present with a noticeable fever, although the swollen joints may be warm to the touch.   Septic arthritis is another possibility, but is usually confined to one joint and generally occurs in older patients. Still, it is possible.   Regardless of the absence of fever or other constitutional symptoms, this warrants an urgent visit to a doctor or acute care facility to be diagnosed and treated. It's impossible to make a decent guess without a face-to-face encounter, bloodwork,  etc.,  and these should be done as soon as possible.   Please keep us updated regarding this. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Abdominal pain, headache chills joint soreness after travel",
    "content": "Please look at this.  I am receiving care, but am getting worse.  At this point, I am concerned and would appreciate any suggestions and guidance.  Here is a detailed look at what I am experiencing:  Age: 27 Sex: Male Ethnicity: White/Caucasian Height: 5\u20197\u201d Weight: 150lbs. Symptoms began: 8/29/2008 General health prior: good  Symptoms (in order of discomfort):  Muscle Pain: Hips, Hip Flexors, Thighs, Groin, Hamstring, Buttocks, Knees, Calves sometimes, shoulders, biceps.  All pain fluctuates in intensity.  Worst pain is in right hip and leg and then the shoulders.  Pain is generally dull and achy like the muscle is weak and has been worked out hard.  It is like the sensation of having lactic acid built-up in muscles.  Some of the muscles are tender to pressure, especially in right leg and hip.  Pain is present at all times, but pain is definitely increased by motion.  Going uphill or climbing stairs is difficult.   Sometimes pain can be sharp.  Abdominal Pain:  Originally was specifically in lower right abdomen, but has spread to both sides.  Pain is still worse in right side.  Pain is present at all times, made slightly worse by movement.  Right side is very tender.  Worst tenderness is in lower right and if you push up under the ribs at all.  Pain is often dull and achy, but also often sharp specifically on right side.  Fatigue: Bad.  I tire easily to small amounts of exercise and am tired all day.  If I exert myself much, symptoms of pain and headache will flare noticeable, with headache pounding.    Nausea:  Present at all times.  It varies in intensity.  It can be made worse by pushing on abdomen or by quick movements, but not much.  No correlation to when I eat.  Headache:  Present all day everyday.  Often worse in the mornings and evenings.  Varies in intensity.  Chills:  Often get sensation of being very cold, with hands actually getting cold and sometimes face becomes flush and warm to touch.  Temperature measured always between 97-100 degrees.    Joint Pain:  I have had joint pain come and go.  For sort periods, whatever joint I use (knuckles, elbows knees etc etc) will become soar.  Has happened a couple times, lasting for a couple days.    Various other stuff:  I have had sharp pains randomly in other areas.  I have had a soar throat twice each time for one day. Etc\u2026   Important history:  Traveled just before falling ill to symptoms.  From June 17th to Aug 24th, my wife and I traveled around the world.  In order we went to China, India, Thailand, Egypt, Spain, Portugal, Brazil, Peru, home to US.  My wife did not get sick.  During the trip, I only had normal food issues, especially in India.   Traveled last summer to East Africa, where I was diagnosed with and treated for malaria in Tansania, specifically Plasmodium Falcipirum.  First treatment didn\u2019t fully kill it with symptoms returning when medicine finished.  Second treatment worked with no symptoms afterwards and a clean bill of health when I returned home.  When I was born I had a heart murmur, but it hasn\u2019t been detected since I was 8.  Lab Results:  I have included all my results below, but the only interesting results were more recently with CPK noticeably high and ESR slightly high.  Also, we noticed that my AST doubled recently.  Also, my indirect billirubin is always slightly high.  In addition to what is shown below I have had 2 CT scans of my abdomen, an ultrasound of my abdomen and a CT scan of my head.  I have also had a upper GI and small bowel series of x-rays taken as well as a colonoscopy.  All of these came back normal.  I have also taken a mental test, the Shidler test (sp) and I was found to be normal.  No history of depression or other mental illnesses.  I was stress for a few days when I returned home though.

In any event, if the boil doesn't improve beyond this point without the cream, I wouldn't use it any longer without first consulting a doctor, who may tell you to continue it, or may want to take a different approach to treatment.  I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

The fever comes back at specific times of the day, around 2-3 am and during the afternoon and then dies down around 7 am or early afternoon. A blood test has been conducted and platelet count is within normal range, so dengue has been eliminated. (However, is it too early to detect for dengue?). He's also had stool test and urinalysis and all came out normal as well.   This is what he feels: Headaches throughout the day Swollen lymph nodes (next to the ear and one more somewhere on the leg) fluctuating fever expectorating clear gelatinous phlegm (but not coughing) swollen/puffy eyes  a doctor has come to visit and gave him augmentin because she says it could be an infection. however, the fever has still been following its regular \" schedule\". is it too soon to gauge the effects of augmentin?   what could be the possible cause and what should we do in the meantime?  thank you very much for your help!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Fluctuating fever for 5 days, all tests negative",
    "content": "Hello -  This sounds like a fairly typical viral  infection that's found a home in the upper respiratory tract. The thick, tenacious mucous being brought up is usually an exudate that forms in the back of the pharynx, and so long as a bacterial superinfection doesn't develop this should run its natural course in around a week's time. The Augmentin should prevent or knock down  any opportunistic bacterial infection, but the viral  infection, if that's what it is (certainly sounds like  it) will simply have to run its course, as there is  very little that can be done to resolve viral things.   Dengue fever would  be accompanied by a rash and excruciating joint pain (this the nickname \"bonecrusher disease\"). This doesn't sound like that, at least so far, although it could be a mild case. In any event dengue fever usually runs a course of about seven days anyway. It is usually diagnosed based on the clinical picture (high fever, severe headache, the characteristic joint pains, disabling dizziness, etc., plus a postive \"tourniquet test\", in which a constricting band is applied to an extremity and this causes spontaneous bleeding or brusing in the extremity, and via lab tests yielding a very high red cell count. This doesn't seem to be the case either.  Most any fever, bacterial or viral, tends  to fluctuate regularly, peaking in the afternoon and again during the night. This is classic for most any febrile disease.  Hopefully by now your friend has recovered or is at least feeling better. I hope this is  helpful to you.\n\n",

Generally speaking mono is diagnosed by a positive monospot test. Did your physician also perform an Epstein Barr titer? Are you continuing to experience symptoms and were additional lab diagnostics along with a physicial evaluation completed? If not I would encourage you to contact your primary care provider. Best wishes. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "title": "Inguinal Lymph Node Swelling Cause-Worried!",
    "content": "Hello,  I am a 34 year old female.  Two days ago I discovered that one lymph node along lower panty line on left side was slightly swollen and a bit tender when prodded.  Only seems a little sore when poked.  I do know that the glands in this area are affected by the feet, legs, genital areas, and gluteal areas.  About three weeks ago, I sustained a large, deep bruise (diameter 3 inches) above my left knee on my lower inner thigh while moving some furniture.  It cleared up just a few days ago after suffusing with green, purple, blue and yellow over the three week span.  Around the same time, I did have a fire ant bite on the left foot which developed a green, pus-filled balloon over it before scarring over.  I seem to remember also nicking the skin behind my left knee while shaving a week ago, though if I did so, it has healed since then.  I currently have one small bruise below my knee on the left leg which is healing.  My question is, which of these factors could have caused the swelling, how concerned should I be about the swelling, and how long till it goes away?  I confess that I prodded and poked the gland a good deal the first day I found it, but am trying to leave it alone now.  I have my annual Well Woman exam already scheduled for the first of October.  Sounds foolish, but I am scared about the swelling being something scary, as CANINE lymphoma was found in my mother's PET DOG by swollen glands in the groin area.  Thank you for your advice.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -   You certainly have had enough traumas on the left lower extremity prior to the swollen gland! It's possible that one of those may have caused the swelling (most likely the fire ant bite reaction), but equally possible it was none of those things and could be something unrelated (and probably benign), up to and including as simple as an ingrown folicle right near the site of the swelling.   Of course it's impossible to know with any certainty, from a distance, what's causing this, but it is a fairly common occurrence, usually medically unimportant. That's not going to put your mind at ease, but it is an attempt to do that. If the swelling is due to any one or more of the things that have happened between your hip and foot recently, it will certainly resolve on its own. If it's due to something trivial such as that possible ingrown follicle, treatment would be simple. The likelihood of it being anything serious is pretty small, but of course not impossible.  If I were the type to bet, I'd put my money on the fire ant bite as the cause of this, since it  is the nearest easily palpable adjacent site, but you would be wise to have the site checked anyway, and since you do have an appointment already, the timing is pretty good. It may well be gone by then, which would be a good thing, but still worth mentioning.   I wish I could give you something more definite, but you've already taken note of it, decided to try and not prod it too much, and have the appointment coming up. You're doing all the right things. Try to think along statistical lines, which tells us the greatest odds are it's either a) nothing or b) a result of the fire ant bite. It's difficult to not worry, so I'm not even going to suggest that specifically.   Please do let us know what you learn, however, and feel free to follow up as needed, especially if anything changes in the interim.\n\n",

I had noticed it going down in size myself over the last few weeks.  She said that with leg shaving, stubbing of toes, and other ordinary activities it is quite normal to be able to feel the nodes in this area, and that they are only of concern if they continue to enlarge or remain very hard.  I'm glad that it was nothing to be worried about.  Your reply to the post really helped me in the interim.  Thank you again.  I feel kind of foolish for having been so stressed about it.

I have had test on my thyroid functions, diabetes, anemia, blood count, chest x-rays, hiv (2 test: 1 in May08, 1 in August 08), stds (several times since May 08, all came back negative), you name it. Everything has come back negative. My main symptoms consist of fatigue (just feeling tired, not wanting to get up, etc). I have been under some stress but it started in July 2008-August 2008. I went to an ENTs doc because I have had problems with my tonsils which caused me to have night sweats back in Nov 07-Jan 08 . The doc gave me all these antibiotics but my ENTs doc feels i need to get my tonsils removed. About 2-3 weeks ago, I had some white and red spots on the roof of my mouth. The ENTs doc said it wasn't strep or thrush (both test came back negative).Ever since May  I have never had a temperature. Usually just a sub temperature that fluctuates between 97-96.8 usually averaging 97.4-98.2. I am so lost, I just want to feel better.   Here all my symptoms since May 2008: Fatigue- no matter if i get 6-8 hours of sleep Feeling Drained with Minimal activity Pain & Draining feeling Behind My Ear Recurrent vaginal infections (bv & yeast since April 2008) I used to have an IUD (Mirena), but it was removed in August 2008  Headaches Dizziness Lightheaded Sometimes feeling like I'm going to pass out Pain nodules in neck Frequent Bowl Movements (not Diarrhea)  Increased and Decreased Hunger Infrequent Chest Pain Irritable  Infrequent pain in arms and legs Hot flashes (with no temp) and Sweating Felling Cold  Sometimes I feel like I have gone crazy because every doctor tells me that I'm fine, but I don't feel fine.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  It sounds as though you could have some sort of viral infection like Epstein-Barr, although I would assume by now you'd have been tested for that. There are many features of your list of symptoms which would fit with that or something similar. It is of course difficult to make an educated guess when all the tests that have been done have come back negative. Still, I'm wondering about E-B and mono as well as other, similar viral diseases.   If you've had these ruled out as well, the only thing I can suggest to you (aside from finding another doctor) is to make sure your nutrition is very good, using vitamin supplements if necessary to be sure you're getting all the nutrients you need. Sometimes this can make an overall difference in how one feels especially when dealing with a chronic illness.  I'd also give some thought to seeing a different doctor.   Hope this is helpful to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi -  Mono, Epstein-Barr virus and several other related viral diseases, can be diagnosed only by process of elimination. Many from this family have very similar symptoms, and the greater part of the treatment is rest and proper nutrition. Still, it's much more helpful to know exactly what's going on.   Mono symtoms can last anywhere from a few weeks to the better part of a year, with the average being about three weeks with another three weeks of gradually- reduced fatigue. Some people feel exhausted chronically for months, however.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi again -  This is all consistent with mono. The enlarged glands will sometimes stay bigger than they were for some time after you're feeling normal again. I'd still encourage you to be tested for mono and if that comes up negative, then for other, related viral diseases, just so you can know what to expect. Also, with mono the spleen is sometimes quite enlarged for a while, which is actually potentially dangerous and all contact sports and general horsing around should be avoided. This is another good reason for a thorough medical exam, as the doctor can feel the spleen for enlargement. (It eventually corrects, like the glands, but during the acute phase it can be very fragile and a ruptured spleen is a life-threatening emergency better avoided). Rest, eat well, treat the symptoms.\n\n",

You can see them by just looking at me, you have to get up really close on my lip. I put some hydrocortozone ointment my lips. The red one seems to have gotten alot better with the hydroctozone.  What could it be, is it contagious?  Also, my fatigue has gotten alot better, but now I am getting symptoms of the common cold  for a little over a week(headache, sneezing, body temp 98.9, sore tonsils, scratchy throat, post nasal drop, yellowish mucus).

    "content": "Hi -  The bumps on your lip sound like cold sores, which can frequently show up during a period of lowered immunity (as with a long-term viral infection). These would probably respond to hydrocortisone, too, although it's not the usual treatment for them. If these are cold sores (herpes simplex type I) they definitely can be transmitted via direct contact.   The fact your fatigue is getting better probably means the virus is starting to die off, but your immune system has been suppressed for a while (in other words you've become \"run down\") so have now likely picked up some more common virus like the common cold. You may have developed a bacterial superinfection (not a super infection, but a bacterial infection on top of the viral one -- not nearly as bad as it sounds). It would appear to be in your sinuses. You probably should be on an antibiotic to knock this down, since your immune system isn't ready to handle something like this quite yet. This is a very common occurrence even when getting over mono or related viral illnesses. Check with your doctor if it gets worse or doesn't resolve in a few days.   I'm glad to hear you're feeling better overall, but you'll really need to be careful to avoid infections for a while,  til your body is back up to its normal fighting strength.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  The potential for bacterial urinary tract infections, given the unique circumstances of this case, are virtually endless. You need to see a medical provider, explain what happened, and have the appropriate cultures taken to make sure you are give an appropriate antibiotic for the infection  you almost certainly have. Where exactly it is lodged is impossible to say, but it is certainly genitourinary.   Advice for future reference: if you insist on using mind-altering substances, a) have someone with you to function as a \"guide\" and also to protect you from doing things which may cause you to harm yourself or others, and b) lock the dog up somewhere away from your reach. This will make self-inflicted infections  and injuries less likely and the dog will probably be grateful as well.   Best of luck to you.\n\n",

You probably should be seen again and a different one tried instead, since the longer this remains infected the greater the risk of scarring  or permanent damage. You might have to consider having the piercing removed if the problem doesn't resolve, since sometimes certain metals are simply rejected by the body chemistry of certain people. Hopefully it will clear up with proper treatment. Meanwhile,  flush the area with warm water and pat dry with a soft cloth as often as practical. Meanwhile plan to see the doctor again and see if a change of antibiotic might be in  order.  Best of luck to you.\n\n",

About 15% of women will still have some discharge at six weeks postpartum.  Your obstetrician will be able to confirm this is the case and check for infections, etc. that can cause vaginal discharge.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I woke up last night experiencing a mild case of night sweats. It was not the \"drenching\" kind that some people talk about but apparently it was enough to wake me up. Immediately upon waking up I took my temp with an oral thermometer which indicated 96.1 (obviously much lower than normal). Despite having a low temperature, I felt warm so I proceeded to turn on a fan and remove a layer of covers.  I then went back to sleep but did not sleep well due to being worried. This particular episode occurred approximately 3 hours after initially going to sleep. This marks the third time that I have had this happen in the past 10-12 days.  Please note that I came down with flu-like symptoms 2 weeks ago. I had one episode of drenching night sweats while being sick (which I'm assuming is normal for any viral infection inducing a fever). Since then, I feel like I have recovered from being sick but have had 3 episodes of these mild night sweats accompanied with a lower-than-normal body temperature. Any idea what is going on here? Any insight would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Dnflgmn,  There is no known medication or vaccine for Leishmaniasis so prevention is important.  Treatments do exist if infection occurs but it is obviously best to avoid the infection in the first place.  Prevention basically centers around avoiding bites from the sand fly.  This can be done by limiting exposure though wearing long sleeve clothing, using DEET containing bug repellants and trying to stay in areas that have been screened from insects.  Clothing can be treated with permethrin (an insecticide).  Sand flies are very small so the screening needs to be smaller than typical bug netting.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Geriatric headache/fever/chills",
    "content": "Hello, I can't guess what is causing his symptoms, but this fever is considered \"low grade\" and that usually means it is caused by either a virus or some other temperature regulating problem, perhaps endocrine system related.  But, it usually does not mean serious infection, as with bacteria, where treatment with antibiotics would be indicated.  This is probably why the doctor says it is nothing to worry about.  If it is viral, the body's own immune system must fight it and usually it does.  In older adults, the immune system is not as efficient as in a young person so he may be more prone to these little viral infections and they last longer in him than they would for you.  There are thousands of viruses that we encounter all the time.  However, if the fever gets high (greater than 38.9 degrees C) or other symptoms such as respiratory distress are present, there is the possibility that a secondary infection has occurred while his immune system was fighting the virus, and he should see a doctor.  This does not mean the doctor can prevent the next one (actually cure the ongoing episodes); it just may be needed for a particular incident.  It is always safe to check things out in the elderly since their health can be fragile.  Even if it turns out to be the same as before, you know you have checked for strep or pneumonia, etc.    I guess what I am saying is that the symptoms he is having may just be his response to the stress of a virus, even though it could be a different bug each time.  Since the Tylenol is helping the symptoms, there is no harm in doing that.  I don't think this is some kind of syndrome; just unique events that happen at times.  Do stay in touch with his doctor to monitor his health regularly.  Thank you for your concern for your grandfather.  Best wishes\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Football Injury,  It may be that the scrape is simply dirty.  Dirt can inhibit proper healing.  In this case, washing it well with soap and water 1-2 times per day will promote healing.  If it truly is infected it will likely need some antibiotics to help clear the infection and allow it to heal properly.  Indicators of infection include tenderness, redness that will likely be expanding out some, and some drainage from the site.   If you believe your skin is infected I would recommend you see your doctor to have this evaluated and see if antibiotics are needed.  Best wishes.\n\n",

It didnt hurt the first day (only when pressed) but began to ache about two days ago. Yesterday I found a swollen lymph node on my neck above my clavicle bone so I realized the bump on my head was also a swollen lymph node.Today I found another swollen lymph node behind my ear, this one is painful and red.All lymph nodes are pretty big and remain the same size. My skin on my left arm is very sensitive to touch and if touched it hurts. Is it normal for swollen lymoh nodes to spread this fast? I have been pretty healthy otherwise. The skin on my legs have been itchy for a  bit but I just assumed it was dry skin. About a week ago in the shower my skin was so itchy around my knees and lower thighs that I had a small blood blister from the itching. I have been moisturizing every day though. Also, recently I have been getting sharp random pains in my armpits but they go away after a few seconds. Just thought that was weird. I am not worried about my skin cause its winter and it gets very dry, it just a symptom i thought i should include. Should I be worried? What could this be?\n\n",

Some infections (such as with ebstein barr virus) can make lymph nodes become quite large and tender.  Lymph nodes can also become secondarily infected with a bacteria so if you have a node that is quite painful I would recommend you have your doctor take a look at it to see if you may need antibiotics.  If these nodes continue to enlarge or you notice that you are continuing to have more and more over the next few days I would recommend you see your doctor.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Typical infections caused by these two strains of MRSA are the same and include spontaneous skin infections.  The main difference between the two strains is their antibiotic resistance pattern.  Hospital acquired MRSA is typically slightly more resistant to antibiotics than is community acquired MRSA.    MRSA can colonized the skin and may or may not be present for life.  If infections from the MRSA are becoming a problem there are some treatments to try to eradicate the bacteria.  This may or may not be successful but is worth a try if the bacteria is causing a problem.  Your doctor can prescribe the needed medicines for this.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "MRSA",
    "content": "I'm a 57 year old female with constant right earache because of sinus pressure, lots of sinus type allergies and/or GERD, and in the past I have been told I have diverticulosis.  Only past surgeries are dental extractions and GI scopes.  Sister died of lupus; cousin with lupus.  Only current meds are allergy meds and Benicar for blood pressure, and aspirin.  My elderly mother died of bullous pemphigus/MRSA complications 2 years ago.  Before we knew it was MRSA I did have direct contact with the fluid from broken pemphigoid \"blisters.\"  I did always wash my hands.  Unfortunately, I do have a habit of rubbing my nose a lot, because I have chronic itchy nose from allergies.  My mom's MRSA got in her blood.  I asked my nurse practitioner doctor about MRSA and she said, \"Oh, sure, you're colonized.\"  She gave me Bactroban to put in my nose but I didn't use it all because of my allergy problems - with my constant runny nose, it just came right out as soon as I put it in.    However, for the 2 years since I have been having intermittent itchy red spots on skin, like mosquito bites but grouped 5 or so in a line.  3 months ago I began having a lot more itching, intermittent, all over body.  Because it has been in the news, I thought about the MRSA and went to a doc-in-a-box, who blew it off as nothing and made me feel stupid.    A few weeks ago I had a very painful pimple-like lesion on my face.  I haven't had a pimple in years, and when I did have them, they didn't hurt like this.  I put iodine on it and it cleared up. For the past few weeks I've been very tired, allergies acting up and throat and neck mildly sore because of that, all my joints and back aching worse than usual.  For the past week I've had explosive gas producing thin yellow mucus or purulent discharge, more GERD, allergies trying to cause bronchitis, and now I have a sore cuticle on one finger that is so painful it keeps me awake at night.  I'm terrified that I was colonized with the MRSA and it has become systemic, like my mom's was.  The two medical professionals I talked to have acted like I am an idiot to be concerned.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Harp01,  As you've suggested, MRSA is a staph bacteria that can colonize the nose and skin of individuals.  Most people who are colonized with MRSA will be asymptomatic and never have any problems.    MRSA is well known to cause spontaneous skin infections so it is possible that the bumps you are developing are from MRSA.  However, your description of red groupings of small spots is actually not very likely to be MRSA.  More commonly MRSA would cause a cellulitis type picture that causes a red area of skin that continues to expand.  Also, bacterial skin infections tend to be painful more than itchy.  What you are describing actually makes me wonder if you may have patches of eczema.  People with significant allergies are at increased risk of developing eczema (which is basically an allergy of the skin in a simplified way of thinking).  I'd suggest you see your doctor when you have these spots to have them evaluated.  If you are concerned you may be colonized with MRSA a nasal swab can be cultured to see if you do have this bacteria or not.  Your contact with your mother does make it more likely that you are colonized but is certainly not a guarantee.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks.  The painfulness of the pimple type spot does concern me.  My mom had similar painful pimple spots that came and went for 5 years, had multiple courses of antibiotics, then they finally decided that she had MRSA in her circulatory system and put her in intensive care for a month, but it was too late.  If that's what I have, I'd sure like to take care of it while it's still just a skin thing.  Every time I try to talk to a doctor about my concern they pat me on the back and/or laugh and say that my mom was old.  I often have trouble with doctors discounting me.  In the past I took this personally, but other women have told me that they also feel that their doctors talk down to them and treat them like children.  What is the best way to respond in a situation like that?\n\n",

I think the best way to deal with this is to be honest with your doctor.  Tell him that you are concerned about this issue and would like it further evaluated.

    "content": "I have a question about recurring MRSA infections.  I have had 3 cases of MRSA in the last 5 months.  The first case was a cellulitis infection of the foot that tested positive in a culture for MRSA.  The second was a  larger infection, with several bumps on different parts of the body, but one on my arm turned in to cellulitis.  This last infection which i was treated for today was a spot on my back that started out like a small pimple 2 days ago,  but quickly turned into a red, swollen very painful spot the size of a half dollar.  This too was diagnosed as cellulitis and MRSA.  All 3 times I have been given antibiotics Bactrim and Doxyclcleen to take, however this time, the doctor prescribed Bactriban to apply in the nose twice daily for 5 days.  My question is how do I keep continuing to get these skin infections, or am I never getting rid of them all together.  I am taking every precaution such as excessive hand washing, using towels and washclothes only once and washing in bleach.  I even went so far as to purchase the hibiclense antimicrobial hand wash hoping to reduce my risk.  Is there anything else I can do, or anything different I should be doing to help control and prevent these outbreaks.  Your input would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Shingles in Children",
    "content": "Hi Dnprescod,  This is an excellent question and a source of much confusion for many people.  Shingles is reactivation of the chickenpox virus.  Once infected with the virus it never really goes away.  The body simply suppresses its ability to propagate and cause disease.  The virus tends to hide in the nerve roots.  Occasionally, when the immune system is weakened for some reason the virus may reactivate causing shingles.  The resulting rash typically is only distributed in one or two of the nerve supply areas due to it living in the nerve root.  The chickenpox vaccine dramatically reduces the risk of developing chickenpox and shingles but both are possible.  Here's why.  The vaccine, unlike many vaccines, is actually a live virus that has been altered so that it is not as strong as the typical chickenpox virus.  It, too, gets suppressed by the body but much easier than the wild virus so most people do not come down with chickenpox from it.  Since it is a live virus, it can reactivate just like the wild type virus and cause shingles.  Typically, since the virus is weakened, the likelihood of this happening is much lower than if one gets chickenpox not from the vaccine but it is still possible.  I should also note that getting shingles from the vaccine does not necessarily indicate that there is a problem with the immune system since the vaccine associated shingles can happen in healthy, immunocompetent individuals as well.  Best wishes.\n\n",

We moved from ME to TN Apr. 2006. May 2007 after a camping trip in TN at horse stables,  I came down ill with flu symptoms, rash on shoulders and 2 interlocking red circles the size of half dollars. .We found the ticks (lone star/deer tick) at the end of May. Blood tests showed poss. ehrlichosis. Dr. in TN dismissed it with no meds.  In June we were on our way back to ME, when I came down severely ill (fever, aches,headaches, intestinal issues,etc.) I also had over 10 brown recluse bites (no necrosis).  Spiders were confimed by professor of entomology CA. Lost 14 lbs in 6 days. Moved back to ME in August. Oct.-Became ill again for 7 wks. Headache, fever at am and pm (101 and higher) nausea, severe fatigue. In 3 mo. I lost over 30 lbs. In Jan. 2007 my BP was normal at 101/68, since then  it has been getting higher. Dec. it was 150/126. My dr. said the CDC contacted her and now it could possibly be Powassans Virus. I have had blood tests, lumbar puncture, xrays, MRI's. Everything seems normal--except by CDC standards (are they alarmists and or hopeful??) .  A dr. in TN once told me that he had several pts. with 'unexplained high BP'...How can that be?  I am so tired of the 'ifs', the labs, the hospitals. . I just want to feel like myself. A yr. ago I was myself, full of energy, could not sit still.  Now there are days where it literally hurts to walk across the room. I know I am getting older and a lot of the symptoms I blamed on getting older (bruising easier, blurry/distorted vision, breathing (COPD) not healing as well, etc.)Has anyone ever done studies on the long term effects of brown recluse bites--particularly to the people that ONLY become ill from them???  Is it a possible the venom is still working through my system?  I know dr.s have to go through the entire work ups, but I am getting so tired and frustrated--it has been almost a year since I actually felt well.  Any advice, help, etc. would be appreciated.  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Chanson,  I think it is quite unlikely that the spider bites are the cause of your symptoms.  Brown recluse bites typically cause local necrosis, although they have been described to cause a severe illness and shock-like picture.  This would be very unusual to continue for a year.  When you were tested for tick illnesses, were you tested for lyme disease?  Lyme disease is very common and can present with a rash similar to what you are describing.  I would also recommend you consider seeing a rheumatologist to help investigate the possibility that all this is actually an autoimmune disease.  Follow up with your doctor is important.

    "content": "Additional Note:  I am 28 yr old male, from maryland and moved to florida September 2006.  My short and long term memory is getting worse and worse day by day.  I was ably to find a lot of information from some old medical records from the military.  Origionally I thought everything started in 2001, but it was actually 2002.  I remember most of the events occurring now, but cannot really put a time stamp on them.  Also, at some point in time I had a weird looking ptch of skin on my right  or left shoulder on the back.  I noticed it by accident, as I don\u2019t usually look at my back.  I told the doc, but don\u2019t remember him actually looking at it.  It was probably about the size of my palm when I saw it , not a perfect circle or even a perfect oval, but that was the general shape.  After a few weeks, it was gone and I can\u2019t find mention of it in my medical records.  Event 1July \u2013 Sep 2002  Tingling/Numbess in upper back, heart burn, tingling feeling in head. Fall/Winter time frame went to Oklahoma had most intense Headache ever while on plane. Went to military clinic after arriving, no hospital that close, was diagnosed with sinusitis, no tests performed. All week had very bad Headache, caused Nausea, Fever. At some point felt a very sharp pain across center/left side of forehead. Shortly thereafter pain begins to subside. Additionally after getting home thick, mucousy, black blood in left nostril for a few days. At some point symptoms mysteriously go away.   Event 2 Mar - Sep 2003  Shortly before going overseas, Headaches return, midrin prescribed. Then, at RAF Mildenhall in England. Symptoms begin to return, tingling, numbness, leg pain, eye pain left eye(felt constricting and was directly behind left eye). Becomes difficult to walk. Back tingles/numbness when leaning forward. 90% pain in legs located in left leg. Pain travels feels like nerve pain, stings/tingles and moves between calf, thigh, foot. Had some temporary similar symptoms in left hand. Had Heartburn quite often. Went back to the states in April. Had MRI's done at Andrews AFB first, then Walter Reed Medical Center. No info received from Andrews physicians; Walter Reed doctor's could clearly see multiple cysts in left sinus which were confirmed by in house MRI's. Cysts had calcified, slightly larger one in left frontal sinus. Similar blood work done again, only findings which seem to be consistant slightly low potassium, slightly high rbc.   Event 3 Jul-Oct 2004  Again, similar symptoms return. All similar to before. Lasts a few months. Still had midrin, so took that for the Headaches. Went to ER for severe leg pain, dizziness. Had a lot of indigestion, some Chest pain. Told I had acid reflux. Same blood results, pretty normal, slight low potassium, slightly high rbc. Few months later symptoms dissapear. Able to return to physical life style, took up rock climbing and went to proffessional classes three times a week for a few months at a large facility in timonium, MD.   Event 4 Mar - Jul 2005  Again, symptoms return. Tingling, numbness, eye pain, occassional symptoms in left hand, weird head feelings heart burn, indigestion. Went to Laurel Regional Hospital a couple times without any significant findings. Went to old family physician. Blood work done. Don't rember if anything else was done. They looked at previous x-ray's, MRI's etc. Doc said pain was muskuloskelatal.    Event 6 Apr-Oct 2006  Symptoms once again return. See neurologist, MRI done of head and spine, contrast was not authorized. No lesions seen, nothing really scene in MRI's, nothing to suggest MS. Dr. mentioned that there is a rare form of MS or other demyelinating disease that only effects spine and is tested by obtaining CSF. After many tests(Blood work, x-rays, MRI's) decide to go see a chriropractor, no lumbar puncture was ever ordered. A few weeks into physical therapy symptoms seem to be going away , miraculously as always. Continue therapy to build up strength in back etc., as continued muscle weakness and lack of strength in legs has caused my leg muscles to shrink very noticably. A month or so into therapy, symptoms return with a vengeance. MRI's ordered, end up taking a different position in Florida and pre-authorization is not received. A month or so after moving, symptoms go away again.   Event 7 Dec 2006 -May-2007  A few weeks before the end of the year, symptoms return. Had to change insurance when moving to FL, and waiting for insurance to kick in. In March, see new doc in, Florida. Explain problems. Have an MRI with contrast done, some slight dessication seen in L4/L5 and schmorl's node at t12. Pinched nerve suspected. Go through a series of spinal injections to make pain go away. Doesn't seem to be working at first, maybe a month later, symptoms seem to go away. Note:after last set of injections, broke out in painful pimple like sores all over back. Seemed to go away after a few weeks.   Event 8 Jul - Present 2007  Very beginning of July 2007, experience very bad Abdominal pain. Went to ER multiple times the week of the 4th of July. Was told I had diverticulosis after CT of abdomen. During the last ER visit that week had been having a lot of blood in stool and had had Diarrhea all week. End of the week after continued light headedness and pain, am admitted to Holmes Regional Hospital. A week spent in hospital, many tests done. Additionally felt Chest pain while in hospital. Had been having leg, Back pain, no head tingling and just assumed it was my back and Abdominal pain was completely seperate. Diarrhea continues after leaving the hospital until the second week of September, then picks up again a week or so later continuing through present. Severe abdominal pains very often. Have been through more tests at Mayo, after first being seen. Initial testing (Fat test diet) caused a lot of pain, some type of fluid injected into vein during MRI led to intense Abdominal pain, lasting an hour or so. End of October, beginning of November, symptoms begin to change a little less constant left Abdominal pain, have not been eating red meat for a few months now (just hadn't wanted it). Leg pain more intense. Weird tingling returns in upper back when bending forward. Short buzzing Headaches lasting a few moments back to back, caused dizziness. Tingling returning in top of head. Stinging tingling pain returns to left eye, located primarily bottom left side and sometimes behind eye, sometimes constricting feeling. Last Monday/Tuesday woke up with skin flaking off on hands (palms, fingers and between fingers.) Additionally over last few months have noticed occassional slurred speech, where I think a thought and say a word that is a combination of two words. Specifically remember doing it during initial consultation with two docs at Mayo in Jacksonville. Only other info is a kidney cyst, and Hematocrit is 50. 5. But had it tested for JAK 2 mutation, and I have nothing to be concerned about.  Blood is just a little thick and probably inherited.  Tests in July were Upper Endoscopy, Colonoscopy, MRI of head and spine, stress test, blood work. The equivalent of an EKG for your brain. No significant findings. Very small amount of pilori found. Antibiotics administered.   Tests from October- present at Mayo  Hydrogen breath test, blood tests, fat test, capsule Endoscopy. MRI.  No real significant findings.

    "content": "Hi Npilant,  From your description it certainly sounds like you have a neurological issue going on.  Some of the tick born diseases can cause neurological issues.  Your symptoms do not strike me as classic for these diseases but in my area there are not a lot of tick illnesses so my experience with them is limited.    If there is concern it certainly sounds reasonable to test for them.  Most of these are tested for by a blood test.  I would recommend you follow up with a neurologist for further evaluation.  Best wishes.\n\n",

My previous (and first) bout with this nightmare was this past spring.  This time it hit very fast and was much more serious.  Through blood cultures, it was positively identified that strep was the cause.      I am now curious as to a possible connection between this infection and my past strep infections as a child and young adult.  I had scarlet fever as a child and countless cases of strep throat which continued through my early thirties.  I'm in my early 50's now and have mild asthma and psoriasis my legs and arms.  While on the IV penicillin, my psoriasis all but faded away.  I remember one of my primary care physicians from years ago telling me I was carrier of the strep bacteria.  Could all of these things be connected?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Samba,  It may be that you are, indeed, a carrier of strep.  Simply being a carrier does not necessarily increase the risk of severe infections, though.  You may want to consider seeing an immunologist to have some screening immune function labs done to see if there is the possibility of you having an immune defect that is increasing the risk of you contracting a severe infection.  An immune system problem presenting at age 50 is unlikely but it sounds like you may have been having this issue since you were young.  If you are a carrier, there may be a possibility of eradicating the carrier state by taking a course of antibiotics.  This may work but, unfortunately, there is a chance that even with appropriate antibiotic treatment the bacteria may recolonize.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Anyway, recently I took my stud earrings out and found that by pressing with my fingers on either side of both ear lobes I could feel a large bump in the areas where the piercings are. The bumps were kind of hard but not visible to the eye. There is one bump with each one of the holes. Maybe it is an abscess around each hole inside the ear lobes...I've had them 2-3 months and the second set still has pus when I wiggle the earring around and pull it downward a little. What is yor opinion on this? Thanks!  Chelsey\n\n",

It feels like there are veins that are clumped up on the underside and burning. This morning, It hurts with a burning sensation when i touch it where it is swollen. And when i try and lift the penis to see the underside it hurts on the one side.   I am just curious to know if its a bruise and will heal over time or something serious that may have happened?

If this is the case this would be considered a medical emergency and I would suggest that you seek medical attention. If you are not experiencing a prolonged erection and you feel like you are bruised this could be related to injury. Pain, prolonged erection, etc. lasting longer than four hours indicates the need for an evaluation. Upon evaluation the use of ice packs (placed in a pillow case for example and not directly on the skin) may be recommended 15 minute intervals several times a day to reduce both swelling and discomfort. I would strongly suggest an evaluation if you are still experiencing symptoms. Best wishes. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

This morning, however, I noticed that a blister had former adjacent to my nipple on my aereola, roughly the size of a halved pea. The skin was thin, shiny, and partially collapsed, like it had been stretched out and then deflated a little, but it was still mostly full of fluid. There were several red patches where it looked as though the skin had been abraded. This was probably a bad idea, but decided to lance it, and since I'm an art student have a scalpel, which i boiled and then broke the skin of the blister with. Pus immedietely came out, mostly pure but the last of it tainted with a small amount of blood, and its size diminished considerably. I've been wearing a band-aid over it and it doesnt seem to have done anything except weep clear fluid quite slowly. Is there anything I should or can do to treat this or are antibiotics the only solution?\n\n",

Give SULFAMETHOXAZOLE/TMP also says Septra and Bactrim. As catscan and diagnosis was being given I took a major turn for the worse. Symtoms were: severe mind problems. felt poisoned or brain was infected. also seeing streaks and colors exploding too bright and shapes. stared at carpet for prolonged periods. unable to focus. basically delirious. also chills and intense fatigue. I saw a pneumonia symptoms list and I had pretty much most things on it but I don't have any lung problems whatsoever although i havent gotten a chest xray. but no weezing or nothing. good air flow. the delirium has gone away but still have a foggy head all the time and a constant headache. conditions havent changed in 7 days. been on SEPTRA for 14 days. The Sinusitis has probably been around of and on since july. major weight loss(40lbs in 120 days) and stress and cold weather during exercise pushed me to be weak in the immune area. 3 days ago went out for walk in swetsuit and the sweat from my hair was ice cold. something you would want to drink on a hot summer day.

    "content": "Hi Abe,  Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) is a reasonable choice for sinusitis.  The major bacteria implicated in causing sinusitis include Strep. pneumococcus (by far most common), H. influenza and M. catarrhalis.    Many people will more commonly choose amoxicillin (high dose) or augmentin (amoxicillin/clavulonic acid) to treat sinusitis but TMP/SMX actually has pretty good coverage for these bugs with the possible exception of H. influenza.  A typical course of treatment is 14 days for acute sinusitis and 21 days for chronic sinusitis.  The same bugs are responsible for causing pneumonia so treatment choices are similar.  Without a cough or some lung symptoms, though, pneumonia is almost certainly not present.  Your symptoms of \"mind problem\" may be a side effect or reaction to the TMP/SMX.  I'd suggest you talk with your doctor about these new symptoms to be sure everything is OK and to see if you should continue on with the antibiotics.  Best wishes.\n\n",

This may be what you are seeing .  Several viruses can also cause symptoms that mimic strep throat.  If you are having pain but are strep negative this may be what is going on.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Please, please try and help me.  I am a 57 year old female, working 4 days (barely able) a week, and suffer CFS.  I am hoping to see Dr. Bruce Carruthers, but he is not able to see me until next year.  I see only a gp (not knowledgeable in this area) and a psychiatrist (who originally diagnosed me with CFS.  (my angel) as was previously thought of as mentally ill.  My GP tells me to push myself.  I start sweating profusely after exerting myself after about one hour.  I only work, on my days off I recuperate, I do not keep my home up, walk my dogs, or have any other kind of life.  Sometimes I am too tired to have a bath or eat and go straight to bed when I come home.  I take 40mg of dexedrine and 225mg of effexor daily. I have migraines weekly, relieved by Maxalt. Was on oxybutyn but stopped as it was presumed to affect my mouth (dryness)  Last week I finally decided that I cannot go on like this, I feel that I am killing myself.  I went in to see my GP, he says \"how much time do you want off\"  I tried to explain that I just cannot handle working anymore and need to go on disability.  I find this very humiliating, as I have always worked, done a good job and kept a nice home, thus I was crying.  I also explained how I was not functioning cognitively.  He sent me with a letter to go get admitted to the psychiatric ward,  luckily my psychiatrist was on call duty there and he did not feel that I needed to be admitted, he told me to take 2 weeks off and come back, and in the meantime to see my gp about my infections etc.  I have been having a lot of trouble with infections in my mouth, to the point of my dentist phoning my physician about it.   My dentist has never seen a patient with the infections and condition of teeth that I have.  I have a very good dental plan and spent over $4000.00 in one year on user fee, so you can see how much I saw the dentist.  I recently went in as my two teeth kind of turned to sand and the bridge on my bottom fell off.  The dentist was more concerned with an abscess that I have on the top.  I feel no extra pain there at all.  My head and throat always hurt anyway.  He put a needle in to drain it, now I just don't know what to do.  I had osteomylitis of the skullbone (proteus only known case) about 25 years ago and the infectious disease Dr. Chow said that it will always remain in me so always watch out for it.  Could this have anything to do with my teeth????  and the abscesses?    And my CFS----we don't have the micoplasma tests here in Canada.  Please what should I do.  I called my gp to see him again and he said that he will not see me until he talks to the psychiatrist.   I am not crazy.  The CFS makes me depressed, am not suicidal.  It makes me crazy in that I am confused and cannot figures things out, balance numbers etc., but not otherwise crazy.  It affects me at work in memory and figuring things out also. Any advice would be most appreciated.  I am willing to travel to get tests or help. TY to anyone who tries to help me   ps     Previous surgeries:       tonsillectomy       carpal tunnel       numerous skull bone scrapings to remove osteomylitis (proteus mirabis)         messenteric cyst--very large  (beneign)         colonoscopy (negative)         breast cysts and calcifications (beneign)\n\n",

A couple of years ago I found a bat inside my house, captured it and had it tested for rabies.  It was not rabid.  That same year, a bat flew into my neck outside my back door.  It flew away.  I had 2 booster shots.  On September 27 of this year, I found a bat in my bedroom when I woke up.  It flew away and I couldn't locate it anywhere in the house.  I had two more booster shots.  I found loose siding where bats might possibly enter and had it sealed.  On December 15 of this year I woke up to another bat hanging from a cloth wall decoration right over my head.   The bat flew out of the bedroom and I haven't been able to find him  I now believe they must be in the walls of the house.  Is there some test that would measure the amount of rabies protection I still have in my system now to see if it is adequate?  Or should I take more booster shots?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I can understand your concern and it is always wise to be cautious where bats are concerned.  Most bats do not have rabies but it is still the most common cause of rabies infection in humans - obviously a rare disease.   If you noticed any kind of unexplained bite marks, then you should see a doctor about the possibility of being exposed to a rabid bat.  But, bite marks are not always apparent due to the tiny teeth of bats.  I believe you are saying you have had the initial rabies vaccination due to your frequent exposures so you should be able to have a titer to determine if the levels of vaccination are still adequate.    You should contact animal control or wildlife specialists for help bat-proofing y our home.    Good luck.\n\n",

I am an Occupational Therapist so I have direct pt. contact, primarily with elderly pts., and I have a 10 y/o & 8 y/o at home.  I have been battling what the third doc. told me is a staph infection in my nose.  I have not had a nasal swab yet.  The doc. prescribed bactroban (?) ointment.  This ointment does eliminate the infection, but after a couple of months it comes right back.  I have been back and forth with this for over a year.  I have now developed boils on my butt.  They appear 1-2x/month.  They are large, hard, red and purple, and develop a white head.  I popped the first one not knowing what it is and yellowish blood tinted fluid came out of it.  I know have a raw/sore nasopharyngeal area.  The left side of my neck is tender and swollen (jugular nodes?), and I have been so tired that I have to rest during the day which is new for me.  My kids have been battling a cold, but I do not have the runny stuffy nose typical of colds.  My current flare-up with the nasal infection is the worse it has been.  Is this staph infection just something I just have to deal with indefinitely?  Can I give this to my patients or my kids?  Are the boils or swollen tender neck related and a progression of the staph infection?  Thank you!  Ryann\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Ryann,  Most likely you have a bacteria called MRSA or methacillin resistant staph aureus.  This bug is prone to causing spontaneous skin infections.  You are likely having trouble clearing the infection in your nose because you are colonized with the bacteria.  This is fairly common.  About 30% of people will have staph colonizing their nose and skin.  Getting rid of the colonization is difficult.  Using the nasal bactroban is a good start.  The best way to try to clear the colonization is to use the bactroban for seven days (twice a day on each side of the nose).  This will help with the nasal part but the skin must also be treated.  Using a washing soap called chlorhexidine to wash with (basically shower and use on entire skin surface) daily at the same time as using the bactroban is also needed.  Everyone in the house needs to do this at the same time for one week.  This may help clear the colonization.    Using both the nasal ointment and the body wash for everyone in the house prevents the bacteria from being spread back and forth.  The bacteria can be spread to others.  In fact, it is quite possible that you picked up this bacteria from your work.   Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi. I am a 23 year old male. I had numerous visits to the doctor and there are still no indication of what is wrong with me. It started with me waking up with a sharp abdominal pain in the right side, which led to me fainting. I went to the hospital immediately where blood tests were done. The outcome of the tests showed that I have a high white cell count. They thought it was my appendix. I spent the next night in hospital and they sent me home, after a specialist confirmed that my appendix was fine. Symptoms after that included dizzyness, lumbness of my legs, the abdominal pains spread to the right side as well (They are now only occassional but sharp)and chest pains (left side). The symptoms at present is Continuous headache and stiffness of the neck, and dizzyness occuring after excersising. I also have a weird sensation just before I fall asleep (almost as if I am fainting). As far as family history goes - High blood pressure and diabetes. Can you please help as I am quite worried. Thanking you in advance.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Christo,  This is a bit puzzling.  I'm having trouble coming up with something to tie all your symptoms together.    The abdominal pain and leg numbness may be due to a problem with the spinal nerves (such as a compression in the spine from a fracture or other process).  This would be less likely to cause a headache and neck pain though.  The abdominal pain and chest pain/fainting could be something like a kidney stone.  When a doctor hears headache and stiff neck the immediate thought is meningitis (infection of the covering of the brain).  This really doesn't fit your symptoms well either.  Perhaps this is an infection from something such as valley fever or histoplasmosis that can cause symptoms in multiple organ areas.  Another unlikely possibility would be a neurological condition such as multiple sclerosis.  Follow up with your doctor is important.  It may also be of some benefit to you to see a neurologist.  Best wishes.  I hope you are able to find an answer soon.  Keep us updated if you don't mind.\n\n",

The abdominal pains have subsided and the dizzyness is now only occassional. The only thing that is still bothering is that I am always aware of my heartbeat when lying down. My heart rate goes up heavily when I am out for a drink, which means I smoke more.

    "content": "Here's my answers to your questions.    1) I prescribe antibiotics on a daily basis.  I am a hospital medicine doctor so I see patients mostly in the hospital and deal with sicker patients.  2) When I am in clinic I frequently have patients that come in to see me expecting an antibiotics.  Often, it takes some convincing of them that what they have is not from a bacteria and does not need an antibiotic.  3) I frequently prescribe antibiotics for skin infections (cellulitis) and pneumonias.  When I am in the clinic it is most commonly pneumonias and ear infections.  4) Yes I have.  5) It is rare but I have had several patients I have been caring for in the hospital that have developed multi-drug resistant infections.  These can be very serious and difficult to treat.  Single drug resistant bacteria are becoming quite common and we must now think of this on a daily basis.  6) Antibiotic resistance is incredibly important to consider.  Appropriate use of antibiotics involves not only choosing a proper antibiotic and not using antibiotics when not needed, but also making sure that antibiotics are taken as they should be.  Failure in any of these areas can dramatically increase the risk of resistance developing.  7)  I consider antibiotic resistance basically on a daily basis.  I hope this helps.  Best wishes.\n\n",

If your parents had you immunized routinely prior to school entry you probably had this and have some protection now.  this would have been called DTP, DTaP, Td, or DT.    Boosters are recommended every ten years following the initial vaccines and this helps your body to kick into gear to fight the toxin quickly but even without the booster, if you had the initial series you are likely OK on this.    Since your symptoms have not been severe, I would guess you are OK but if you have an increase of symptoms or you don't get better you should get additional help.  These are reasons to seek immediate care:      * A recent injury and muscle cramps or spasms at or near the injury.      * Trouble swallowing or muscle spasms in the facial muscles.  Diagnosis is made by symptoms typically - progressive muscle spasms, fever, irregular heart beat, pain and muscle cramps.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Angela, Here is a posting I found from one of the Doctors here about MRSA. I don't know if you saw it or not so I cut/pasted it for you to read. It's to another Mom about her child...  First of all, you honestly need'nt worry so much! I'll try here to explain things for you, and if you still have questions, please don't hesitate to ask.  Staphylococcus Aureus (SA) are a group of bacteria which are very commonly found on the skin and cause infections. But there are many different types and the particular type known as MRSA (methicillin resistant Staph aureus) is causing increasing problems because, as the name suggests, it is very resistant to treatment with antibiotics. Even some of our most powerful antibiotics, such as methicillin, can't stop it in its tracks.  Around 30% of people carry the germ SA in their nose or on their skin (this is often referred to as being 'colonised' with the germ). SA and MRSA are not normally a risk to healthy people and the majority of people 'colonised' with SA do not have any symptoms and aren\u2019t aware they are carrying the germ. If colonised, one becomes 'infected' with SA if the bacteria get into the body through a break in the skin.  In case of 'colonisation', a special antibiotic called mupirocin is usually applied to the skin or the inside of the nose to remove the bacteria. Skin and hair may be washed with special disinfectants.  As for specific treatment of 'infection', antibiotics aren\u2019t completely powerless against MRSA. The 'infection' may simply require a much higher dose over a much longer period, or the use of an alternative antibiotic to which the germ has less resistance.  The long-term risk of SA is the chance that it may become resistant to all antibiotic drugs. For this reason it is important that antibiotics are only used when necessary and the full course of a drug is taken when it has been prescribed.  It is also very important to take basic hygiene precautions. This includes covering cuts and broken skin with waterproof plasters and washing hands frequently and thoroughly. _________________ Best regards,   Dr. Heba Ismail, M.D.\n\n",

Then last night she said yellow puss started to come out of it and when here boyfriends mom pulled the skin away there was green puss. I told her it might have been a cyst that developed an just became infected over time. Im not entirely sure though. She tried to register on this site but said it wouldnt let her. So she asked me to post the question. Do you think she needs to see a doctor about it or will it go away on its own. Any advice to what this may be will be greatly appreciated. Thankyou in advance.

    "content": "Hi Diane,  There are a few possibilities for what may have been the cause of the underlying lump.  It may have been something embedded in the skin or possibly a small cyst or other type of skin structure.    It does sound like it it may have become infected causing the increasing redness and pain.  If the redness and pain are continuing she should see her doctor as it may require some antibiotics to clear up.  Sometimes after the area drains the infection resolves.  If all the redness and pain goes away in the next day or two it will likely heal fine without any antibiotics.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Before I tell you the problem it's important to say that I have had herpes before, about a year ago. A couple  of weeks ago my boyfriend and I attempted anal sex. In the end there was no penetration but he had used his fingers in that area alot. There had been alot of rubbing. The next day , as it was not sore, I shaved. I usually shave all of the area down there, front and back. After a few days I noticed swelling (in the area between the vagine and the anus), alot of itchiness (mostly around the anus) and spots (around the anus). When I go to the toilet it hurts to wipe. All of this I still have for about 2 weeks now. I'd like avoiding going to my doctor about this. I've put some moisturising creme on (E45) a couple of times just to soothe it. Is there anything I can do myself to make the healing process faster? What exactly caused this? What exactly is it?    Thank You\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Anna999,  There are a few possibilities.  It may be that the skin is simply irritated from the friction of the rubbing.  The shaving may have further irritated the area if there was some underlying irritation already.  This may take a day or two to develop.  In this case, using a moisturizer is reasonable to help the skin heal.    It may also be a fungal infection of the skin in that area.  Usually, this causes a lot of itching and often some red bumps as well.  These can be treated with a topical anti-fungal medication.  If STD's are at all possible I would suggest you be tested for them.  They may be asymptomatic so even if this irritation isn't from an STD, testing is a good idea just to be sure.  If the area isn't getting better over the next few days it would be a good idea to have it evaluated to see what is going on.  Your gynecologist would be an appropriate doctor to visit.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Would it be possible for you to schedule a complete physical exam with a doctor?  I understand your frustration but rather than going in for one or two complaints, perhaps you can get a complete evaluation including blood work to check for iron levels and thyroid function.  Ask for these tests specifically since they have not checked thyroid before.  Since you have a combination of symptoms throughout your body, having someone look at the complete picture makes sense.    You should also address any possible depression issues, perhaps take a self-screening test to see if there might be some other underlying cause for your  physical ailments.    If you don't get satisfaction with your appointments, keep trying - you should be able to get any necessary referrals even through the military, though there is often a lot of red-tape involved.  Persistence can pay off eventually.  Good luck.\n\n",

Looking at me you would probably never see it, but I do.It has totally ruined my social life. At about 16 I noticed that my face want as equal on each side as other peoples, I tried to ignore it, then I noticed that my left testicle started hanging lower than my right, the head on the penis is less curvy on the right side than on the left, my right armpit did not stink as bad as my left, but started stinking about the same after about 2 years at 18. I was pretty chubby in HS but now I am losing weight and my left love handle is almost gone, while my right is about half an inch or less petrudes more, same with my hip at the leg, it petrudes out more. My right nipple has less hair than my left, my jaw bone measures about half an inch shorter on my right than on the left, its like my right side of the body is not keeping up with my left, and I have never told anybody about this, if anyone I knew found out I wouldn't be able to look them in the eyes.This has completely ruined my life, I feel like a complete defect, I will never be able to get married or have kids, I think about this every day. All I want is to be normal, I just want to know what could have caused it, am I doomed for life? Is it my DNA? Is it fixable? I'm dimmer with math than average, is my left or right side of the brain not developing like the other? I'm not a loser, I'm a defect,I just want to be normal.

    "content": "Hello, I can see these things have caused you great stress even though they do not sound like something that is noticeable to others.  I worry that you say this \"deformity has ruined your life.\"  I think it is important to have a general physical exam with a doctor where you can discuss these concerns in depth to rule out any syndrome or actual health problem.    People are not perfectly symmetrical and nobody is perfect in any way.  Testicles are uneven in most men and most people would be surprised how different they would look if they were able to make both sides of their faces exactly the same.  Their appearance would be quite different.    Good relationships don't rely on physical perfection and it is much more important to find someone who can love you for the person you are; not for your physical body.  While appearance can make a difference, it is usually not the most important factor in a successful love life.    If these things are not threatening your health it is possible you may not be able to be as you say, \"normal\" but you should still learn to accept the body you have.  This does not mean that you have no problem but many people with serious deformities do learn to make the most of their situation, have healthy self-images and lead happy, productive lives.  You may also benefit from therapy to deal with the issues you have about your body.  In conjunction with your medical doctor, you may be able to make great strides in the happiness arena.  Some reassurance that imperfect can also be normal along with an evaluation to rule out physical concerns should help.  You have talents and abilities that are unique to you and cannot be compared with another person.  Plenty of normal people struggle with math, reading, or other academics.  Do get this checked out.  Good luck to you. Debbie\n\n",

    "content": "1. 27 2. male 3. many, at the age of 6-12 4. none 5. none 6. none  I posted in the headaches section of the forum, but as i've discovered, I'm now fairly certain I have an ear infection.  I haven't been able to think clearly, my eyes burn, my ears hurt and it feels like that familiar ear infection feeling.    I've been wearing ear plugs to sleep every night for the past 3 or so months.  so It seems like too much of a coincidence to ignore.  I can't see a doctor...but a friend has Doxycycline that I want to take.  I read that Doxycycline is pretty similar to Minocycline, which I am allergic to.  Is Doxycycline ok to try?  If so, what is a good length of time to take this medication for an ear infection?  Thank you for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Whereeveriam,  I would absolutely not recommend you take the doxycycline if you are allergic to minocycline.  They are very similar and the likelihood of a reaction is high.  Also, doxycycline would be a poor choice for coverage of the bugs that cause ear infections.  There are a few questions that need answered for you.  1st, do you have an ear infection?  It sounds probable that you do.  2nd, is it an outer or middle ear infection.  An external ear infection is treated with topical drops.  It typically causes tremendous pain to move the outer ear.  A middle ear infection is treated with oral antibiotics and typically the ear is not as painful to move the outside.  Seeing a doctor will clear all this up for you and get you an appropriate treatment.  Best wishes.\n\n",

All I want is a clear mind again, and these headaches are killer.  Do you suppose that a middle ear infection (I really think this is what's wrong with me) would subside without medication?  or would things just continue to get worse?   Beside the fact that I can't afford to see a doctor, I have a serious fear of needles.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi again,  Recent studies have shown that about 80% of middle ear infections will get better on their own without an antibiotics.  Because of this, there has been recommendations to only use antibiotics if the pain persists for more than 2-3 days.  If it is not getting better in the next day or so it is less likely to get better on its own.  In this case, having it evaluated is probably the best thing to do to make sure you have an ear infection and not something else.  Also, this way you can get a proper treatment.  Just to ease your mind a little, needles will likely not be involved.  While you are waiting to see if it is going to get better, using tylenol and ibuprofen as needed for pain can be a tremendous help.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Angler769,  With persistent bleeding I would recommend you put direct pressure (fairly firm) on the bleeding area for 10 minutes without removing the pressure.  This is a long time but it is important.  The full 10 minutes will allow a clot to form.  Removing the pressure too soon can tear apart the forming clot.   If it doesn't stop bleeding after this then it is time to go back to the doctor to see if there is something more needed to get it to stop.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 46 year old Caucasian female. 5'1\"and weigh 130#. Ihad a  CBC,basal metabolic panel,urinalysis & liver & lipid profile done June 2007-all were WNL except a WBCof 11.8 (ref.range 4.1-10.9) & neutrophils 8.6(ref.range2.0-6.9). ARNP-C said nothing to worry about. Around July 19th I began feeling fatigued easily,joint pain, L lower back,hip and leg pain, running a low grade temp of 99.0-100.7. Isaw ARNP-C who dx:sinusitis and sciatica. I took a 10 day course of Avelox and a muscle relaxant. I returned to the ARNP-C on Aug. 8th as I continued to run the fever, fatigue worsened,pain in L lower back,hip and leg continued, nausea. I was placed on Phenergan and Cipro 500mg twice a day and Clindamycin  300mg twice a day  for 2 weeks. At that time we repeated a CBC and urinalysis. Urine was WNL. WBC 13.3(ref. range 4.1-10.9) and neutrophils of 10.3 (ref rang 2.0-6.9).I returned to the ARNP-C who had me see the MD on Aug. 21st as the fever continued,  as did the sciatic pain and now I'm having intermittent nausea, vomiting & diarrhea,dizziness,lightheaded,almost fainted 3 times,no appetite.My MD suspects sepsis with ? endocarditis and is trying to locate origin of infection. On Aug.23 I had the following test: CT of the Abdomen & Pelvis which showed a uterine mass ,most compatible with fibroid & a left hepatic lobe cyst,otherwise unremarkable exam. CXR-no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.MRI of lumbar spine-Impression: mild focal left paracentral disc protrusion at L4-L5.Otherwise,unremarkable exam. Echo-Pending final results although technician has 25+ years experience said looked WNL. MD was looking for endocarditis. Limited CT paranasal sinuses w/o contrast.Impression:1. The orientation of the presented images is questioned.This should not be considered a final interpretation until this can be confirmed with respect to nasal fossa findings 2. The paranasal sinuses are all clear.3. In the presented images,the nasal septum is severely deviated to the right &  there is prominent hypertrophy of left inferior nasal turbinate mucosa. I've had extensive dental work, all but 6 teeth have either caps,crowns or bridges thus making scan very difficult. Mono spot test,liver panel,MRSA culture of nares, strep & ESR and C-reactive protein- all WNL.Blood cultures neg,but where done w/o chills. I returned to the MD on Sept.4th-he still suspects sepsis and feels blood cultures were inconclusive due to not having chills when drawn.We drew another CBC & a repeat urinalysis & is still looking for site of origin of infection-I don't have results yet. I took  a stool sample in for C-diff,toxins & leukocyte count today. I'm scheduled for a HIDA scan on 9/12 and a U/S of gallbladder on 9/21 as I'm now having abdominal tenderness and all other symptoms continue. It's been 8 wks and 3 antibiotics which MD feels should have cleared most bacteria. Saw GYN on 8/30 who feels fibroid is benign. Any insight would be greatly appreciated. I'm a Home Health RN and u/a to work until a confirmed dx is established and the dizziness, faint feeling and lightheadedness goes away, as I can't drive. I also have an autistic teenager and don't have time to be sick.I return to the MD on 9/11 for a F/U,as he is very concerned that we can't find the site of origin. I have a history of environmental allergies.  Past surgeries include L oopherectomy,T&A,tubal ligation,apecoectomy (dental procedure).  Family hx: CAD,arthritis both osteo and rheumatoid,osteoporosis,COPD  Current meds: Vicodin,zanaflex,xanax prn,singulair,zyrtec,Glucosamine,chondrotin,MSM,ASA,Calcium,Multivitamin,Vit C, Garlic, Lysine.\n\n",

If the area continues to spread you should have it checked out as it may still be a staph or other bacterial infection.    Treatment for eczema and contact irritation (contact dermatitis) is a topical steroid cream such as hydrocortisone.  Hydrocortisone is available without prescription but is fairly weak.  If it is not getting better your doctor can verify that the area is such a condition and if you need a stronger, prescription cream.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi. My 11 year old daughter has been sick for over 2 weeks now. It started with a sudden high fever (102.5) and severe headache, some upper abdominal pain, weeakness and severe fatigue. The fever lasted consistently for 6 days, during which she was seen by doctors 4 times. White cell count was never elevated, though granulocytes have remained a bit high. Mono and strep tests negative all 3 times. Initial Xrays showed slightly enlarged liver, but ultra-sound a week later showed everything is normal. Her fever over the past 10 days is low in the mornings (96-99) then shoots up in the afternoons (102-103.8). She has been having shooting pains through her hip into her groin area, and in her right knee. She was hospitalized 2 days and a neurologist found the right leg was markedly weaker, so they did an MRI of her lumbar spine but it was all normal. Some of the tests they have run are a tick panel, cat scratch fever panel, and now (at my urging) a test for tularemia. I won't have results for several days. She has lost nearly 10 pounds during this time, stays pale and fatigued. No abnormal white cells found, though some immature ones were mentioned. Her sed rate was 30, and her blood seems very thick when they draw it, and abnormally dark in color. As background, we live in the country and stray animals find us. We have several dogs and cats (some cats are sickly, mainly diarrhea), chickens and rabbits. Until a few days before she started getting sick, she helped feed and water the chickens and rabbits and did get a few flea bites (why she stopped helping). She has been very healthy all her life. I possibly have lupus, her older brother has thrombocytosis and was tested for leukemia due to changes in his blood and similar symptoms a few years back (it had to do with an infection  causing changes to his marrow, but I don't remember what the disorder was called). Her pediatrician and the other doctors we have seen are stumped, as none of the tests seem to point them in a certain direction. She has missed 2 weeks of school and is just felling lousy all the time. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I'm a 20 year old female with no meds and no history of serious illness. I'm a nonsmoker and don't drink. I don't know my family history because I was adopted as an infant.  This is hard to explain, because I really have no idea what's going on, but I will try my best.  I noticed yesterday that my throat was a bit sore on the right side. I went to the bathroom and looked in the mirror and happened to notice a very whitish-yellow color behind the fold that is just before the tonsil (a google search of oral anatomy turned up the palatoglossal arch).   I shined a pen light at it to get a better look and saw that there was a whitish yellow mass coming out of the tissue there. I gently touched the arch, which suprisingly pushed the mass out. It didn't hurt (perhaps very slight soreness), but there was a lot of that mass and not there is a small, somewhat sore hole there. I checked it today, and there was a little more of the mass, so it seems that either something is growing rapidly, or something is being pushed towards the opening. Whatever it is, it seems so unusual and leaves me very concerned. The mass is solid, but not hard and was in several pieces.  I looked on the other side of my mouth and found no such perforation, though where the area is located, it is larger there, whereas the area I pushed the mass out of is now relatively flat. I am wondering if there is possibly a mass behind the tissues on the other side and there simply has been no tearing or opening there.  Any ideas as to what is going on? I really have no idea. Thanks so much for your time!\n\n",

I have trouble getting to sleep sometime and no matter how much sleep I get I have the worst time getting up for work and I'm tired as hell.  Thankfully I work for my dad and haven't gotten fired for it. If I had any other job I would be fired 100 times for this reason, but anyways I also have bad acne regardless of what I do on my face, shoulders, chest, legs and the area between my testicles and anus  (sorry bout the last one).  I also have a chronic cough that I've had for about the past year where I cough up flem that has what looks like greyish/blackish specks in it.  I also itch quite frequently all over my body and at times feel like things are crawling on my skin (I know by now I probably sound like a walking problem). I can't gain weight, I eat ALL THE TIME and I'm still hungry about an hour later.   Reason for my title is I was watching a special on parasites on the discovery channel earlier this evening and it got me thinking so I went online to find out what the symptoms were for parasites which included almost all of the symptoms I have (there are more but I'm not going to go into detail).  I was wondering if any of what I've described sounds like parasites.  Now I know someone will more than likely say something to the effect of go to the doctor or something, but let's be real here....who can afford that? Any advice from anyone would be greatly appreciated because it's not getting better and I want to move forward in life with a career but the fatigue is hindering me from doing so.  Sorry for the length, but it had to be done :)\n\n",

I didn't have a fever to start with and the pain when swallowing was gone after the first day of meds. But my \"throat\" is still sore. I rub the outside even though to push on it is it tender.   I was also treated with Azithromycin, in the case it was an std, however, nothing has changed. One tonsil is puffy with white seeds and the other is FLAT against my throat with seeds. I have also been gargling with scope or salt water.  Is there anything i'm missing? Something I might have or perhaps will i need to have my tonsils out?

As time goes on it becomes more and more accurate.  At your stage it should be a fairly reliable test (though likely not 100%).  If it is negative and there is suspicion it may warrant presumptive treatment.  There are a few other non-specific markers that can help also, such as an elevated ESR (a marker of inflammation).  Continuing to follow up with your doctor is the best way to find the diagnosis.  You certainly can request a second opinion if you choose.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I felt better for a few days, then slight soreness returned. A US doctor prescribed a one dose cypro that would get rid of strep, just in case, but without a culture. A few good days and then it returned.   A Mexican doctor did a culture to confirm and prescribed Combined Benezetacil (3 penecilins) three times every 28 days. After a week, I have good and bad days.

    "content": "Hi PatientX,  Strep throat is generally very responsive to antibiotics.  Currently, the Group A strep that causes the infection is thought to be essentially 100% sensitive to amoxicillin.  There are some patients, however, that continue to test positive for the bacteria, even after treatment.  In these cases it becomes a difficult question.  There is a certain percentage of people that will be carriers of the bacteria-that is, the bacteria will live in their throat but not be causing a problem.  When this is the case, if the throat is cultured it will be positive, even if it isn't the strep bacteria that is causing the infection.  I would recommend a few things for you.  First, I would suggest having your throat cultured and sensitivities run on the bacteria just to make sure that the antibiotics you are being treated with are effective.  Second, I would recommend you have your throat cultured for viruses, particularly the Ebstein-Barr Virus, that can mimic strep throat.  Do you have a cough?  If so, it is very unlikely to be strep throat.  Strep classically will cause a fever, ill feelings and a severe sore throat without cough.  If it is determined that you are a carrier of the strep bacteria be sure that your doctors know this when you present with sore throats so they can be sure your symptoms line up with true strep infections rather than another illness.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Brodiemojo,  If I am understanding correctly, the WBC of 36,000 was from the fluid in the knee.  Is this correct?  White blood cells in the knee fluid indicate infection within the knee joint, a condition called septic arthritis.  This condition often needs to have the knee joint opened and washed out by the surgeons.  This will help wash out a lot of the bacterial load and allow the antibiotics to work much better and faster.  It also minimizes damage to the knee joint from the bacteria.  If the WBC count was from her blood it still would be an indicator of infection or significant inflammation.  Given that there was fluid in the knee, the washout may still be needed.  These infections often come from bacteria traveling in the blood that gets to the joint and sets up infection.  It may have initially started as a cellulitis of the foot and traveled up to the knee.  This is a known possibility (though not particularly common) with a cellulitis of the lower leg.  Antibiotics and drainage should bring the infection under control.  As to what caused the initial infection it is hard to say.  There may have been a small amount of trauma to the foot that wasn't even noticed, allowing the bacteria from the skin to get in and cause infection.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I have a high fever, go hot and cold, experience some delirium, headache, muscle pain, slight light sensitivity, difficult to stand for long, slight nausea but no vomiting, slight diarrhoea, my sweat smells rancid and my mouth has a 'similar' taste that no amount of brushing can remove.   The fever breaks after 24-36 hours, and I start feeling normal perhaps 48 hours after the onset.   I would put it down to food poisoning usually if it weren't for the fact that the episodes are exactly the same each time.  Any thoughts welcome.  Matto\n\n",

Most of my leg and foot was red, swollen and very painful and I had a fever for days ranging up to 104F.  I was treated with IV antibiotics.  During my hospitalization, large, fluid filled blisters formed on my calve.  I had home care for a couple of weeks to wrap my leg in sterile dressings and compression wrap.  The blisters finally stopped draining after, about, two weeks.  During that time the skin on my entire leg and foot peeled as if I had a bad sunburn.      Since that time I frequently get blisters again on that same leg, in the same area where the original ones were the worst.  No fever or pain, just the fluid filled blisters just under the skin that break open and drain.  The fluid is clear with a slight yellow tint.  My doctor says I will have to be careful with this leg the rest of my life.  I am doing just that with keeping it clean and moisturized and using gauze dressings when the blisters open and drain.  Is this ever going to end?  Why is this fluid building up there?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Samba,  It sounds as if you may have had an infection called staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome.  It classically causes a cellulitis and skin blisters.  I am not as familiar with it causing recurrent blisters, though.  You may want to consider seeing a dermatologist for an evaluation.  They are the skin experts and may have some ideas on how to help keep your skin from blistering.  Sorry I can't really answer your questions that well.  I hope this is at least a little bit helpful.

She is 49 years old with Sjogren's Syndrome diagnosed and a previous history of Autoimmune Progesterone Dermatitis (resulting in hysterectomy). She is taking autoimmune suppressants. She is also taking Mestinon for unconfirmed Myasthenia Gravis (trying to slow the speech problem). In March 2005, she was inoculated for Typhoid as a precaution prior to a trip to Costa Rica. She also has a high body/skin temperature. We have been searching for reasons for the speech problem and would like to know if this is an angle that should be pursued. That is, with a weakened immune system, could the Typhoid inoculation caused her to develop a low-level Typhoid fever, that in turn is causing her high body temperature and speech slowness?\n\n",

    "content": "I recently moved to Hawaii and went on a guided hike to Maunawili Falls.  This area had signs posted warning about Leptospirosis, the bacterial infection in the water.  Our guide instructed us not to drink the water or swim if we had large open cuts, so I decided to swim.  When I got home I did a little research and found out how serious the infection can get, and that it can ultimately result in death.  So, of course, now I am very nervous.  I read that it can be spread by water going up the nose and in the eyes, etc.  I do have a small cut on my smallest toe, a canker sore in my mouth both of which were exposed.  I also got some water in my eyes and up my nose.  I realize I am probably overreacting but I am just looking for some peace of mind and to be safe and healthy.  I rinsed my cut with hydrogen peroxide and I rinsed my mouth with it as well (along with regular mouthwash).  What else can I do to prevent a possible infection from spreading? Is there anyway to detect infection?  Would it be wise to start an course of antibiotics (I read Doxycycline 100mg q 12 hours x 1 week was appropriate) just incase? Or wait to see if I experience common symptoms?   Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Your concern is understandable. Unfortunately, the diagnosis of leptospirosis depends on many factors which include history of exposure, lab tests as well as isolation of the organism from the blood, urine.  Serological testing (antibody tests) are expensive and difficult to interpret especially so early after exposure. Taking the antibiotic as prophylaxis has been given to people in endemic areas (using doxycycline) under physician supervision. I would like to make it very clear that you should not take doxycycline on your own \"just in case\". You must be assessed first as this drug may not be sufficient to TREAT you if actually have the disease. Prophylactic treatment is used to prevent disease rather than cure disease.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Nesha, Does your doctor offer you a discount for finding answers for him?  Pertussis is a growing health problem becoming more common, and with changes in recent recommendations.  Doctors expecting to treat families, or be primary care doctors need to be updated within the last year on this.  The CDC has plenty of online information for him.  To his credit he is honest in admitting his limitations, and it seems plausible he has given you the right treatment. It is unlikely your antibody level to pertussis could have persisted from infancy to give a positive test, so you were no doubt exposed by the sick kids.  Teens and adults now need to be reimmunized for pertussis before they are exposed, especially if they may have contact with infants, or are in environments like health care or colleges. The keflex probably was already killing the pertussis, as it is sometimes used for that purpose, but I presume it was reasonable for your doctor to switch to an antibiotic more often used for it.  Now that you have been exposed, a vaccine probably won't be needed in the near future.  Lots of information at http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/per ... efault.htm\n\n",

The symptoms are as follows:  - The rash itches terribly all the time and is incredibly sore after being scratched. It is not discharging anything and is not blistered.  -He has trouble going to the bathroom both ways      >-he feels like his prostate is swollen, it is   sometimes painful to urinate but difficult to stop     >After #2 rear so irriated he can barely can move  This is getting to the point where he can barely stand it. We don't believe STD's are an issue as we have not been with anyone else in 4 years. however, if the response is that we should get tested we will because we were with other people prior to begin dating. He is not currently on any medication and has not had surgery for approx 5-6 years (on his shoulders). The only family history that i know of is that he and his father have terrible heart burn and have I think what are called concaved chest? (THey go in under the rib cage a little).

    "content": "Hello Destry,  My best advise to you is to watch everyone very closely.  If anyone begins developing signs of a stomach flu type illness and/or muscle weakness they should be evaluated immediately.  The muscle weakness often will present first in the face and move downward.  More specifically, things to watch for include nausea and vomiting, double vision, trouble speaking or a dry mouth.   If everyone is still well there is likely no need to go to the doctor now.  Symptoms generally will present 12-36 hours after ingestion of the toxin.  I am not aware that taking antibiotics after exposure will prevent the development of disease.  As a note of reassurance, often time when a recall such as this occurs most if not all the recaled items actually turn out to be OK.  They are being removed as a precaution as it cannot be guaranteed that they are safe.  Best wishes and, again, if anyone develops any symptoms that are concerning they should be seen right away.\n\n",

When I was given that TB shot , I didn't bleed at all, just a pinhole like red point is seen , that superficial area became plump while injecting and within an hour or so it became almost normal and flat.just a very pale red tiny spot is left. When My husband was given the same shot, the skin became plum whiliing injecting  and he started bleeding a little for a while. he had to use a couple of cotton balls to clean that area for next 10 mins.Then the plumpness went away completely in an hour, though that area is still brownish red in color(quite prominant, looks like  a brown mole, but not raised at all).It's been just 2.5 hrs since we have given those shots,mine is practically flat with very little reddish spot, but my husband's is still brownish red and completely flat, no swelling. We are kinna afraid since he was bleeding for few moments after receiving the shot unlike me, is it just some amount of  blood clogged underneath the skin or it indicates any positive reaction. we have to wait for another 2-3 day for getting the results, but we are quite upset in anticipation and it is hard to withhold our patience for another 2-3 days.Please help us out in detecting whether it is a positive symptom or just our illusion. Looking forward to you answer asap. Thanks B\n\n",

    "content": "Dear biman, I can appreciate your concerns, and would like to set your minds at ease.  The TB test (PPD or purified protein derivative) test is the most widely used test to rule out tuberculosis. The test is administered with a tiny needle called a TB needle whose needle tip is inserted just barely under the skin into the dermis (called intradermal) and because it is so close to the surface, WILL cause the formation of a bleb which contains the test fluid.  This raised fluid filled area is not a positive sign. This fluid will be absorbed by the body and flatten out on the surface of the skin at the injection site anywhere between 1 to 3 hours typically.  Any discoloration of the skin is purely incidental to the individual's immediate response to the needle insertion and the introduction of the fluid.  Somewhere between 48 and 72 hours, a person with TB can expect to see a different type of raised area of surface skin.  This is called an induration . The healthcare provided who administered the test or a peer, would then measure the size of the induration and record it as a positive.  So long as the surface of the skin remains flat - no matter what color the area is - it is NOT a positive sign.  Remember, the important point here is that we are looking to see, between 48 and 72 hours, if there is an induration at the site of the administration of the PPD. Discolorations do not count - in the absence of an induration. As far as the bleeding is concerned, not being there to see for myself, I would have to give you a generalized piece of insight. It is not completely unusual to nick a small capillary during the administration of the test, if the blood vessels are tine and close to the surface.  If the effort to clean the area did not express out the fluid injected, the test should still be valid.  If agressive attention was however paid, to the end result that the bleb was squashed down, it is possible that the liquid was lost, and the test may have to be repeated. It would be good to let your care-provider know.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I was diagnosed with Rhinitis about a year ago .  About 4-5 months ago II started getting this weird cracking/gritty sound like fluid swishing around whenever i move my head side to side or rotate it around. The sound is not there when my head is still.  I do have a bit of Post nasal drip that seems very thick as i have to snort hard in order to get it into my throat to be able to clear it out. I cannot blow it out of my nose because there is nothing in my nose to blow out.  Im realy concerned about this sound of crackling fluid moving around in my head.  I was to see my ENT dr about 3 months ago and he checked my ear and said there was no fluid and to see my dentist which i did and he did not feel it was anything to do with my teeth/jaw.  The sound is getting stronger and i am really worried this could be somehting terrible and life threatening (I am a constant worrier and always diagnose my self with the worst).  I have no other symptoms of earachs, pains or anything other then the thick PND.  If the ENT saw no fluid with his littel handheld lighted thingy could this still mean there is some sort of fluid gushing around in there?  Thanks!\n\n",

Fever and flulike symptoms require medical attention after you have recently been bitten by a tick or if the symptoms are accompanied by a skin rash, particularly the bull's-eye rash characteristic of Lyme disease. Muscle weakness or paralysis requires immediate medical attention.    Swollen lymph nodes can be associated with infection and is indicative of your body fighting off the offending organism, so you may wish to see a health care professional about this.

Yesterday, my brother was feeding our puppy with chicken bones, and as he was giving the bones closer to the puppy's mouth, he was suddenly bitten, but only 2 scratches from it's teeth, with small wounds occured. I would like to ask (in behalf of my younger brother who is 14 years old) if a scratch from a puppy's teeth possibly be considered as a dog bite or just a small wound? could rabies be (Rhabdoviridae[i] virus) present within that scratch?\n\n",

(monday was the last time i was able to eat, and yesterday at lunch was the last time i had ice that stayed down) my doctors office did not return my call before closing for the weekend, so i was wondering if i should go to the local er, or if i should try to wait it out until monday? i don't want to go down there and sit for a few hours to find out that they can't do anything anyway.\n\n",

I would recommend that, if possible, you see a neurologist for some nerve studies to see if they are OK.  The lab tests you listed are all essentially normal (very borderline levels) so I don't think they are going to point you in any particular direction.  The ASO is a bit elevated which generally indicates a somewhat recent strep infection; however, I am not familiar with strep infections causing symptoms such as yours.  If the rash is not resolving I would recommend you see a dermatologist as well.  Sorry I can't be of more help.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 32 year old female. In January, I had to have a D&C due to a missed miscarriage. Everything seemed fine until about 10 days after the D&C. I started having sharp pains in my abdomen. I went to the ER, a pelvic exam was done, urine was checked, I didn't have a fever so they sent me home. That week the pain got worse so I went to my gynecologist who had performed my D&C...he did a pelvic exam and told me he didn't see any pus so I didn't have an infection. The pain got even more worse where I was going to the doctor every 3 days. The pain moved from my lower & mid abdomen into my low back. My doctor then said he wanted to do laprascopy to see what was causing the pain. I had the laprascopy done in Feb. where some minor endometriosis was found mostly just on the outside of my uterus (stage 1). My doctor declared that was why I was in extreme pain. Well in March I started to doubt him so I went and got a second opinion from another doctor who immediately prescribed me Augmentin since he thought too maybe I had some kind on infection (mind you my white blood cell count had been checked and was normal) I actually felt cured...and asked my doctor if I could try to get pregnant again, he gave me the go ahead. I got pregnant on the first try and again felt fine until I was about 5 weeks pregnant and the pain came back full blown. At 6 weeks pregnant, I went and saw another doctor from the same clinic as the one who prescribed me Augmentin and he did an ultrasound, where as it showed a healthy fetus and heartbeat in the uterus. This doctor though was concerned with infection so he prescribed me Zithromax. He said  he wanted to give me other antibiotics but I was pregnant so it was limited what he could give me. Well I am starting to feel better but I am worried since i am pregnant & don't want to miscarry again. I have a few questions: Would you recommend I tell my doctor to treat me again once I am done taking this antibiotic so it doesn't come back? What are the chances this is PID (that is non STD related) I was checked by the way for all STDs and they were negative. Would PID caused from a D&C procedure need different treatment than STD related PID? Also wouldn't the laprascopy have shown inflamed organs.  Thank you in advance for your help.\n\n",

They don't typically work preventively anyway and overuse of antibiotics leads to resistant strains of bacteria.  There are some cases of recurring infections such as UTIs where a low-dose maintenance helps but for most infections, this is not the case.     Treatment would vary depending on the organism - bacteria or virus.  I'm not certain about what would show up on a laparoscopy.  Perhaps someone else on the boards can better answer that question.

Ocassionally, water can contain microscopic bacteria or other microbes that can irritate the skin when contact occurs.  If your symptoms return I would recommend that you see your doctor.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for providing this excellent service.   My mother was recently hospitalized for many weeks for a bowel surgery with complications. VRE was found in her urine. She was treated with Tigecycline.    She would like to be tested to see if VRE is still present in her GI system. What is the best way to test for this? Would a routine stool cuture show VRE? ( a doctor recently ordered a stool culture for another reason. It didn't show any organisms that I thougth would be present at all times such as e.coli and enterococcus.)  (She is 66 years old. Past history of diverticulitis w/ surgery, gallblader removal, c-diff.)\n\n",

    "content": "Typically, a stool culture or rectal swab would be used to culture enterococcus that subsequently would be tested for vancomycin resistance (hence, vancomycin resistant enterococcus or VRE).  The catch is that stool cultures generally grow out many types of bacteria that are considered \"normal\" GI flora.  These are typically not reported and a culture will come back negative.  Generally, only non-\"normal\" bacteria such as salmonella or shigella are reported.  If one is looking for a specific bug such as VRE, the lab must be told this when the test is ordered because sometimes special culture media must be used or a typically \"normal\" bug may be being looked for.  If the lab was not aware that VRE was in question for your mother they may not have looked for it.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I just have a little bit of congestion every now and then, but right around 3:00 in the afternoon for the past 4 days, my body has been feeling achy.  Now, I know that if strep is not treated properly or fast enough, that it can result in rheumatic fever and so on.  I don't think I do have it, but why do my joints still hurt.  I've been taking my antibiotics as prescribed.  Are they not strong enough?  Should I go back to the doctor and get retested to see if it has cleared?\n\n",

    "content": "Retesting is not necessary as the type of strep that causes strep throat is extremely sensitive to antibiotics.    Generally it is thought that treatment of strep throat within 10 days will prevent rheumatic fever.  It is still possible to get some post infectious joint pain as some of the antibodies may settle into the joint.  Rheumatic fever is stil relatively rare so I think it is unlikely that this is what is going on.  However, it does seem that you may have been treated a little late.  I would recommend that you follow up with your doctor for an examination to make sure that all is well.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Today I got a call from her saying that I was positive for mononucleosis but my Lymes test isn't back yet. Are these two diseases confused a lot? Could I have both diseases? Would it be a good idea to continue on the antibiotics in case I do have Lymes because of the lasting effects of the disease if left untreated?  Thanks in advance for your help!\n\n",

With the swelling shifting to the right arm when you were on your right side it sounds as if you may have some edema (fluid in the soft tissue outside of the veins) that is moving around with gravity.  This may have several causes and may have caused some swelling of the ear that lead to trauma causing the bleeding.  Without a direct exam I cannot say what is going on.

    "content": "Hi, I'm a 34yo male who is allergic to nothing and has no history of illnesses.  My problem concerns a milky discharge from my penis. It is sticky and get's irratated when stuck to my underwear. Last July when this started I was experiencing painful urination all the time and now only experience it once in awhile. Sometimes I feel pain through the inside of my penis, the urethra area I believe it's called. Anyhow, I developed a series of bumps that looked like blisters but not poppable ones all around my genital area.   I went to my doctor who ran 2 tests for STD's, one right away last August and the second in October when antibiotics didn't work. Both tests came back negative but she gave me antibiotics anyway to see if that would work. After the second time, she sent me to see a urologist. The first visit he tested my urine and said I was fine and that the small blister-looking things were just musco-something and it would probably just go away with time. The second time I went in, he tested my urine again, said it looked fine, did a scope through my urethra, told me everything looked fine. He gave me a prescription for something to make the rash go away but it hasn't worked. I am going in to see him again soon and I am still experiencing the same symptoms as I have for all these months. I have lost my girlfriend because I was fearful of telling her because I didn't want her to think I had cheated on her and I haven't had sex since the symptoms started because I am worried about infecting someone with whatever I have. The discharge is better on some days than others and I'm really frustrated and feel horrible mentally about this.   Could this be a problem with my prostate or kidneys? I am only 34 and my urologist doesn't think it's a big deal, but for me I have never had anything wrong ever in a sexual sense and I fear I will never have sex again or be able to have children one day. I am talking to someone now who I would like to date, but I have been keeping my distance until I understand what is wrong with me. Most days I don't want to leave the house and lately I have been gaining weight and feeling quite depressed because of this. What should I ask the doctor to do when I go in for my next visit in a couple of weeks?\n\n",

Do you know which antibiotics you took?  It's likely that they were the correct ones.  My only thoughts are that you may have some inflammation in your prostate or possible at another part of the semenal tract such as the epididymus or semenal glands.  You may consider requesting a semen culture to look for any infections that may be due to a resistant bacteria and are still hiding.  Generally semen cultures are not needed but in your case it may be helpful to help close the infectious door as a possibility.  I would recommend that you continue to follow up with your doctor and pursue the diagnosis.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Sores on the inside of the lip can take several days to heal (generally because they end up being bitten again and again).  Some viruses can also cause these sores.  They generally take 5-7 days to resolve.  If the area is not improving by about 7 days, or if it is getting larger or more painful I would recommend that you see your doctor for an evaluation.  I do not generally recommend using hydrogen peroxide or other topical antibiotics as they are usually not necessary and some can actually inhibit wound healing.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 36 year old male. Last friday night I noticed a rash on my legs from the knees down. I can only figure that it is happening due to laundry detergent not being fully rinsed out of the clothes. I added more detergent than was required to my load of laundry that day and when I wore the clothes that evening is when i saw the start of the rash. The next day i wore a long sleeve shirt and had a little of the rash on my arms now. We have been using the same brand of detergent for years and no flare ups or anything until this episode. Do I need to change to a detergent that won't cause this at normal amounts being added to my laundry and how long should it take for this rash to go away and is there anything that will help it to disappear? The only med I am on is propranolol.\n\n",

Generally this type of rash will resolve in several days after the offending agent is removed.    You may be able to wash with less detergent and not get a rash.  If you still get the rash, you may need to change detergents.  If the rash is getting worse or not improving I would recommend you see your doctor for a formal evaluation.  If the rash looks like hives, benadryl may help.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you dr. Lowe for your response. I was able to rule out that it was the detergent causing my rash. My doctor thought it was a reaction to a medicine he was trying me on. That was also ruled out. I finally got a response from my dermatologist that had the best results. She really felt like it was Schambergs Purpura. I had the same symptoms as what she had seen. I was put on a steroid pack for a week and the rash was gone. From what I have found out about it, I am hoping it doesn't happen again. I want to thank you for giving me a response on this topic, even if I wasn't straight on the right symptoms. I will come back for any medical advice i need.\n\n",

    "content": "This is actually a debated subject.  With certain types of bacteria, particularly those that tend to cause skin infections, there is evidence to suggest that drainage of the abscess may be all that is needed.  Others still feel that after drainage, antibiotics should still be used.  (Most doctors still tend to use this approach of drainage and antibiotics as it is the safer route until there is good data to suggest otherwise.)  So, your infection may clear on its own; however, it is probably wise to take the antibiotics to ensure that your infection resolves.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Resistance to permethrin has been documented in head lice.  Body lice are less apt to become resistant.  The mainstay of body lice treatment is environmental treatment.  Body lice spend most of their time on clothing of the infected person.  The are on the skin only to feed.  As such, some advocate not treating with a topical medication at all.  Rather, thorough environmental control only.    Most still would treat as an adjunct.  Permethrin is good at killing lice, but not so good at killing knits.  As such, the treatment should be repeated in 7-10 days.  Regarding the environmental control, you can hire a professional to do this or do it yourself if you so desire.  Washing clothing in as hot a temperature as possible is important to killing the lice.  Temperatures > 131 degrees Fahrenheit for longer than 5 minutes are generally effective.  Dry cleaning may also be effective.  For those items that cannot be washed, sealing them in an air-tight bag for 12-14 days ensures that the lice and the newly hatching eggs will not be able to feed and thus will die.  (incidentally, chemical treatments may not be effective.  Effectiveness has yet to be proven.)  It is important to remember all the items that come into contact with your body.  Clothes, combs, furniture, bedding, etc. must all be treated.  I suspect if you are having resistance the reason is in the environment rather than medication failure.  Look for any possible are that is not being effectively treated and may be causing reinfection.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

Common causes include allergic rhinitis (allergies of the nose) and upper respiratory tract infections.  You may want to discuss with your doctor a short course of a nasal steroid (such as fluticasone) to decrease inflammation and help clear your eustachian tube (2-3 weeks is often enough).    If you do have allergies, you may be able to use other allergy medicines to help as well.  The nasal steroid is an excellent treatment for nasal allergy symptoms.  Hope this answers your question.

I had fever for entire time always around 38 to 39 celsius. Years past, now that I am attending secondary school in Canada, I am re experiencing this symtom; fever. I took advil and I went to the emergency room in North York General Hospital. They told me from the blood work, the inflammation level is high and wrote me a referral to the specialist. I have consistent fever that goes up high as 39 celsius and I am experiencing massive headache. What exactly do you think is wrong with me? What does it mean by having high inflammation level? What are its effects? Are there any non-medical methods I can be using for I have appointment with Dr. Lee on thursday? Thank you so much Please respond me asap thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Fevers that are lasting consistently over 2 weeks are termed \"Fever of unknown origin\" and definitely deserve a medical evaluation.  It is likely that your doctor will want you to see an infectious disease specialist to help in the work up for this.  Inflammatory markers are blood tests that look for the presence of inflammation in the body.  This inflammation may result from an infection or other etiology that is causing the body to react in an inflammatory fashion.  The don't relate to a specific diagnosis, but rather help us to see if it appears that something really is going on, or if the symptoms are less concerning.  For example, fevers that go on for a few days with normal inflammatory markers are likely to be due to a simple viral infection.  In contrast, markedly elevated inflammatory markers indicate that further investigation should be undertaken to see if something more severe is going on.  The diagnostic possibilities are extensive and a physical examination is important to help guide where to begin.  Follow up with your doctor is essential.  Best wishes.\n\n",

According to the severity of the these side effects the appropriate measures are taken.  When the side effects are intolerable, it is important as your Doctor advised to stop the drug immediately and to be supplemented with fluid and electrolytes to avoid  dehydration and other complications.  Clostridium difficile is a commonest organism in \"antibiotic-associated colitis\" and require specific therapy.  When the diagnosis is confirmed, antibiotics  like metronidazole , and vancomycin may be prescribed by the Doctor for 10 days, which control the infection in most of cases.  Oral or parentral antiemetics would be helpful to stop the vomiting and to allow oral intake as prescribed by the doctor.  I advise you to follow up with your Doctor for proper management.

It is painful to open my mouth very wide, bearable, but painful.  There were about 5 or 6 very small clear bumbs at the corner of my mouth.  I popped them, they were filled with a clear liquid, and I scrubbed them out with soap and water and they appear to be healing alright.  Should I be worried about any sort of infection?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear CollegeStudent12,  Cold sores are more likely to be the diagnosis of your complaints. It is caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV-1).   The main features of the disease are the development of fluid-filled blisters on red swollen areas of the skin or on the mucous membranes. These lesions are tender and painful and the condition is recurrent.  Direct physical contact like kissing can transmit the infection which remain dormant (not active) till the body immune system is a weaken for example after a cold attack or after periods of stress.  Complete medical history and the examination of the characteristic sores are usually enough for a diagnosis.  Treatment with specific antiviral cream is very effective.  I advise you to be checked by your doctor for proper management. Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you Dr. Lowe for your promptness and helpfulness.  In response to your questions, a strep culture was done and it came out positive. I was prescribed Amoxicillin, which made me feel a whole lot better, but I continued to have the sore throat. I took that for 7 days and called my doctor when things weren't getting better in my mouth. She then switched me to Cephalexin, which I have been on for 24 hours. My throat no longer hurts, but I still have the white stuff on my tonsils. The Amoxicillin did not give me a rash, which you said would possibly mean mono. If the pus does not go away by the time I finish my medicine, I will go get tested for mono. If I test positive, is there any medicine I can take to get rid of the exudate or is it just something I have to wait out. It does not physically bother me....it's just gross-looking.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  As Dr.  Lowe explained before, exudative pharyngitis due to  EBV is usually confusing with group A streptococcal pharyngitis, to add more difficulty in the diagnosis concomitant infection of both agents occurs in 30% of people. Sore throat, perhaps a strep throat that doesn't get better with antibiotics is mostly due to EBV infection.  However other physical and clinical signs are characteristic to EBV infection would help the physician to differentiate between these two causes. Moreover, specific serological tests,(detection of antigens and or antibodies to a specific antigen from the infecting agent  like as the monospot and heterophile antibody tests can help in the diagnosis of CMV infections.  Viral induced sore throat usually subsides in a week with rest and plenty fluid intake.  A 10-day course of antibiotic pills are usually sufficient to treat to cases with A streptococcal pharyngitis but longer antibiotic duration may be recommended in complicated cases.  Keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

The severity of the rash range from mild to severe according to the cause. There might be Itching on many cases.   - Seborrheic Dermatitis occurs on any part of the body where the skin is oily or greasy.   - Folliculitis is an infection of the hair follicles. Forming small, white-headed Bumps in hair follicles (roots).  Lesions may be Itching. Superficial folliculitis resolves spontaneously in a few days, while deep or recurring folliculitis should be medically treated.   -Some embryological remnants or non pathological changes in the foreskin occur in many males, these conditions require no treatment.  Fungal and viral infections have different presentation and itching is common with characteristic lesions.   Direct clinical examination. Best regards.\n\n",

I've had numerous tests - blood, sonogram of abdomen, stress test and ultrasound of heart, refraction test of gallbladder, upper GI, colonoscopy.  All of which have come up fairly normal.  (I have Mitral Valve Prolapse and some Gastritis, Divercular stomach.  Also have been diagnosed with two UTI's in the past month.  Now here is the strange thing.....every time they give me an antibiotic for the UTI - I have an allergic reaction (hives, Lip swelling, eyelid slightly swollen, and severe nausia)  I've tried Ceprafloxin, Bactrim, and Macrobid - all with reactions.  I've very scared to try anything else....  Now I was reading where if you take too much antibiotic you can develop more severe reactions like Candida.  I might have had a minor case of vaginal Candida a month ago but it went away on it's own and have no other symptoms.  While taking one of the Bactrim I developed white patches on my tongue, but it has since disappeared.  My question is could the Candida infection have spread and is causing me to feel so bad?  I have read a little about systemic Candida - but how would I know if I had that?  What kind of doctor would I see for this kind of problem?  Also, I am having a complete oversion to sugary things - I feel sick if I eat sugary food.  Can you please give me some advice?  Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I advise you to consult an allergist or to follow up with the previous allergist who examined you before.  Your symptoms are suggestive of allergic reaction which could be due to certain type of food (sugars, in that case it is named intolerance) or  infection.  The fact that you have been diagnosed with urinary tract infection makes infection a possible cause. Thus cultures should be done to identify the causative organism. In any case it should be done for the specific antibiotic description.  The allergen-specific antibody test is usually done to test individuals for being allergic to one or more substances.  I advise you also to repeat the blood picture, sugar tests and do the glucose intolerance test. If you have not been checked for the Vit B12 and folic acid blood levels, I advise you to do them. Thyroid function tests are also advisable.  Regarding systemic candidaiasis, your symptoms are not suggestive in addition to systemic fungal infection occur in immunosuppressed individuals, your Doctor will not miss this. But it is possible to have a form of urinary or GI candida infection during periods of stress, after antibiotics, or any other cause of temporary decline in the immune system or changes in the local environment.  Keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

These are also known as 'Shotty Lymph nodes'.   Individuals with history of recurrent upper respiratory, ear, throat dental, etc tend to have clinically palpable lymph nodes in their neck.   Nodes are generally considered to be normal if they are up to 1 cm in diameter.   Of significance, an increase in nodal size on serial examinations. Hence nodes that continue to grow in size are important and those that regress in size after infection control tend to be more reassuring.    Best regards.\n\n",

As the days went on I looked more carefully and saw that the tiny red bumps had a white head that just brushed off when I touched it as well as the skin easily peeled off on my shaft. Its been approx 4 days and there is no more lumps, just redness on my shaft and a few red spots that kind of look like spider veins on the head. Any idea what this could be??\n\n",

It's not simply giving yourself more time to think about it or looking for the right time to come in your life. You are choosing a course of action\u2014making a conscious, active decision. The short-term benefits of not getting treatment are obvious. The long-term effects of this decision may not be so apparent.  Here's what you risk:  Scarring of your liver (fibrosis), which may have been slowed, prevented, or even reversed by treatment  Cirrhosis: severe liver damage that may lead to liver failure  The development of liver cancer  The need for a liver transplant   There are people who have Hep-C and still live a fullfilled life once they went thrugh the treatment. If insurance/cost is determining factor then I suggest go to your local county hospital to begin treatment and I suggest you join a local support group of individuals who are going thru the Hep-C treatment.  You may want to take  Centrum Silver to get the additional vitamins your body needs. I am suggesting Centrum Silver as you indicated you are post- menopausal.

If I am statistically correct, Hepatitis C is one of the commonest indications for liver transplant in United States.   Few points you must be aware of :-  Chronic Hepatitis C can (statistically variable) progress to Cirrhosis. And cirrhosis again can progress to liver cancer.  Combination therapy of -Interferon and Ribavirin before the development of cirrhosis has shown very promising results in Hepatitis C. High cost is the major factor in this mode of treatment.

    "content": "Hello,   The swelling you have described that is felt on the right upper side of the neck (I assumed from what you said -jugualr-)  is probably enlarged Lymph nodes as it occurs in a Lymph node region, however this must be confirmed by your physician.   Abnormal Lymph node enlargement commonly results from infection / immune response, cancer.   Following infection Lymph nodes become enlarged, painful and tender (most likely to be the cause in your case).   A history of throat infection is usually present, as this lymph node could be a reactionary to infection in the area drained by this lymph node group (most likely to be the cause in your case). .   After recovery or treatment of infection with adequate course of antibiotics, they regress in size but never to normal size.   Hence nodes that continue to grow in size are significant and those that regress in size tend to be more reassuring.   Direct clinical examination is essential. I advise you to consult your doctor for proper management.  Keep us updated.  Best regards.\n\n",

I recently went to the docs regarding my forskin becoming tight over the penis head, he reassured me that the skin will remember & if i gently tease the foreskin back over time it will eventually remember that it can go all the way back over the head...which did happen.  But, I was masturbating yesterday (the 1st time since pulling the foreskin back) & when ejaculating I had a massive pain & there was blood as well as semen. My whole penis has been very sensitive since then & the foreskin no longer goes back over the head. I have also noticed a swelling on the underside of the shaft close to the head.  Can anyone advise what has happend & what I should do? Any advice is appreciated  I am planning on going to my docs asap to get this checked as the tenderness is uncomfortable.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Balanitis is inflammation of the glans penis commonly seen in uncircumscribed men. It usually causes redness and/or a blotchy rash on the glans, sometimes with a discharge. Balanitis involving the foreskin or prepuce is termed balanoposthitis. The most common complication of balanitis is phimosis, or inability to retract the foreskin from the glans penis.  Balanoposthitis may have any of multiple bacterial and fungal origins. Complex infections also have been well documented. These often are due to a poorly retractile foreskin and poor hygiene that leads to colonization and overgrowth.   Anaerobic organisms have been associated with the diagnosis, although in most cases, the patient is treated empirically and a specific organismal etiology is not obtained. Candidal infection appears to be the most common cause of disease. The condition in older adult men often has other etiologies, including intertrigo; irritant dermatitides; and candidal, viral, or fungal infections.   Treatment centers on antibiotics / antifungal treatment, improved hygiene and treatment of eczema if present. Circumcision may be needed in some cases.   Blood in semen may be the result of inflammation, infection, blockage, or injury anywhere along the male reproductive tract. It may indicate disease or a problem within the urethra, testicles, epididymis, or prostate.  Given the limitations of the internet as a diagnostic tool, you are advised to seek a direct clinical examination to reach the proper diagnosis.\n\n",

    "content": "22 years old, female (180 cm, 73 kilos), no relevant prior diagnoses or surgeries, each of my parents have had cancer (mother - skin cancer on the face, successful surgery, father - colon cancer, successful surgery)  My gums sourrounding my lower right wisdom tooth are very swollen and sore.  My wisdom teeth are still coming in (upper right has crowned, lower two are only partially poking through my gums, and upper left has not yet begun to errupt).  When I went to my dentist about extraction (8 months ago), he said none of them are impacted, and that I could wait a year or so before having them pulled, since it would be easier to do once they have come in further.  I have had minor incidences of sore/swollen gums around my wisdom teeth, but they usually faded in about two days, and never got very bad.  However, the pain of the current swelling woke me up in the middle of the night.  In the morning when I examined my gums, I noticed that the swelling also encompasses the area around my bottom right molar that is furthest back (32?).  I also discovered that I have broken out with about 8 small cold-sores on my lip (clustered together on the right side of my lower lip), something not uncommon for me when my immune system is low (happens about twice a year).  Additionally, my lymph node underneath the my jaw on the right side is very tender, and hurts if I so much as arch my neck too far.  I am hoping there is something non-antibiotic related that I can do for this infection.  I suspect it's just due to my errupting molar and that my gums are a little sensitive and prone to infection.  Swishing with salt water or anti-bacterial mouth wash would help, right?  Does my guess about what this is seem reasonable?  Any suggestions would be helpful.  thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Your assessment seems correct, but I would caution you that if the inflammation does not subside, and the swollen lymph nodes continue, over the course of maybe another 5 days of so, and you develop further signs of possible infection (increasing pain, a foul discharge from that spot in your mouth, a temperature, for example) you should contact your doctor or dentist for possible anitbiotics. The canker sores may just be from an upset to your \"normal\" body chemistry, and should subside on their own. Also, you should make sure that you are diligent about oral hygiene, brushing your teeth at least twice a day and flossing daily. Staying away from simple sugars (ie, sweetened drinks, candy, even lots of fruit juices) and rinsing your mouth frequently, even with just plain warm water, will help keep things clean. Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water, too, and warm tea can be soothing (hot may be difficult to tolerate). An anti-inflammatory pain reliever that your doctor recommends as safe for you to take would also help with pain relief. Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "When you were prescribed the antibiotics did they do a throat culture to see if you indeed did have streptococcal pharyngitis?  Strep throat can cause the sore throat and exudate.  Typically, the antibiotics do not shorten the course of the illness, they only prevent the complication of rheumatic heart disease.  This may explain why your throat continues to hurt.  For strep throat, the best antibiotic is still penicillin.  If the antibiotic you were on was amoxicillin and you developed a rash, you almost certainly have mono.  This is a well known reaction between the virus and antibiotic.    If you do not get better soon, it is very reasonable to be checked for mono.  Typically, mono does present with fatigue, ill feelings, sore throat, etc. but the absence of these symptoms do not exclude mono.  A simple blood test called a monospot should suffice for you.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

He then said that it was most likely an infection caused by another bacteria since I have red, swollen tonsils, pus on my tonsils, swollen lymph nodes, and a really sore throat.  To fight the infection, he prescribed me penicillin, a nasal decongestant, and Tylenol for pain.  I am almost done with my 10 day penicillin prescription.  My sore throat and fever is gone; however, my tonsils still have pus on them.  They may be a little less swollen and red then they wore a couple of weeks ago as well.  Anyway, does it usually take longer for the tonsils to return back to normal, or do I need to go back to the doctor and get another evaluation?  Do I need more antibiotics or could the bacteria be resistant to the penicillin that he prescribed me?  What would be the cause of this?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Tonsils are located on each side of the back of the throat, directly behind and above the base of the tongue. When tonsils are swollen and red the condition is named tonsillitis.   Inflammation of the tonsils is common as they are the filters for bacteria and virus entering through the aero-digestive tract.   White lesions on the tonsil or on the  throat , are most probably due to either an infection with a bacteria named group A streptococci  or a virus Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).  These conditions are usually associated with fever, and in the case of the bacterial infection, obviously a coarse of antibiotic would help in treating the condition. In the case of streptococcal infection, a simple throat swab and culture would define the causative agent.  A 10-day course of antibiotic pills are usually sufficient to treat to cases with A streptococcal pharyngitis. Tonsillitis symptoms usually lessen in 2 or 3 days after treatment starts. In some conditions it may require more than one course of antibiotics to cure.  Exudative pharyngitis due to  EBV is usually confusing with group A streptococcal pharyngitis, to add more difficulty in the diagnosis concomitant infection of both agents occurs in 30% of people. Sore throat, perhaps a strep throat that doesn't get better with antibiotics is due to EBV infection.  However other physical and clinical signs are characteristic to EBV infection would help the physician to differentiate between these two causes.  Moreover, specific serological tests,(detection of antigens and or antibodies to a specific antigen from the infecting agent  like as the monospot and heterophile antibody tests can help in the diagnosis of CMV infections.  I advise you to follow with your doctor. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I am not expert in this area, but I would advise you to consult both the veteranian Doctor and her Doctor.  They should communicate together as diseases that affect sheep are variable and are geographically different.   Examples of blood borne disease are viral infections.   If there is any center for infectious diseases close to your place it would be more beneficial to go for their consultation.  An important information, not all organisms that infect animals do not infect humans, and if so they do not surely cause diseases as the body immune system is able to control most of the foreign organisms that are introduced into our body efficiently in most of the times.  Keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "My father was recently diagnosed with sepsis, in his case urosepsis.  He is 81 years old, and has a long list of other medical conditions including diabeties, congestive heart failure, arthritis, and macular degeneration, blood clots, and the list goes on.    Prior to the diagnosis, my father stopped making sense, and showed many of the signs of having a stroke.  He started having halucinations or dillusions, Im not sure which is the proper term.  The doctor insured us that once on the antibiotics that would stop in a day or two, but it continued for about 5 days and then miraculously  it stopped and it appeared my father was going to pull through.    After a few days of being \"normal\" my father seems to be reverting back.  Is this a sign that his condition is getting worse?    Unfortunately I'm not the family member that has the authority to ask questions, and she wont  ask them on her own so I would appreciate a few suggestions of what I should demand she ask the doctors!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi justtc, Sepsis, especially in the elderly, is very serious and may become very debilitating. Also, just the fact of being out of the normal every day environment has the potential to cause confused episodes. Since his symptoms seem to be worsening again, has he been febrile, had repeat blood and urine cultures done? Sometimes an adjustment of dosage or a change in the antibiotic altogether is indicated. In my opinion, at the very least, an inquiry to the general labwork results in comparison to the previous ones, as well as cultures, and febrile episodes. Best wishes. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

I don't believe any tests have been done in the last week or so.  The diagnosis was made at a small hospital in WV and before the holidays he was put into a nursing home/rehab facility.  The day he was released an MRI was done and we were told he had a small stroke or tia.    I'm not sure I understand the term \"febrile\" correctly, but I beliee it has to do with the cardiac muscle...  I do know that several nights ago he felt as though he was having a heart attack and requested his nitro pill.  He was extremely upset because he was refused his medication, and it has been since that episode that his condition has worstened.  My own research gives me reason to believe my dad has been dealing with sepsis for quite some time.  Several months ago he lost his ability to stand.  He is a severe arthrtiic and at the time I thought nothing of it due to his age, health...but now find myself questioning many things.  Could you give me a lfew suggestions to ask ..or have someone ask, his medical provider?  Your help would greatly appreciated.\n\n",

I have read through material and searched extensively online and I can not find a clear answer on exactly how they are spread. My main question: Can either be spread by kissing?   It is my understanding that once MRSA is contracted, you basically have it for life. How does this affect myself as well as our children?  If you know of a informative website that is more in \"layman's\" terms with information, please direct me there. As you can tell, I have plenty of questions and am simply not getting answers here at the hospital.  Thank you in advance for your help.\n\n",

Risk factors for infection include history of using antibiotics; underlying diseases or conditions such as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus,  skin lesions; invasive procedures e.g dialysis; urinary catheters; past hospitalization and long hospital stays.  People may be carriers(no symptoms) or infected (with symptoms) with these germs.   At home healthy individuals are at low risk of catching the infection. Even for hospital visitors, casual contact - like kissing, hugging, and touching - is acceptable.   -Hand washing is the most important way to prevent the spread.  - cleaning all the towels and the environment soiled with the patient body fluid. -Notify doctors and other health care personnel that he has this form of resistant strain to take precautions when using procedures that may transmit infection to others.  I advise you also to consult the health-care professional in the hospital where he got the infection for more information and Guidelines.  Keep us updated.\n\n",

I'm able to pull the skin all the way back and it covers my whole penis and looks normal when not pulled back.  Upon further inspection I noticed that the lips on my penis also seem swollen, and where the little hole where the urine comes out seems to have a little red around it.  I had sex several times last night with my girlfriend.  Can anyone help me out with what this might be? Should I inform my partner right away and go see a doctor or can tis be cleared up on it's own?  I don't feel any pain or itching at the moment.  Thanks\n\n",

Viral infections include herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1); herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2); human herpesvirus (HHV); varicella zoster virus (VZV); Mycoplasma pneumoniae; influenza B; adenovirus; coxsackievirus; Ebstein-Barr virus; hepatitis A, B, and C; cytomegalovirus (CMV); and rubella virus.  There is no specific laboratory tests to diagnose Bell palsy, however some tests are requested for etiological diagnosis that include the immunological detection for viral infection (Immunoglobulin M (IgM), immunoglobulin G (IgG), and immunoglobulin A (IgA) titers for the viruses mentioned above, decided on the clinical setting.  Antiviral agents are commonly recommended  like Acyclovir, but other antiviral agents may be appropriate.  Hope this information is useful. Follow up with your Doctor is essential.

    "content": "If I understand your history correctly you've had a significant amount of flow for the last five years.  Is this correct?  Do you have days with no flow?  Do you experience any pain or burning sensations?  While women can have increased vaginal discharge that is normal, there are many other causes of vaginal discharge, including yeast infections and STD's.  Things such as malodorous discharge and pain point more towards infection of some type.  Given the long chronicity of your problem, I'd recommend a gynecological evaluation.  You can talk with your gynecologist regarding what is actually going on.  As far as what to tell her, just tell her what you've been experiencing.  If she needs more information, your doctor will ask.  Even if this is considered a non-illness, there may be some treatments that can reduce the flow so you can have a more comfortable day.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  It would be more helpful if you could describe more these lesions.  However, it could be a Dermatitis.   Dermatitis is referred to different types of skin rashes that are caused by infections, allergies, and irritants.   The severity of the rash range from mild to severe according to the cause. There might be Itching on many cases.   - Folliculitis is an infection of the hair follicles. Forming small, white-headed Bumps in hair follicles (roots).  Lesions may be Itching. Superficial folliculitis resolves spontaneously in a few days, while deep or recurring folliculitis should be medically treated.   - Seborrheic Dermatitis occurs on any part of the body where the skin is oily or greasy.   They usually flare in winter and become less in summer.   Secondary bacterial infections may occur and Antibiotic lotions, cream and or systemic form are used for treatment.  Otherwise, specific lotions and shampoo are used for treatment.   - Although it sounds strange to think of Acne, but your description is very suggestive of Acne. In reality many people may have Acne in the pubic region even without having this on the usual areas like face and chest.   Other causes include:   - Contact Dermatitis occurs due to skin contact with a substance that causes an allergic reaction (allergic contact Dermatitis)  or with an irritant substances (irritant contact Dermatitis).   There are many causes for contact Dermatitis some involve irritants such as soaps, certain creams and some may be due to allergy.   Avoiding the causing substance is the mainstay of prevention in addition to medications prescribed by your doctor.   These lesions appeared before you have been tested Negative for STDs, so the possibility of being due to STDs is less likely.  Direct clinical examination is essential for diagnosis. I advise you to follow with your doctor.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  This could be a condition known as balanitis. Are you uncircumscribed?  Balanitis is inflammation of the glans penis commonly seen in uncircumscribed men. It usually causes redness and/or a blotchy rash on the glans, sometimes with a discharge. Balanitis involving the foreskin or prepuce is termed balanoposthitis. The most common complication of balanitis is phimosis, or inability to retract the foreskin from the glans penis.  Balanitis is not sexually transmitted. It results from an overgrowth of organisms which are normally present on the skin of the glans. The condition most commonly occurs in uncircumcised men. The environment under the foreskin is warm and moist, and these conditions often favor the growth of the organisms that cause balanitis. These organisms are especially likely to grow if moisture is allowed to persist under the foreskin for a while. This may occur if you have not washed for a couple of days, or sometimes after sexual activity (vaginal, oral or anal - with or without a condom).  You should seek medical attention in order to treat this condition.  Best regards,\n\n",

Balanitis involving the foreskin or prepuce is termed balanoposthitis. The most common complication of balanitis is phimosis, or inability to retract the foreskin from the glans penis.  Balanoposthitis may have any of multiple bacterial and fungal origins. Complex infections also have been well documented. These often are due to a poorly retractile foreskin and poor hygiene that leads to colonization and overgrowth.   Anaerobic organisms have been associated with the diagnosis, although in most cases, the patient is treated empirically and a specific organismal etiology is not obtained. Candidal infection appears to be the most common cause of disease. The condition in older adult men often has other etiologies, including intertrigo; irritant dermatitides; and candidal, viral, or fungal infections.   Treatment centers on antibiotics / antifungal treatment, improved hygiene and treatment of eczema if present. Circumcision may be needed in some cases.   Given the limitations of the internet as a diagnostic tool, you are advised to seek a direct clinical examination to reach the proper diagnosis.  I think you should bring it up to your parents. You do not need to discuss masturbation with your parents if that is what is embarrassing you. But you should tell them that the foreskin is inflammed.  Best regards,\n\n",

Transmission also can occur by exposure of a scratch, abrasion, open wound or mucous membrane to saliva or brain material of a rabid animal.  It would also be very unlikely for your meat supplier / restaurant to cook rabid animals. No you can't get it through eating.  Best regards,\n\n",

I assume the neurological event has occured 30 yrs after the GBS episode.   The stroke/epilepsy in this case seems to be because of the other causes and noto due to past(30yrs) histroy of GBS.

Staphylococci exist as part of the natural microflora of the human skin, the nostrils,  pharynx, and the intestinal tract. About a quarter of the population are permanent carriers of Staphylococcus aureus. Transmission is most frequently by direct contact with an infected individual but may be by air or via fomites. There are several host factors that may increase one's susceptibility to staphylococcal infections. The most common factor is injury to the skin or mucous membranes caused by abrasions, trauma, burns, or insect bites. Invasion of  injured skin by Staphylococcus aureus may result in furuncles, carbuncles, impetigo or cellulitis.  Other predisposing factors are diabetes mellitus, renal failure, foreign bodies in the human body (such as indwelling intravenous catheters, tracheostomies, orthopaedic  prostheses), malnutrition, chronic alcohol abuse, malignancies and old age.

That is the typical presentation, but by no means the only one.   They require no treatment.

They may be infected, trichomycosis in the case of sweat glands and folliculitis in the case of hair follicles.   They may be visible as small nodules or might only be felt as small lumps in the skin. They are yellow/black or red nodules on the hair shafts in the inguinal region. Nodules are often on the scrotum and occasionally on the base of the shaft of the penis. They may contain pus in them.   The hallmark is that they will have a hair arising from them that reveals their true nature. These lesions can be associated with erythema and itching. Superinfection with other dermatophytes has been noted.  I advised you  to seek a direct clinical examination to reach the proper diagnosis. Only by complete history and physical examination, the correct diagnosis can be reached.   Hope you find this information useful. Best regards,\n\n",

The space between the nail apparatus and nail fold is a weak area in the body's defences. Trauma (cutting nail too deep), or abrasions around the nail fold promote the entry of offending organisms.

    "content": "Dear renee, Tonsils are located on each side of the back of the throat, directly behind and above the base of the tongue. When tonsils are swollen and red the condition is named tonsillitis. Inflammation of the tonsils are common as they are the filters for bacteria and virus entering through the aero-digestive tract. Viruses and bacteria can cause tonsillitis with specific clinical symptoms and signs. Repeated infections are commonly caused by viruses like infectious mononucleosis (the Epstein-Barr virus) and bacteria lik e(Streptococcus group A), in both cases white patches are seen over the swollen tonsils. Diagnosis needs careful examination in addition to certain investigation like Swab and culture and blood tests. Symptoms of tonsillitis include: Severe sore throat, Pain during swallowing  Headache  Fever and chills  Enlarged Lymph nodes felt as tender swellings under the neck You have to consult your doctor as soon as possible. Mean while best rest, drink more warm fluids, use gargle with warm salt water and Honey and lemon , they will have a soothing effect on your throat. Best regards,\n\n",

I never had tried to diagnose myself so I am not one to be on line asking questions like this but I am scared.     I have been taking Bextra for over 9 months and this past week I developed a tongue lesion.  My husband and I thought it was an ulcer but I haven't had ulcers for years and this didn't clear up.  Also on the weekend I thought my back went out but nothing specific happened.  It's just the lower back is killing me.  My eyes also have been burning for months at times.  Well, today my husband's e-mail popped up with Bextra side effects and mentioned this Stevens Johnson Syndrome and symptoms.  Well, it got me scared and now I think maybe my lower back pain is really my kidneys hurting.    Do you think I have reason to be alarmed?    Pleave respond as soon as possible.  THANK YOU! Martie Drager\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Martie Drager, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome is a life threatening skin disease that usually results from a drug reaction Stevens-Johnson Syndrome starts with non-specific symptoms such as:  Coughing , Aching , Headach, fever and  GI disturbances A patchy rash usually procedes other symptoms and moves across the body. Blisters or inflamtion of the mucous membranes then starts. The nose, eyes,  vagina and the mouth are the mostly affected areas. Stevens-Johnson Syndrome is one of the side effects of the drug, Bextra. An important infornmation about this condition, is that it takes one or two weeks to manifest these symptoms from the first time of the drug intake. Although your symptoms started after 9 months of the drug intake,under any circumstances, your complaints are warning. I advise you to stop the drug and consult you your doctor as soon as possible. Best of luck,\n\n",

    "title": "Could this be pleurisy?",
    "content": "My troubles started in April after a series of really bad migraines. I was put on 25 mg of Topomax (to work up to 75 mg) for migraine preventative. I had used Topomax before with great success, but this time was different... Really bad anxiety, feeling out of it, slurred speech, etc. This all resulted in an ER visit with chest pain. The day I went to the ER, the chest pain would come and go. It would radiate to my jaw and to my back. The pain would last for anywhere from 45 min. to a few hours. My heart rate was high (118, I think), but EKG was fine. They gave me fluids, waited for my heart rate to go down, and sent me home. I am 32, so they said not to worry about it, estrogen was my natural protection against a heart attack (even though I am 5'6\" and am morbidly obese- 290?!). So anyway, the next day I see my doctor. My throat was very red, I had sinus drainage, so I was told I had a respitory infection (no fever though). Amoxicillin and Allerga D. I went home and the chest pain still happened daily (mostly at night, with some heart palpitations). I called back in a few days after no change. They said come back in. My throat was still red, Dr. said, wrong antibiotic and gave me Levaquin, 500 mg for ten days. It worked. Chest pain went away. Eleven days later, after finishing meds, the chest pain came back. Dr. called in amoxicillin and went on vacation. The Amoxicillin once agin, did nothing. So I had six days of Levaquin, 750 mg, at home, and I decided to take it. Chest pain left. Now, seven days later, Levaquin is gone, pain is back. Dr is on vacation. This time, my chest pain started in my left arm pit and spread through the left side of my chest and eventually to my shoulder and back. It was awful last night. I am scared to go to sleep (my aunt died in her sleep of a heart attack at age 50, she had a dr appt the next day for chest pain she had been having). Today, chest pain is still there on left side of chest and in my back/shoulder. My neck (not throat but on the outside) feels tight and swollen. I have no fever, no cough, no normal symptoms of a respitory illness (I am prone to sinus infections), no congestion. ??? What is this??? and why does Levaquin help? Also, I have had really bad indisgestion at night and swollen ankles, feet, and fatigue. Is indigestion and edema a side effect of the anitbiotics? Could this be pluerisy?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Your complaint although seems so confusing and difficult to be interpreted into one of the common causes of chest pain including pleurisy. however,  hopefully I think that the pain you describe it is due to a very benign causes, which is anxiety and rapid breathing. Anxiety and rapid breathing is one of the known causes of chest pain, probably due to exertion of the respiratory muscles, hyperventilation effect, indigestion and nerve pain. In this case the pain is usually felt as pressure inside the chest that radiate to the neck and shoulders all around the sides and the back. And is sometimes associated with the feeling of numbness around lips and hands. In this case all what would help you is to lie down, relax and try to slow the rate of breathing. Breathing also inside a bag kept loosely around nose and mouth would improve the symptoms. I should emphasize that this diagnosis is made primarily after exclusion of all other causes of chest pain by careful history taking and physical examination by your physician, in addition to all the required investigations.    Best ragards,\n\n",

    "content": "Hi rocknroll3487, Since you are not sexually active then you are right regarding your symptoms not being caused by a STD as these infections are contracted by sexual activity with a partner. Both women and men are sometimes affected by yeast/fungal infections. When symptoms arise in men, common complaints are redness,  itching, flaking/ peeling skin, discomfort, etc. Conditions that may predispose one to this type of an infection are Diabetes/Endocrine dysfunction, recent treatment with antibiotics, balantitis in uncircumcised men,  etc. A physical examination by your physician would determine if this is the causative factor for your symptoms, and if so, usual treatment is anti-fungal preparations. I would suggest an evaluation. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

Bladder infections are caused by a lower urinary tract infection because the bacteria essentially enters the urethra, moves upward through the urinary tract and enters the bladder. These type of infections are treated with a course of antibiotics and plenty of fluids. It's important to take all of the medication as prescribed even if one feel's better before the full course is taken. Untreated bladder infections may cause serious complications. As for abstaining from intercourse, generally speaking, it's typically recommended while symptoms are present. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Cbeautifulx100  what you have described could be a yeast infection. you did not mention if you are having itching or just only the white discharge.  There are some over the counter medications that usually help decreasing and treating the symptoms. However, we cannot assume that it is for sure a yeast infection.   There is no need to feel embarrassed about it, because these are in fact the most common infections in women.  if you feel that you have itching with white discharge, trying over the counter medications will not cause any harm. and you can ask a pharmacist.  however, if what you have is not a yeast infection,  it is important to have it checked by a doctor, because over the counter cream wont treat it. And again it is necessary to meet with your medical provider because it's easy to think you have a yeast infection when you may really have a more serious infection or condition such as chlamydia or gonorrhea.   Thank you very much, and i hope you feel better.\n\n",

    "content": "One other condition to consider here is bacterial vaginosis (BV).  In a female who has not been sexually exposed or is not sexually active, a whitish or greyish vaginal discharge which coats the vulva uniformly, emits a musty or fishy smell, and causes no vulval irritation, is very suggestive of bacterial vaginosis.  BV is not regarded as a true infection or a sexually transmitted disease, but is associated with douching and multiple sexual partners. Yeast infection may cause one symptom or several, and symptoms can range from mild to severe. The telltale signs of yeast infection include itching, burning, soreness, swelling of the vagina and vulva and a discharge. The typical discharge linked to yeast infection is yoghurt-like in appearance and smells strongly of yeast. Some females, however, have a watery or mild-smelling discharge.  Diagnosis can only be made by physical examination and simple laboratory tests, so get examined to determine the cause.

    "title": "Stomach Infection for Two Months?",
    "content": "My husband and I (both age 32)  have a stomach problem that appears to be un diagnosable. We have both had upset stomach with loose stools or diarrhea for nearly two months now.  My Dr. has ruled out all the following: h.pylori, e.coli, cyclospora, cryptospora, and ghiardia.  I've had numerous blood and stool tests without result, and my upper GI series was completely normal. Our Dr. keeps telling us that we're completely normal, but we're still feeling sick - I'm hoping that someone on the forum can help me out.  For about a week before the acute symptoms hit, I had reflux that was more like vomiting into my mouth without the full on vomiting.  Then the vomiting really hit me, and I had very watery (but not bloody) diarrhea for a few  days.  The ER Dr. thought this was a stomach virus, since an MRI and x-rays showed no problems.  Normally I've got a strong appetite, but for the next month I had no appetite and felt constantly nauseated.  Within a week of my acute symptoms, my husband had the same exact thing.  He still has reflux very badly, and we can only eat small amounts of bland foods.  I'm drinking plenty of water, and am definitely not pregnant.   I've lost about 10% of my body weight, and still my appetite is weak.  What kind of infection could cause us to still be ill after two months?  Can salmonella hang on this long?  Any thoughts would be most appreciated - I'm at wits end!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi budgie2, Since you and your husband are both suffering the same symptoms it would seem to indicate a possible infection is present. I see that you stated that you have been tested for some types of infections but what about for example, C-Diff (Clostridium difficle)? Symptoms often encountered with this infection are abdominal discomfort, mucous in stools, foul smelling, diarrhea, gastrointestinal upset. Although this infection is often associated with hospitalization and long term care facilities it also is associated with certain antibiotics as well as transmission from contaminated surfaces, person to person, etc. I would suggest that you not only inquire about whether or not testing has been completed for this particular disorder but also testing for toxic heavy metals which is also a cause GI disturbances. If infections and toxic heavy metals are ruled out, I see where you stated that you had diagnostic xrays but what about any endoscopy procedures? Has this been completed or mentioned? Symptoms resulting from an infection caused by Salmonella typically last approximatly a week. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

I have access to all my test results online through my Dr's office, so will go back and check whether they tested for c.difficile or heavy metals.  They tested me for cryptosporidium and cyclospora because I asked - I  know that test is not normally done.  Those were the only things I could find which might last a long time and come and go as our symptoms have.  My husband is a student in social work graduate school, and has a placement at a rest home this year - that makes me suspicious about c.difficile.  I'll update later on.\n\n",

They also did an ova & parasite culture x1, which doesn't explain exactly what they're testing for, but I think that is where they checked for e.hystolica, shighella, and yersinia.  That test also came back negative, as it did for my husband.  I think they also did check for heavy metals - we have both had about a dozen different blood tests to check for what kind of nutrients, antibodies, and everything else in there.  My husband had elevated liver enzymes, which have gone down slowly over the last month.  He has no general health issues that would explain that, so my Dr. is monitoring him on that.  She's stumped as to what we could have.  The gastroenterologist I saw said I'm completely healthy.  I forgot to mention that I haven't had endoscopy or a lower gi series.  I did have ultrasound of my abdomen done, with no anomolies showing.  The upper gi was so unpleasant I'm scared to do more testing.  Are there any other infections that are not commonly tested for that I should look into?  Is it possible that whatever infection we did have caused some damage that will just take some time to work itself out?  Thanks again for all your help!\n\n",

    "content": "Crohn\u2019s disease affects men and women equally and seems to run in some families. About 20 percent of people with Crohn\u2019s disease have a blood relative with some form of inflammatory bowel disease, most often a brother or sister and sometimes a parent or child. Crohn\u2019s disease can occur in people of all age groups, but it is more often diagnosed in people between the ages of 20 and 30. People of Jewish heritage have an increased risk of developing Crohn\u2019s disease, and African Americans are at decreased risk for developing Crohn\u2019s disease.  Several theories exist about what causes Crohn\u2019s disease, but none have been proven. The human immune system is made from cells and different proteins that protect people from infection. The most popular theory is that the body\u2019s immune system reacts abnormally in people with Crohn\u2019s disease, mistaking bacteria, foods, and other substances for being foreign. The immune system\u2019s response is to attack these \u201cinvaders.\u201d During this process, white blood cells accumulate in the lining of the intestines, producing chronic inflammation, which leads to ulcerations and bowel injury.  Scientists do not know if the abnormality in the functioning of the immune system in people with Crohn\u2019s disease is a cause, or a result, of the disease. Research shows that the inflammation seen in the GI tract of people with Crohn\u2019s disease involves several factors: the genes the patient has inherited, the immune system itself, and the environment. Foreign substances, also referred to as antigens, are found in the environment. One possible cause for inflammation may be the body\u2019s reaction to these antigens, or that the antigens themselves are the cause for the inflammation. Some scientists think that a protein produced by the immune system, called anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF), may be a possible cause for the inflammation associated with Crohn\u2019s disease  MaryAnn RN\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Maja:  It's been a while since you posted. I just located this website today but I noticed that a lot of posts are not replied to.  I had/have active EBV as well. In answer to your question about doctors and getting help, have you been to a naturopathic doctor? I went to a ND who prescribed a variety of supplements to address building up my immune system. It took several months, but slowly I felt a little better.  The interesting thing with EBV is that you seem to have peaks and valleys in how well you feel. That is the way it has been for me. It's 3 years since my EBV activated and I still don't feel like my normal self. I've actually forgotten what feeling normal/well feels like!  The ND I was seeing was very helpful in identifying (from simple blood work) a number of things that were going on with me. It wasn't just the EBV that was making me sick. I also had Hashimoto's Thyroiditis (an autoimmune condition that causes a low functioning thyroid), Iron deficiency anemia with a low ferritin level, Vitamin D deficiency, Psoriasis, and my adrenals were not functioning too well. My immune system wasn't working very well.  When you find another doctor hopefully they will do  more labwork to see if anything else may be goin on with your body's chemistry. There are lots of reasons for why people feel chronic, unrelenting fatigue.  I hope you are able to feel better soon.\n\n",

    "content": "Hallo Karen,  Thanks a lot for taking your time and writing an answer! I really appreciate that!!  It is always good \u2013 in a way \u2013 to hear that other people have almost the same experience as I have. It makes one feel lonely a lot of times with what one has to deal with. I guess you know what I\u2019m talking about if people tell you that they wouldn\u2019t have guessed that you are feeling really sick by the way you look like, right? What I mean is, one can be even lucky, to look pale enough so that they have a little bit of a clue, what is going on. Who can \u201csee\u201d fatigue? Or maybe headaches? Sometimes it is really hard to explain what is going on with me. Sometimes I\u2019m tired of even talking about it and explaining myself.   I am really really sorry to hear that you suffer from EBV as well. Three years is a long time and I know sooooo well when you say you barely can remember how it is to feel well. Do you feel sometimes too, IF you have a moment of feeling well, that you would like to do 20 things at the same time to use the situation of feeling healthy? By the way, right now, right here, I\u2019m feeling like this, after having had a super bad migraine almost the whole day.  This is another thing as well: I don\u2019t suffer just from EBV, no\u2026.I have migraines for now almost 20 years as well (over one third of my life\u2026I\u2019m turning 37 in two days). Of course a lot of headaches come with the EBV so I have triple times migraine.    Thank you for your suggestions. Yes, I have thought about going to a naturopathic doctor but I haven\u2019t gone so far. Guess what? Just two days ago I was (finally) shopping for many many supplements (special vitamins and herb stuff). As you can imagine I read already a lot about how to go different ways than a \u201cnormal\u201d doctor suggests. You know, in Germany many people suffer from EBV as well and there a many doctors as well who ignore this sickness, have no knowledge about it or do everything but treating you right. I am in a German forum as well and at least those people over there have some (as far as I know three doctors) who treat EBV. Those docs do a lot of blood work and each patient gets an individual treatment plan including different herbs.   Maybe it is a general problem of mine that I don\u2019t trust those kinds of docs over here yet. Maybe it is just in my head that they have more knowledge in Germany. I am sorry, thinking like that. Unfortunately I can\u2019t just jump over there and get some treatment and then come back. It would be really too expensive!   You know, I live in the states for two years now and since I am here I am sick. You can imagine, that I almost can get the idea if all this makes me sick, too\u2026\u2026It is triple difficult to settle down in a different country with a different language and what is even harder: a DIFFERENT culture!!! Gosh, I can\u2019t tell you how!!   It was interesting to hear what your symptoms are with the EBV. Last September a specialist (doctor for infection diseases) tested my immune system. He did a lot of blood work and he said my immune system isn\u2019t too bad. In other words, there was no gap so that I would need for example extra Vit. D, or E, or what ever. Well, I trusted him. Shouldn\u2019t I? :-o  Two weeks ago I was in a sleep lap. Diagnose: Hypersomnia. (Well, yes guys! I told you before!!) That doc proscribed the medication \u201cProvigil\u201d. Ever heard of it? It is supposed to give you more energy. Yesterday my family do proscribed some steroids again for two weeks. Oh my gosh, there must be going on a lot right now in my body with those energy makers and those supplements. \uf04a In one week I will be Arnold Schwarzenegger.   You described it so well: having EBV means having peaks and valleys. I really hope I will have a \u201cpeak\u201d again soon to finally start working in this country and start an at least normal live again. It seems my life is on hold since I left Germany. Well, about a year ago I finally started to feel \u201chome\u201d here in the states (I\u2019m mentioning that because a lot of people think of course that the one and only reason of having EBV is \u201cbeing here in the states\u201d. Well, I think it is not THAT easy\u2026) and I thought that I could finally do all those things again that I did in Germany. I have always been sick a lot with colds and flues and such (and of course headaches) but this is too much.   Anyway, I could go on and go on but I guess I should better stop and rest so that my headaches don\u2019t come back.  Thanks for reading and once again for responding.  Alles Gute und gute Besserung f\u00fcr dich \u2013 as we Germans would say! (translation: all the best and stay healthy/get well soon).   Maja\n\n",

    "title": "EBV needs to be studied closely.",
    "content": "Hi Maja:   I agree, it is refreshing to chat with someone who understands what you are going through. I can relate to all of what you talked about, except my headaches feel like they are on the verge of a migraine, but they aren't migraine.  EBV is the perfect example of a \"hidden illness\". Outwardly you look fine, but how you feel is a completely different story. When I was my sickest I got so frustrated with people telling me, \"You look great....I'm so glad you're feeling better\". Infact, I wasn't feeling better. I know this sounds silly but sometimes I wished my hair would fall out or something so people could see and that EBV is a real illness that makes people very sick.  When you look like nothing is wrong with you and you feel sick for a long time, people begin to think you are looking for sympathy, or aren't telling the truth about how you feel. You just want your illness validated and better understood. Most regular docs don't know much about EBV, let alone how to help you get well. The advice about getting rest is of course helpful, but it isn't everything. I really do believe that there are things you can do to build yourself back up so you can recover from this terrible virus.  EBV changed my life. I had to resign my job which I could no longer perform. This was a financial burden to my family because I was paying the tuition for my son's schooling at a special needs school. I was falling asleep at meetings at work, I drove off the road twice so I wasn't safe driving, and no matter how much I slept I never felt refreshed. Chronic unrelenting fatigue!!! My sleep cycle was way off kilter and it changed constantly, terrible headaches, feeling like I was coming down with the flu, cryptic tonsils, muscle weakness in my arms and thighs and legs (I was dragging myself around), memory loss, and a mental fog that made me think I was going crazy. I'm probably not telling you about anything you haven't personally experienced yourself.  When I am feeling better I do feel like I can do all the things that I used to be able to so without a problem. And I made that mistake many times. When I overdo, I fall backwards....hence the peaks and valleys. Sometimes I'm feeling pretty good and suddenly I have a set back and I don't have a clue why? It can be very depressing. After a while people don't want to hear that you don't feel well when they ask \"How are you doing?, you LOOK great.\" Then you just respond, \"Fine, how are you?\"...even when you feel like you can't take feeling sick anymore. You understand, right?   Why are you being prescribed steroids? I'd be warry about using steriods. I don't know anything about Provigil other than it stimulates the central nervous system. Why did the doc say he felt steroids were necessary? When your Vit D was tested, did they do Vit D - 25 Hydroxy? The result should be higher than 32 ng/mL. Also was your iron and ferritin level tested? Thyroid tests? Free T3, Free T4, and Antibodies?. DHEA Sulfate, Cortisol throughout the day? My labs came back positive for all of these. It is a good idea to ask for copies of all your labs so you can keep a file of your medical history, also reports for any tests you have done like the sleep study. Then when you have to visit another doctor you have everything they need in addition to being able to track things yourself.  Most insurance plans do not pay for naturopathic care, but if you can afford it find yourself a thorough ND to consult with.  I'm sorry that your illness has prevented you from transitioning to the US. What brought you to Ohio in the first place?   Let me know how you make out. I'll be thinking about you Maja. Wishing you patience and better health.\n\n",

    "title": "I had lots of examinations (ultrasound, MRI, gastrascopy)",
    "content": "Hallo Karen! I am so sorry it took me sooooo long to finally right back again. I had some awful days/weeks with being tired a lot, having a lot of pain and being frustrated a lot. I had \"tones\" of examinations (ultrasound of my heart, MRI of my head, gastrascopy of my stomach). In a way I am a little bit disappointed because the only thing they found was a little irritation of the bottom of my stomach. Of course I am glad, they did not find anything serious but somehow the heavy pain does not fit with the results. Difficult to describe. Before the gastrascopy I was already taking Nexium and afterwards the Doc said to continue taking it. That's it. Guess what? It does not help. Anyway....this is too long of a story.  Still I have to find a doctor who is willing to start a long-term therapie. It doesn't make any sence only to treat things that a coming up at that moment. That is treatment at the surface.   Isn't it unbelievable? I know a treatment that is used by some  doctors in Germany to treat people with Epstein-Barr-Virus and guess what? It works. But please, it is no weared treatment with mirracle medication or what ever.  It is called \"Microimmuntherapie\". People over here don't know it. I haven't found anybody so far.  What is this therapie? Well, difficult to put into only a few words - especially in English. I'll give it a try: highly thinned substances (cytokine, specific nucleic acid) will be given sequentially to deliver concerted information to the immune system. Through this, a defected immuns systme learns to react naturally and effectively.  Karen, your posting really touched my heart and I felt being understood. As well I feel so sorry that your life has changed as well because of this ugly illness. some people have no idea what it means to turn your life up side down. It is more than just changing one or two (bad) habits of life style. It almost feels like starting at zero and everything that used to be a finger snip is more than a big project now. I am so sorry it effects your whole family. I hope you somehow get it managed - especially thinking about the money. I hope you will find a solution for paying for your son's education.   Yes, and this is what makes it even dobble difficult: it not only effects oneself, it effects one's close family and friends as well. They feel so helpless. They have a taff time to understand and except that there is barely something that they can do (thinking about medical help). I guess in the past you had to listen to the most exciting advice as well, hadn't you? Something like: why don't you try this supplement or that? Do you drink a lot of water? Do you sleep enough? Bla bla...  Next week I'll have an appointment with ANOTHER doctor (infectious diseases). It is said, he knows something about EBV. I hope it is more than I already know. :-)  Oh, to answer one of your questions real quick: my husband is the reason why I came to the U.S. We had to take a decision who goes where. Well, my husband does not speak any German so it was an \"esay\" (not literally!!) decision.   How are you doing today? If I could, I would send you bags of power and energy and health. Stay strong! Many greetings, Maja\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Maja:  You've been pretty busy. I'm sorry you've had to go through so much in such a short period of time. I hope your next doctor's visits prove to be more fruitful for you. There are some 'headache sites' with good forums out there in cyber space.   Yes Maja, I've had to listen to a lot of well meaning folks give a lot of well meaning advice over the past 3 years. What I finally learned is to give them  little to no information,  and I attempt to change the subject fast. It doesn't always work, but when it does my frustration is nipped in the bud. The funniest thing was when relative was telling me I should be taking vitamims and excercising, but then they critizised me for taking too many vitamins when I told them....yes, I take 'such and such' vitamins. Go figure!?!   Anyway, we all do the best we can for ourselves and we try our best to keep a positive outlook. The reality is that some days are very difficult and this approach is easier said than done.  I wish you the best in your search for better health. If you find out anything interesting about EBV treatment in your travels let me know.  All the best, Karen\n\n",

The first time that i got them pierced i had no problems, but i took them out when i was pregnant. You still can see where i got them pierced the first time and i asked the piercer to pierce them again in the same spot.  I thought that he did up until today. When i woke up this morning, i noticed that a blister came up and that it was where my nipples were pierced the first time. When i went to go clean it yellow puss came out of the blister and then a little bit of blood.  I do not know what i did wrong because i cleaned them the same way that i cleaned them before. What do you think is wrong and what should i do?\n\n",

    "title": "Question about Mono",
    "content": "Hi, I am an 18 year old college student. On Jan. 6 (5 weeks ago from today) I was at a party and was kissing a girl who later that night told me she had just recovered from mono. Needless to say, I was very unhappy to hear that. In addition to that I'm the type of person who is extremely paranoid about my health. Because of that I've read as much as I could find about mono online and everything said that usually symptoms occur about 4-7 weeks after infection. Well, it's been 5 weeks and I feel fine, except for one thing that began occuring a little less than a week ago. I'm assuming, and hoping, that this is due to my nature of dwelling on things like this too much, but I've been getting little pains in the left side of my abdomen. If I were to actually contract mono I wouldn't be to devestated, I would just like to know for sure. However, this little pain is bothering me (mentally, physically it's just a little pain), because I don't want any problems with my spleen. In addition to this I broke my ankle last August (6 months ago), requiring surgery to repair bone and ligaments and have just recently been able to be normal again. This means that I've been swimming everyday and playing tennis as much as possible to get back in shape again. I wouldn't want my spleen to rupture if indeed it is enlarged... basically I'm just hoping for some answers that will put me at ease, or at least some advice to calm me down, haha. Thanks for reading.\n\n",

In infectious mononucleosis, the first things to appear are: fever, sore throat, headaches, white patches on the back of your throat, swollen glands in your neck, feeling tired and not feeling hungry.  Splenic involvement is RARE.  If still in doubt, get a monospot test done, you'd be negative for mono.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Urinary Tract Infection",
    "content": "Symptoms of UTI or bladder infection are not easy to miss and include a strong urge to urinate that cannot be delayed which is followed by a sharp pain or burning sensation in the urethra when the urine is released. Most often very little urine is released and the urine that is released may be tinged with blood. The urge to urinate recurs quickly and soreness may occur in the lower abdomen, back, or sides.  This cycle may repeat itself frequently during the day or night--most people urinate about six times a day, when the need to urinate occurs more often a bladder infection should be suspected.  When bacteria enters the ureters and spread to the kidneys, symptoms such as back pain, chills, fever, nausea, and vomiting may occur, as well as the previous symptoms of lower urinary tract infection.  Proper diagnosis is vital since these symptoms can also be caused by other problems such as infections of the vagina or vulva. Only your physician can make the distinction and make a correct diagnosis.   A urinary tract infection is treated with antibiotics, however the right one needs to be taken as that many different kinds of bacteria can cause these infections.  Hope you feel better soon.

If you sustain a wound and it has been more than 5 years since you were last vaccinated, some doctors choose to readminister the vaccine.  I would ask your doctor what his protoccol may be.   All wounds should be washed immediately with soap and water.  Keep the wound  covered during possible exposure to dirt or other contaminants.  Tetanus is not the only consequence of a contaminated wound.  If the area surrounding the wound becomes red, warm to touch, and swollen, see your doctor as soon as possible.

    "content": "hellow my name is andrea, I am 18 years of age and I keep feeling this knot like in my neck on the right side,  under my jaw where the neck starts, I cant tell if it is swollen or if it is normal, I can kind of feel it in the same place on the other side of neck also, there is no pain or continuous growing, they seem to have gotten smaller over time it doesnt exactly feel extremly swollen, you have to push down a little to feel it and also on the side of my neck. I do not feel any other abnoralities besides there in my neck, I was just wondering could this be caused by an untreated infection?...a couple of years ago, I think I may have had tonsilitis, it was red,painful, and I had all this white stuff on them, I never got it treated b/c my parents did not have insurance on me, it lasted for almost a week, I know for a fact it was infection by the research I have done. I still feel like there may be infection going on, I do get some white stuff on them still, and it comes off in soft pieces and has a smell. I didnt know what was wrong for awhile and thought I was developing Lymphoma, but I have had No signs of that and I have had my blood tested in the past months of me being pregnant, and my blood work came back perfect, (No STDS or weird blood cell count) I do still get very worried that I may have cancer, but everyones keeps telling me that I am fine, my husband thinks that infection is probably still there and without the use of Antibiotics it is taking longer for the infection to clear up . Oh, also I have always had overlarged tonsils and now they seem like there not big like they use to be after the infection, I mean I don't have problems with my tonsils anymore, I am just so scared about the lymnodes or glands, I just hope it isnt as serious as I think it is, I don't want cancer and I just hope it is something that can be treated with antibiotics. I really need some awnsers, I mean, can it be infection that had settled there? the last time I was sick was about 11 months ago and I think it was upper respitory infection, (weezing, coughing up green/yellow stuff) I don't know how long it has been since I have felt the abnormal gland/or lymphnode( I think its my glands)  I think it was when I had infection in my tonsils, they got swollen and stayed like that for a long time, but after I moved out of my house that was full of cats,dust, and mold(old house) the glands went down, and now I just feel like the right one is still slightly swollen cause of infection.    What could this be?????\n\n",

It is probably a lymph node it occurs in a lymph node region, however this must be confirmed by your physician.  Location: Since I am unclear of the exact location here are two views. The submandibular lymph nodes are located along the underside of the jaw on either side. They drain the tongue, submaxillary gland, lips and mouth, conjunctivae. Common causes of enlargement include infections of head, neck, sinuses, ears, eyes, scalp, pharynx. The jugular lymph nodes lie both on top of and beneath the sternocleidomastoid muscles (SCM) on either side of the neck, from the angle of the jaw to the top of the clavicle. They drain the tongue, tonsil, pinna, parotid. Common causes of enlargement include pharyngitis organisms, rubella. An increase in nodal size on serial examinations is significant. Abnormal lymph node enlargement tends to commonly result from infection / immune response, cancer and less commonly due to infiltration of macrophages filled with metabolite deposits (eg, storage disorders). Sometimes, following infection lymph nodes occasionally remain permanently enlarged, though they should be non-tender, small (less the 1 cm), have a rubbery consistency and none of the characteristics described for malignancy or for infection. These are also known as 'Shotty Lymph nodes'. So essentially I am saying that lymph nodes that decrease in size verses increasing in size over a 3-4 week  period of observation may more than likely be due to an infectious process. Constitutional symptoms such as fever, weight loss, fatigue or night sweats could suggest disorders such as tuberculosis, lymphoma, collagen vascular diseases, unrecognized infection or malignancy so the presence of these symptoms would be more disconcerting. The presence of fever is commonly associated with infections. If you are experiencing a sore throat with white patches which includes a foul odor I would advise you to have an examination by your physician as untreated infections may result in complications. If finances are a concern such as inadequate health insurance etc. I will search for some available assistance in your area if you wish information regarding this matter. I hope this has been somewhat helpful. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

I hope this has been somewhat helpful. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN  Thank you for giving me some awnsers, some of them kind of scared me a little and some made me hope that is what my Diaognosis is. well I figured out where the problem is, I think its my midjugular area like(where the triangle of the jaw and where the neck meets, I think its called your jugular chain). I did a lot of research and I am still kind of confused, I do have Bad sinus problems, I sneeze constantly, especially before I moved out and I coughed a whole lot, I also get this stuff in my eyes, and when I get it out it seems to come out in a string of goo and my eyes are very itchy and I tend to get red around my eyes and nose and everything seems fuzy. My mid nodes don't seem to be getting larger and when I moved out of that dusty house, the 2 nodes that were swollen went down except one that seems to be a little bigger. They don't seem to be extremly hard or very tender, they are painless and very so often when I get sick, they seem to react a little by a slight pain for a second, or maybe its just my imagination, I just pray that it isnt something life threating. I feel fine and I am very entergetic person, I hardly get sick and if I do get sick, its always something to do with my sinuses. I don't get fevers, chills, night sweats or anything like that and I have been living with this problem for quite sometime, I am very scared to go to the doctor right now to find out what it is, only because I am about to be a new mother in a month and if I found out that it is something bad, I don't know what I would do. They are the only 2 nodes that are abnormal, I don't feel anything else besides them, could this be a drainage? or an infection? Does this sound like cancer?                            Thank you for your advice\n\n",

    "content": "Hi AndreaIrwin, Generally speaking lymph nodes 1 cm or less are considered normal except regarding the epitrochlear node (located near the elbow). Infection is a relatively common cause of lymph node enlargement and typically means that the body is functioning appropriately because the lymphatic system is the bodies defense in fighting infection, (viral/bacterial). Since you feel relatively healthy and are experiencing no constitutional symptoms, in my opinion, I would be more inclined to consider this to be of an infectious origin. I would however, advise you to have your physician examine you upon your next visit to have a more definitive opinion because nothing can replace an actual physical exam. I'm sure that your Obstetrician would be able to identify if there is a reason for concern. I hope this has been somewhat helpful. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "Age: 18 Sex: Female  I had my tongue pierced about two weeks ago I had swelling and redness, and a hardening to tissue around the ring that didn't go away so I went to urgent care to if it was infected. I found out it was and the doctor put me on Augmentin 875mg take one tablet by mouth twice daily (every 12 hours). The medicine seemed to work right away the swelling went down, the pain went away,  the hole closed and the hardening decreased. But now since I have finished all of the antibiotic the hardening is still there and seems to growing back in size a little everyday. I was wondering is this just scar tissue or a abscess it is starting to worry me and I need a answer before it gets any bigger. Just to let you know that there is not pain at all, or trouble swallowing, bad breath, or discoloration.\n\n",

I don't know if this is from rubbing or what, as I am currently in a sexual relationship.  Its sore if rubbed for a while, but I don't know how to get rid of it.  It just comes and goes when it pleases.  Its more annoying than anything else, especially since I have to try to hide it from my girlfriend.  It goes away when wet or in the shower and sometimes it will just flake right off and will be gone for a month.  If you have heard of this or have any info on it, I would be much appreciative.\n\n",

Thank you for your time.  hey jessica, do you have swollen lymphnodes under the jaw at the starting of your neck, kind of on the side of your throat?...if yes, I do have the same problem, I have had that for a few years. and I have not yet seen a doctor about that, but now I am kind of wondering what it could be, what I think it might be is, some kind of infection, maybe for you also, but hopefully it is just something that can clear up with an antibiotic. Have you had any kind of infection like sore throat, infected tonsils? I doubt it could be Hep c. I do have some of the same symtoms and I am also 8 months pregnant and they found No sign of Hep. or STD...I thought maybe It could be cancer(lymphoma) but I am pretty sure they would have suspected something when they studied my blood twice, I think you may have nothing to worry about, lymphnodes are weird and so are glands, sometimes they just swell to get rid of infection. My husband has this weird like dime size lump on his arm, but the doctors says it is fine, he also occasionly gets cist like bumps anywhere and the doctors says that is normal. well, I wish the best for you, and eventually me and you will figure out it is nothing to worry about.\n\n",

I would definately keep your appointment though, just to make sure that is what it actually is.  Good luck and take care!\n\n",

I had it and it was easily treated, you do have to go see a doctor for her to test the culture, and when you get that done, she will recomend a persciption called  Clindesse, it is a one time thing, sometimes bv can come back and sometimes it can clear up without treatment, it is best to get treated, cause over time it can cause problems such as Infertility and it can get up in your uterus and cause infection there. don't worry about it, you will be fine once you are treated, it is also caused from sex(mainly female sex partners) too many sex partners, douching, soaps, tight clothing, females tend to spead it, males cant really get it, but it does make there penis itch. Bv is caused by overgrowing of the bacteria already in there, it just happens or you can get it from a female.  I hope this helped you, I know that is what you have and I suggest go to a doctor and tell them about it,  youll be fine hun.\n\n",

I noticed in bottle one there was some specs in the bottle with the urine.  very small, little pieces of 'crud' or something.  Bottle 2 seemed clean.  There was no pain or discomfort, i'm just wondering what those specs might have been, and is this normal?  i'm pretty paranoid when it comes to my health lately, and it's been on my mind all day. 26 male.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: E Coli bacteria - Recurring Sore Throat",
    "content": "Hi Fairway, Yes e coli can be a very common infection.  Most people have heard of it in the news with tainted undercooked hamburger being the offending source.    E. coli is  short for the medical term Escherichia coli , which normally lives inside your intestines, where it helps your body break down and digest the food you eat.  Unfortunately, when the E. coli moves from your intestines, where it's needed, and finds its way into other parts of your body (where it is not supposed to be), you can become ill.  Not only can you get upper respiratory infections with e-coli, but they are responsible as well for urinary tract infections and gastrointestinal illnesses.  Now that you have found the offending bacteria responsible for your throat infection you should be starting to feel much better.  If the symptoms return, call your doctor again.  Sometime a longer course of anibiodics are needed to completly treat the infection.  MaryAnnRN\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for the reply MaryAnn! I was releived when the Dr.'s office called and said the  culture found something but kind of freaked when they said gram negative bacteria - E. coli as I had never heard of this causing sore throat/respiratory. I really do hope this Ciprofloaxin knocks it out. I was told to take the 5 day course of this medicine and call the office back....I think they said they would do another culture....does that sound right?  Also, are there differnet kinds or \"levels\" of cultures that are done? I am asking because the first time I went to Dr. (a differnet Dr.) they did a \"quick\" strep culture and also sent one out and I was told they were both negative. Would those cultures have only been looking for Strep? Or do all cultures just grow what ever bacteria may be present?  One other question..... in mid December my Father passed away and prior to his death I spent about 3 weeks with him at hospital (slept there) and  ICU. He had very bad vascular problems in his lower legs and developed some form of pneumonia. I was  constantly in close contact with him and spent a lot of time in the hospital with him. I have read a bit about gram negative bacteria and hospitals, ICU's etc. Is there any relevance?  Thanks again for your time. Rick\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Rick, You have a very wise conciensous doctor.  Doing a second culture after treatment is to ensure that treatment has been sucessful.  Especially in your case, with the difficulty you have had in clearing your infection.  In answer to your second question, no not all cultures are alike.  It depends on what they test for as that different bacteria need different mediums to grow in.  Your third question, could your spending so much time with your father in the hospital have anything to do with your infection. Perhaps, but you could have also caught this infection anywhere.  And besides it sounds like you have just been thrrough a very stressful time in your life with losing your father.  Stress can lower our resistence to infection and thereby make you more suseptilbe to illness. So can lack of sleep which I am sure you did lose alot of with your father being so sick.    Take it easy,  I sure hope you feel better soon.  MaryAnn RN\n\n",

    "title": "Recurring Puss or Stones on Tonsil",
    "content": "Note: If I was supposed to post this under ear nose and throat, I tried, but there was no \"post new topic\" button.  About two weeks ago, I went to the doctor because I had white stuff on my tonsils.  There was one large patch, then two smaller patches.  I had no other symptoms.  My throat wasn't even sore.  He did a throat culture.  It was negative for strep, but he told me that it wasn't always conclusive and decided to put me on amoxicilin for ten days.  I took it as instructed.  About five days into it, I developed a cold.  Whether this was part of the original condition, or not, I wasn't sure.  My throat got sore during this cold, and I had pretty bad congestion.  It was also around this time that I noticed that what I assumed was puss could be scraped off with a swab.  It was a relatively hard ball, about pea sized.  And I could fainly see a bit more up in the crypt of my tonsil.  I got through the 10 days of antibiotics and felt fine.  No white stuff on my throat.  Cold was gone also with the exception of a bit of post-nasal drip, but that was minor.  I've been off of antibiotics for 7 days now.  At work tonight, I noticed that I had the white thing again.  And once again, no other symptoms.  I am a diagnosed Anxiety Disorder/Panic Disorder, and thus I kind of freaked out.  I'm settled a bit down now, but I wonder if I need to go back to the doctor.  I have a tendency to overreact.  My thinking is, if it was strep, it should have been taken care of.  I know there's a thing called Tonsil stones, and that could be it.  But my worrisome thoughts dwell on the slight possibility of something majorly wrong.\n\n",

She has severe pain around her eyes and around nose.   3. Her mouth is very sour. Sometimes she can't even touch her own lips with her tongue.   (She also has tremor in her hands when she feels really bad, but it's not visible. She is describes it as if her body is shaking).  She was seen by many doctors and many tests have been done and NOBODY has a clue about what's wrong with her. She has been really suffering for 3 years with this and it's getting worst.   MRI show no Sinusitis.  2 out of 3 blood tests showed hyperactive thyroids (little above normal level), but her physician doesn't think it's a problem.   Last blood test showed H-Pylori and FA Factor (don't know what it means).   Her physician prescribed her PrevPac, but she took a set of the same medicine 2 years ago and symptoms didn't disappear.   Any help or advice would be a saver.   She was seen by ENT, Neurologist, 3 physicians, was in Emergency Room and no help.   Please HELP....\n\n",

A condition, for example, Balanitis, is an inflammatory condition of the penis which may present with redness and rash, often occurs in uncircumcised males and may be caused by a fungal origin. I would strongly suggest that rather than attempting treatment without a diagnosis that you have your mom notify your physician for an evaluation so that a proper diagnsis and treatment can be initiated.

    "title": "Reactivated Brown Recluse Bite",
    "content": "12 years ago I got bitten by a brown recluse spider on my lower left leg/calf.  The first Dr. didn't treat it properly and I had to go to another Dr. for wound debridement.  He informed me that I may need a skin graft if the wound doesn't heal.  With careful wound care I lucked out and the wound healed in 18 months.  No skin graft was needed, but I have scar tissue.   In August.... I had an allergic reaction to Soma at the bite location.  2 weeks later the wound reactivated with the tissue/skin necrosis.  All the dead tissue peeled away and I have a dollar size wound that is trying to heal.  Healing has gone so far and then stopped.  I've been to the Dr. for 4 months who gave me prophylatic Keflex.  He sent to me a vascular surgeon.  This Dr. insists that it is a varicose ulcer and is treating it as such.  He won't listen to me.  I told him I was allergic to Sulfa and he gave me Dyazide.  You can't take Dyazide if you are allergic to Sulfa!!  I don't have high blood pressure either.  It is usually low. My question is who do I see about this.  It is very, very painful and I believe that I may need a skin graft this time around.  I don't want to wait another 3-4 months with this wound and then find out that it is being improperly treated.  None of the Drs. here(ND) are familar with insect bites.  Thank you very much for your time and assistance!!\n\n",

    "content": "Went to a new walk in clinic 5 days after the specialist put on the compression bandage.  The new Dr. said the bandage was on too tight and culture showed Staph Aureus.   I was given a new antibiotic and told that it is NOT a varicose ulcer.  It is a new wound over an existing healed wound.  It will take months to heal.  I am seeing a primary Dr. for observation of the wound.  The last two weeks it has showed much progress in healing.  I am off the antibiotics, but continue to take pain meds.\n\n",

    "content": "A few months ago i was having problems with bowel movements, and i had very serious pain and pressure under my ribs, it got to where i went to the ER one night, they didnt know what it was told me to see my doc the next day.  I went to my doc and told him what was going on and he immediately said H Pylori and tested me for it and that was it.  I was on 2000 mg a day of amoxicillan and 2000 a day of Ethry something, i don't remember.  But, before the H Pylori i was diagnosed with irritable bowl, i had constant diarhea, when i ate it came right back out with 10-20 mins.  I havent had this problem since the H pylori.  I do still have the stomach pain every now and then and the black coffee ground looking stool occasionally.  The doctor initially told me that they would retest in 6 months.  Could i still have the bacteria and that is what is still causing the stool to look like that and messing with my bowel movements?  Is it normal to wait 6 months to retest?  Hope to hear from someone.  Thanks\n\n",

When I was 9, I bite the nurse just because she was holding a needle towards me.   I bite if she tried to insert a tube for me too.  I promise I won't do it anymore.   When I was 24, needed an antibiotic shot IM three time a day during one hospital stay.  I was still jumped when the nurse turn on the bed light.  Still need 2 nurses attented.  The needle did not end up at my bump so the nurse very angry.  Now, they just stucked an IV during the stay so wouldn't be that much of stress.   Nothing can win, needle for blood test still can't escape.  I hope your daughter will do better than me.  Is her heart all right?  Take care.  Pika.\n\n",

The other symptoms you describe headache, sinus pressure, etc. of course may indicate an infection which may be present without initially having an elevated temperature.

Just because you had a clear urinalysis 2 months ago doesn't necessarily mean it cotinues to be clear. I would suggest another evaluation and if it is negative then a workup regarding the kidney stones and ovarian cysts should be completed. Now, regarding this post, the tiny white balls in your stool...is there any abdominal cramps, diarrhea etc. that accompany these symptoms? There is a condition called giardia which is a parasitic infection from drinking water and small cystlike objects are found in the stool. Although some people may have a parasitic infection and have no signs and symptoms, some symptoms when they do ocurr are diarrhea, foul smelling stool, and abdomial cramps and weight loss. A microscopic study is done on the stool to identify it. It takes 3 stool samples to diagnose this conditon. Giardia is treated with a course of antibiotics. In any case I would suggest a physicians evaluation. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

I also read about Giardia online and I'm not around any kind of contaminated water or other people much. I work at home and have 2 young ones in school, but they're fine.

I looked up the info that comes with my med, and this is this info: \"The tablet coating of the Tegretol XR formulation is not absorbed in the body and may be found in the stool\".  WHAT a RELIEF!!!  The pill is formulated to release slowly in the body.  So it's very possible that other meds may do the same thing.  The Tegretol XR has a tiny, tiny hole in the middle so that explains how it is a little larger than the pill.  Hope this helps!\n\n",

    "title": "Pea sized balls in my stool",
    "content": "Twice now I have noticed a pea sized round beige object in my stool. Once was 1-2 months ago and then again today. I've been having mild to moderate cramps/pain just under my rib cage in the right-central area. Ultra sound showed no problems with gall bladder or anything else in that general area. The cramps/pain can also be felt in lower portions of my abdomen at times as well.  Today I retrieved the object from the stool and put it in a medicine bottle. I plan to visit my doctor when he can see me (4 weeks from now probably). The first time I saw one of these I got it out and examined it. It seemed to be thin shelled and full of a merky dark green/brown liquid.  The discomfort is mild, but it is bothersome. I'm 39 and my mom had an extremely large colon tumor removed a year ago. So naturally, I worry.  I do travel with my job and was in Mexico in July. Maybe this is some sort of parasite?  Any ideas or suggestions greatly appreciated.  Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Theresa, Thanks for your response. I received a call back from my physician's nurse. He believes this object is the remains of the time release Norvasc that I take. It seems unlikely to me since the pill is so small and has no coating or shell. What I found was 1 to 1 1/2 times the size of a pencil. The outer shell was not extremely fragile but would break with some pressure.  I accidentally spilled my Norvasc one night and some of them landed in the kitchen sink. I was amazed at how very quickly they turned to mush when they got wet. This too makes me not understand how the object could be from this medicine. I also take Ziac and Avalide. Maybe he meant one of these instead?  What are your thoughts?  Thanks again and happy holidays!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi RichMan, Was the evaluation based over the telephone by the description you gave or was it based on actual examination? Generally speaking, occasionally medications will not be absorbed by the time the intestinal tract empties if there happens to be increased motility at that time for one reason or another but these are generally coated (enteric) medications. If the determination was made from a description you gave rather than an actual evaluation, I would suggest that if this occurs again, collect the specimen and take it into the physician's office for testing. Do not rely on information of what it \"could\" be based on solely a telephone call. That's my thoughts on the matter :) Have a Happy New Year! Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "title": "Pink Eye",
    "content": "My 15 year old son awoke 4 days ago with a red right eye that was irritated and tearing.  Two days later, the left eye became red.  He went to see his primary care physician who told him he had an \u201cinfection in his eyes\u201d and prescribed a topical antibiotic drop four times a day.  After two days, his eyelids were more swollen, red and irritated.  I went back to his PCP because he was not getting better.  He changed his antibiotic drops but wanted to make sure something more serious wasn\u2019t going on.  My son was referred to a local ophthalmologist who suspected viral conjunctivitis but said it was a little unusual to see so much discharge.  He asked me if I wanted to have a new test performed on his tears that could help confirm the diagnosis.  I thought it was best to know.  The ophthalmologist lowered his eyelid and collected some tears on what looked like a pregnancy test.  About ten minutes later, the test was positive and confirmed the diagnosis of viral conjunctivitis.  It was nice to have a definitive answer but I wish it had been done sooner.  As it turns out, my son was probably allergic to the first antibiotic and this was likely making his condition worse.  He was kept out of school for a full week and we used over the counter artificial tears until the redness improved.  Unfortunately, my daughter and husband both caught the same virus but at least they did not waste time trying antibiotic drops and I didn\u2019t bother returning to my PCP.  If so many family doctors use the rapid strep test why don't they also use an rapid eye test?\n\n",

Antibiotics can be used for strep throat, a bacterial infection,  but not the typical \"sore throat\" because they are viral infections.  To answer your question; strep throat does not have to be treated with antibiotics.  If left untreated there is a chance that strep throat can turn in to rheumatic fever, or even kidney disease.  Typically strep throat goes away on its own in 3-7 days.  Your doctor should ultimately decide if treatment is necessary.\n\n",

A sore throat from a virus is completely different from a sore throat caused by the bacteria streptococcus (strep). A sore throat caused by the gram positive bacteria streptococcus always requires a course of antibiotic therapy. Untreated streptococcal illnesses can cause numerous complications, for example, acute rheumatic fever,  post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, etc. Rheumatic fever develops about two-three weeks after an untreated streptococcal infection and causes joint pain and heart disease. I certainly hope that a swab test was completed and if it was positive, antibiotic therapy was initiated. Get well soon! Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

You should however consult a dermatovenereologist for an opinion, because you had unprotected sex with a partner whose status is unknown.

    "content": "Hi, i am very concern about my sister because for the past year she has been getting some huge infection with the shape of a ball in the inner lip of her vagina.  Doctors need to wait for the huge mass to get at its maximum size in order to squeeze all the pus out of it.  No doctor can really tell how she gets the infection and what treatment she should get.  It keeps happing every three months and it causes her so much pain.  Last time she had that weird infection was three days ago, where doctors at the emergency room had to squeeze all the pus out.  Some doctor took a sample of the pus and did an exam; the doctor concluded that the infection is call \"ecoli\".  However, ecoli has nothing to do with a huge ball that grows in the inner lip of a vagina.  I don't know what to think anymore or how to find a specialist.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi mayo, A Bartholin's gland cyst may present as an enlarged area \"lump\" in one of the vaginal lips near the opening of the vagina. When an abcess occurs these become very tender and painful. Secondary infections of these particular cysts may include infections with the bacteria ecoli, (ecoli bacteria is normally present in the intestinal tract) Cysts are drained, oral antibiotics are generally prescribed, depending on the bacteria present. Warm soaks may be suggested to ensure drainage of the area is complete. Another factor to keep in mind, if after going to the bathroom, if she is wiping from back to front, tell her to wipe from front to back. This will prevent transfer of this bacteria into that area. A Gynecologist is the physician whom in which she should be being evaluated. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

Then after they beat the cold they are actually built better then before. Take me for instance i really don't work out much just walk a lot. My muscle mass stays the same seems like i cant shink. I still do when i have sex though just a bit. Another problem is changing colors in light. When im in doors i am a golden color probably just the light. I don't think so becuse im red at times too. I think the sun is making my skin peel constantly. When i take a shower i skrub very good to remove it all then i put on lotion then my skin looks really good. Except for my face and scrotum. I still havent figured that one out. My doctor said though that if theres anything wrong inside that the skin will show it. Im really healthy i think. Im thinking its just toxins getting pushed out of my blood. But im not the doctor.\n\n",

    "content": "I am new to this forum so I am sorry in advance if this post is not in the correct place. Thanks in advance for all responses and any info. Here is the situation I have had chronic otitis media going on since my surgery in 2002. I had a tympano plasty done to repair a perforated drum 3 all together but 2 were in 2002. None of them took still perforated which I thought was the reasons for the infections ongoing. Recently the primary care physcian cultured my ear and said it came back mrsa positive. That I contracted it through my surgery in 2002. She said the infection was very old and there was pus as far as the eye could see excuse the terminology. Also the could not rule out the possibility of a cholesteatoma from the infection.I recently got my records (chart) from them for the new Neuro-otolarynologist I am going to see. I read in there that near the time of my surgery they wrote down mastioditis in which they gave me amoxicillian for. I am SO confused. If I had mrsa in my ear how could I have had this so long? I have been very sick for a long time but I have never had any skin lesions like I have heard most with mrsa do. Just have ear infections. Well I guess I should not leave out all the other symptoms dizziness, fatigue, headache/migraine, nasuea, sinusitis, allergies, and asthma.Also any moisture in the air gives me headache I guess because of the infections in the ear and hole. Are there different kinds that can localize to one area? What should my next course of action be. Should I get retested somewhere else? Can you get mrsa from surgery and it just remain active in the one area?She put me on 2, 21 days of Bactrim- which means all in all I took this antibiotic for 42 days.  Are there diff. strains of this infection. I do not think this is CA-MRSA because I have no lesions and have not had any bed sores or infections at other surgical sites. Thanks so very much\n\n",

    "content": "Yes, sir or mam I know that mrsa is methicillian resistant staff. That is why I have had the ongoing infections since 2002. It will get better for a little while then it is right back when I am done with the course of antibiotics. No they did not try vanomycin, just Bactrim like I said for 42 days. What they used the amoxicillian for was just after my surgery when they said I had the mastoiditis. At that time they had not cultured the ear to see what type of bacteria whatever that they were dealing with. Usually up until now all they would say is chronic otitis media and give me some form of antibiotic be it zithromax, let me see either ceftin or cefzil, anyways all kinds I can not think of all the names off hand I would have to read the list. Anyway thanks for the response even though it did not answer any of my questions about MRSA . I guess I will have to find out on my own just thought it might be useful to ask someone about who has been educated on the subject of in diseases. Thank you for your time. Bye\n\n",

    "title": "Swollen lymph nodes - infection or something else?",
    "content": "I've had a few swollen lymph nodes on the left side of my neck for about 3 months now. They are not at all painful, and they seem to have been increasing (slightly) in size. About a week ago, I noticed another swollen node above my collar bone on the right side. This one feels very firm, but is still not painful. I haven't had any fevers or anything, but I have been extrememly tired all the time, and I have lost some weight.   I went to see my doctor for this about 2 1/2 months ago, and she gave me a pretty strong antibiotic, which did nothing. So I went back to see her a couple days ago, and she did some tests. She did a strep test and mono test, and both were negative. She also did a CBC, but I don't know the results of that yet (by the way, the last time I had a CBC, about 4 months ago, I had an elevated WBC). The doctor seemed very concerned, but couldn't make a diagnosis, though she did say she didn't think it was an infection. She sent me to a specialist that same day, and he just poked around on my neck and said it was nothing. I don't believe that, because my GP seemed very concerned - enough to ask this other doctor to stay at his office late in order to see me that day. Anyway, the specialist did order a CT scan, so I'm going in for that next week.  Needless to say, I am pretty confused - and a little nervous. This couldn't be anything serious, could it? I feel fine other than the tiredness, but I would really like to know what's going on.  Any help on this would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

    "title": "Question regarding \"mono spot\" test",
    "content": "Hi, I was told a week and a half ago I am positive for mono using the monospt test. I was sick for a good two to almost 3 weeks before this diagnosis. I was also not feeling up to par for a week or two prior to developing the first \"real\" symptoms of mono. It felt almost as if I was kind of sick then felt ok for a week and then got worse. I have to add that I was on a work related trip to Alaska when this diagnosis was made. My sleep schedule and duration was turned upside down and I also wasn't eating like I normally do. My normal climate is a subtropical climate with high humidity, Alaska was an arctic desert. In addition I didn't really have the classic swollen lymph nodes and severe sore throat but I felt really out of it for a week or two. I was also tachycardic during that time, around 100 bpm. The doctors originally thought I was just dehydrated, which I probably was.  My question is will  the mono spot test will show positive if you have any antibodies in your blood (like from a past infection)?. I am a little confused because it seems to me like the monospot will show positive if you have ever had mono in the past.  I really want to follow up on this just to make sure it isn't anything more serious.   I still feel very tired but don't have any swelling and an only slightly irritated throat. I also have a chest pain that lasts for a few seconds and then goes away maybe once or twice a day. It's been a month now and I still can't work because of the fatigue. Luckily I'm not losing money because of it. Any help or encouragement would be greatly appreciated!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi ssublime1, I will try to give you some information about mono tests. A monospot is a test that identifies a current infection. The test that identifies a previous viral infection is called an Epstein-Barr viral antibody titer. This is how current and previous infections are distinguished. Lab findings for current infections often include elevated white blood cells, some of which may have an unusual appearance. An enlarged spleen and liver abnormalities may also be present. Swollen lymph nodes, enlarged spleen may resolve in about 4 weeks or so. Fatigue may resolve in a matter of weeks but may last for 2-3 months. Treatment for mono is usually directed at treating symptoms. Antibiotics are not effective. Acetaminophen or ibuprofen for discomfort and fever, warm salt water gargles for sore throats, plenty of rest and fluids, and if the spleen is enlarged, avoiding any activity that may cause abdominal injury to avoid spleenic ruptures. You certainly should have a follow up evaluation to check your health status and avoid any other complications. I hope this answers some of your questions and hopefully you will get well soon  Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

I went to another doctor yesterday and he agreed that the bloodwork didn't completely match up to mono. Does this sound like anything else you are familiar with? Thank you!!  I went to the Dr. Today and found liver function normal, wbc elevated but still within norm range as well as high norm rbc.Platelets are in the mid norm range. Neutrophil and monocyte are both high but lymphocyte is low norm. Is this normal blood work for infectious mono? I am concerned because I have been sicker than normal for the past year but was always told it's a common virus. But the same thing over and over is a little troublesome to me.\n\n",

Also for the past 4 or 5 days I have been feeling nauseated, especially in the morning. I thought that's a little wierd for being in about the 6th week of having mono without much in the way of other symptoms except fatigue and headache. Here's my results as of March 29th- Neut%-   75.4 Lymph%-   15.0 Mono%-  9.2 EOS and BASO were both low.  WBC count was 10.5-    x10e3/uL  It says on the sheet 4.3-11.0 is normal range.  RBC is 5.63   x10e6/uL Norm range is 4.3 - 5.8  Platelets were 255   x10e3/uL Norm is 150 - 375  Neut count was 7.9 x10e3/uL which is 1.1 over norm range. Mono count was 1.0 x10e3/uL which is .2 over norm. Thank you again for answering my questions!!! It really feels good to be able to ask someone who knows and get a straight answer\n\n",

A good friend of mine and his wife had pnuemonia for quite a while and they were told over and over it was only common allergies.   Not that they are all bad, just don't want to take chances.

    "content": "Genital ulceration may be due to infective  or non-infective causes. Infective causes are sexually transmitted and include syphilis, chancroid, genital herpes, LGV and granuloma inguinale. The last two conditions are more commonly seen in the tropics and subtropics.  As you have had no sexual exposure, it must be assumed that your recurrent genital ulceration is due to non-infective causes. However, a repeat test for HSV 1 and 2 at the next outbreak is advisable.  Trauma, Behcet's disease, Stevens-Johnson syndrome and carcinoma are  non-infective causes of genital ulceration. In your case, carcinoma is excluded because the ulcers are not persistent, not growing larger and tend to heal on their own but recur intermittently at the same site.   Traumatic genital ulcers may be caused by vigorous manipulation of the penile organ, such as in prolonged and  repetitive acts of masturbation, which is not admitted. A common site is the frenulum of the penis, which is the site you are attempting to describe. Behcet's disease is usually accompanied by mouth ulcers. Stevens-Johnson syndrome is a hypersensitivity of acute onset, frequently caused by infection or certain drugs and may occasionally cause genital ulcers, mouth ulcers and a conjunctivitis.  At the next outbreak of these ulcers, please get examined by a genitourinary physician for diagnosis and reassurance.

I have about 5 spots around my lower abdomen, and have been keeping them clean, but they coincided with the elastic area of my underwear and have rubbed them pretty much raw, which looks absolutely terrible.  I need to see a doctor, obviously,  but will not be able to see one for a few days.  I'm going to have to tell my girlfriend about this, and i'm very concerned how I got it, as I've never had an STD before and have been monogamous for over a  year.  I read they can be passed through sexual contact, but can they be passed on by sharing a bed? as I'm terrified of passing them on to my girlfriend  as I've read they can last for up to 2 years, will sharing a bed be potentially risky? I'm really worried as  I feel could be pretty damaging to my relationship..  nervous, irritated and in need of some answers.  BJ\n\n",

    "title": "MOLLUSCUM CONTAGIOSUM",
    "content": "Transmission of the molluscum contagiosum virus is by skin-to-skin contact. Children and sexually active adults are usually affected. Lesions in children occur on exposed skin sites, but in sexually active adults, the virus is transmitted during sexual activity and lesions occur in or around the genital region.   Sharing a bed may involve skin-to-skin contact if clothing is not worn, so transmission of the virus is possible but not definite.  Confirmation of the diagnosis by a dermatologist or genitourinary physician is advisable before breaking the news to your girlfriend. The presence of one STD should prompt a search for others; therefore, if the condition is confirmed, a full STD screen becomes mandatory for you and your partner.  In an immunocompetent host, mollusca usually persist for up to 6 months and then resolve spontaneously. If immediate treatment is required, the lesions can be removed in a doctor\u2019s office with little discomfort. In HIV-infected individuals, mollusca often progress even with aggressive therapies, creating significant cosmetic disfigurement, especially by facial lesions.

    "content": "Hi folks:  I wonder if you could perhaps give me a few possible diagnoses for what this could be.  Here are the symptoms: 1.  High fevers (up to 103), temporarily relieved by ibuprofen but them comes back. 2.  Generalized mild  achiness and stiffness, most noticeable in the spine, but also armpits, etc. 3.  Excruciating jabbing pains on one side of the head when fever is highest.  These pains are intermittent, maybe 2 seconds on, 3 seconds off.  They are more intense than labor pains (to my memory; I had an unmedicated childbirth).  The headache is also relieved for the most part by 1600 mg of ibuprofen, though not completely. 4.  No URI symptoms other than stuffiness due to dry mucous membranes and very slight chest heaviness. 5.  No UTI symptoms. 6.  Mild anorexia and mild nausea but no vomiting or diarrhea, no abdominal pain other than generalized achiness mentioned above.  Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Well basically, I can't figure out where to make a new topic, and I'm in a panic mode right now.. let me explain my situation and someone PLEASE help me ASAP.  Scenario: I was in jeans & boxers, and the girl was in jeans as well. We were feeling eachother up and eventually led to rubbing of the penis area to her vaginal area, with clothes still on. I could feel that there was vaginal fluids at the bottom of her jeans. Next morning (today) I have 2 swollen glands on both sides of my groin area, diarrhea, pain in the upper right side and upper left side of both of my butt cheeks, runny nose, and feel cold. If I slightly stretch the skin on my penis, i see 2 VERY small red spots. I'm very scared and hope that this isn't herpes... would these symptoms come this quick? I do remember touching my genital area with my hands during the middle of our interaction.  The sexual interaction was around 3:00 in the morning to about 5:00 and noticed these pains and symtoms later during the same day. Could these glands be caused by irratation or anything to that extent? Thank you so much for the help.\n\n",

As far as your symptoms,  after sexual intercourse with an HIv infected person, if you are infectred, you will develop flu like smptoms. These symptoms will go away, and you will have no other symptoms for a long time.  If you are alreayd expierencing HIV or aids symptoms, then a test would show up positive for it. Being that you tested negative, then you are probably safe, and have another type or infection or cold.    Bing:  Was there direct contact of vaginal fluids to an oppening in your body? Did her vaginal fluids get on your penis, or a cut on her finger? It would be very unlikely you could contact an STD if both of you had on jeans during your sexual encounter.  The symptoms you describe could just be a flu bug of some sort, and the small red spots on your penis could be irritation from the friction against your jeans. If you are concerned that you may have an STD then go to a clinic to get tested, but I think you are safe. It sounds to me like you have the flu.  rsky: If you had unprotected sex, the only way to know for sure if you have contracted an STD is with a test. You need to make an appointment with a doctor or clinic to be tested.\n\n",

Do you think I could have it or do you still think it's a very small chance. It does seem quite coincidental that all these symptoms happen after this.

It is possible to get herpes if you came in contact with any of her vaginal fluids, and then touched your penis.   You can get herpes even if you canot see any sores on the womans vagina. She can have sores inside the vagina which would not be visable, or she would not be having an outbreak at the time, but even if there is no outbreak, it is still possible to transmit herpes.   You are correct, the symptoms you describe are symptoms of herpes, but can also be symptoms of something else.  There is really no way to know for sure without an STD test, so I recommend that you get tested as soon as possible, to ease your mind, or get treatment.\n\n",

Symptoms of herpes are called outbreaks. The first outbreak appears within 2 weeks after you become infected and can last for several weeks. These symptoms might include tingling or sores near the area where the virus has entered the body, such as on the genital or rectal area, on buttocks or thighs, or occasionally on other parts of the body where the virus has entered through broken skin. They also can occur inside the vagina and on the cervix in women, or in the urinary passage of women and men. Small red bumps appear first, develop into small blisters, and then become itchy, painful sores that might develop a crust and will heal without leaving a scar.\n\n",

    "content": "The chances of you having it are very unlikely. The way to diagnose herpes is by looking at the sores on the penis. Without looking at them, I cannot tell you if you have it or not. It does not sound like herpes. While some of the symptoms you describe are consistant with herpes, the main symptom is lesions on the penis, and the sores you describe do not sound like herpes.  It is possible to get herpes even if you cannot see sores on the woman. There are two reasons for this. She can have an outbreak, inside the vagina, which would not be visable on the outside, or she can not be having an outbreak at the moment. Although it is harder to contract herpes if there is no outbreak at the time, it is still possible that the virus can shed. In general, studies suggest that asymptomatic shedding with subsequent viral transmission to another person possibly accounts for one-third of all HSV-2 infections.  I do not think that you have it, as I have said, it is very unlikely to get it in the manner you have described, but I still think you should go to a doctor, if only to put your mind to rest.\n\n",

    "content": "Yes, if she has a cold sore on her lip and gives you oral sex, it is possible to spread herpes that way. A cold sore on the lip would be HSV 1, and genitial herpes is HSV 2. You can get oral herpes from kissing someone with oral herpes, and it is possible to give oral sex and contract genitial herpes.   You will get skin lesions 2-12 days after exposure. The first sign of infection is fluid accumulation (edema) at the infection site, which is quickly followed by small, grouped blisters, the characteristic HSV lesions.  Primary herpes is often accompanied by fever rising to about 102\u00b0F, muscle aches, headache, and flu-like malaise. These general symptoms usually resolve within a week.\n\n",

    "content": "Since this is now looking to be possibly some type of infection, instead of an orthopedic problem....I'm going to post this here and see if anyone has any advice. Thanks!   Posted: Tue May 31, 2005 3:41 pm  About three weeks ago, I began having sorness and tingling in my left foot and calf. My big toe and across the top of my foot was very sore, and the outside edge and the two smallest toes on the same foot went from tingling (like when your foot falls asleep), to being numb. This went on for about a week. I thought I must have done something, and figured with some advil and a few days it would get better. But, instead of getting better..it started up in the right leg and foot as well. Then it got to be both feet, legs, and my lower back. Although I couldn't think of anything I had done...I still figured I must have hurt my back somehow, and it was probably just a pinched nerve or something, and that with taking it easy and some time it would get better. Then on Saturday I woke up and every joint in my body was sore and stiff. I felt like I had the flu x 10...but I haven't had any other flu like symptoms (no fever, head or chest congestion, etc.). The joint pain and stiffness seems worse in the morning, and gradually over the day will get a little better. I've had arthritis in my wrists from an old injury for years, but they usually only bother my in really cold weather, or when I've done something repetitive and over-used them. Then they will swell and be stiff and sore. All my joints feel like that right now, but there doens't seem to be any swelling, redness, and no previous injuries. So, I don't know what's going on. If I wake up tomorrow and it's as bad as it was this morning, I'm going to call and see if I can make an appointment with my doctor. I'm just wondering if anyone has any idea what this might be? I've had family/friends suggest lyme disease (haven't been near any woods or animals...haven't seen any ticks), flu (no other flu symptoms, and it's been going on for 3 weeks), rhematoid arthritis (don't know much about this...so couldn't say), and multiple sclerosis (only because my aunt was diagnosed 2 years ago, and hers began with numbess in her feet and legs). I thought maybe it was just a virus or infection...but it's been going on for 3 weeks now...and besides the joint pain and not sleeping well...I haven't had any other symptoms.  Thanks for your time and help! J\n\n",

    "content": "Posted: Fri Jun 03, 2005 4:34 pm    Post subject: Results of the blood work....   Thank you for your reply and taking the time to help answer questions and calm nerves for everyone on these message boards. I came home from work today and the doctor's office had left a message on my answering machine. They said my bloodwork (see post above for what they ran) came back and did not show any clear answers as to what could be causing the joint pain. They said to call them back on Monday if I was still having pain and they would refer me to a Rheumalogist.  I'm definately still having joint pain. However, today it's not only been my joints, it's been my muscles too. Mainly the muscles in my legs. They have been very sore and tired/weak feeling today. It feels like I've ran a very long hard race, and my muscles are tired and tight and my legs are heavy. Just standing up from sitting in a chair takes more effort, and when walking my legs feel heavy and sore and it's slow going.  I'm going to call the doctor on Monday. But, I'm beginning to get really worried now. If the blood tests didn't show anything that would indicate Rheumatoid Arthitis or Lupus or any of the other things he thought it may be...then what else is there....something better...something worse....? What would affect the joints and the muscles...but not have any other obvious symptoms...?  Thanks for your time and help.\n\n",

    "title": "Lab Results",
    "content": "We got the lab results back. They did a \"CBC with Differential / Platelet\", \"Comp. Metabolic Panel\", \"Rheumatiod Arthritis Factor\", \"Antinuclear Antibodies Direct\", and \"Sedimentation Rate\". The doctor says that although there are some items elevated, there isn't anything that conclusively tells him what is causing the joint and muscle pain. So, he wants to refer me to a Rheumatologist. I called and can't get an appointment until July 25th. Sad So, for now I wait...and keep wondering. There were 4 things in my lab results that showed to be elevated.  White Blood Cell Count 11.3 H x10E3/uL Limits 4.0-10.5  RDW 16.0 H % Limits 11.7-15.0  Neutrophils (Absolute) 8.2 H x10E3/uL Limits 1.8-7.8  ALT (SGPT) 46 H IU/L Limits 0-40  None of these seem to be very high over the limits. But, in February, before all this started, I had a complete physical, and all these were within the normal range. So, it is quite a change in 4 months. Not sure if it means anything, or helps to figure out what's going on. The RA Factor, ANA, and sed-rate, all seem ok (see below).  Rhematiod Arthritis Factor - RA Latex Turbid. 6.6 IU/mL Limits 0.0-13.9  Antinuclear Antibodies Direct 33 U/mL Limits: Negative <100  Sedimentation Rate - Westergren 15 mm/hr Limits 0-20  Antistreptolysin O Antibodies 31.6 IU/mL Limits 0.0-200.0  Does any of this help to give a clue as to what's going on?  I also asked my doctor about \"Cat Scratch\" disease/fever. Several months ago my nephew (he's 7) began complaining of his leg hurting. At first his parents just thought he pulled something playing rough or jumping on the trampoline. But when he kept on talking about it, they got him down and realized the lymph nodes in his leg/groin area were very swollen and hard. They took him to the doctor, who did lots of tests, and an MRI. They could see that something had many of the lymph nodes in his leg swollen, and his WBC was elevated on his lab results, but they couldn't figure out what was causing it. They tried two rounds of anti-biotics, with no improvement. They finally sent him to a Children's Hospital to see an oncologist. The oncologist first wanted to take some blood and do a culture for \"Cat Scratch\" fever. It took 9 days to get it back, but it was positive. They gave him a different kind of anti-biotic and he recovered quickly and has been great since then. As I said, I asked my doctor about this, because I had also been around my nephew's new kitten, but the doctor doesn't seem to think this could be a possibility. Granted, I don't remember getting scratched...but neither did my nephew, and they could never find a scratch on him. I even called back to the doctors office Friday morning, and asked that since we have to wait a month for me to get in to see the Rheumotologist, could we go ahead and test for the \"cat scratch\" just to be sure. The nurse said she would ask the doctor, and someone would call me back. It's Tuesday night, and so far no one has called back.  I'm not sure what to do at this point......\n\n",

    "title": "Can you make sense of this?",
    "content": "Hi. I am a 23 year old female student with no previously diagnosed chronic medical problems.  In mid February I contracted infectious mononucleosis (which initially presented itself by a flat red rash on both forearms) confirmed by a monospot test, atypical lymphocytes etc.  The acute mono ran its course. It turned out that I got the gastrointestinal variant of IM, and the acute phase was actually not that bad.  I was still able to attend most classes.  When the acute phase was about up my doctor thought that she saw some swelling in my uvula, so as a \"preventative measure\" she prescribed a short course of corticosteroids.  I had bad nervous side effects (heat flashes, tingling in both forearms, dizziness, insomnia) so I discontinued the pills after a day and a half with my doctor's consent.  After that it seemed as though I just got weaker - even weaker than during the acute phase.  I was easily tired by ordinary activities.  I also began experiencing symptoms that could easily be attributed to anxiety and depression - such as tingling and numbness in my extremities, muscle spasms, headaches of a kind unlike I had ever experienced, mild insomnia, stomach pain, SEVERE gas, night sweats, breathlessness, etc.  It got so bad that I began having panic attacks (I'm not sure what else to call them).  After a horrifying episode where my body seemed to have limitless adrenaline, I didn't get any decent sleep for 3 days. I  actually had to be admitted to the hospital under the diagnosis of major depression (I also got a UTI at that point for which I took Cipro).  When I left my diagnosis had changed to a panic disorder with agoraphobia.  It has been 1 week since I was discharged, and I've been taking paxil for 3 weeks.  I had a whole slew of blood tests and cat scans of my head and stomach at the hospital - I gather to rule out some medical problems.  I am feeling a lot more energetic and happy, and I actually do vigorous exercise for 1/2 hour every other day and am not exhausted by it.  However, i still have mild aches in the front of my head, intermittant weakness in my legs and forearms, muscle twitching, brain fog, mild gas, some constipation, and weird pelvic symptoms.  I know it sounds weird but I have soreness in my bladder area, in my vaginal area, and in my anal area too!  I also have frequency.  Note that after my Cipro was gone I was retested for urinary tract bacteria with a midstream catch and a 72 hr. culture with no growth.  I also had a pelvic exam - everything looked ok but the result of the pap is not back yet.  What I am wondering is this: I know that anxiety and depression can cause seemingly unrelated and quite severe symptoms in some cases - which is probably why I have the diagnosis I do.  However, are there any underlying medical conditions (possibly triggered by mono) which may be causing my sumptoms?  What about neurological disorders or  Lyme Disease? Thank you!\n\n",

That cold lasted three days, one of which saw me so fatigued I literally could not move.  Came back to LA, was totally fine for three weeks and then got a serious bout of chest pressure mixed with light-headedness and headache. Saw a doctor, began taking Ibuprofin. Condition then morphed into mild chest pressure/pain accompanied by occasional pressure behind my eyes and a \"pressure feeling\" in my head (not quite a headache, though similar) that made me feel\u2014for lack of a better word\u2014loopy or not quite there. This head pressure (which has the characteristics of a dull headache) is almost ALWAYS directly preceded by a mild headache that begins in the back of my head and travels from the base of my neck around to my forehead. The two strangest aspects of this phenomenon are the sudden plugging and/or ringing of my ears and a congestive wall of pressure at the front of my face. I\u2019ll tell you, it\u2019s quite strange to find yourself mid-sentence projecting a voice that\u2019s suddenly not yours.  I saw the same doctor again and got an EKG, 2D-ECHO, and FULL PHYSICAL with blood work (the specific tests the blood was run through I can't say, but there were at least five different tubes of blood pulled from me). She told me all the tests came back \"normal\" and that she thought I had a chest inflammation and said to take Claritin and Motrin. On a whim I switched from Motrin to Aleve and that seemed to work MUCH better for the pain.  Now the chest pain/pressure is 95 percent gone but I still have at least twice daily the facial/head congestion and the weird headache (though less aggressive under the Claritan/Aleve combo).  The new development (AND WHAT WORRIES ME MOST, THUS THIS POST) is the feeling of being in a \"fog\" or \"bubble\" that's ALWAYS present, a thing that makes me feel like I'm moving in slow motion or walking in lead shoes, \"loopy or not quite there\", and a sharp tension/pain in my upper spine that\u2019s been constant the past four days.  And lastly, the one wrench in all this is that in an office of 9 people, 7 have spent at least one sick day in the last five weeks. There\u2019s a woman here who actually has complained of the same symptoms mentioned above; everyone else has cried flu.  I trust my doctor, but this is scaring the *bleep* out of me.  Has anyone heard of a bug or bacterial disorder that takes this course?\n\n",

    "content": "Your symptoms are indicative of acute tonsillitis - an upper respiratory tract infection.  This is a generalised inflammation of the tonsils (seen as red bumps in back of throat) usually accompanied by an inflammation of the pharynx (seen as very red and swollen throat). The infecting agent may be bacterial or viral. Bacterial infection may be caused by Streptococci, Pneumococci, Staphylococci and Haemphilus influenzae.  The most common complaints in acute tonsillitis are fever, a very sore throat, pain on swallowing, malaise and loss of appetite. In severe inflammation of the tonsils, pus may be seen on the surface of the tonsils and this is what you may have described as white patches.  An adequate intake of fluids is advised, as well as antipyretics to relieve the fever pending a doctor's examination. If the inflammation is of bacterial origin and severe as it seems to be in your case, the doctor will prescribe antibiotic treatment after a throat swab to identify the causative organism.    Keep the appointment with your doctor!  Dr Anthony Solomon Consultant Physician, Tropical & Genitourinary Medicine\n\n",

I took several rounds of Diflucan, thinking that it was thrush, but there was no change.  Now, a year later, I am taking Valium and Zoloft everyday, and my tongue is STILL coated.  It usually takes on the color of whatever I have eaten, but is mostly a tan or brown color.  I brush my tongue everyday, and it hasn't gone away.  There are no sores or white spots anywhere in my mouth or throat, so I'm pretty sure it's not thrush.  What should I do?\n\n",

    "title": "Hi",
    "content": "Hello jj1994,  Basically, penicillin is the first line drug of choice for treatment against the microorganisms causing rheumatic fever which is streptococci (specifically group A-Beta hemolytic strep). If you frequently have attacks of sore throat and then have manifestations or symptoms similar to the one you are feeling right now, then it is advisable that you have booster doses of penicillin via intramuscular injection.   As for your other medications like prednisone - this is an anti-inflammatory drug which help lessen the swelling of your joints however the draw back is that your immune response may also be lowered hence the decrease in your WBC.   It is much better to consult with your cardiologist because if your rheumatic fever still continues or worsen, your heart valves may eventually be affected which in turn could lead to rheumatic heart disease <if your valve(s) is/are affected - most commonly the mitral valve which is situated between your left atrium and left ventricle of the heart>  I hope you are somehow enlightened with what you are feeling right now.  Sincerely, M.D.\n\n",

I finally quit, which i know i should have a long time ago.  So it was now been a week of quiting and it doesnt seem to be healing yet.  I am guessing it will go away eventually...  I went to the doctor 3 weeks ago to get a throat culture and the results were negative.  So im guessing that is a good sign.  If i speak loudly it hurts my throat, so im guessing it is my vocal cords that are damaged.  My question is could this be cancerous or would i maybe need my tonsils removed?  Any information would be helpful.  Thanks alot\n\n",

You could have tried to get out a splinter with a pin or needle, cleaned with alcohol or in a flame.  Don't squeeze pus out, use gentle pressure to get it to flow out through an opening that is already there.  Too much pressure can spread an infection into deeper healthy tissue.  By now the hydrogen peroxide has already helped if it was going to help.  Don't use it too many days on the same wound because it delays healing.  If the swelling has subsided and you have not been having fevers, you should be ok by now.\n\n",

I personally have a navel ring, along w/a nose ring &would like to give you the DO's & don't'S of piercing care.   don't USE PEROXIDE or alcohol, or any astringent because not only can it damage the wound, it also can destroy the cells that form scar tissue.  don't use creams or ointments (neosporin). They keep the wound moist & delay the healing process. Also - & I did this once w/my nose - I had taken the ring out because there was some redness around my nose & applied neosporin after cleaning because that was all I had at home. That served as a coating that actually closes up thehole.   DON'T wear tight clothes because they can cause the piercing to grow out  DON'T remove the ring during the healing phase because you will lose the piercing.   DO'S: antibacterial soap (daily while bathing). Sea-salt, table-salt (both in warm water) or saline solution - rinse w/that then dry throroughly w/a clean towel after. It helps  promote healing.   Best of Luck\n\n",

    "content": "I've battled poison ivy all my life, it gets very aggervating.  The rash you described does sound like poison ivy.  The poison ivy rash that you get is an allergic reaction to the oil on the plant.  You can get it by touching the plant itself,  or depending on how sensitive you are to it, you may get it from handling a jacket that came into contact with it.  The best way I've found to treat the rash is plantain.  This is a common plant that grows in your front yard.  It reminds me of lettuce.  The leaves are very round and grow in little clumps.  Shred the leaves by hand and and make sure they're a little moist.  After you've shredded the leaves apply them to the rash and make sure you rub them around on it very well.  Do this 3 times a day.  My poison ivy is gone in less than a week when I do this.  I wouldn't take the augmentin though.  Augmentin is an antibiotic.  You're seeking treatment for an allergic reaction, not necessarily an infection.  Over the counter allergy medications (Benadryl)  always worked for me. My grandmother taught me a saying to learn poison ivy, schumack, oak etc.  \"Leaves of 3 let them be, leaves of 5 let them hide.\" Hopefully this info. will atleast make him more comfortable and keep him from getting the sander back out.\n\n",

    "content": "The sedimentation rate (sed rate) blood test measures how quickly red blood cells (erythrocytes) settle in a test tube in one hour.  When inflammation is present in the body, certain proteins cause red blood cells to stick together and fall more quickly than normal to the bottom of the tube. The more red cells that fall to the bottom of a special test tube in one hour, the higher the sed rate. These proteins are produced by the liver and the immune system under many abnormal conditions, such as an infection.  i do not believe UTI would have triggered your low red blood cell counts, you might have anemia, meaning low red blood cell counts, and there are many types of that too. anemia could affect the sedimentation rate.  the fact that your doctor has asked you for pelvic ultrasound is a good idea,  i hope you always feel good.\n\n",

    "content": "It doesn't sound like PID to me, but sometime you can have PID and have no symptoms at all. Many different organisms can cause PID, but many cases are associated with gonorrhea and chlamydia  PID is difficult to diagnose because the symptoms are often subtle and mild. Many episodes of PID go undetected because the woman or her health care provider fails to recognize the implications of mild or nonspecific symptoms. Because there are no precise tests for PID, a diagnosis is usually based on clinical findings. If symptoms such as lower abdominal pain are present, a health care provider should perform a physical examination to determine the nature and location of the pain and check for fever, abnormal vaginal or cervical discharge, and for evidence of gonorrheal or chlamydial infection. If the findings suggest PID, treatment is necessary  PID can be treated with antibiotics.   As for HIV....I can't say that it is harder to catch than people make it out to be. You are right, there are some very promiscious people who never get it, and some people who can catch it the very first time they have sex. It just depends on if you sleep with an infected partner or not.  Also, When someone has HIV, but is taking their medication, their viral load can be at zero, meaning, if they were tested for HIV, it would come up negative. This does not mean they are cured, as there is no cure for HIV, but peopel can live normal lives for 20+ years with no viral load.  If you have sex with someone who has HIV, but a low viral load, it is less common that you will contract HIV. THAT DOES NOT MEAN IT IS SAFE. It just means the chance can be smaller.  HIV is contracted throguh blood and body fliuds only. You can share a glass, a bite of food, and will not catch it. You can only get it through an opening in your body,  The reason you get HIV during sex, is that the HIV is present in a mans semen, and during sex, microscopic tears form inside the vagina due to sex, you do not know these tears are there, they just happen, btu when a man ejaculates, his semes come sin contact with these tears, and HIV can get into the blood stream.   The same goes for oral sex. You would catch that if you had any open sore in your mouth, and his semen came in contact with it. That does not mean you are safe if he doesn't ejaculate, because a man releases some pre ejaculate, that still contains the virus.  SO this was a very long post, but I hope I answered you questions.  It isn't that HIV is harder to catch, the risk is out there, and it is very real, its just that some people have been lucky enough not to sleep with an infected parter. The only safe way is ALWAYS use protection, each and every time.\n\n",

    "content": "This has been going on for quite sometime now and it is starting to really scare me now. So I ask you professionals for your best opinion as to what my problem may be. I myself have smoked for 10 years and am in my mid 30s, Ive smoke pot for at least 4 years almost daily. The only problem I have that is attributed to these smoking habits are the thickness in my blood and the way that makes veins feel sometimes, restricted/constricted I guess would be a good explanation. Not sure if the smoking has something to do with me REAL problem.  The problem is that it seems I make people get sick. If im close to someone say less than 1 foot, sometimes they will clear their throat, sneeze or cough. If I am around them for a long time they develop a heavy cough or sneezing. If anything, this is highly contagious for it seems that everywhere I go someone tends to react from my presence in such a way.   Another symptom is, anytime I smoke pot, within 30 mintues or so if I scratch myself using my fingers I get these bumps, kind of bump you would get from a mosquito bite that recedes within 10 mintues if I don't scratch anymore. This only happens when I am HIGH, does not happen when I havent smoked pot or am not handling pot.  I havent been able to get a regular high paying job becuase I am afraid of making others sick around me at work. So I don't know what to do or even what this problem may be. I have been tested for STDs and am clear. Could this be some type of fungs or other type or disease or infection? I do have a couple bad teeth, could this possibly be the issue?  The last doctor I consulted said it was all in my head, but I know for sure this is not the case. The doctor prior to him said there was nothing he heard of before that would provoke such reaction by others from me.  The biggest issue is, I myself hardly ever get sick, cold/fever/flu. So why is it that I am contagious? Any advice would greatly be appreciated, for this is beginning to really get to me now.  One thing I do remember, and possibly when this started was one time I touched some plants with the palm of my hands as I was sitting down at night on what I thought was grass. As soon as I went down to sit i felt a stinging sensation on both my hands and quickly got up again. Right away my hands got really itchy and within 30 mintues my hands were swollen to the point where I could not close my hands into a fist. This went away within 2 days, but ever since that time I do believe I began to make people sick around me.  Does any of this make any sense to any doctors here? Please advise!   All I want to do is go back to being normal as I was before, please help!  Thanks in advance for your time!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear CaringHuman- It is possible that some of the people you come into contact with are very sensitive to cigarette smoke, which may cause some of their symptoms. And yes, smoking constricts (makes thinner) blood vessels in your body. This can lead to stroke, hypertension, as well as heart disease. I urge you to try to prepare yourself to quit. Many individuals have to \"practice\" quitting, and some use stop smoking aids such as lozenges, gum or even medication. Imagine how much money you could save ! You state that after you smoke marijuana you experience itching, Is this associated with hives (red welt like marks)? Do you have any other allergies?  Consider this-marijuana IS a WEED. You could be allergic! Try to stop smoking marijuana at LEAST for a few days.. a week at least, and see if you still experience the itching. If you do still have itching, you could have what is called idiopathic urticaria, meaning itching/hives for no known reason. Some people have been treated with a combination of over the counter medications that block the release of histamine, which causes the itching.  If you stop the marijuana and continue to have this problem, please reply back and I may have other suggestions for you. Thanks!\n\n",

Yes indeed, I have stopped smoking marijuana and am in the process of stopping my smoking habit, soon enough I will get over the urge of cigarrettes and am sure I will succeed in stopping that habit once and for all.  As for the bumps, I never get them unless I was smoking pot, I havent gotten since I stopped, so more than likely all my health issues span from my smoking habits and since I will be stopping the cigs and have already stopped the pot, I hope all my issues will be cleared.  I will keep you update on my health and hope to god that you are right in your feedback.  Thanks again and god bless!\n\n",

Soon, you will notice getting less winded with activity as your lungs start their healing process, and your memory and motivation levels  may even improve! As for cigarettes, well, don't be surprised if it takes a little, ok, a LOT more effort! There are many over the counter aids you can try, gum, lozenges, just remember try very hard not to smoke while using these.  Some things people do while attempting to quite are: brushing their teeth a lot, the minty breath followed by a cigarette, well just does't taste right! Also, try to stay busy to keep your mind off of cravings. Slow deep cleansing breaths several times a day, and if you have a hobby that occupies your hands, well, DO IT!  Rememeber, sometimes you may think, \"Oh, I'll just have one.... it'll be ok\". DON\"T FALL INTO THAT TRAP!  Where is your dream vacation spot? Think about it, that just may come true with all the money you are going to save by not purchasing cigarettes! Just don't buy them, if they aren't around it will make it a little easier.  Don't get disappointed if at first you don't succeed. It takes some people 2 or 3 times before they quit for good.  I KNOW you can do this! Good luck!\n\n",

My cervix is inflammed and they done many paps,blood work and urine samples and the only thing they have found is the inflammation and a slight sign of bacteria. Been having iregular bleeding for months now,and also just had a baby in september. Had a pap after the baby and everything was fine, stil nothing is showing.I have stomach pains but not in one place sides.lower belly,back and chest. Also started anxiety attacks, they have me on paxil for those, doctor said it could be hormonal from having a baby causing all these problems and anxiety... I am really confused and not forsure what to believe or what steps to take. My husband seems to believe its caused from my pregnacy because i went overdue and started what they called a bloody show, and thats when the bleeding started and still hasent quit.. I really need another opinion and some advice.I have had thyoid tests done that came back normal and have had three paps since my baby was born all normal.There is no pain during sex and usually no blood. But afterwords I start bleeding again.I just don't understand what it could be and why they havent been able to tell. Could it be cancer and if so how would they tell, I had displasia about a year ago and i was treated and had it removed and it hasent shown back up in any of my paps.I am scared to death,don't know what to expect or do.I am suppose to see another doctor thursday, should i request a biopsy or an ultrasound.What can i expect, or do...

It started out with what i thought to be ingrown hairs on my chest and breast area but i went to the doctor and was diagnosed with folliculitis. He treated me with antibiotics but they did not seem to help. The bumps then spread to my arms but they cleared up on my chest. Some of them can be popped like a pimple. This has gone on for a year now. Also now my throat has got white pockets in the back that will not go away. the inside of my jaws are the same also. each bump is the shape of a pear. I went to the doctor and recieved a rocphen injection and also oral anitbiotics. no help. Some days my throat will hurt and others it will not. I feel a crawling sensation most of the time. On my neck there is what seems to be glitter constantly moving like something is crawling around in my skin. And I have one black hair(I guess it is) that grows back in the same place every time i pluck it. My eyes are also involved. My eye doctor would not give me contacts because my eyes were so damaged inside. He said for me to go to the doctor for a clahmidia test or something?? My vision is not impaired. My eyelashes tend to clump together and my eybrows do also. My hair along my hair line does the same thing. When I pull out a hair there is either a white or black wet looking ball on the end and my hair moves like a worm or something. But the hair like thing that moves is thinner in texture than a hair. I don't know i am about to go crazy! I thought it was a parasite or maybe a fungal infection but who knows! I have taken a bath in alchol tried anti parasite medication you name it! HELP!\n\n",

I am 22 and was sexually molested as a child, which resulted in me getting genital warts, they were removed but i don't know if that can come back.  can the crawling and the ingrown hairs also be a result of my sexual molestation??  i have gone to doctors and am only told that the ingrown hairs are normal, but i don't think so.  my hairs grow more than one in each pore, i can pull out the ones that are infected but most of the time i have to eait until they can be popped and then pull out the hair.  is there a way that i can get rid of them?  i think im paranoyd but maybe its all connected somehow.   i live in new york and am in constant fear that i might get infected by a roach or a fly or something a rat has touched  if anyone has any idea about what is going on with me, please help\n\n",

In the last week, things have changed.  Three days ago, the fatigue, that I wake up with, was noticably more significant.  I am now waking up with my eyes scratchy and burning, whole body aches and muscle soreness, primarily in the back shoulder and neck, minor sinus and throat scratchiness and soreness, and minor lymph node swelling under the jaw.  As the day progresses the fatigue progresses to minor lethargy in the evening.  I am now running a low-grade fever in the evenings and experience a splitting headache that radiates into my neck and upper shoulder muscles.  This has been getting progressively worse over the last three days.  Are these symptoms of a known disease?  Can you help me know what's going on?  Thank you!\n\n",

If so, it could be what is called a chancre, caused by syphyllis which are usually not painful. You also state that you have a history of HSV-type1, which causes cold sores on the mouth.  It is possible to spread this via oral sex.  Without being able to see this bump, it is very difficult to say for sure. I strongly recommend a trip to his physician. It could be nothing, or it could be something more serious. Either way, finding out for sure will bring you both peace of mind.  Good luck!\n\n",

I've tried the usual, standing up, loosening my belt & clothes, not eating gassy foods, but it's been persistant over the last week and a half.  It's been bothering me at work, at home, while driving and I'm not sure what to do.  I've never had this sort of pain before.

Sme of the possibilities include Appendicitis, Cholecystitis (Gall Bladder-blocked bile duct?) or Pleurisy. Pleurisy is inflammation of the thin layers of tissue (pleura) covering the lungs and the chest cavityPleurisy is inflammation of the thin layers of tissue (pleura) covering the lungs and the chest cavity. PAin is worse with deep breaths. Have you experienced any nausea along with these symptoms? Another possibility, depending on the location of the pain is renal calculi (kidney stones).  I suggest a trip to your physician at your earliest convience.  Hope this helps and good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I'm wondering about STD testing.  I'm embarrassed to admit, but I've been naive about testing and always assumed that those various tests were performed during an annual well-woman exam.  (Which I am faithful to do)  Hence, I've never specifically asked for STD testing, except for an HIV test once.  Also, I've given blood many times and I know they screen for Hep B & C, syphilis, HIV, and HTLV I&II.  Now, after a friend told me they don't do it unless you ask, I've been nervous.  I've been monogamous for 3 years with my husband of 1 year, and he has been too.  But we've never talked about (and won't) my or his previous sexual partners.  I have had a history of unprotected sex (something I'm not proud of) but I've never had any symptoms, other than a few (self-diagnosed) yeast infections.  Now I'm worried that somehow I have some undiagnosed sexually transmitted diseases that have been dormant for years.  I do have an appointment for a yearly next week, but my nerves have gotten the best of me!  I need to know what the chances are of my having a STD go unnoticed for so long?    Thanks, Scoobie\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Scoobie,  The std that can be dormant for so long is hiv/aids otherwise usually every other disease manifests itself in an acute way.   In women sometimes the primary lesion of syphyllis (the chancre) presents itself in the cervix so it is not apparent but this is followed few weeks later by the typical rash of syphyllis which is usually not missed. If you want to be sure, you can always ask for the syphyllis blood tests.  Reagrding the blood it is tested for hep. b, hep. c, hiv, and syphyllis and i think malaria also. It is tested and it has nothing to do with whether you ask or not.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.

    "content": "Hello.  Received oral sex last night from a new partner.  She has only been with two other people, one for a long time, no symptoms or anything at all.  I have had one partner, again, no symptoms of anything.  It has been a year between partners.  Now, I received oral sex last night, and for one portion of it the tip of my penis burned for a second, almost as if she maybe got saliva or something inside it (don't know if thats relevant).  Anyways, later on that night, about 3 hours later, I went to the bathroom for the first time.    Right on the very tip of the head of my penis I noticed three discolored spots right near the opening.  Two seem to be purple and one is just slightly red.  There is no irritation, no itching, no burning during urination, nothing.  I visited my college medical center and the doctor told me it just looked like bruising, possibly from teeth, and to give it 24 hours or so.  It has now been about 15-16 hours and it hasn't subsided any yet.  I am just looking for a second opinion as the on-campus medical center is terrible as far as diagnosing colds and such.  It has me very worried.  Again, two of the dots are purple, one is slightly red.  They all are about 2mm or less in size.  Thanks for any advice here!  Again, no testing has ever been done, but as positive as I can be that  both of us are clean.  I inquired with the doctor about getting testing done, but she said she felt that it was not needed in this situation.  Lastly, if this is just a bruise, could anyone explain why my penis tip may have \"burned\" for a second or two during this?\n\n",

    "content": "I was playing football at a local park and ran past a soccer goal post and not seeing a small hook like thing on it put my hand on it and it cut the bottom of my hand pretty badly.  The cut looks very unpleasant but its not deep so that I would need stitches.  As soon as I cut it I washed it out with some sort of wet nap that was in a first aid kit, put some cream on it that was in the kit as well, and then wrapped it with some medical tape and left that on there for about 24 hours.  My question is what is the best method of letting it heal?  When I removed the tape the skin around the cut kind of looks like it does after swimming... it's white and kind of wrinkly (which I think may just be sweat that was under the bandage).  Will the cut heal better if I leave it open and let air get to it or if I continue to apply the creams and then wrapping it w/ gauze and medical tape?  The reason I was wrapping it before is it's on my right hand (and im right handed) and its in a spot that makes it hard to write and do other things.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi worried_nbama, All posts on this forum are important and are answered to the best of everyone's ability. My apologies for the delay in answering your post. With that being said, have you had an evaluation by a urologist or any diagnostic studies? Mondor's disease of the penis may present in acute, subacute or chronic phases. Mondor's disease is a  thrombophlebitis (blood clot) of the superficial dorsal vein of the penis. Some of the treatment for acute phases are with anti-inflammatory agents, anticoagulant drugs, and antibiotics. Some of the causes for this condition are prolonged intercourse, genital trauma, infection etc. Symptoms of pain on the dorsal surface is common. Keep in mind that I'm not saying that this is your particular problem but it is certainly something to be considered. If your concerns are lack of insurance, call your local hospital and inquire about assistance. Most hospitals have programs for people whom are uninsured/underinsured and they should be able to also provide you with information regarding a physician who would be able to offer services at possibly a lower cost. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

You may want to gargle with some warm salt water, (1/2 teaspoon salt per cup of water) as often as is comfortable. If it's viral in nature and there are no symptoms now such as fever etc. then usually no other treatment is required. However if symptoms persist then contact your family doctor who may want to do a swab test of your throat to check for strep and evaluate you for any other conditions. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "content": "One month ago, I started my 1st dose of Humira to help control Severe Ankylosing Spondylitis and a recent working diagnosis of IBS. Formerly on Enbrel. A couple days later I had a painful throat (more intense than sore throats I've had in the past), then coughing til it was painful to the chest, temp bounced between 96's up to 101.7, swollen tonsil with white spots-only 1 side, overheating; could only speak in a whisper; later I couldn't breath, so got a prescription for Advair & Prometh.DM/Decadron (put on breathing maching in dr office and diagnosed with a cold with wheezing; neg result for strep). Also, the white spots where mostly cleared up by dr visit, then completely gone, but returned 1 wk later. After the 2nd painful dose I had remaining 1/2 inch dark circles at shot area (took me a couple tries as the injecting of the Humira felt like acid squirting into my thigh); and a couple dark spots from the 2nd does as well. Rhem said from vit c preservative. Stopped Humira. Stopped cough syrup due to antihistamine causing rash and started Zithromax Z-Pak 5 doses. Sore throat gone, cough gone, but spots still visible and one side of tonsils swollen. Tried gargling salt water. GP prescribed Nystatin 100,000U; swish & spit 4ml daily. Noticed that I have blisters on top, front gum only. Blisters mostly gone after Nystatin, but white spots still on swollen tonsil and have spread to the other tonsil, although that tonsil has not gotten swollen. Due you have any suggestions on what this might be? I've never had any mouth/gum/throat issues before. Thanks for your help.\n\n",

Has your physician run any tests other than blood count such as for mono or strep?  Liver function should also be tested, including any factors that could be affecting the liver.    My suggestions come only from your typed symptoms.  More of a history is needed concerning medications you are on, previous medical history, etc...  A visit to a General Practicioner or Family Medicine physician would be a valid suggestion so they may review your entire history.  I would suggest doing this as soon as possible, as the yellowing skin is a symptom that points to the liver and should be checked.

Sometimes months will go by without any swelling but sometimes its every couple weeks and usually takes over 3 weeks for the swelling to go down. Even if they arent swollen i can always feel the lumps and if pressed on is painful.   When they become infected its extremely painful and have fever for the first couple days. I have seen 1 surgeon and 2 general doctors but not a specialist. I went to a gland specialist and he said i should see a dermatologist. Besides the surgery its always the same thing they tell me to do, wash with antibacterial soap every night and take antibiotics when they become infected. No one seems to have a cure from all i read online and the doctors ive been to don't either.\n\n",

    "content": "thank you for the query.  Lancefield classification is a 'serologic'  classification of bacteria of haemolytic(blood cell breaking)  streptococci into groups based on their specific carbohydrate antigen on their wall. Based on this, types from A to O have been identified. Group A is the most common in causing infections to humans. Group D is quite uncommon in humans. S bovis and Streptococcus equinus are the 2 members of this class of streptococci. S equinus is almost never isolated from human specimens, leaving S. bovis.   You didnot mention what was the specimen used to get this report. was this blood? you might need a culture and sensitivity done.  any further enquiries are welcome.\n\n",

Sometimes (though not often) I wake up with it a little red with a slight bit of crust.  It almost seems to be an allergy of some sort since I've also had a cough and runny nose for a few days.

I was tested for strep but it came back negative and was given amoxacillan spelling?  The sore throat has now lasted for just under 3 months and I have since went to the doctor who tested for strep again negative, and gave me more amox.  Then once more and was given z-pac.  During these 3 months my sore throat gets really bad then gets better to the point I think its going to go away then poof the next day its back with a vengence.    Symptoms are Really big tonsils almost touching, like so close my finger would not be able to fit between them. Sore throat that varies in intensity Night sweats where i will wake up soaked, went through 2 sets of clothes last night. Extremely dry mouth if I do anything physical.  I should also mention a month before this sore throat came I had my nose broken in a sparring match at kickboxing.  Not sure if this would matter.  Finally I went to a ENT he looked at my tonsils and said they need to be removed but did not want to listen to any of my symptoms or anything.  only that I had sore throat for over 2 months.    I do not have insurance and this has all ready cost me a lot of money and I really don't want to shell out 3k bucks.  Any ideas on what I should do?  Thanks a lot,  Travis\n\n",

    "content": "The broken nose could have affected your sinuses, causing increased post-nasal drip, causing a sore throat.  When you say you saw \"white things\" on your tonsils, were they spots all over the tonsils or were they isolated to one cavity within the tonsil?  Were the white spots on the back of your throat also or only the tonsils?  If they were confined to the one area on each of the tonsils, this points more toward allergies rather than infection.  I'm curious why antibiotics continue to be prescribed for you when your tests continue to come back negative.  How does the inside of your nose feel?  Is it dry or runny?  You could always try the old standby's of breathing warm, humid air (the steam from a hot shower, bath or boiling water) could help your sinuses begin to clear if they are the culprits.  Give us some more information about the sightings in the back of your throat and we'll be able to get more of an idea.\n\n",

This can cause a senerio where the germs causing an infection or inflamation are held at bay only to return with a vengence if an antibiotic is not taken for the prescribled length of time...  long enough to kill the offending germs.  It is a serious matter when your throat swells to almost closing off.  Why?  It can potentially affect your breathing.

    "title": "Unknown Infection, lasted over 6 months.",
    "content": "Hi, I am a 26 year old, married, non-smoking,non-drinking, female who has had chronic monolike symptoms for over 6 months. I went to the emergency room about 6 mos. ago with a very sore throat and swollen glands and was given a rapid strep test and a throat culture and sent home with antibiotics that made me sick. After a few days a felt worse and called for my results from the step test and throat culture and was told they were negetive.  So I went back in and they ran a mono test that came back \"faintly positve\", the sent me home with a different antibiotic and told me to follow up with my doctor. When I followed up with my doctor she tested me for mono again and aslo ran a check for cmv and ebv all of which turned up negative.  I still felt worse but my doctor had gone on vacation and I went to see another doctor.  I should add that at each of these doctors visits I was running a low grade fever and had a fast heart rate and poor blood pressure.  This doctor told me after and examination that I was really sick and he didn't know why, but was determined to find out.  He had a super duper blood panel done that came back fine. I know that chronic mono like sypmtoms presented by a patient who seemingly has nothing wrong with them is suspected of being infected with HIV. On that note, I have to say that I am not a risk and that I have been tested repeatedly, all with negative results.  My first test was when I was 3mos pregnant three years ago.  My second test was a year ago when I first started to feel really run down a fatigued after I stopped nursing my son.  I dropped 15-20 pounds in 2 mos. and had no appetite. I also had sore joints, swelling in my fingers, and sore wrists. I also had unexplained red marks that would appear on my arms and hands. That time I was diagnosed with depression and given meds. After months of taking super expensive antidepressents that didn't really help, and just made me gain weight I went to a naturalpath who thought I might have a thyroid disorder. Her blood test came back \"borderline\" according to her standards which she said are much lower than the test I recieved while pregnant. She put me on The \"Eat right for your type\" diet for an O+ and I tried to follow it for 1 1/2 months and felt worse than ever.  And my 3rd test was with that \"super duper\" blood panel that my last doctor ordered.  I have not seen a doctor now for months because I got tired of no one being able to give me a diagnosis. I have seen five doctors and a dentist and no one can tell me what is wrong.  I still have a recurring sore throat, swollen glands and I have increasing pain under my tongue(so painful it brings tears to my eyes), down my neck and in my clavicle area. The area under my chin is constantly swollen.  I am also currently 12 weeks pregnant with our second child and I am terrified that this mystery illness could harm my fetus. In addition to the sore throat etc. I still have swollen fingers with pain in the joints, my wrists and my knees. I also still get red marks on my hands and arms that sometimes itch,and a red, painful rash on the back of my scalp and sometimes a red \"rash\" on my face that doesn't hurt or itch.  I currently have the face and scalp rash.My hands and feet are always ice cold even though I live in Hawaii  From time to time I where the tepmperature rarely falls below 70 degrees. I get migraine headaches once every month or two. And for the last three days that I have been monitering my temperature I have had a low grade fever  ranging from 99.4-100.4 degrees.  I am very tired and nauseous as well, but at 12 weeks pregnant that is to be expected. I hope I have provided enough information, I have tried to be as specific as possible with my symptoms. Any information anyone could give me would be extremelu helpful, I am scared that something serious may be going on and is getting worse as my doctors keep giving me the brush off.\n\n",

    "content": "I have had a lot of the same type of symptoms and problems since a year and a half ago.  The rash is not really one of the symptoms that I have had, but the swollen lymphnodes all over that leave your hands feeling swollen and soar.  Painful underarms, low grade fever, etc.  My tongue would get swollen and soar, too. Some symptoms started to get a little better after the removal of a lymphnode that the doctor told me an infection might be festering in.  I really did not get much better and two days later ended up in the hospital with some other symptoms, including a massive infection that my body was in shock from.  This is a long story, so I will cut it short.  Even though they never discovered the cause, and do not agree with my original theory that my intestine ripped, I do believe all of the lymphnodes being swollen and infected had something to do with it.   Maybe the antibiotics and painkillers complicated things because I seemed to be having intestinal problems from them, but I remember reading that when all of your lymphnodes are swollen there was danger of some leaking into your blood stream.  I do not have a spleen and have been fighting infections all of my life.  I continued to have problems after I was released from the hospital and finished up the oral antibiotics.  A tooth that was suppose to rootcanaled had broken and needed to be removed.  The root canal did not kill the tooth, and they thought maybe a lingering infection in my tooth may have been the problem that I was having.  The tooth was removed in the hospital because it was a curved root and the oral surgeon had to go through the bone and take it out piece by piece. Also, I was having the surgery at the hospital because I did not have a spleen.  Anyways, After the removal of that tooth I was better more often.  I still had frequent infections, but not continiously and worstening when the antibiotics were finished.  Now I have been sick for two months, starting ten months after my surgery for my tooth.  Another tooth in a different area is bothering me and the area I had surgery on is bothering me.  My heart has been giving me problems since last May before my first hospitalization for infection.  I too am trying to get to the bottom of this chronic infection and hope that when the tooth gets taken care of that I will be better.  Also, if you have an infection in your heart valve, you can be sick for a long time and have your symptoms.  I have not pushed the doctors for the test that catches it, but I did have an EKG that showed an enlarged heart valve.  I read that there is only one test that takes several blood samples over a period of time and is kept at a certain temp. to truely diagnose this kind of infection.  Good luck.  I have been sick during my pregnancies, too.  After the birt h of my second baby I had an infection that the doctors couldn't diagnose or treat and it turned into a full blown sinus infection that they treated with six weeks of intervenious Unysin.  I did get better for quite a while.\n\n",

The infection had been there for possibly a month prior due to misdiagnosis from one doctor.   As I was finally correctly diagnosed, I was put on Septra DS twice a day for 10 days. At approx. day 8 I began feeling pain in the bones of the back of my skull, slightly labored breathing, stiff neck, and a headache that had been there for 3 days prior.   Today I just finished my last dose of Septra and am feeling flu-like. I have a slight fever  of 99.8, chills and my breathing is labored. My neck is stiff and when I turn my head from side to side it aches, although I have no headache currently. The bones in the back of my skull are still very tender, although not as swollen and painful as 2 days ago.   How am I to know the MRSA is gone? My doctor never mentioned whether I should schedule a follow up appt. Is it possible I just have the flu? Or could this be the MRSA? Please help me. I'm scared.\n\n",

I called my doctors exchange and the doc on call advised that with a stiff neck and sudden fever I should have meningitis ruled out. I had a spinal tap and several blood draws, and everything came out fine. They suppose I just have a bad viral infection.   Unfortunately, now I'm laying here in brutal backpain (that extends to the sides of the trunk of my body) from the spinal tap. I have Vicodin and it's not even cutting through. Any ideas of what I can do?   Thank you in advance.\n\n",

    "content": "I broke both legs in dec. When I got the casts off I went to get a pedicure. They cut my big toe.It became infected and at physical therapy they told me i had to got to dr and get it checked. I did. he removed a third of toenail, cleaned it out and told me to use peroxide daily.It would not heal. I went back to dr several times. No culture was taken, no antibiotics given. I then developed a deep sore on my right breast and sores in nose. I had no idea they might be connected to toe. In April I became very ill and could not breathe. I went to dr twice and was given prednisone and a z-pack. In 4 days I was in hospital. I was in hospital for 15 days very ill. I was on solumeterol and levaquin in iv. I dropped the vitamin d,calcium and protein from my blood, my blood pressure went very low,I became too weak to chew,my blood sugar soared to over 400, my veins shut down. My nose began to bleed daily and I began to have sores all over. after i was released i kept mentioning the sores and was treated for yeast and drug reaction.  In June my hair began to fall out. I was sent to a dermatologist who diagnosed mrsa.I have been on clindamycin and bactriban for a month.sores are healed, but i keep getting new sores briefly and red hot spots on skin. My left breast has become sore and i have become very arthritic. no fever usually Questions-Do you think the illness in the hospital could have been the mrsa? Do you think the toe started it? I am worried I need an infectious disease doctor and vancomycin. Will I ever be cured? I have been off work for 5 months . Help!\n\n",

    "content": "Regarding your follow up visit, the doctor will probably swab the inside of your nose for a culture.  If you are still MRSA positive he or she may prescribe another  round of antibiotics for you .  You may have to go back for a couple of follow-ups.  The MRSA may be eradicated or unfortantley you may be a lifetime carrier.  Either way the follow up visits are very important.  I suggest that you practice strict handwashing, keep any areas that may be draining covered, and complete all antibiotics prescribed unless otherwise indicated by a doctor.  REMEMBER , THOUROUGH HANDWASHING IS THE NUMBER ONE WAY TO PREVENT INFECTION.  ALCOHOL BASED HAND SANITIZERS SUCH AS GERM-X ARE ALSO VERY EFFECTIVE.  Hope I have helped.\n\n",

Even the VERY short ones have this \"dusting\" as soon as they grew back. It's like a coating of sugar or dust on the hair itself. No itching, swelling, redness or irritation. Just this \"dust\". It looks like soap that was poorly rinsed but it's not. Hasn't spread to abdomen area or higher (yet). White-covered hairs are concentrated in groin area primarily. Could be sweat-related. I wash every day. Sometimes more than once. But does seem to be spreading. Please advise.\n\n",

    "content": "I'll keep it as brief as possible. Thank you in advance for any help please.   About a month and a half ago I had a sore throat and noticed white spots/marks on my left tonsil. I went to the ER(no insurance here), and they said it was strep, but did NO culture. They gave me Amoxicillin for 10 days. I took it the spots went away, but new symptoms arose. I had swollen glands, swollen/enlarged left tonsil, a blister right of my uvulae, and what felt like something swelling in my throat(left side and adams apple). I went to a doctor and he said the amox didnt get it all, so he prescribed Keflex for 7 days(maybe its keflen) and presidone for 3 days. 2 days went by and the pain and swelling felt worse, i was smoking, immediately quit, because i felt like I was having trouble breathing, but I think I just felt really swollen in my throat. I went to an ENT and he said acid reflux and said my mouth/throat looked normal, he gave me acidphex. I had trouble swallowing pills even, felt like they were staying in the back lower part of my throat(behind adams apple). I went to ENT again, and I notice the blister by the uvuale still there and pointed it out, he also noticed a cyst/blister on left side of my throat, said it was normal. I had trouble believing that. Since then, I have been to the ER twice, doctor again, and health clinic once. On on occasion 2 weeks ago, i went to the ER with a 102 temp and dehydration and massive pain. I had diarrhea for days, lost 15 pounds, fatigued, trembling, WBC was 15.6, wbc in stool, and felt like i was dying. They gave me ivs for dehdration, immodium ad, and prescribed cipro(twice a day for 4 days) and bentyl. Over the next week i felt better, but now the same symptoms are coming back. The redness in mouth/throat have never left and neither have the blisters, i see some on my left tonsil and even some small white/yellow marks in the opening of the tonsil. I have had 2 hiv tests, syphilis test, mono test, and some basic blood tests. My family says its anxiety, but i cant believe it. I have blisters in my mouth, glands in pelvic area are hurting(like i got kicked there), headache on left side, and pain in throat and tonsil area. If i eat cold food(milkshake) it swells(or feels like it swells). i am achey and fatigued, and yes i am having anxiety over this. I am straight but had 1 gay experience about a week prior to all this starting in which i gave him oral, he ejaculated in my throat/mouth, and i did rim him. I am running in circles with this and have asked the hospital and doctor to do std test(other than whats been done) and they said it wouldn't be that. I am woried because i usually work out 5 times aweek and have no fatigue or trouble going to work. That has ALL changed now. Plus i have noticed since i was dehydrated and in the ER(given IVs and Cipro) that the dorsal vein on my penis has swollen up to the size of a pencil, it has never been noticeable before, it too feels like there is some mild constriction there as well as on and off in the testicles. Also some weakness numbness in those areas as well as the left leg and pelvis. I am really scared and worried, have no insurance and am running out of money and family support.   Please help me if you can. Should i try to go to infectious disease doctor? im going to another doctor(walk in clinic) tomorrow. Please help me.............I feel much pain and worry(it almost feels like the flu, but i only had a temp twice that i noticed). No coughing, throat is more bothered or swollen than sore, but sometimes sore, and as the days go by again, i feel it getting worse again, it hit my intestinal area agian today, but no diarrhea yet, but i am staying on the BRAT diet so far. sorry this is so long, i hope someone can help me. Thank you.\n\n",

A month ago, while having beer, within 20 min. a small lump started appearing behind the left ear which kept growing at a rapid pace. Soon red blotches started appearing all over my body and suddenly my entire back was red. The doctor gave me anti-histamines and all the symptoms disappeared. Everything was back to normal. The similar symptoms have appeared twice more while having beer & just two days ago, while having whisky. I guess this narrows the search down to Alcohol being the cuplrit.  Is there any cure ?

    "title": "Is Cold Sores a STD?",
    "content": "Hi i need some education about cold sores.  I have had them very occasionally since i was born, and usually they go away within a week or so. Recently i use a cream on them called Zovirax and that often stops them from even appearing at all which is great. So its not something that really bothers me. Also i don't ever have sores anywhere else on my body.  The reason i am posting though, is because ive got a new girlfriend and she has talked about having sex without a condom because she started taking the pill. I didnt say anything, but im scared that i can't do it because i carry the cold sore virus.  So do i have a STD? Can she catch it from me if we have sex and will it definatly mean she will get cold sores? Is it possible she could get sores on her vagina even although i only ever have the small sores on my lips occasionally?  Is it possible i could have already given her the virus by kissing her? Or can it only be transmitted if I have a cold sore at the time?  I had a STD test last year and it came back as all clear but i don't know if they even looked for the Cold Sore Herpse virus or not.  Im really quite worried about this, because im not sure if i can ever have sex because of it. And im most worried that i have already given her the virus by kissing her.  Please help\n\n",

    "title": "Cold sores",
    "content": "Ninety percent of all people will have at least one cold sore, (herpes simplex outbreak) sometime in their life.  Some children who are affected with cold sores may become seriously ill. However, after the first cold sore infection, many people develop antibodies to the cold sore virus and never have another cold sore. About 40% of American adults, however, have repeated cold sores.   Cold sores are highly contagious when a flare up is present, and a cold sore can be transmitted even when there is no visible signs of a cold sore, this is called viral shedding. Children often become infected with the cold sore virus by contact with parents, siblings or other close relatives who have cold sores.    The cold sore virus is highly contagious. Anyone experiencing symptoms of a cold sore must be very cautious when being intimate with another person so as not to transmit the cold sore virus. Those who have symptoms of a cold sore should refrain from contact with another person to help avoid transmission of cold sores.  If the cold sore  virus has been transmitted, the infection is permanent.   Cold sores can be either a one time event or reoccur.  Possible causes of a cold sore reactivating may include stress, fever, menstruation, cold, fatigue and sunlight. Recurrent cold sores usually occur as lesions in or around the mouth.    Cold sores can be transmitted to the genitals by oral sex.\n\n",

It is better to investigate your immune status before embarking on another course of immunisations. For that, you will be subjected to a Hepatitis B profile.

Do you know what strain of malaria is prevalent in the area you visited? What precautions did you take?

    "title": "Please help...Mono or something else?",
    "content": "Hi...I'm sure this question has been asked loads of times, but I am a bit worried. 3 months ago I noticed the gland on the right side of my neck grew extremely large (could be seen just looking at me). It was very hard, and did not hurt at all. I let it be for about a week and when there was no change in size, I went to see the doctor. The doctor felt it and asked me of any symptoms, I felt fine other than the huge lymph node, and the doctor checked and no other nodes were swollen. My only symptom was being tired and being a college student, I didn't think too much of that and neither did the doctor.   After another week passed, I returned to the doctor because there was still no improvement. I was tested for mono, strep (even though I had no sore throat) and had a CBC. I was told negative for mono and negative for strep. The CBC showed that I had a viral infection and that my platelet count was increased. They sent me home and told me to take tylenol.   About 4 days after this, I began to feel sick, just the usual cold type symptoms and decided to go back in and get tested again. This time they did a chest X-ray, CBC, Mono test, Strep test, and since I go to school in the desert, tested me for Valley Fever. Everything came back normal except for my mono test was now positive, my chest x-ray showed a nodule on my lung, and my platelets were still increased at 460000, my SEGS was 47 and my Lymph was 48 (not sure what any of that means).   I was relieved to find out I had mono, and thought everything would be better. However when I returned home from school, my node was still large. It gradually started getting smaller, but still has not returned to normal and is still fairly large.   I am extremely tired, and recently felt like I had an ear infection. When I went into the doctors for the ear infection, I decided to have them test me for mono again since I showed 2 different results within a 4 day period when I was still in school. The results from my doctor at home were that I tested negative for mono and had no signs of antibodies for it or any sign of it at all. They said this was fine because mono can make you feel sick for months, but not show up in the blood again after testing positive for it before. My concern is that it has now been 3 months, and I still have an enlarged node. I never felt as though I had mono (i.e. I never had any kind of sore throat, no other glands were ever enlarged) being very tired has been the only serious symptom I have had other than nausea and low grade temps that are on and off. And now for the past week the right side of my neck, where my gland is enlarged, is very achy.   Basically, I'm not quite sure what I\u2019m asking other than do you think that this is something more than mono or is this common to having mono. I feel like something is just not right with me, and I have repeatedly been on my doctors case, but I feel like they are just brushing me off as having mono because it is the easy diagnosis for a 19 year old, female college student. It worries me that I tested negative for mono, then positive 4 days later, then negative again 3 and a \u00bd weeks later.   If anyone has any ideas at all, or has been in a similar situation, I would greatly appreciate any thoughts at all you may have! Thank you!\n\n",

He subsequently was dx with kidney cancer In April, when he had the same episode of fever, sore throat--but he threw up a few times.  I took him into the ER and they did a CT scan of his abdomen, because of the vomiting--tha'ts how they found the tumor.   So if you are having nausea, I think you need a CT Scan--but I'm not a doctor or a nurse.  The surgeon thought the fevers were coming from the infection next to the tumor.  They did a radical nephrectomy.  Theoretically, he is now cancer free.  Except now he has still had fevers and the sore throat--so I don't know what that means either.

    "content": "Many cases of infectious mononucleosis (mono) are asymptomatic, but in symptomatic patients, the main features are fever, headache, sore throat, lethargy, rash, enlarged lymph nodes in the neck, enlarged spleen and a mild hepatitis.    The blood tests you had have been contradictory, but diagnosis is usually confirmed by a positive Paul-Bunnell test and positive Epstein-Barr Virus IgM antibodies. Do you know if these were the tests conducted?  Your ESR is within normal range.   Infection with Toxoplasmosis or Cytomegalovirus may produce a similar clinical picture as mono, but of course the lab tests for mono would then be negative. With the persistence of an enlarged lymph node in the neck and other symptoms, you must be further evaluated for these other conditions producing a similar picture. The nodule in the lung detected by Xray and CT scan should also be rechecked to determine if there is a change in size.

    "content": "Hello,  Pennsylvania has at least two spiders \u2013 the Yellow Sac spiders and a Brown Recluse spiders that can cause ulcers, it could be that you\u2019ve been bitten by one of these. Until you find out, do not pick at the puss spot, keep the area clean and covered and report any changes in your body (fevers, chills, nausea, rash, etc.) to your doctor without hesitation.  The Brown Recluse spiders venom includes a neurotoxic component. About 7 hours after a bite, a small blister-like sore appears that will grow in size. Symptoms include chills, fever, bloody urine, fatigue, jaundice, pain in the joints, nausea, rash, and in extremely rare cases, convulsions and death.  The amount of damage depends on the amount of venom injected.  The damaged area may be the size of a dime or as large as 8 inches in diameter.  If the poison gets between the muscle fibers it can cause damage to the nerves and muscles as it goes.  Healing is slow and scar tissue results from the wound.  Healing may take 6-8 weeks or require up to a year if the wound is large. The health and age of a person will play a large role in recovery.\n\n",

    "content": "I am at my wits end.  For the last year I have had a re-occuring sore throat with sores on my throat, tongue, and gums.  When this happens I'm in terrible pain and it literally wipes me out, zaps my strength to where I'm so weak I can only sleep.  This sore throat complete with mouth sores lasts a full week plus.  When this all started I would only get the sore throat about every three to four weeks.  I saw my doctor's PA and she suggested that I gargle every day with a mouth wash that had Thymol in it, and to rinse my mouth out with Malox.  This helped for awhile, but after six months this problem seemed to become resistant to the thymol.  Then the sore throat and sores occurred every three weeks, now it's every two weeks.  I wake up with a sore throat and one sore in the back of my throat, by the next day I have a mouth full of sores and this lasts over a week.    I spoke with my doctor and he gave me a prescription for a paste to put on the sores, most of which I cannot reach...and the paste doesn't last.  He told me to change toothbrushes every month as well.  But didn't really offer any suggestion as to why this is happening.  I am frustrated, in pain, and weak from this happening all of the time.  I don't know what to do next.  Should I ask to be sent to a specialist, and if so, what kind of specialist.  I just can't go on like this.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello. I have been having swollen 2 swollen fingers about 2 months ago. They were very red looking and were feeling and looking infected at the very tip near the fingernail. I never went to the doctor about this. They swelled very bad after a week or so so I sqeezed them and puss came out. I squeezed until there was no puss left coming out. After 2 days that I did that there was no more swelling or pain and everything went back to normal. Was that a good thing to do? It sure felt like it after 2 days of doing. But now a week ago a different finger feels and looks the same way I squeezed it but this time no puss will come out. So what should I do and what is the problem from this? Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "There are several types of bacterial infections, namely paronychia and felon which are found in the mouth, and if there is any broken skin, i.e. hangnail being bitten, it can cause infection.  Herpetic viruses can cause them, if you have cold sores or genital herpes, you could infect yourself.  This is much less likely, though.  If your fingers swell and contain pus, it can become an infection called cellulitis that can be potentially very serious, even to the point of the area being amputated if not treated.  Squeezing pus out only introduces more bacteria into the affected area, and is generally not recommended.  Keep the infected area very clean with peroxide and/or betadine, use antibiotic ointment and see the doctor.  There may be some other reason you are so prone to these infections.    Worst case scenario, diabetics commonly get sores, blisters and infections in the extremities chronically and may have a more difficult time healing.  Ask your doctor if he thinks you should be checked for it just in case.\n\n",

No infection should go without very careful cleaning, antibiotic ointment and bandaging, if it doesn't improve at all in a day or two, should be seen by a doctor.   Your infections more than likely are a result of biting your fingers.  If you have existing infections to the point of having pus in them, do not attempt to remove the pus; see your doctor to find out for sure what is causing them.\n\n",

    "title": "alcohol related penis rash NEED HELP!",
    "content": "Hello,  I am a 19 year old male and I get a very irritating rash on my penis that lasts for about 7days when ever I drink anything with alcohol in it. The first 2 times it happened I thought it was something on my hand and that when i went to piss (which I have to do alot of when im drinking) that I tranferred the stuff to my penis, but after the 3rd time and every single other time I had a drink of bozz  the rash always apearred the next morning causing me extreme discomfort for many days.   I put rash creams on it and it helped, but only temporally. The bizzare thing is that it always appears the next morning and the rash starts at the bass of the penis then after a while it spreads all over my penis, but it never infects the head of my penis. This rash only started to appear right around the time I turned 18, I never had this problem when i drank alcoholic drinks in my younger years.  Did i some how develop an allergic reaction to alcoholic drinks over the years, or is God trying to get me to stop drinking? and if i am allergic to alcohol why does the rash only appear on my penis and no where else, and am i the only one who has this problem or are there others, and can this be treated so that I can still have a drink with my friends once and a while?\n\n",

    "content": "Ok. Here's the deal. (this is for my mom.)  I work at a vet clinic. and today I was assisting the doctor to hold a dog who was a fear biter- replacing the girl who was currently holding him due to a phone call she needed to answer. the dog was coming in for its rabies vaccination, which it was only a week overdue for. As the doctor was going to muzzle the dog, the girl let go before I had the dog under my control and the dog bit me.   It wasn't a vicious bite, it didn't even break the skin, even the red mark it left went away after about 20 mintues. I washed my hands with anti-bacterial soap, double checked that It didn't break the skin, which it didn't, washed my hands again, then went back about my daily business.   When I talked to my mom later this evening and my mom asked how my day went, absent-mindedly, I told her. Big mistake. She wanted me to get the rabies vaccine since the dog's vaccine had lapsed by a week and the whole 9 yards.   I explained to my mom that for one, small breed domesticated dog to human rabies is extremely rare- you never hear of a pet giving rabies to someone in America. Its usually a racoon or bat or some other wild animal. Secondly- I tried to explain that not only does an animal's bite need to break skin, even then its rare, usually the bite has to be fairly deep to reach the tissue so the virus can hit the nerve endings and travel to your brain.   of course being the over-protective mom that she is, she's still kind of worried. So I told her I'd show her some resources. I was gathering up some online educational materials when I found this site. Any insightive words from a doctor for my mother?  (Besides tell your daughter to find a new less 'motherly stressful' career?) lol\n\n",

    "content": "The important thing is not whether it is type I or type II; do you have outbreaks on your genitials?  If so, you will need a swab and culture/microscophic exam to confirm that you have genital herpes.  Just because you have type I herpes does not mean you have type II as well.   Blood tests are less accurate than a swab test.  Only type I can be spread from oral to genitial and vice versa.  Type II can only be spread to and from genitals.  The main difference between the two is the area of nerves the virus resides in; type II in the lower back and type I near the ears.  I suggest if you have genital sores, you get a culture done asap.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 20 yr. old male and my ex says that i somehow gave her HPV in the time leading up to august of 2004 at which time she had an abnormal pap, I shave my pubic region and have never noticed anything, however, I haave recently have slacked off on shaving frequently and  I've started developing bumps, just a few and not in the cauliflower type clusters i've read are commonly connected with HPV, it could just be ingrown hairs, however, I still would like to see a specialist. I went to an urgent care and they said they couldn't tell if it was genital warts or not, but just to be sure they put some wart removing fluid on it, however it never went away.  I'm wondering what field of medical specialty would be best to vist...a urologist, a dermatologist, or some other specialty field any advice on who to see would be very much appreciated thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "It sounds like classic infuenza to me - although it's past flu season, it's not impossible.  Has anyone that you know of been sick lately?  The pain in the back and legs, also the very sudden onset of fever and  cold-like symptoms are key.  If you get to the doctor within 24 hours or so, he can prescribe some amantidine to lessen the severity and duration of the illness.   Unfortunately, there is no cure; it is a virus and doesn't respond to antibiotics.  It will go away, but may take several days, and you may feel fatigued for several days after.  Do not let your temp get too high - if it does, it is possible to have febrile seizures.  Take the Dayquil as directed, get plenty of fluids, fevers dehydrate.  Do not try to do anything you don't absolutely have to, definitely don't go to work!   You will be very contagious while the fever is present.  I hope you feel better soon.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Arsalan,          having frequent attacks of tonsillitis sure can be very irritating, right? It is true that tonsillitis can have its complications, that of having valvular defects, most especially the mitral valve wherein these valves will have an abnormality in opening and closing. Strains of group A beta hemolytic streptococci are the ones responsible for causing such defects when tonsillitis is left untreated. Don't worry though because there is what we call a prophylaxis for frequent attacks of tonsillitis so that you can protect yourself from getting complications (the antibiotic that I know of that's being used as prophylaxis is Penicillin G or penicillin V which is given intramuscularly). Kindly ask your physician about it. I am sure your physician will know what's best for you.  Sincerely M.D.\n\n",

I took that Bactrim for 10 days and still am running the fever.  I recently had quite a bit of lab work drawn and my CMP and CBC were both normal but that was a couple of months ago.  I also had a CT of my head at that time for the migraines.   A couple of weeks ago I had swollen tender axillary lymph nodes and I still have one on the left side of my neck.  It's not that big but it is tender when I run my fingers across it.  The others went away within a couple of days.  That is all I can really think of.    Thanks  Renae\n\n",

I have not been sexually active for several months (I would estimate the beginning of January '05) and as far as my partner knew, he was clean.  I noticed the first bump which began forming a little over a month ago, though now there are similarly 4 or 5. I realize I cannot possibly have an accurate diagnosis without a proper check-up, though I was hoping you could provide me with some information before I make an appointment.\n\n",

Did she perform oral sex on you?  You really need to get yourself to your / a doctor, and have this examined, and checked to ensure it's not an STD like Herpes.......but go as soon as possible.  Sometimes it's very difficult to diagnose an STD when it's in the latter stages.  Be sure to ask for the bloodtest for Herpes as well.....one that distinguishes between type 1 and type 2.    And please, until you have this properly diagnosed by a doctor, AVOID having any kind of sexual contact with anyone - that includes oral sex and even masturbation.  It might not be an STD but you never know......you have the responsibility to have this checked out, so as to know what it is and be sure you protect your partners in the future.  And don't worry about feeling embarassed to see a doctor...they deal with this kind of thing ALL THE TIME, honestly.    Does the bump look like a blister?  Does it look like a pimple?  Whatever you do, do NOT squeeze it.  Is it at the base of the shaft or further up?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello everybody. I woke up today with a little swelling on the right side of my neck. It is at the place I would imagine mumps' swelling should occur. Like right below my ear and right below the jaw bone. It is not very noticeable by the unattentive eye, but if I carefully see it and if I put my fingers into it, it is obviously swollen. I have some pain, but bearable I guess. Maybe the Advil that I took helped with that a little. I have also discomfort chewing and opening my jaw/mouth. The swelling is not soft or tender, but rather tough.  I do not have fever or any symptoms of malaise, not today and not lately, at all. I consider myself as a very healthy person actually... almost never get sick. I also have had MMR 4-5 years ago when I entered college. I am 23 y.o. now, female, 5'6\", about 132 lbs.  Is it possible that the vaccine should fail? I am really scared because mumps could have bad complications. I am also scared that if I have mumps my younger brother will get it from me too. He is 19 and we live together.   I am putting warm water compresses over it right now. Would warm saline gargles help? I am very worried about this. Anybody has an opinion? Please?\n\n",

    "content": "The mumps virus typically causes a swelling of the parotid gland on one or both sides of the face giving the patient an obvious facial swelling. The parotid gland is situated anterior to the ear, but the area you have described ( \"right below my ear and right below the jaw bone\") is known as the angle of the jaw where lymph nodes are located, not the parotid gland. If the lymph node is swollen and tender, you may require a physician's evaluation to determine the cause. Patients with mumps complain of pain and swelling over the parotid gland, and the pain and swelling are made worse by eating.  You should have received the MMR vaccine earlier in life at the age of 12-15 months and a booster dose again at 4-6 years. These two doses give a lifelong immunity. The vaccine is so efficacious that clinical disease is rare in immunized persons. The dose you received 4-5 years ago should totally exclude the possibility of mumps unless this was the first and only MMR vaccine administered on you. Please check your childhood immunisation records to confirm previous doses.   Dr Anthony Solomon MB BS DTM&H DIP.VEN FRSM Tropical & Genitourinary Medicine\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Berlin,   Welcome to our forum. Is this rash acute or chronic? You may have had protected vaginal intercourse, but is there a history of unprotected orogenital contact (fellatio)? The condition you describe on the head of the penis (glans) and foreskin (prepuce) is known as balanoposthitis.  I will deal only with the acute condition and the non-venereal causes since you are emphatic that it is not sexually transmitted. Several factors are implicated in acute balanoposthitis and it is only by examination that a diagnosis is possible. This is unfortunately not possible over the internet.  Non-venereal causes of balanoposthitis include: minor trauma poor hygiene  topical medicaments/cosmetics/aphrodisiacs underlying inflammatory skin disease, eg eczema and psoriasis primary infections such as candida and certain bacteria  Candida infection is one of the most common causes of an itchy rash affecting the glans and foreskin of the penis. It most often stems from the vagina but orogenital contact has also been implicated. Diabetics and immuno-suppressed persons are more prone to develop genital candidiasis.  No, I am not aware that washing the genitalia regularly with soap and water can cause balanitis. An exception would be hypersensitivty to the soap used.  Get examined to determine the aetiology so that appropriate treatment can be administered.  Dr Anthony Solomon MB BS DTM&H DIP.VEN FRSM Tropical & Genitourinary Medicine\n\n",

    "content": "have a 16 month old daughter that started having diarreha March 28th then fever started April 3rd by April 5th she was running 102.6 and the doctor put her in the hospital because she was very lathargic. Her WBC 27,000 ESR 83 chest x ray okay abdomen x ray okay nasal swab came back okay. They started her on IV antibiotics and she stayed in the hospital until April 9th. She had antibiotics every day and her white cells went down. They also did a tick bite test on her that was normal. She continued to run a fever but it became low grade so they let us leave the hospital and sent her home with 10 days of augmentin. She continued to have diarreha but the doctor thought it could be from the meds. 4 days after being off the augmentin she started running a fever again and still had diarreha. The doctor prescribed Alinia for the diarehha which was to be taken for 3 days 2 x's daily. on the third day she developed a rash so the dr said to discontinue the meds. Her fever started again and diarrhea was still there. They ran the wbc again and they were normal he sent us home and said lets check her agian in another week. Sorry she also had stool culture and urine culture while in the hospital that were normal and then another stool culuture after the hospital that was also normal. There have been so many appointments I may be getting them a little confused but at the last appointment on May 18th she had lost a pound and is still running a intermitent fever and having diarreha. The doctor was already concerned about her weight because she has not gained any since she was 8months old and she is 16 months but know she has lost a pound. At 8 months she weighed 20.8 and now she weighs 19.0. She is 30in tall. He also checked for strip and that was normal. He also did a CHem 14 and her plattlets were high and her lymphocytes were 65% and ESR 28. He has even told us that he did not know what could be wrong with her and was not sure what to do next. He said he was not sure what kind of specialist to send her to but picked a pediatric GI but it will be at least a month before they can get her in. Her doctor is a general practioner. Because of our insurance we are at the mercy of our dr and the specialist. The only way I could get something done faster is to take her to the emergency room but I am afraid they would not realize the importance of her condition since she is stable at this point. The doctor made the comment that she does not look bad and she will smile a little and I am like I do not want to wait until she looks like she is dying before something is done. I am a mother of 3 kids aged 10, 8, and 16 months. So this is not me being a nervous first time mother her behavior and health is not normal. Also I know why she is not gaining weight she will not eat. I am still breastfeeding her, I stopped nursing her during the day to try to wean her per the doctors idea that maybe that would make her better but since she lost weight I started nursing her whenever she wants. Sometimes she does not even want to nurse. I do not know what to think but I am very worried please let me know what you think. Thank You!!!\n\n",

You could also try making an appt to see your current physician.....both you and husband go in together......be very frank and honest that you are extremely concerned for your daughter..........and is there any way he could please get your daughter seen by the specialist on a more URGENT basis.  As a Mom with other children, you have to trust your gut - and be an advocate for your little one............(which I know you are doing).  With the elevated platelets  and ESR ,she's definitely got some kind of inflammatory process going on.  Is she continuing to have diarrhea?  Fever?  Keep a log of everything....a daily log of her diarrhea (how many times a day, what color), her temperature, how often she nurses, etc.  That way, it provides a better \"picture\" to your doctor and the specialist you'll be seeing.  Are YOU on any medications?  Seeing how you're breast feeding, I'm just wondering if there's anything that you're consuming that's passing its way into your breast milk?    Was your baby on an IV when in the hospital, for fluids - to combat all the fluid loss from the diarrhea?  If your baby's diarrhea recurs, or if you feel she's not nursing enough (poor appetite), be sure you're aware of the signs of Dehydration - for you'd surely need to return to your doctor:  http://pediatrics.about.com/od/symptoms ... ehydtn.htm  Have your other children been ill at all?  What about yourself?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi jason, People with diabetes are more prone to developing certain conditions, jock itch being one of them. Have you tried any treatments when these symptoms occur? Alkaline phosphatase is an enzyme produced in the liver but can also be produced in the bone. A test that confirms if an elevated alkaline phosphatase level is due to abnormalities associated with the liver is a GGTP (gamma glutamyl transpeptidase ) An elevated level would indicate a disorder related to the liver, normal results would indicate that it is related to the bone. Elevations in GGTP are seen in conditions such as gallbladder and bile duct problems, cirrhosis, pancreatitis, liver injury, infectious mononucleosis, diabetes etc. etc. I would suggest an evaluation that would include this lab test as well. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

They gives me no problem in breathing or eating and  have no pain too. The time when i realize about them  is only when i see them, As i saw in normal people,  my tonsills are like 10 times bigger than thiers.  For history, i have been told that in childhood i used to breath through mouth as my nose gland were  enlarged, also around 6 years back i got my nose  broken and the bone was fixed a bit deviated from  its origin and the right nostril had lower air passage, but i feel breathing fine.  \"\" I have heard that such prolonged infections can  be turned into very serious diseases, and can also  effect heart. \"\"  Please advice me.   Note: I Showed to an ENT Doc here in pakistan,  and he said that fibrosis occured in my tonsils  as per him the doctors 3 years back gave me medicince containing asteroids.  Thanks, Byezzz.\n\n",

Looking again for advices on this.  Thanks a lot, Arsalan  Note:  1> My Tonsills size: right one is around 10 times bigger       than normail, left is 3 times. 2> No bad breaths and no bad throat feeling. 3> White spots and some (10% of the size) seenable       WHITE material on them. 4> No Pain and No Fever. 5> Duration: from around 3 years, since a major       inflamation that time.   ENT 1 advice: Tonsills fibrosed bcuz of steroids in medicine  3 years back, PUS seen and removal recommended.  ENT 2 advice: PUS is not seen, white material can be food or  some thing, but not infection, disease is not present, size is larger but don't means that its tonsillitus, removal or  treatment is not recommended.\n\n",

I say \"dust\" because i can seemingly rub particles off of the hair if i grab the hair strand and clinch it with my finger nails and run the hair through it. But the partciles either are growing bag or multiplying or something, however they don't seem to be spreading elsewhere on my body, and just to be clear by \"scrotum\" i'm referring in vulgar terms to \"the testicle sac\" I'm not sure if that is the correct terminology or not.

It is extremely painful and being someone who enjoys food it is torturous to not even be able to swallow my own spit.    It started about two days ago and is showing no signs of letting up. My tonsils keep getting bigger with more white and yellowish splotches. I had fevers up to 102.6 and I sweat in my sleep. The only other thing that bothers me besides my throat is my head when I get up too fast.  Actually my ears feel like like they are infected but I think that is only because my throat is and they are connected.  My mother thinks I have mono but I don't think so because everything I have read about mono says that you get very sluggish and tired. And the worst part about this illness is that I feel perfectly fine from the chest down. It is only my tonsils. They did a strep culture and it came out negative. They are telling me to just \"ride it out\". Easy for them to say. I am not coughing. No boogers or runny nose. No sneezing. My body was a little bit achy on the first day but not after that.

I am the only person she (girl-2) has been with sexually since previously being tested negative for std's.  Her doctor gave her a swab and we are still waiting on the results.  However, I'm not sure how she could have herpes as girl-1 has is recieving a birth control \"shot\" and is tested regularly by her doctor before the shot is administered, and we would know if she has anything.  However I am only assuming that std's are tested as a part of this procedure.  I have no symptoms of herpes, and neither does girl-1, however once I did get a single pimple on the base of my penis several months ago that eventually went away after being popped, as zits do.  I plan to be tested for std's asap, but I would like to know if I should be worried, or if it is likey that girl-2's doctor is wrong?  Oh yes, and girl-2 has previous surgery to remove traces of cancer in the reproductive system, although I'm not sure whether it is cervical, or ovarian.  Could herpes-like symptoms be occuring somehow as a result of this as well?  I'm incredibly worried and stressed out over this as you can imagine.  Thank you.\n\n",

    "title": "GENITAL HERPES",
    "content": "Most persons infected with genital herpes have not received a diagnosis of the disease. Such persons have mild or unrecognized infections that shed the virus intermittently in the genital tract. Some cases of first-episode genital herpes are manifested by severe disease, but many cases of the disease are transmitted by persons who are unaware that they have the infection, or are without symptoms when transmission occurs.  Unless your GIRL 1 was experiencing symptoms or requested a screening, I am doubtful if she would have been examined for STDs when she went for her contraceptive shots. In this sexual scenario, any one of the three parties could be the culprit.  The presence of one sexually transmitted disease raises  the possibility of another, so all parties in this scenario should first undergo a full STD screen, then be treated or counselled (as applicable) to halt the spread of any STD in the community. Genital herpes, however, is a recurrent, incurable viral disease.  Dr Anthony Solomon MB BS DTM&H DIP.VEN FRSM Tropical & Genitourinary Medicine\n\n",

I assumed all was well I healed and went on with my daily life. 6 weeks later 3 so called Spider bites (biols appeared on stomach and buttocks after I shaved. I was very sick and very very tired, headaches ect...and these areas seemed very infected, draining ect... I called the ER wic where I was seen prev.... explained I needed a nurse due to a re-occurance and that I was never called with my lab results previously.  The woman who answered the phone stated she had my lab results in fron of her but was unable to interpret them. She would have a nurse call me (this was Saturday, I explained my urgency and concern. I left another message that day! No call. I cleaned and drained these areas my self and covered them, concerned for my nine year old daughter and all others. Monday I call this facility and was told they did not have my lab results I would have to call the hospital medical records dept to obtain them..... Called there and of course was sent back to the WIC. Spoke to a nurse finally who informed me I had  Community acquired MRSA and needed to come in and see them or see my GP well of coarse I would not go back to them....they never called me to tell me how serious this was...contageous or anything for that matter......shouldnt they have called? Well my GP saw me and immediately did lab work and set me to Infectious Disease. I am now on Zyvox and other meds to control this although I am very scared...I am very tired have a cough and headaches......My fiance who lives elsewhere is very angry at me since I wont let him see me and I am scared for my daughter..... My main concern was going 2 months with no proper treatment.  Is it common for a Dr. not to call you and tell you something is wrong and proper treatment and follow up is necessary???? People have died from this..... Can I see my Fiance? My daughter lives with me but I just take precautions the best I can..... Scared and confused     Marie\n\n",

I can't give you any explaination except that whomever was responsible for reviewing the lab tests didn't alert the physician to the results. You can certainly see your fiancee (please don't isolate yourself from family, friends and loved ones). Some precautions that you should take are practicing good hygiene, handwashing etc. Keep draining or open areas covered until healed. Don't share personal items, towels, wash cloths, razors, etc.etc. Here is a web link that has some information regarding community aquired MRSA (If you have had no hospitalizations recently and it's not hospital aquired. http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/HIP/aresist/ca_mrsa.htm I hope you find this information somewhat helpful.

    "content": "Hello,  I have experienced itching skin, which later became red bumps for at least the past 2 months.  I was initially treated for scabies by my primary care doctor about 6 wks ago.  When the itch didn't go away for about 7 days, and the itching increased, I was sent to see a dermatologist as there were some itching on my face.  My dermatologist thought it was also scabies but did a biopsy.  The result came back with folliculities.  I'm currently under treatment for about 2 days not and the itching hasn't gone away yet.   When I was initially diagosed with scabies, I stayed away from my family and b/f.  To date, no one else has experienced an itch.  My nurse told me that folliculities was not contagious so I had oral sex with my b/f last night and began to resume my activities with my family.  Was this a mistake?  Pls. advise.  Also, I'm not convinced that I have folliculitis as my bumps don't have pus and not in zig-zag line.  Instead, they either appear as 2-3 bumps with spaces in between in a straight line or just all scattered as dots.  I'm clear between the fingers, and the \"dried up\" red spots are not brown spots.  Could I  have both folliculitis and scabies or do I really just have folliculitis?  Is the biopsy result really accurate?  Pls. advise.    Your professional expertise in this matter would be greatly appreciated!!!\n\n",

I also have small red dots on my skin on various parts of my body, chest and buttocks, legs, arms that are spaced apart at varying distances.  My face itches and tingles mostly near my ears but has also bothered me around my mouth and my nose bridge at the top of my forehead as well as other parts of my body. Under my left arm pit i have bumps that are like moles but not the color of moles that were not present in the past and have been there for about a month or more. have also had moderate to severe acne popping up in odd places that I havent had it at before. I also have sharp needle like pains mostly in my feet and toes like something is biting me from time to time.    I have been diagnosed and treated for scabies twice with nothing resolving it. The first time I was diagnosed I was put under a UV lamp in the dark and the doctor said I had scabies. the 2nd time no tests were done. The 3rd time I went to see the doctor about this problem  no tests were done to conclusively prove i did or did not have scabies. I was told I had a fungal infection and to treat with antifungal athelete foot treatments. did that for a few weeks and then finally went to see a dermatologist on recommendation of ER doctor that again diagnosed me with scabies.   I have seen a dermatologist who says its not scabies and prescribed prednisone pills for 10 days and then prescribed pramasone cream for the itching the 2nd visit. all this has not cured whatever i have and am using benadryl pills and cream to treat the itching.  I really am at my wits end with this and do not think the dermatologist realizes it really is scabies and is just trying different things until he realizes it is scabies but nothing like what normal scabies looks like. I have looked on other message boards about similar conditions and nothing I have found seems to provide any more definitive proof of what my condition/problem is.  Please HELP! Thanks WJK3\n\n",

Scabies are treated with a scabicide applied from the chin to toes and you shower about 12 hours later and repeat this in 1 week. Clothing items and other personal contacts should also be treated. If you have any lesions on your head or face these are not likely to be a result of scabies. The appearance of scabies:    It is very unlikely that treatment fails, the appearance of scabies again is by reinfestation. If you have had appropriate treatment and are still having the problem it is unlikely that it is scabies (providing you have not been reinfested) I would suggest that you ask your dermatologist to do a scraping because scabies, fungal infections etc. can be indentified under a microscope. Prednisone and benadryl are used to treat inflammation and itching but the problem certainly needs identified for the apropriate form of treatment. Has there been any lab work, biopsies etc. done? You may also want to inquire about these things as since it is a long standing problem. I hope this is somewhat helpful. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "content": "I was told to get a biopsy done at the dermatologist the last time I went to the hospital for this rash I have.  The dermatologist did not do it and I did not insist on it until after the 2nd time I came back from the dermatologist and was still having itching after using the pramasone cream for about a week. I called them and they said to use the pramasone for a month, but I have since run out of pramasone and out of money and do not have a job to get any income so I am pretty much stuck like Chuck with no truck. I have a follow up appointment in early January and I am going to insist a biopsy or scraping be done as I can hardly tollerate this anymore.  I am very hairy all over my body especially my forearms my chest, stomach, all over my legs and do not know if this matters or not as to how my condition looks different from real scabies.   here are some photos i just took showing the red spots on various areas of my body  chest   chest #2   left buttock   left foot on right side   I was treated the first time with Lindane lotion and then 3 days later I went back to the hospital cause I hadnt improved and they prescribed elimamite cream (premetherin) and used that also with no sucess.  Each time after treatment I don't know if all clothing got washed in hot water so I could of reinfested myself after each treatment. Went back for follow up a week later then they said I had fungal, treated with tinactin for that for a few weeks then went to hospital a 4th time diagnosed with scabies, prescribed kwell shampoo but did not treat for scabies since follow up with dermatologist was following monday after going to ER on thursday.  Dermatologist examined me said that he didnt think it was scabies, prescribed step down treatment of pregnisone tablets for 10-14 days, then wet back 2 weeks later and prescribed pramasone cream have used it all with no sucess.  It has been approximately 2 months since the last time I treated for scabies and have had continual symptoms of scabies in my opinion the whole time.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi wjk3, To me, this looks different than the cases of scabies I have seen, however, I will bring this to the attention of one of the fine doctors of the forum for their opinion. In my opinion you do need a scraping at the very least and if it is not definative then also a biopsy. You have to remember to insist, it is your body after all. Now as for the medication, call the dermatology office, talk to the doctor, explain to him/her that you are out of your prescription medication and can't afford to have it re-filled. They usually carry sufficient samples and provide them to patients as trials prior to getting the prescriptions filled or when they can't afford the particular drug.  Call the office.   Also there are free clinics to assist people whom are uninsured etc. that provide health care if you have a chance to check them out. Here is a link for the NC area. http://www.ncfreeclinics.org/  I hope this helps. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "content": "Dear wjk3, I agree with Rntdj. Without a biopsy we would just be guessing. The lesions look highly atypical. Do you have a pet such as a cat / dog in the house? If you do then bring this up to your dermatologist. Sometimes they can lead to allergies that are resistant to treatment. Again a skin biopsy could easily determine whether it is scabies, fungal or allergic in origin.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  All of this started within a week after I moved into an apartment with a person who was  less than cleanly around his apartment and he has two cats.  Also, the apartment was infested wtih fleas severly, but this seemed to have started within a few days of having slept on a mattress that I took from a dumpster area. It started on my scalp at the time I had shaved the majority of my hair off of my head. I have since left that apartment back on October 15th, and we bombed the apartment more than once for fleas while I was there, but don't believe it is related to pets.  I have four dogs living where I am at now and never had any problems being allergic to them while I lived here previously.  Thanks, WJK3\n\n",

    "content": "Just got my 4th sore throat in the past 2 months and I really am confused.  These sore throats don't feel like any I've had before and keep coming back.  The irritation is high up in the back of my throat and is usually on one side or the other (this time it happens to be both sides however).  Swallowing is difficult  and I've had no fever or cold symptoms.  The first time I also was vomiting on and off for a couple hours, which never happens to me.  I was put on a \"Z pack\" of antibiotics and it went away after about 3 days.  The second time I was put on Amoxicillan for 10 days.  The third time (less than  a week later) I went to the doctor, he drew some blood for tests and put me on Omnicef.  Five days later he called and told me to stop taking the Omnicef and pick up a \"PrevPac\" for h-pylori (I've never had acid reflux though).  Two days before my PrevPac was done I got a sore throat again.  Now it's day three of this sore throat and it's getting a little worse each day.  I also have had other symptoms in the past couple months which I can't find a reason for.   My right shoulder and jaw started bothering before the sore throats started.  The jaw pain went away after a couple weeks but the shoulder pain spread to the left shoulder and occasionally is in the elbow joints and arm muscles.  I say occasionally because it's different almost every day.  The doctor did a lymes and a mono test and said it was negative.  My 5 yr od son had strep about a month ago so  I was tested when I had the 3rd sore throat and it was negative.  The past few days my lower back has been bothering me also.  I don't know whats happening because all my life I've been in great shape and rarely get sick.  I've never been overweight and eat extremely healthy foods.  Any suggestions?  I still have about 4 days of the Omnicef left - should I take it?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi flynndt, Let me start by answering your last question first. If you were directed by your doctor to discontinue using the Omnicef, discontinue it and dispose of the remaining amount. It sound as though since your sore throat began after vomiting (if I understand correctly) and you may have some esophageal irritation. Can you describe for me the appearance of your throat? Red may indicate irritation, white patches may indicate numerous problems for example, bacteria, fungal etc.  If your doctor is treating you for  h-pylori, was testing done for this? If not I would suggest inquiring why. Here is a website for this particular ailment. http://www.cdc.gov/ulcer/md.htm My apologies for so many questions but it would give enough additional information to attempt to suggest something further.

I would suggest that to start with you have an evaluation done by an opthamologist to rule out any eye disorders. In my opinion dependency upon eye drops is highly unlikely. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "content": "I have battled a sinus infection for about two months now.  Most of the symptoms seem improved w/the exception of almost constant headaches, especially in the last several days.  Also in the last several days I have experienced a \"heaviness\" in my chest.  When I breathe in deeply I feel a tightening.  It isn't painful but it's uncomfortable and not normal.  I have also noticed upper back pain.  This seems crazy but it seem to me that I feel a single crack or pop when I exhale and that seems to be on the right side.  I can't find anything online to figure out what this is.  Is this the sinus infection affecting other parts of my body?  Does that happen?  I am very medically inept and have always been very healthy, other than the occassional sinus infection which typically has cleared up.  I feel strange sort of tingly sensations in the back of my head, too.  Am I nuts?    Thank you so much!  Gigi\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Gigi!  I have suffered from sinus infections for several years.  It is not uncommon to start to wheeze with a sinus infection because, when you are reclining or sleeping, sometimes the post nasal drip will drip into your trachea instead of down your esophagus.  There is also a well known triad that consists of nasal polyps, aspirin sensitivity and asthma.  Sometimes the aspirin sensitivity can also include the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications like ibuprofen, naproxen, etc.  So, you may want to take note if you get that feeling after you have taken such a medication even if you never had a problem with them before or have never had asthma.  I hope this information helps!\n\n",

I have been trying to research this infection and am having a lot of trouble understanding this infection.  Everything seems spoken in such a technical language that I am not understand what I need to do for my son at this point or what troubles he is going to have from this.  I am becoming more scared about MRSA the more I read about it and would just like to have some idea about what this is and what this is going to cause in my son.  I wasn't told much from the hospital when his results came back with this.  My husband and I had taken him in because he had a boil on his rear that became quite large within a short amount of time.  They drained it and then tested the infection.  His medications were then switched to Bactrim and he recieved ointment for his nose and we were told he has MRSA and would have it for the rest of his life.  What does this mean??  I am hearing some very disheartening things about MSRA and just want to know what i need to look for, and what it causes exactly and what kind of problems this will cause for my family.  Can somebody assist me in some answers.  I do understand what it is, I just don't understand how severe this can get, if he can die from it, what it will cause over his lifetime and if he is contagious all the time??  Write me back if you can help me.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Tracy, First of all, you honestly need'nt worry so much! I'll try here to explain things for you, and if you still have questions, please don't hesitate to ask. Staphylococcus Aureus (SA) are a group of bacteria which are very commonly found on the skin and cause infections. But there are many different types and the particular type known as MRSA (methicillin resistant Staph aureus) is causing increasing problems because, as the name suggests, it is very resistant to treatment with antibiotics. Even some of our most powerful antibiotics, such as methicillin, can't stop it in its tracks. Around 30% of people carry the germ SA in their nose or on their skin (this is often referred to as being 'colonised' with the germ). SA and MRSA are not normally a risk to healthy people and the majority of people 'colonised' with SA do not have any symptoms and aren\u2019t aware they are carrying the germ. If colonised, one becomes 'infected' with SA if the bacteria get into the body through a break in the skin. In case of 'colonisation', a special antibiotic called mupirocin is usually applied to the skin or the inside of the nose to remove the bacteria. Skin and hair may be washed with special disinfectants. As for specific treatment of 'infection', antibiotics aren\u2019t completely powerless against MRSA. The 'infection' may simply require a much higher dose over a much longer period, or the use of an alternative antibiotic to which the germ has less resistance. The long-term risk of SA is the chance that it may become resistant to all antibiotic drugs. For this reason it is important that antibiotics are only used when necessary and the full course of a drug is taken when it has been prescribed. It is also very important to take basic hygiene precautions. This includes covering cuts and broken skin with waterproof plasters and washing hands frequently and thoroughly.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Hepatitis C is a bloodborne virus that attacks the liver causing acute hepatitis and chronic liver disease and can include cirrhosis and liver cancer. It is spread through direct exposure to blood or body fluids that contain the HCV. Exposure can be via illegal drug injections, unscreened blood or blood product transfusions, organ or tissue transfusion (prior to 1992), clotting factor concentrates (prior to 1987),  multiple sexual partners, exposure through work such as health care provider, public safety worker, doctor, nurse to HCV positive blood (accidental needle pokes, blood incidents, etc), and children born to HCV positive women.  OSHA \u2013 Occupational Safety & Health Administration (USA) have requirement standards for Enforcement Procedures for the Occupational Exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens in the work place. Perhaps your husband\u2019s work place has this policy or the local Health Departments can give you more information on bloodborne pathogens and testing locations in your area.\n\n",

    "title": "Unknown infection on foreskin and anus",
    "content": "I'm 27 years old and been in a long term relationship for the past 6 years. I've had one other sex partner in March 2003 which was just a one nighter and it was unprotected. Since August 2004 I had notice a lesion developing on my foreskin of my penis. I didn;t think much of it at this point because I wasn't having any type of symptoms related to STDs. From the lesion on the foreskin, it first started out looking like one patch the size of a vegetable pea. Within this patch, small tiny pencil lead tip size bumps are forming with no discoloration, no bleeding or pus discharge at all. The only symptom I was experiencing is slight itching on or around the lesion. I didn't experience painful urination. So, with this in mind I thought that my lesion was just an abrasion on the foreskin and decided to let it heal over time.   Three months past and the lesion on my foreskin started to have differnt looks now. It grew from a pea size to the size of a quarter. There is discoloration now. The color of the lesion went from normal foreskin color to a white color and very often small dark red patches inside this quarter size lesion. Sometimes there was a pimple like dot in the middle or center which look like a pus or fluid of some kind. This pimple never bleed or pus never drain. Again it just itch and wasn't painful. When I urinate, no pain or discomfort was experience. So this is what made me see a doctor.   The Doctor examine the lesion and wasn't sure what it was. Doctor said it might be syphilis but again wasn't sure. So she said I will be tested for all STDs. A blood culture and slide impression of the lesion was taken. Doctor tolded me to check back by the end of the week. The end of week came and I went back to see my test results. Doctor stated that all my results are negative. Nothing came back postive. So, the doctor just referred me to the deparment of health where another doctor who was a STD specialist seen me.  The STD specialist said it could be syphilis but again it could be something else. This doctor who has been practicing this for years had no clue. In the end, he decided to also do another blood culture and slide impression of my foreskin lesion. He informed me to check later by the end of the week for results. I went back and again my results were all negative. STD specialist conducted this second STD test because he said that the first one could have been a false test. STD specialist just recommended that I should thoroughly clean under the foreskin of my penis since I was not circumsized. He said give it about a month and if nothing happens check back.   I took his advice and clean my penis foreskin thoroughly for two months. After these months the lesion is still there and remains the size of a quarter. I went back to the first doctor that seen me and he referred me to another doctor at the same hospital. This third doctor conducted another blood culture just for the record or to close the book on STD he said. Results came back negative again. So he said it might be chancroid so he had me take dose of Azithromycin. he said lets see how this medications does for a month and check back. Its almost been a month now and its seem to be growing. I now have a hemorrhoid like bump near my anus. So what do you think? I really worried about this. I wonder if it is something relating to cancer or possibly a STD that is durment. Help.\n\n",

    "content": "Early in December I saw a doctor about a problem with dizziness that had been getting worse for more than a week. He said I probably had a viral ear infection and it would go away on its own in two to three weeks. Over the course of the month I got sicker and sicker - fever, chills, feeling faint, fatigue, loss of appetite, terrible sick feeling all over, swollen glands, pain behind the ear / jaw, sharp pain in the ear itself, ringing in both ears, hearing tones in my left ear, tingling / twitching on the sides of the face, stiff / painful neck accompanied by twitching on the forehead and headaches and inability to think strait and eye socket pain, difficulty concentrating, and sometimes a strange altered feeling in consciousness, like I\u2019m underwater \u2013 especially when the back of my head and neck hurt.  I was only getting worse, but thought to take large doses of vitamin C to help my immune system fight what appeared to be a losing battle. Coincidence or no, I got a bit better though the symptoms have shifted somewhat. The upper back of my neck is always stiff and hurts. I feel pressure all over my head. Sometimes it\u2019s my face, sometimes the back of the head. I still feel dizzy and just plain *weird* (very difficult to describe). I still feel pain and pressure in my jaw and in and behind my ears. It\u2019s hard to swallow. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m having trouble breathing.  My throat hurts. I have persistent post-nasal drip. The sick all over feeling is still there but subdued somewhat.  Can someone please tell me what this is? Someone suggested to me that it\u2019s a vigorous Epstein-Barr infection. When I see my doctor again in a few days I\u2019m going to ask him to also test for Lyme disease, heavy metals, and maybe have my dentist check for a molar infection. These are just guesses on my part. I would appreciate more. I don\u2019t care how many tests I need, or what they cost. I want to at least know the name of the thing that completely trashed my December, and hopefully what I can do to get rid of it completely.\n\n",

    "content": "For quite a long time I had a few small, fleshy, skin colored bumps, on the lower part of the shaft of my penis.  I basically thought nothing of it, since there were just a few of them.   In the last 6 months or so, the number has greatly increased, but they remain small and painless.  They now occur in a ring about half an inch thick around the base and a few scattered ones on the rest of the shaft.  I have only been sexually active with one girl and she's only been sexually active with me.  Neither of us has any reason to believe we'd have an STD because our sexual history is limited to each other.  The only thing that I can think of that I've done differently is that I started to shave that area and it was around that time that they increased in number.  I've read just about every post on here about HPV.  I really don't think I could have contracted it, so what else could it be?    I read on familydoctor.org that you can put a few drops of vinegar on the bumps to do a simple test for HPV.  If the bumps turn white then you've got it.  Mine didn't.  Also, I am prone to ingrown hairs in other places, could this be something related?  One last thing, I can provide a close-up picture of these bumps if that would help you provide me with the best advice.  Thank you in advance for your time!\n\n",

    "content": "I have a friend whose husband went into the hospital (one that specializes in curing cancer) March 1st to have surgery done for anal cancer.  They were told that he would be out of the hospital and home within 14 days, but he is still in. A little over a week ago they put a bag on his stomach to catch his urine and stuff, but took it off because they said he was having complications with it. They put a catheter back in. The other day, she was in the hospital visiting him, and one of the nurses slipped and let out that they've known for about a week that he has MRSA. Apparently they didn't want them to know, and they are not giving them any information on it. She knows it is an infection, but that is all she could find out from them. Now, my friend would like to know any information that anyone could possibly supply. She especially wants to know if animals can get it. She has a dog, a turtle, and four cats in the house and is worried that if he eventually comes home with it, will they get it if she doesn't find them temporary homes? Also, is this something that happens often in hospitals? Is there some sort of research that has been done on the probability of this happening when you go into a hospital? Thanks very much for taking the time to read this and any information is welcome.\n\n",

It is a type of bacterium commonly found on the skin and/or in the noses of healthy people. Although it is usually harmless at these sites, it may occasionally get into the body (eg through breaks in the skin such as abrasions, cuts, wounds, surgical incisions or indwelling catheters) and cause infections. These infections may be mild (eg pimples or boils) or serious (eg infection of the bloodstream, bones or joints).  In order to sue for negligence or damages you must first prove they were negligent and because of their negligence, damages or harm have been done that are permanent and/or irreversable and it is directly caused from the negligence. If you feel you can do that, than you should try. It's a very expensive process and hard to win.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I'm looking for some insight and am glad I found this site.  I've been sick since about October, on and off with the \"colds\".  Back in December, I had Bronchitis and was given an antibiotic that was strong. I was unaware of the fact that I was pregnant and unfortunately had a miscarriage on January 20th.  The bronchitis did not clear up totally and I was put on another antibiotic.  I was also given a blood test.  My results indicated that I had a bad viral infection and bacterial infection and that my iron was very low.  I was also told that my white blood cell count was very high (14 I believe).  I began taking palifer for the iron and an antibiotic for the infection.  I went back recently for another blood test, again another antibiotic (Suprax) which I am now taking.  My WCB went down to  11 (which is still high I'm told). I'm still stuffed up although the Strep seems to have cleared up fairly well.  My concern now is that I have 4 days left on the suprax and now I am having underarm and arm pain.  Also throuought this time, I have had pain under my left shoulderblade.  I should mention that I am a smoker.  Could this be cancer of the lungs?  Thanks in advance for your help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Pennylane, I am sorry to hear about your miscarriage. I know that it is a hard thing to deal with. I would definitly tell your physician about your underarm pain and other complaints. It may have nothing at all to do with what you are dealing with but sometimes you can get swollen lymph nodes in your arm pit area from infections.  You mentioned you had a viral infection and now since you are on a antibiotic I am assuming it is bacterial. Bacterial infections may develop after a viral illness, such as a cold or influenza, and are less common than viral illnesses. Bacterial infections may affect the upper or lower respiratory system. Symptoms tend to localize to one area. In the upper respiratory system, the most common sites of bacterial infections are the ears, sinuses, and throat. In the lower respiratory system, the most common sites are the bronchial tubes (bronchitis) and the lungs (pneumonia).  Bacterial infections are more common in smokers, people exposed to secondhand smoke, and people with chronic lung disease (such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other chronic medical problems. Antibiotics can effectively treat most bacterial infections.  There are a few steps you can take to reduce your risk of catching a cold or influenza. They include the following:   Wash Your Hands Often   Hand washing is the most neglected, yet most effective, method of disease containment. The primary means of spreading both colds and influenza is person-to-person contact. Effective ways to prevent respiratory infections include: 1) washing your hands thoroughly and often, and 2) avoiding hand-to-hand passage of germs and droplet sprays from sneezing and coughing.   Avoid Crowds During Influenza Season   This may not be a very practical suggestion for everyone. However, if you are at high risk of catching a cold or influenza, or at risk for developing complications from these infections, try to avoid crowded areas or people who are obviously sick during the winter influenza season.   Get a \"Flu Shot\"   Each year, the World Health Organization tries to determine which strains of the influenza virus will be most dangerous in the upcoming influenza season. Vaccines are developed for these strains.   Anyone may benefit from a flu shot, but vaccination is strongly recommended every fall for several groups of people people who are at the highest risk for complications. These include:   People over age 50 Infants aged 6-23 months Residents of chronic care facilities and nursing homes  Those with chronic illnesses, especially of the heart, lungs, blood, and kidneys  People with a weakened immune system Women more than three months pregnant during flu season Health care workers who come in contact with sick patients  Caregivers or household members of persons in high risk groups  Flu shots are available at doctors' offices, hospitals, local public health offices, and at some workplaces, stores or shopping malls. A possible side effect is a mild \"flu-like\" reaction including fever, aching, and fatigue. Up to 5% of people experience these symptoms after having the influenza vaccine.   Please strongly consider stoping smoking which can exacerbate any respiratory problem. Take care of yourself, vitamins espically zinc and vit c are important. Follow up with your physician about your other complaints. I hope this helps you and I wish you well.\n\n",

As for the HIV, it is spread by unprotected sexual intercourse by an infected person, a partner, (not the sexual activity-masterbation, even if you use saliva as a lubricant) sharing needles as in drug use, etc. etc. So unless you have been involved in those activities (IV drug use, unprotected sexual intercourse, etc.) I would not be concerned.

I believe he has herpes simplex I on his mouth, but at the time of the incident he was not having any outbreaks and hasn't had on in a while.  As i understand it, viral shedding can make it possible for the infection to be spread.

I know you can't tell me for sure that I am okay or that Probably I am okay, but I am wondering precisely how risky is what i have done?

By the time they are over age 50, some 80-90% of Americans have HSV-1 antibodies.  A prior infection with oral HSV-1 lowers the risk of acquiring genital HSV-1 even further. Studies show that genital HSV-1 infections almost always occur in people who have no prior infection with HSV of either type (Corey, Annals of Internal Medicine, 1983).  In the absence of prior oral infection, however, HSV-1 spreads easily to the genital area, usually through oral sex. In some countries, such as Japan and parts of Great Britain, genital HSV-1 is as common as genital HSV- 2, or more common.\n\n",

It's mobile and soft I guess you could say, and it's completely painless. As if that wasn't bad enough, last night I found another lump,  but this time it's behind my right ear. This one seems significantly larger, and it's pretty hard, which scares me, because I've heard that firm, immobile lumps are signs of cancer. This one is relatively painless as well. It might be a bit sensitive, or it could just be from me touching it and pushing on it all the time...Anyway, I'm obviously freaking out, and I just kinda wanna know what's going on. I have blood tests scheduled for next week, but I'd just kinda like to know what could be going on and how serious it could possibly be. I'm really hoping it's mono, but I'm just worried considering the length of time the first lump has been there, and the size and firmness of the other. If anyone that knows what they're talking about could help me out, I'd so greatly appreciate it\n\n",

The Doctor let me know I had done such a great job at my breast exam that I had found a lymph node. Look at this site, is shows where they are located.  http://training.seer.cancer.gov/ss_modu ... hains.html  All of us have hundreds of lymph nodes scattered throughout our bodies as a critical part of our immune systems. This network of nodes functions as a powerful, intelligent filtration system to keep the insides of our bodies clean and healthy.  Tiny vessels called lymph vessels carry germs, foreign particles, and unhealthy or malignant cells to the lymph nodes, where they are trapped. Active lymph nodes enlarge as they attempt to destroy the unwelcome material.  The lymph nodes also function as schools. Lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, study the foreign material so that they can produce antibodies, killer cells, and other substances to protect the body from the threat.  Sometimes the lymph nodes are overwhelmed in the process. Our defenders can be taken over by a infection. These enlarged nodes can become a refuge where the invaders can hide and proliferate.  Please take care and follow up with your physician.\n\n",

I keep putting off going to the doctor because I hate to waste the time & money.    We leave for vacation in 9 days.  Should I just continue the Mucinex, Sudafed, Tylenol Cold, Zicam & Airborne stuff or get some antibiotics to get rid of this?      Thanks so much for the help!\n\n",

Since then I've had strange feelings around the top of my head (sometimes it feels as if my head has received a knock, sometimes it feels as if something is swimming around between my brain and skull) and I've also often felt dizzy.  Reading about the symptoms of meningitis it seemed quite similar but it doesn't feel at all as bad as what I imagine meningitis to feel like. The pains in my neck have now gone but I've still got the strange feelings in my head and I still feel dizzy.  Is it worth going to see a doctor?  Thank you for any help\n\n",

    "content": "I was diagnosed with bronchitis 3 1/2 weeks ago and give Ceftin to take for 10 days.  After 6 days, I developed colitis and was advised to stop the antibiotics.  I stopped and the colitis resolved itself within a week.  I developed sinus pressure and went back to the doctor on Friday.  He could still hear some gurgling in my lungs and said I had a sinus infection.  He gave me 7 - 500mg samples of Levaquin.  Took everyday with lots of water.  Had mild side effects:  nausea, bad taste in mouth, dizziness, increased eye pressure.  All of these were at their worst 1-2 hours after taking pill.  On day 3, 1 hour after taking pill, I had vision problems (seeing spots) sensitivity to light, and got a migraine (had 1 migraine in my life 15 years ago)  It was frightening.  Called doctor and he said this was not related to the drug.  He told me to take again and I did with the same side effect--migraine.  I stopped taking it.  I am willing to accept side effects, but this was frightening.  I have taken amox. eryth in the past with no problems  I know it is not good to stop taking antibiotics.  Do I have to be concerned about getting really sick.  My symptoms have improved greatly.  Although my cough is loose, I still feel a little rumble in my back, at the bottom of my left lung. Should I call my doctor again--he was a bit dismissive last time--but I don't want to get really sick.  Thanks Jenny\n\n",

    "content": "My 13 year old daughter has not been feeling well since last Saturday, 3/5/05 ~ sore throat, fever (low 99-100) that is on and off, extreme fatigue, headache, upset stomach, and constantly complaining of feeling dizzy.  She stayed home from school on Monday the 7th, went to school on the 8th but had to come home early.  I took her to the dr. that day and they thought she had mono.  They did labs and sent us home with Zithromax.  She did not go to school the rest of the week and continued to be ill over the weekend with the same complaints as above with the exception of the fever seemed to be more \u201con\u201d than \u201coff\u201d.  I took her back to the doctor on Monday the 14th and was told that her labs were positive for a past mono infection within the last 2-3 months but nothing current.  They indicated her labs were also positive for allergies.  They said that she should be fine and with the exception of her allergies \u201cacting up\u201d i.e. ears looked fine, throat looked ok, etc..  They gave her Singular, Rhinocort, another round of Zithromax and gave her a shot of something.  I\u2019m guessing a steroid but they didn\u2019t say.  I should have asked.    I guess my question is\u2026\u2026could she have the mono now even though the labs reported a past positive?  She has been feeling great up until last week\u2026..hasn\u2019t been sick at all!  Which is uncommon for her because she, historically, seems to have a weakened system (pneumonia x2, scarlet fever x2, numerous ear infections, etc).  Now she can hardly get off the couch, is still running a fever and is constantly crying about not feeling good.    Pleas help!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear amyswag1, Infectious mononucleosis (often called \"mono\") is a common viral infection that causes fever, sore throat, and enlarged lymph nodes. Mono is commonly caused by the Epstein-Barr virus, in more than 90% of cases, but other viruses, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), can also cause mono. Once infected with one virus, a person develops lifelong immunity to future infections by the same virus, but not to other types of viruses causing mono. Mono can also be mixed up with other serious conditions, but that can usually be excluded by simple lab tests as a blood count and an ESR. If you haven't had them done, please discuss this with your doctor. If the condition proves to be mono, I'd like to assure you that it generally goes away without medical help. However, it may last from weeks to months. Treatment is mainly to ease symptoms, usually at home, with plenty of rest and fluids, acetaminophen or ibuprofen for fever and pain control. Schedule routine visits with your doctor, so he/she can monitor the course of the illness and detect possible complications. If her condition worsens at any time, do not hesitate to take her immediately to the hospital. Please keep us informed with what's going on.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear amyswag1, I apologise for not making myself clear.  A previous infection with mono may sometimes pass unnoticed clinically, and would only appear a few months later in lab results. Since the Epstein-Barr virus is the common cause for mono, it is the virus usually tested for, while other viruses are not, and the test is usually referred to as the test for mono, which is of course a misnomer! It could be misleading, as in your daughter's case, where she has a picture of mono now, but negative labs for a current infection. However, I need to know if also a blood picture and ESR were done or not? The picture of mono could sometimes be mistaken with other serious problems and we need to rule them out!\n\n",

    "title": "question on a thrombosis probably caused by a mastoiditis",
    "content": "Hi,  In february this year (2005) my 5 years old son had the following: otitis, mastoiditis, meningitis and a thrombosis of the sinus sigmoideus (up to the jugular vein) It is highly probable that the menigitis was caused by the mastoiditis which in turn was caused by the otitis, this seems to be a typical causal chain. The thrombosis was also probably caused by the \"infection\", although it is  unclear to me if the main reason was the mastoiditis or the meningitis (I hope that this is irrelevant)   the mastoiditis was chirurgically treated, the meningitis was treated with antibiotics (and I guess the otitis disappeared alltogether, I never hearder about it again!!).  Now we are left with this annoying  thrombosis. The medical team was unsure on how to handle it, they first decided to do nothing and after a while decided to give him Heparin in injection (called fragmin in germany)  every day. The cause of a thrombosis is typically a blood problem, but for my son the reason was the infection. This single fact seems to be  embarrasing because there is apparently only little medical literature on \"children\"  thrombosis with this cause.   I do not expect you to \"magically\" solve that problem.  I would appreciate if you could tell me where I can learn more about all that, or where do I have a chance to find a \"similar\" case.\n\n",

However, generally speaking, this type of thrombis is usually resolved following rehydration and the administration of systemic antibiotics. Steroids and systemic anticoagulation may be beneficial. Probably the reason you never heard about the otitis again is the antibiotics took care of this problem. Your right about available literature since this is relatively an uncommon condition. Here is a link that has other references that might be of use to you.

    "title": "Sore throat for two months, tonsils huge... doctor shrugged.",
    "content": "Okay.  Let's go back two months.  My grandma was dying of cancer, and I was one of her main caregivers.  Stress? Yes, much.  So I got sick, about a week before she died I caught a cold, with a slight sore throat.  A week and a half later, sore throat got more severe, severe enough to send me in for a strep test the day of her funeral.  Went to Minute Clinic (that's a joke, took 4 hours). Both rapid and culture were negative.  Shrug.  Okay.  I can live with that.    Three weeks later, it's not any better, but I'd buried my grandma and started a full time job.  Had no time to be sick or to worry about it.  Finally, I woke up one morning with my uvula looking about twice the size of my thumb, and twice as long as normal... literally choking on it in the morning.  Went to call in to work, couldnt speak.  Laryngitis is not unusual for me.  Doctor says I have cellulitis in my throat, and to go home and rest.  Gave me prednisone (thank god... that stuff rocks), and keflex.  I take both as prescribed, the uvula swelling went down that night, but my sore throat never went away.  So.. a week of debating, and it's back to the doctor.  He claims that I caught another virus on top of the first, because the cellulitis is gone, but my tonsils are huge.  Mmmkay... so... we do nothing for this? sigh.  Figures.  He also decides at this point that I may have sleep apnea and I tell him I've known for years that I do.  I don't have insurance right now, and can definitely not afford a sleep study.  Woo. Nope.  Anyways.    So I go home and suck it up.  Already being out the full cost of two doctors visits and two prescriptions.  Now, I went out the other day.  Had a drink.  Literally, immediately afterwards, my tonsils swell up horribly, enough to make me panic that my throat is closing up.  I drank water for a bit, and thought maybe it was the type of alcohol... so I try another.  (heh, persistant, yes?) The swelling didnt go away, but it didnt get worse... I took two ibuprofen.  I know, bad idea with alcohol but was desperate.  Swelling goes away.  Yay.   Now, tonight.  I take one sip of one beer and automatically it swells up again.  'Grr.'    So, after ALL of that... my question I suppose is a chicken or egg sort.  Having never had a negative reaction to alcohol of any sort (well, obviously other than the blessed hangover...), am i having some sort of allergic reaction to the alcohol? Or is it this dang persistant virus that is the main culprit, and the alcohol just makes it worse?  And what the heck kind of virus lasts two months?  I disagree with my doctor in his theory that it was a new virus after the first, it never let up at all and I feel its the same one.  I did have 48 hours of over 103 degree fever and flu-ish symptoms last weekend... Other than that, I've been a pretty consistent 99.5 ish.    I am at a loss of what to do as far as home care... I also have a barking type cough.  Ooh, and some fun headaches and dizziness thrown in.  Lovin it.    Couldn't be mono, could it?    So, I'll be staying away from alcohol.  ( obviously... fool be once, shame on you... twice, shame on me. )   Tonsilitis?  Shrug.    Ayudame, por favor.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear blastoff,  I am going to be honest with you as best as I can. At age 13 you are taking big risks with your health and your life by having unprotected sex. Not only can you aquire sexually transmiited diseases some of which can kill you (AIDS) but you are also at risk of getting pregnant. I urge you to see your physician and get an exam. Please think about the rest of your life. You are worth saying NO and waiting to have SEX with anyone. You have the rest of your life ahead of you.   Your body is precious and you need to treat it with respect meaning that you wait to have relations with someone untill you are older and you can make better decisions. ONE form of birth control is condoms which give you a better chance of protection but still not 100%. Please speak to someone that you trust and let them know your concerns. I will give you some info on HERPES but as I said only your physician can give you a definitive diagnosis.    Genital herpes is an infection caused by the herpes simplex virus or HSV. There are two types of HSV, and both can cause genital herpes. HSV type 1 most commonly infects the lips, causing sores known as fever blisters or cold sores, but it also can infect the genital area and produce sores. HSV type 2 is the usual cause of genital herpes, but it also can infect the mouth. A person who has genital herpes infection can easily pass or transmit the virus to an uninfected person during sex.  Both HSV 1 and 2 can produce sores (also called lesions) in and around the vaginal area, on the penis, around the anal opening, and on the buttocks or thighs. Occasionally, sores also appear on other parts of the body where the virus has entered through broken skin.  What are the symptoms? Unfortunately, most people who have genital herpes don't know it because they never have any symptoms, or they do not recognize any symptoms they might have. When there are symptoms, they can be different in each person. Most often, when a person becomes infected with herpes for the first time, the symptoms will appear within 2 to 10 days. These first episodes of symptoms usually last 2 to 3 weeks.  Early symptoms of a genital herpes outbreak include  Itching or burning feeling in the genital or anal area  Pain in the legs, buttocks, or genital area  Discharge of fluid from the vagina  Feeling of pressure in the abdomen  Within a few days, sores appear near where the virus has entered the body, such as on the mouth, penis, or vagina. They also can occur inside the vagina and on the cervix in women, or in the urinary passage of women and men. Small red bumps appear first, develop into blisters, and then become painful open sores. Over several days, the sores become crusty and then heal without leaving a scar.  Other symptoms that may go with the first episode of genital herpes are fever, headache, muscle aches, painful or difficult urination, vaginal discharge, and swollen glands in the groin area.\n\n",

I recently had a needlestick injury while working in the ER (source patient tested negative).  I had baseline serologies drawn, which, much to my surprise showed a positive result for HCV antibodies via EIA and a negative HBsAb despite vaccination, a booster shot and documented seroconversion. I obtained my results from my last platelet donation from 1/27/05 and they are as follows: HCV Ab (anti-HCV, EIA)   neg HCV (RIBA)                      neg HCV (NAT)                       neg I had all of the serologies re-reun at a different location and the results so far show a positive HBsAb, but again show a positive for HCV Ab, negative HCV qualitative (RNA PCR) and am awaiting the RIBA results. My question is:  How likely is it that I could be negative via NAT testing (which shortens the window to 5-10 days) and 4 weeks later have been exposed and developed antibodies or is this more likely a false positive? I'd appreciate any input ASAP as I have been biting my nails for several days now!\n\n",

If your condition was related to tonsillitis that's why the antibiotic made you feel better. However, antibiotics have no affect on viral conditions and they just have to run their course. In my opinion, your physician provided appropriate treatment. If you are dissatisfied with your current provider and you feel the way that you do then I encourage you to find a provider in which you are more comfortable. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

The first and some subsequent attacks are accompanied by flu-like symptoms.  I have had it for 14 years and know it well.  I don't mean to doubt you, but are you sure about the sexual contact?  I got mine from a facial cold sore of my partner during oral sex, not regular sex.  Also Herpes is HIGHLY contagious and can survive outside the body for a looooong time, ie. if she was at someone's house and used their towel...  if she has a facial sore and has scratched that, and then somewhere else... even though they are different strains of the virus, it still happens.  Also HSV can be on other parts of the body other than face or genitals.  My mother has it on her thigh.  You never know.  Take her to a doctor and get a test done to be sure.  I can see no other explaination for an open genital sore.\n\n",

Sadly I now live in a country where I cannot get these meds and so I import Lysine from the states and take 1500mg per day as my naturopath friend suggested it.    I really can't say whether it works or not, but I'd like to think so    Studies I have read on it pretty much say it does not work, or is inconclusive at best.  I wish you luck and that you never have a reoccurence.  Feel free to PM me for support.  Thare are some good support groups on the web too.\n\n",

I could not get warm and sat in a blanket for about 20 minutes in which time I was shaking severly, my temp rose over 4 degrees. it topped out at 101.8 before it broke. The scary thing is my fingers were going numb when I was trying to get warm. My temp is back down to 99.5 right now and it is usually at about 97.2 to 97.4 degrees. Is this the onset of something else?\n\n",

At the same time they can be indicative of more serious conditions. However, if the shortness of breath is still there or recurrs or indeed if you have any doubts that this may be more serious than the flu then yes have someone look at it. The flu is usually self limited and only lasts a couple of days.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello: Here are some facts about Molluscum Contagiosum.  It is a skin disease caused by the molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV) usually causing one or more small lesions/bumps. MCV is generally a benign infection and symptoms may self-resolve. It is believed to be a member of the pox virus family.   Molluscum contagiosum may be sexually transmitted by skin-to-skin contact (does not have to be mucous membranes) and/or lesions. Transmission through sexual contact is the most common form of transmission for adults.   MCV may be transmitted from inanimate objects such as towels and clothing that come in contact with the lesions. MCV transmission has been associated with swimming pools and sharing baths with an infected person.  MCV also may be transmitted by autoinoculation, such as touching a lesion and touching another part of the body.   Lesions are usually present on the thighs, buttocks, groin and lower abdomen of adults, and may occasionally appear on the external genital and anal region. The lesions may begin as small bumps which can develop over a period of several weeks into larger sores/bumps. The lesions can be flesh colored, gray-white, yellow or pink. They can cause itching or tenderness in the area, but in most cases the lesions cause few problems. Lesions can last from 2 weeks to 4 years -- the average is 2 years.   The incubation period averages 2 to 3 months and may range from 1 week to 6 months.  How long one is infectious is not known for certain,  but researchers assume that if the virus is present it may be transmitted.   Most symptoms are self-resolving, but generally lesions are removed. Lesions may recur, but it is not clear whether this is due to reinfection, exacerbation of subclinical infection, or reactivation of latent infection.   Because transmission through sexual contact is the most common form of transmission for adults, preventing skin-to-skin contact with an infected partner will be most effective in preventing MCV.  Unfortunately, unless you used in vitro fertilization, there is no way to get pregnant without risking contracting the disease, until the lesions are gone. Regards, CArolyn\n\n",

It seems to be getting worse, and it looks like it is bruised.  I was wondering if it is infected?  I have been using the cream the doctor gave my son but it has not worked. Should she return to the doctors, or is this a waste of time, money?  Everything I read indicates that this will heal on it's own.  Mean while I have to try to hide them with bandaids so other Mom's, or teachers aren't concern.  She does go to preschool and I don't want anyone else to catch this.  Please let me know what I should do. Thank you, June\n\n",

However, in view of the fact that eradication of these lesions is delayed with the topical treatment given, and the condition is cosmetically unpleasant and may cause concern among parents of other children at school, I think you should opt for a clinician-directed office therapy which I have used with great success in adults and children.  This method is known as curettage, and involves removal of the lesions with a small curette causing little discomfort or no pain. Other clinician-directed therapies exist and you should discuss the options with your physician or dermatologist.   I hope this information is helpful.

    "content": "Yesterday (2-7-05) I went to the ER because my hands were numb and I could not stop trembling.  Earlier in the morning when it started I thought I was just having a panic attack, because  lately I seem to get about 2 a month.  But I never had the trembles like that for a few hours or numbness in my hands.  I always have rapid heartbeat and pain in my arm that goes away usually within 30 minutes.  EKG was ok, my heartbeat was a little high aruond 100.  Turns out is was a panic attack...I think.  They are still waiting on my thyroid test to come back.  They did a CBC blood test which did come back OK, no infections or anything else abnormal.  I was prescribed 0.5 mg of xanax.  I had an appointment with my regular physican that afternoon anyway because I had a sinus infection that would not completely go away.  So when I went to that appointment I was prescribed levaquin 500mg.  Amazingly the xanax worked and I felt fine this morning.  I was told I could take them when needed and did not have to take them daily.  I started the levaquin this morning and after reading about it online, I completely put myself into another panic attack and had to take a xanax.  Is levaquin really safe to take?  I've heard of all these horror stories from people who take them.  I'm a 28 year old female I've never had an allergic reaction to any medicine before,  (lets pray not now) I've been keeping my water bottle by me all day, trying to flush this drug out of me.    How long would it take to see an allergic reaction from this?  An hour? 10 hours? 24 hours?  I'm on 4 hours since I took it.  Are my odds less of a side effect because I only took one?  Why would I get this antibiotic if my CBC showed no infections?  Was my hear rate up because of the panic attack?  Also, since I'm prone to panic, if anyone knows how to tell a normal ache and pain to something serious, even if its just an opinion I'd appreciate it.  I think that sometimes I suffer for no reason, because I focus too much on small things.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Alwaysscared,  Any medication has potential side effects that occur in only a portion of the patients who take this medication and levaquin is not different.  There is no need to fear the side effect as long as it is recognized early on and the medication stopped.  i am not sure what are the horror stories that you read about levaquin online but i have seen way too many people take it with no side effects whatsoever. You have to take a look at both faces of the coin not just one.  Most probably you have a chronic sinus infection and with chronic infections, the white count does not have to be high.  Panic attacks causes increase in the heart rate.  Pain is a totally subjective sensation. i don't think that there is a way to tell if the pain that any patient is suffering from is actually there or not (meaning that there is no objective way to determine whether or not pain is present and hence it can not be quantified).  When assessing a patient, all of the symptoms that the patient suffers from are taken into consideration including the pain if present.  If you think you have a problem in regards to pain, you have to talk to your doctor about that and let him/her decide what is this pain related to and whether or not it has a serious cause and how to treat it.  i think the only way to differentiate between serious pain and non-serious pain is to be evaluated by a health care provider.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.  Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

(Think of Hawaii and it's islands.) This spot has a strange texture....to the touch it almost feels like the skin on your lips.  These spots move across his abdomen up to his chest....then they will go around his sides and then across his back.  Over a period of a year they may incircle his body 2 or 3 times.  He has had them now for about 8 years.  We once asked about the spots at a doctors office....and he told us then what it was called....but neither of us can remember....and we've become curious again, because they have returned. (they sometimes disappear for several months after traveling for a while.)  They never spread or change pattern.....just move around as a group....like something moving under the skin....very odd.  Does anyone know what this might be.....I do remember being told that it was nothing to concern ourselves with.  Just curious.\n\n",

Hives are a sign that the whole body is experiencing a hypersensitivity reaction. Hives occur when the body's capillaries and tiny veins get leaky. Fluid escaping from some of these blood vessels becomes trapped in parts of the skin and lining membranes of the body, causing localized swelling.   This leakiness can be caused by classic allergic reactions in which histamine triggers an inflammatory response. It can also be caused by a number of other regulatory systems in the body in response to different types of triggers.  The most common allergic triggers are drugs, especially antibiotics; foods, especially fish, shellfish, nuts, peanuts, eggs, berries, and food additives; infections (which we'll discuss below); insect bites or stings; inhalants such as animal danders, pollens, and molds; and contact allergens like plant substances, skin creams, cat scratches, moth scales, or animal saliva. In college I had a pet tarantula for a while and some of my friends got hives from petting her hairy abdomen.   There are also a number of distinct physical causes of hives (known as urticaria in doctor-speak):    Cold urticaria \u2013 the most common of the physical causes. These hives are triggered by exposure to cold water or air. This would be a good excuse to avoid swimming in cold pools (something my kids love for me to do).   Dermatographia -- hives that appear where the skin is firmly stroked. (Named because you can write on someone's skin by raising welts where your finger traced). This occurs in about 5% of people (and many more if you repeatedly stroke hard enough).    Pressure urticaria -- hives that appear under tightly fitting clothing or jewelry. Unlike dermatographia, which occurs in seconds, this can appear many hours later, obscuring the cause.    Cholinergic urticaria -- hives that occur in response to heat, exercise, or emotional stress. This usually doesn't begin before adolescence.    Aquagenic urticaria -- hives that are triggered by contact with sweat or with water. In these people, exercise itself is not a trigger, and they can drink water without a problem.    Solar urticaria -- a rare disorder in which sun exposure results in hives. Sunscreen can help!  I mentioned earlier that infections could trigger hives. We know that some parasites can be responsible for hives (including giardia and pinworms, which are common in day care settings). We also know that bacterial infections, most notably Strep, can be the culprit. Viruses of many types can trigger hives as well.  Over 70 percent of the time no specific cause is found when children have hives. They were hypersensitive to something, but no one discovers what, and the hives go away. Doctors think that most of these unidentified cases may be from viruses, which would make them the most common cause of hives. This is particularly likely when there is a cluster of cases (although molds, animals, foods, parasites, etc. could also be responsible for clusters).  Who gets it? About 20 percent of people will experience hives at some point in their lives. Those who have known allergies or a family history of allergies are more likely to get hives. All other things being equal, girls are more likely to get them than boys.  What are the symptoms? Wheals or welts come and go on the skin or mucous membranes. These may itch intensely, itch only a little, or not itch at all.   Each typically has a whitish, raised patch of skin surrounded by a reddish halo. The welts may be tiny or large, and may be all over the body or confined to one area.  Is it contagious? Hives themselves are not contagious, but the triggers of hives, especially viruses, bacteria, and parasites, may be contagious.  How long does it last? The individual welts often disappear quickly and are usually gone within 48 hours, although new ones may continue to appear for days or weeks. If new hives keep occurring for six weeks, this is called chronic Urticaria.  How is it diagnosed? Usually hives can be diagnosed based on the history and physical examination. Sometimes specific allergy testing or testing for infection is needed to look for the underlying cause.  Chronic urticaria is usually not serious, but can be a sign of an underlying disease process. Children with chronic hives should have a thorough physical exam and lab work just to be sure there are no underlying illnesses.  How is it treated? Hives are usually treated with an antihistamine, such as Benadryl or the prescription Atarax. If drowsiness is a problem, one of the newer, non-sedating antihistamines may be a better choice. Sometimes antihistamines are coupled with a histamine H2 blocker, such as cimetidine, for a more powerful effect.  A variety of stronger treatments are available, but are usually unnecessary. If there are other allergic symptoms, such as wheezing or tightening of the throat, then a shot of epinephrine may be needed.  How can it be prevented? The best way to prevent another bout of hives is to identify your triggers and avoid them. If you know in advance that you will be exposed to a trigger, a preventive dose of antihistamine can prevent or minimize the\n\n",

Current recommendations are for everyone to receive a Tetanus-diphtheria vaccination at least every 10 years to maintain your immunity. If you get a tetanus prone wound,  then recommendation is  that you receive the shot at least every five years. Contrary to most beliefs of the general population it's not only when you become injured by a \"rusty nail\" that vaccination is necessary. If it is a minor cut, that didn't require stitches, cleanse the area with an antibacterial product, and apply the antibacterial ointment. There should be an improvement in a couple of days. If not, have an evaluation completed. However, if you are showing any signs of a systemic infection, fever, chills, etc. and the redness/pain continues to increase have an evaluation done immediately. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

Temperature in healthy adults is tightly controlled at a mean of 37 degrees Centigrade with a diurnal variation of 0.5 degree (plus or minus). It is important to obtain objective evidence of fever by recording your oral or rectal temperature. Patients who complain of feeling \u201chot\u201d or \u201cfeverish\u201d do not necessarily have fever.   If a fever is confirmed and persistent, your doctor will investigate the cause.  The cause may be linked to your symptoms of dizziness or lightheadedness, assuming that your blood pressure is within the normal range.  Thank you for contacting this website.

    "content": "Hi,  A brownish or reddish ejaculate indicates blood in the semen and can cause concern to the men who experience it. The condition is common, and many episodes go unnoticed because ejaculation is usually intravaginally. It may be benign or the first indicator of a urologic disease.  It can occur in persons of any age. Most men with this condition are young (average age less than 40 y) and have symptoms ranging in duration from 1-24 months. Blood in the ejaculate that persists for more than 10 ejaculations or 2 months requires further evaluation by a urologist or genitourinary physician. Often, the condition is self-limiting within 2 months.  The patient's blood pressure should be checked because severe hypertension is associated with this condition, and may have a similar basis to the association of hypertension with nosebleeds. Other conditions that could cause blood in the ejaculate include: *Lesions of the urethra that bleed and contribute to the ejaculate, such as polyps, warts and strictures. *Infections of the urethra (urethritis) which may be sexually or non-sexually transmitted. Urethritis has long been recognised as a cause of bloody semen, especially in younger men. *Inflammations of the prostate, such as prostatitis.   *Other conditions of the prostate such as bleeding after a prostate biopsy (which resolves on its own), prostate cancer, prostatic varices, prostatic stones. Blood in the ejaculate of men older than 50 y is occasionally a harbinger of prostate cancer. *Cysts, infections and malignancy of the seminal vesicles (a pair of male accessory sex glands that secrete most of the liquid component of semen). *Systemic diseases, most important of which is severe hypertension as previously mentioned. Others in this category include bleeding disorders, chronic liver disease and lymphoma.  Quite often, the cause is benign,  remains unknown and resolves on its own.  I hope this information will prove helpful for your friend and her husband. Thank you for contacting this website.

    "content": "I am sorry to hear that your father is seriously ill in hospital.  Tuberculosis and pneumonia are life-threatening diseases and ideally, the patient should be in an Infectious Diseases Unit with facilities for intensive care. Doctors are expected to give patients or their next of kin the information they ask for about their condition, its treatment and prognosis. If the doctor is making himself unavailable for this purpose, you may wish to follow the hospital's procedure for complaints. You have a right to expect a prompt and appropriate response.  If you feel that your father is not getting good and adequate treatment in the present hospital, you have the choice of transferring him to a better unit if one exists in your locality. Please ensure that it is safe to move him if you take the decision.  You complain that the nurses are giving him all kinds of medication. Tuberculosis is a serious and chronic disease that requires multi-drug therapy for six or more months. These drugs have possible adverse effects. Your father may also be having complications, which would require additional medications. I would expect that the doctors and nurses know their jobs and would not give medications if not indicated.  It is of great importance to have family and social contacts investigated for infection with the disease. Please arrange this with your physician.  Thank you for contacting this website.

    "content": "Hi,  From your update, it seems that the doctor is optimistic that your father will get better. In fact, I think the medical personnel are doing their best, taking into account the severity of your father's illness, its complications, his age and his loss in weight. Treatment of tuberculosis requires specialized knowledge, particularly where the disease involves resistant organisms or non-respiratory organs.   Although your father is not eating, he is getting all the nutrients his body requires in the intravenous infusions (which he must be having). Antituberculous drugs are frequently associated with liver toxicity as adverse affects and this may be one cause of your father\u2019s loss of appetite. Is there a history of pre-existing liver disease or alcohol dependence?  Please do not forget that your father is elderly, and therefore, his response to severe infections may not be as expected of a healthy, younger adult.  I cannot advise you of  Boston Hospital because I am not domiciled in the US and cannot compare facilities. The doctors and nurses who volunteer their services on this website are based in various continents.  Thank you for the update.    Dr Anthony Solomon MB BS DTM&H DIP.VEN FRSM\n\n",

I wake up with a real low 96.8 to 97.6 temp...then fluctuate throughout the day sometimes in the 99's (mostly in the evening or night hours) mostly 98's and hot weather seems to make it higher.  I have read that about 99.3 is a fever but when my temp goes to that or a bit more I don't feel sick and it goes right back down...especially if I go into a 70 degree room versus a 90 degree room...is this normal? It also starts to drop at around midnight to 1 or 2 am.   Should I worry?  It should be noted that i have had cbc's liver functions and kidney functions as well as other tests and nothing is \"wrong\" with the results.  I do believe I have a high metabolism and of course am anxious a lot of the time...in fact one of my problems now is an addiction to the thermometer.  So if there is any way to put my mind at ease I would appreciate it.  Thank You.\n\n",

    "content": "Fever is frequently defined as the elevation of body temperature in response to an infection or other disease process. Using the upper limit of normal as 99.9 degrees Fahrenheit, fever would be defined as 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.7 degrees Celsius) or higher. This is the definition I typically use. Some physicians define fever as 100.4 or 101 degrees Fahrenheit (38 or 38.3 Celsius), however, and I do not believe there is just one correct answer.  A person's normal temperature also varies throughout the day, with the lowest temperature being in the morning and the highest in the late afternoon and early evening.  Women who are ovulating will have a monthly rise of temperature at the time of ovulation. So tinker, as you see you are still within the normal range. And fever is defined not by temperature values but by the presence of infection or a disease process in addition to the temperature change. I don't think there is a reason to worry about the values you mentioned. Best regards,\n\n",

    "title": "This is me, too..............plus...............",
    "content": "I just had to type a response to this because this sounds like me also.  I, however, may have experienced trauma to my hypothalamus or adrenals.  It first started with a hysterectomy in '99 that left me with insomnia such that I woke up every single morning after 4 hours sleep in a sweat and panic.  I was put on sleeping pills (a benzodiazepine) for 2 years and about 3 months into it's usage, I developed between dosage withdrawals that caused me such stress that my thyroid numbers were thrown off and I started to develop numerous allergies and acid reflux and throat gripping anxiety.  I finally tapered off this medication after I started to experience swollen and painful hands and feet and elevated ANA.  I remember earlier that my DHEA was very high as was my cortisol and my anion gap was low (low electrolytes).  As soon as I figured out that the benzo was the cause of all this grief, I weaned myself off of it and many of the symptoms disappeared excluding the painful hands and feet (paresthesia).  It seemed however that after that I could not handle stress at all.  I would shake inside whenever I encountered stress.  On one particular occassion, I was having to deal with my ex-husband and the stress was so bad that I then developed TMJD so very severely that I had to be fitted with a night gard and be put on antiinflammatories, but nothing was helping.  So low estrogen was thought to be the cause because no doctor would investicate beyond this and I was put on estrogen for about 6 months and it caused me anxiety on the second day after application (patch), so I changed the patch.  The day that the new patch was affixed, I would have no anxiety until about 8:00 a.m. the next morning at which time the anxiety would return, so I changed the patch again.  I changed a patch every day that was intended to be changed every 3rd or 4th day.  My doctor for whatever reason allowed this to go on for 6 months.  I started to get weaker and weaker and weaker.  So, I decided one day to put up with the anxiety and leave the patch in place for the whole 4 days.  Well, I started to get really tired and felt pressure in my thyroid.  I did this for about a month.  I really started to exhibit major hypothyroid symptoms.  Finally, my doctor ran a test on my thyroid and it came back as hypothryoid.  She wouldn't check my adrenals nor my estrogen levels.  She put me on Synthroid and then Armour.  I started to experience some really devasting symptoms on that....extreme anxiety and horrific pain in the back right flank area.  I stopped the thyroid hormones and the pain greatly subsided.  So, I went to another doctor who would and did check a lot, but this doctor was hours and hours away and I knew that I couldn't afford him or manage the trip again, but decided to go to him this one time.  My blood work came back as having extremely elevated estrogen and extremely low progesterone and thyroid.  I was deathly ill by this time.  So, I stopped the estrogen and was put on thyroid hormones about 4 weeks later (very small dose of 25 mcg.).  Well, then I started to experience hyperthyroidism symptoms and lost 13 lbs. in one week.  So, the doctor who had checked my adrenals along with everything else stated that my adrenals had been extremely stressed and that my cortisol levels were very low as was my seratonine.  My epinephrine, norepinephrine and dopamine were elevated as was my DHEA which was 3 times the top of the range.  He told me to stop the thyroid hormone and start on low dose hydrocortisone (10 mg. daily).  Well, I started to experience extreme weakness with this after a while.  Was my system allowing this medication to build to toxic levels or was my body just rebelling from all the medications it has been on?  Perhaps I only need miniscule amounts of medication.  I don't know.  So, I stopped that.  I decided that I didn't want anymore drugs put into my body until someone found out for sure what was wrong with me, but I can't get a doctor to run a whole gammet of tests on me to get to the bottom of it.  These days, I am very, very sick and should possibly even be in the hospital for an array of tests.  I do know that 4 years ago my 8:00 a.m. cortisol was 23.8 and nearly 2 years ago it was 13 and now it is 10.  My doctor said that these are normal fluctuations.  These are my symptoms.  I can't tolerate the heat without getting very weak and dehydrated, I'm fatigued most of the time but unable to sleep, my night time sleep is very broken up with about 2 - 4 hours immediately and perhaps after waking 1 more hour or so, my body temperature while I sleep can be as low as 96.8 and has risen over the course of the day to as high as 100.2 with fluctuations up and down (high temps in the heat or low temps in colder temperatures, but also when I am weakened by overexerting myself (a kind of weakening that I can feel to the core of me...in my chest and legs) by something as easy as pulling weeks in my garden then my temperature will take a drop), I have dips of depression, too, and can't tolerate any refined carbohydrates, sugar, alcohol, or medications (i.e. otc sleep aids, benadryl or hormones), my hands and feet swell as does the flesh around my eyes, my right flank pain increases in relation to my other symptom increases and most days I feel like I am merely existing.  I am miserable and scared and was just wondering what my doctor should be investigating and if he doesn't then perhaps I should find another doctor who will investigate my symptoms.  Please tell me what tests should be done to rule out hypothalamus, adrenal, central nervous system or liver problems and do you suggest any other causes for my problems and if so, what tests in general should be run.  Thank you very much in advance, McMarsha P.S.  I'm sorry this post is so long, but as you see there is a lot of vital information that shouldn't be left out.  My problems are definitely a result of compounded events over the course of 4 years.  This much I know.  [img]%20%20[/img]\n\n",

A tooth abcess needs prompt treatment because of the complications they can cause. For example, loss of the tooth, spead of the infection to soft tissue or jaw bone, or spread of the infection to other parts of the body, brain, heart and lungs. I would again suggest prompt treatment. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "title": "\"isolated\" chills",
    "content": "I have experienced sudden onset of chills about once every several months for the last five years. My wife and I refer to it as my spells of \"temperature deregulation\". I feel as if I may be coming down with the flu for ten minutes (I feel a bit achy and under the weather) and then I experience racking chills for about twenty minutes. I immediately jump into a hot bath and so I'm not sure how long they would persist under other conditions. I feel somewhat nauseas as I'm experiencing these chills, but have never vomited and have no other symptoms (no focus problems, or cognitive changes). Blood dramatically drains from my hands and feet and my shaking is pretty severe. Afterwards, I may feel a bit hot and usually go to bed as I'm a bit exhausted after the chills, but otherwise I feel okay. These episodes of \"dysautonomia\" have always occurred in the evening and as far as I can remember, in the winter, but I never am particularly cold before onset of these chills. Also, as I've not had very many, the time of day or season consistency may be a statistical fluke. Only five to eight total episodes and I took notes the last two times as to what I'd eaten or been doing, but haven't generated interesting clues. I don't believe I have any other unusual autonomic symptoms. I'm wondering if anyone has any leads or ideas as to causes of \"isolated chills\"?\n\n",

    "content": "Normal blood pressure lies within a range - it is not one set of numbers. Optimal blood pressure is now clearly defined as a reading below 120 / 80. If your blood pressure is always in the 100/70 range, you do not suffer from hypotension.  You state that you experience shortness of breath and rapid heart rate when changing from a supine to a sitting position and it is of very short duration (30 seconds), and not sustained. There is a rare condition known as platypnea which is characterized by shortness of breath that worsens in the upright position. It is unlikely that you have this problem because your shortness of breath lasts only 30 seconds and you do not experience it during or after exertional workouts. Several pathophysiologic processes contribute to shortness of breath and it would be out of place to list them here. If symptoms persist, both cardiac and pulmonary evaluations are recommended under the respective specialists.  Your other complaints of easy fatigability and lack of energy are suggestive of  chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Unfortunately, you do not state duration of these complaints.  CFS is characterized by a minimum of 6 months of severe physical and mental fatigue and fatigability made worse by minor exertion. Apart from profound fatigue, there are no other symptoms or physical signs which distinguish the illness. Anxiety and depression are commonly associated with the syndrome but are not part of it. No laboratory tests can confirm the diagnosis, but it is advisable to consult your doctor who may wish to conduct the following laboratory tests to exclude other causes of fatigue:  Full Blood Count, ESR, CRP and CK; Renal, liver and thyroid function tests.   I hope this information has been helpful.   Dr Anthony Solomon  MB BS DTM&H DIP.VEN FRSM Consultant Physician, Tropical & Genitourinary Medicine\n\n",

    "content": "The condition you describe is suggestive of phimosis, which may be present from birth or may follow contraction resulting from trauma, infection or balanitis xerotica obliterans (BXO).  Clearly, this is not congenital in your husband's case because it is of recent occurrence. As you have excluded STDs, it is most likely due to the trauma of frequent masturbation or BXO.  BXO is a common condition which frequently begins in childhood but may remain asymptomatic for a long time. In uncircumcised patients, the margin of the prepuce (which you describe as \u201caround the foreskin by the tip\u201d) is pale in colour, thickened and sometimes fissured and sore.  Treatment of BXO is by circumcision. If the condition is due to trauma, abstinence from masturbation will help. A genitourinary physician or urologist should be consulted for diagnosis and management. If urine flow is restricted, he should go to ER.  Thank you for contacting our website.

    "content": "Hello,   My girlfriend has had a problem with burning vaginal pains after intercourse for the last 3 or 4 months.  The problem has been slowly getting worse since we first noticed it.  She describes it as an intense, sharp burning unrestricted to one specific area.  I think it burns her inside and partially outside the vagina.    After visiting her a week ago (we only see each other once every other week), we had unprotected intercourse as usual and she complained about increasing pain/burning.  In the last 3 days, I have noticed extremely dry, flakey skin on my penis.  I am not circumcized, and the effected area is only what is covered by foreskin (the majority of the head, the area below the crown, and all the under-foreskin).  The area burns with any contact of water from showering or friction from masterbation.  Small cracks in the skin seem to be developing, which are probably the cause of the burning.  All of these symptoms were preceded by mild, occasional itching.    Neither of us have had any discharge.  I assume this is some sort of infectious disease since I have had very similar symptoms as her, but I have no idea where we/she got it from.  Overall, this is fairly embarassing and frustrating, so I'll greatly appreciate any help that I can get. Happy Holidays, Dave\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Dave: It is possible that your girlfriend has a yeast infection which is causing her burning pain. The problem with yeast infections is that unless both partners are treated they keep reinfecting each other. You might ask your girlfriend to get a prescription for her yeast infection that includes a medicated cream for both of you to use.  The reason that you are only having symptoms under the forskin is that yeast thrives in warm moist areas such as under the foreskin, under skin folds and in the vagina.  Only when the yeast has been cleared up on both of you should you engage in sex again.  Otherwise this infection will just continue on. Regards, Carolyn\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,   Thank you for assisting your elderly mother to contact this website.  Although the term sepsis is used to describe the destruction of tissue by disease-causing bacteria or their toxins, I believe your question is directed at skin infections generally because your diabetic mother is now experiencing one on her thumb.  Since diabetes is a lifelong disorder, education of the patient and the family is the most important obligation of the physician who provides care. The disease is affected by daily fluctuations in environmental stress, exercise, diet and infections. The best person to manage it is the patient and the patient\u2019s family and you are doing the correct thing by assisting your mother.  The physician or nurse has a duty to explain to a diabetic patient how to recognize, prevent or treat some of the hazards of the disease. It is important for her to have regular tests for blood glucose to ensure good control of diabetes. She should be provided with a home glucometer and taught how to operate and record results. If mother is a smoker, she should give up smoking. I will expect that she is on medication for CHF.   Prompt and proper first aid treatment is of the utmost importance in apparently minor injuries and infections of the skin, especially if located on the feet. The \u201csmall infection\u201d on her thumb should be treated with a mild antiseptic and a physician consulted if redness, blistering, pain or swelling develops. Any break in the skin of the feet may become ulcerous or gangrenous unless treated properly by a physician. As soon as possible after any injury or abrasion of the skin of the feet, the area should be cleaned with mild soap and lukewarm water and covered with sterile gauze. The physician should be consulted for advice and treatment as soon as possible after any foot injury or infection.  I hope this information has helped you and your mother.  On behalf of the crew at this website, I would like to send seasonal greetings to your 78-year old mother.

    "content": "Hi,  Apart from HIV which is a retrovirus, there are two other retroviruses, HTLV 1 (Human T-cell Lymphotropic Virus Type 1)  and HTLV 2 (Human T-cell Lymphotropic  Virus Type 2).  Both are associated with disease in humans.  HTLV 1 is endemic in Japan, the Caribbean and certain parts of West Africa. Transmission is by blood transfusion, drug users sharing needles and from mother to child, principally through breastfeeding. It can also be transmitted by sexual intercourse, especially from male to female.  HTLV 1 is associated with adult T-cell leukaemia / lymphoma and with a degenerative neurological disease.  HTLV 2 is a much more rarely isolated virus than HTLV 1 which has been isolated from Native Americans and in Africa, and also from intravenous drug users in the USA. Its role in human disease is uncertain but it is infrequently associated with hairy cell leukaemia.  Naturally, if you are generally in good health and full physical and blood examinations (numbering over a hundred times, according to you) have shown no abnormalities, it is unlikely that you have any of the diseases associated with the virus at the present time.

I again stongly suggest you be evaluated. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "content": "I finally visited the doctor last week after months of noticing strange vaginal discharges. The most recent was a cheesy, slightly odorous discharge with a slight irritating sensation. However, after each menstrual period I get a discharge with an intense odor, usually fishy and varies in colour(white, yellow, slightly brownish). This discharge doesn't last until the next period, it stops just about a week and a half before my next period. And during that time I get no discharge at all.   Also between periods I spot lightly once or twice. I've read several forums to read about similar experiences but my spotting is nothing like the spotting they describe. My spotting is very light and sometimes the red colour is just visible in the discharge and other times my spotting resembles a very very light period of a few spots.  Last week when i visited a gyn. she told me that it was an infection called bacterial vaginosis (Gardnerella) and prescribed some medication: metronidazol tablets 2x a day for 7 days, polygynax capsules 1 every night for 10 days and gyno-travogen 1 capsule for the very last day. I am into my 5th day of taking the medication.  Yesterday I read about the infection she diagnosed and the symptoms stated are the same symptoms i experienced just before my last period, but now I am worried because those are not the only symptoms i have. What about my other symptoms I described previously? like the spotting and the yellow to brownish discharge?  And what intensifies my worries is that she did not perform a culture test, she just examined me manually by inserting her fingers into my vagina.  I need some advice and information. I'm worried I might have something more complicated and serious.   PLEASE RESPOND ASAP. This is becoming unbearable.\n\n",

    "title": "2 PROBLEMS: NIPPLE AND VAGINAL DISCHARGE",
    "content": "Hi,  First, let us look into the complaints you have about the left and right breasts:  i)  a bloody and purulent (yellowish) discharge from the nipple of your RIGHT breast  ii) a sharp pain in the LEFT breast which is associated with a lump the size of an acorn. The pain is getting worse and more frequent. There is no nipple discharge.   You do not state if you are lactating, if you are on contraceptive pills  and if the yellowish/bloody discharge is spontaneous or expressible. \u201cSpontaneous\u201d means that the discharge comes out on its own, without trying to force it out by manual expression. \u201cExpressible\u201d means that you have to manually express the discharge if it is to be visible.   You have consulted your doctor and it was dismissed as \u201cnothing\u201d. Is that the doctor\u2019s word or your own interpretation? The symptoms you are experiencing in both breasts warrant a specialist examination by a breast surgeon. I am personally surprised that you have not been referred to one.  In the non-lactating breast, the commonest causes of nipple discharge (in decreasing frequency) are duct ectasia, intraductal papilloma and malignancy.   Spontaneous, bloody discharge from a nipple is suggestive of a benign papilloma in the duct or a malignant lesion. At your age, it is more likely the former (women over 50 are more likely to have a malignant cause).  Purulent discharge from a nipple may be caused by a sub-areolar abscess.  Milky discharge in the non-lactating female occurs in certain endocrine disorders A painful lump in the left breast may have several causes.   At your age, I am presuming that the causes of your breast lesions are benign, but further examination and investigations are mandatory to confirm the diagnosis. Please ask your doctor to refer you to the appropriate specialist.  In respect of your final complaint, a vaginal discharge that has a fishy odour and causes no vulvar itching or burning is very suggestive of Bacterial Vaginosis (BV). However, the discharge in BV is usually off-white or greyish-white in colour, not yellow.  Was a sample of the vaginal fluid subjected to tests? The tests that could have been done at the time of your visit are simple and diagnostic: acidity (pH) test of the vaginal fluid; amine test (development of a fishy odour after mixing a sample of vaginal fluid with a particular chemical); and a sample to identify \u201cclue cells\u201d by  microscopic analysis. Bacterial Vaginosis does not cause an inflammation in the vagina, so you would not expect any swelling there.   What medicine was prescribed?   Thank you for contacting our website.

There are two distinct forms of this disease:  Louse borne relapsing fever (LBRF): Body lice (Pediculus humanus) become infected with B. recurrentis by feeding on spirochetemic humans, the only reservoirs of infection. Humans become infected when an infected louce is crushed and their body fluids contaminate mucous membranes or breaks in the skin.  Tick borne relapsing fever (TBRF): The ticks become infected by feeding on spirochetemic hosts (rats, mice, chipmunks, squirrels, rabbits, hares and humans). The spirochetes are transmitted by ticks to humans and animals via saliva and excretory fluids when the tick feeds.    i found that by searching for spirochetes but its part of this website!! so could his infection be borrelia/relapsing fever?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  What was the doctor\u2019s diagnosis when he inspected the lesions 8-9 months ago? You mentioned \u201cbacterial infection\u201d in your last sentence: was this the diagnosis or your own interpretation?  Possible bacterial infections could be  impetigo contagiosa or furunculosis.  Your description of the lesions is very unclear. Perhaps my questions will assist you to give a clearer picture.  Have the lesions recurred at the same site? Do they occur singly or as grouped lesions which begin as itchy, red spots that evolve to papules, vesicles or pustules and later painful ulcers? According to you, the lesions first appeared on the skin in the lower abdomen, disappeared (without treatment?) and recurred in the lower abdomen and additionally on the penile shaft. By lower abdomen, I assume that you are referring to the pubic skin and adjacent region. At the same time, there was a pimple-like lesion on the lower lip, which keeps recurring. Are you sexually active, and was there a sexual contact within 2 to 20 days of the first episode?   You ask if this could be herpes, if not a bacterial infection.  Genital herpes is acquired sexually through contact with a person shedding the virus and could be due to Herpes simplex Type 1 or Type 2. Incubation period varies from 2-20 days. Type 2 usually results from sexual intercourse, while Type 1 can result from intercourse, fellatio or cunnilingus. Common symptoms are itching, burning, and redness prior to the eruption of the vesicles. The lesions usually recur at the same sites and start as itchy red spots, progressing to papules, vesicles or pustules, and finally painful ulcers.   An accurate diagnosis can only be made by a good history followed by visual examination of the lesions when they occur. This, as you know, is impossible on the net. Therefore, a visit to a dermatologist is necessary when the lesions appear again.   Thank you for contacting our website.

    "title": "Nipple piercing",
    "content": "Hello, I am a 33 yo female who had my nipples pierced 10 weeks ago. Sterile technique was used along with proper wound care (sea salt soaks,antibacterial soap, etc..) Until recently they appeared well healed. I occaisionally use lavender oil to help soften the \"crusties\" and for its antibacterial properties. I did apply this last night. While cleaning my nipples today, I noticed that my left nipple has a small \"blood blister\" approx. 2 mm away from the piercing at the entrance of the wound. The blood blister is on my actual nipple(superficial) and the piercing is at the base of the nipple. This was not there yesterday. It is approx. 3mm in size and when I touched it , it did leak some blood. There is no warmth, redness or discmfort, nor am I running a temperature. I am menstruating presently. Upon palpation of the breast I do not notice any discomfort, lumps, discharge, etc... My guess is that the area somehow became \"pinched\" during sleep or from my bra, however Iwould like another opinion. I am wondering if I should start on a prophylactic course of abx to make sure or if this could possibly have to do with hormone changes due to menstruation, though this has not happened the last 2 cycles. I will keep an eye on it for any changes in the mean time. The piercing does not appear to be migrating. Note: I did spend some time in a hot tub 3 days ago....... I have also been taking ibuprofen the last few days..... I do have many \"cherry hemangiomas\" on my torso and that breast in particular. Most are pin head sized, though I do have larger ones on my back, and unfortunately as I age I seem to develop more. This resembles one of the larger ones, but it is more pliable and darker in color (not bright red) Thanks in advance for your time and opinion. Respectfully, Michelle\n\n",

    "content": "Hello: I advise strongly that you go to the doctor and have it checked.  My main concern is not Rabies, but rather an infection called \"cat-scratch\" disease.  Cat-scratch disease is an infection caused by bacteria (germs) carried in cat saliva. The bacteria can be passed from a cat to a human.  You can get cat-scratch disease from a cat bite or cat scratch. You can get the infection after a cat scratches you if the cat's paws have the bacteria on them. (A cat can get the bacteria on its paws when it licks itself.) With a cat bite, the cat can pass the bacteria to you in its saliva. You can also get the bacteria in your eyes if you pet a cat that has the bacteria on its fur and then rub your eyes. Many people who get cat-scratch disease do not remember being scratched or bitten by a cat.  Cat-scratch disease is not a severe illness in people who are healthy. But it can be a problem in people with weak immune systems.  Some warnings signs to look out for would be: A cat scratch or bite that does not heal in the usual length of time.  An area of redness around a cat scratch or bite that continues to get bigger for more than 2 days after the injury.  Fever that lasts for several days after a cat scratch or bite.  Painful and swollen lymph nodes for more than 2 or 3 weeks.  Bone or joint pain, abdominal pain (without fever, vomiting or diarrhea) or an unusual degree of tiredness for more than 2 or 3 weeks.   Hopefully, this will go away and will only be an unpleasant memory. Regards, Carolyn\n\n",

I went to the doctor who looked at it and said it was a skin tag and he froze it off. Went back again recently because I saw something that was a bit darker and near the base of the penis. He said it looked like a wart. I asked him specifically if it looked like a sexually transmitted type and he said no. I reiterated my question and said \"can I give this to my girlfriend?\" to which he again replied no. I was confused so I started researching and a friend of mine said he had something similar...a wart on his penis that his doctor advised was not of the HPV variety either. I haven't found anything online about a wart down there that is the non-sexual variety. Now I am skeptical. Why would my doctor say this? The only thing I found researching online was mollusca contagiosum.\n\n",

The medicine was called Metronidazole. I took them at 10:30 am om friday. I spent all friday evening and night through Saturday vomiting. Now the vomiting has stopped but there is blood in my urine.

    "content": "Hi Ashley,   Please state what your complaints were when you saw your family doctor on those two occasions.   Was the urine sample you provided a mid-stream specimen or a first catch sample? First catch samples usually produce false-positive results. What bacteria was isolated on culture and what was the result of sensitivity tests? What was the dosage of each of the Metronidazole pills? This drug is usually prescribed for the treatment of  trichomonas vaginalis infection (TV) which is nearly always sexually acquired. It is also the drug of choice for bacterial vaginosis (BV). Both TV and BV produce an offensive vaginal discharge. Do you have a discharge? If your doctor confirms TV infection, it is important to examine sexual partners and prescribe the same treatment even if the organism is not found. This avoids the risk of re-infection.     The doctor must have informed you that vomiting is a well-known side effect of Metronidazole and that you should abstain from alcohol while on it.  Blood in the urine: did you discover this yourself or was it after another urine test? There are several causes of blood in the urine (haematuria), the commonest of which are diseases of the kidneys and urinary bladder which are too numerous to mention here. Haematuria warrants more detailed investigations such as blood, urine and ultrasound studies.   Please supply us with some answers and we will advise you further.    Thank you for contacting The Doctor's Lounge.   Dr Anthony Solomon MB BS DTM&H DIP VEN FRSM Consultant Physician, Tropical & Genitourinary Medicine\n\n",

I get the same \"pimple\" like swelling of the taste bud on my tounge as well.  I pop it and it goes away. I don't really worry about it, as well as I don't think you have anything to worry about.

    "content": "Hi docc, You are probably already aware that hepatitis c is a liver disease where the liver becomes swollen and stops working properly. It is a serious disease because your liver removes toxins that build up in the blood. It is a sneaky disease because some people can have no symptoms at all (approx 80%) and their liver only shows a small amount of damage. About 15% of people infected with the virus may develop cirrhosis after having the infection for many years. Some of the symptoms are: Feeling tired Feeling sick to your stomach Poor appetite Stomach pain Diarrhea Muscle and joint pain Dark yellow urine Yellowish eyes and skin  One of the treatments that I'm aware of is with a  drug called interferon. Treatment can prevent further liver damage and cirrhosis. My suggestion is that if your doctor wants to discuss treatment options with you that you should hear him/her out and then make your decision especially since you lab values already appear out of range. I hope this helps. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

Most probably you will be treated.  Abdominal pain is somtimes difficult to figure out without examination. There are many causes for right sided abdominal pain including liver disease (and you have active hepatitis c), gall bladder disease, ulcers in the stomach and first part of intestines, gall bladder, kidney disease including stones, colon disease, others such as back diseases and hernias. Many of these have to be looked for specifically such as kidney stones (having urine analysis and ultrasounds and having ct scans looking specifically for them with a certain protocol).

    "content": "i have no idea what this could possibly be, i've asked others about it and they have no answer. the illnesss only last a day, if that. it starts out by having a feeling of extreme cold when i breathe, then i get the fever, and the highest it's been is 103.5. i get bad chills, disorientation (like i have to work to turn my head but there's no pain and it seems like i'm walking in a dreamworld) my breathing is shallow and my heart races, and after a few hours it's gone. i experienced it all last year, around the time my husband and i were having bad troubles. in the period of about 5 months i had this twice, had to have my tonsils removed due to severe infection and became abcessed (swollen larger than walnuts), and shingles. i was only 21 years old. does anyone have any ideas? is it possibly stress induced? it really bothers me that i don''t know what it was-is it possible that i have some type of cancer and don't know? please, someone help me\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Sahra_black: Have you been to the doctor for this?  If so were any lab tests done and what were the results of them?  Could you provide us with the results of the lab tests?  We would need to know a little more about this before giving an answer.   Is it only at stressful moments or do the symptoms  occur when resting quietly?  Do you feel any heart palpitations (a pause in the heart beat followed by a hard beat of the heart)?  When you feel cold, while breathing in, do you feel cold over your body also? Do you develop any type of rash or blister like lesions? How long does your fever last?   I await your reply. Thanks for using The Doctor's Lounge. Carolyn\n\n",

    "content": "one of the last times i was \"struck\" i did go to the emergency room. i was so scared that something was terribly wrong with me. however, even though when i got there i had a fever over 103, they made me sit out in the waiting room for 5 or 6 hours. when the doctor saw me he told me i had a sinus infection even though he didn't check me over or run any tests. i've never had any tests run, never really had the money to do so. it does seem that it always occurs when moments are most stressful, but usually it would be days i wouldn't be doing anything in particular. i've had it a total of four times so far. the fever usually lasts for a better part of 24 hours, along with the rest of the symptoms. yes, there were heart palpitations, and yes i did feel cold all over-but i think from the chills. they were so bad my teeth would chatter and i would lay in the floor with a blanket over the heating vent (this was in winter) and still i was cold.  i never developed any kind of a rash or anything, except for the shingles i developed around the same time. as for the disorientation, it was almost like i was underwater, likewise with impaired hearing. i've always had strange medical problems but this one worried me particularly. any ideas?\n\n",

    "content": "When you have a high fever, and 103 is high for an adult, it is common to feel cold chills, disorientation, fast heart rate and shallow breathing.  I assume that the doctor diagnosed sinus infection because you had some tenderness either around the orbits of the eyes on across the forehead or had a discharge from the nose.  Once the fever goes down the symptoms should go away.  When people are under unusual stress, their immune system(part of the body that fights off infection) does not work as well and they are more prone to infection, colds, sinusitis, etc.  I would recommend you try to find ways to reduce your stress, perhaps by taking frequent breaks from whatever it is that stresses you, make sure your diet is high in foods that are natural antioxidants (fruits/vegetables), drink plenty of water and take mega does of Vitamin C.  All these things will help to build up your immune system to aid in warding off infection. Good Health To You, Carolyn\n\n",

    "content": "Hello: You stated,\"I am not anymore stressed out then any other working mother with 4 small children.\" As a mother of 5 grown  children, I remember well the days of working and raising kids.  Is it possible you don't realize how much stress you are experiencing?  Do you have any help at home?  How stressful is your job?  Stress can affect every fibre of our being, from our skin and hair to our cardiovascular system, and every effect is negative.  Have you been tested for arthritis, since you mention the joint pain? Also your  symptoms of joint pain are similiar to the symptoms of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS). CFS is usually diagnosed by doing labs to rule out other causes and when everything has been ruled out the name for the fatigue and joint pain is CFS.  Do you find that your symptoms subside on your days off or on vacation?  If so, then that would certainly indicate stress is a main component of your illness.  Sorry, I cant be of more help to you.

    "content": "Hi! I have had sharp pains in my upper stomach on and off for two years now with tiredness, watery light colored stools and sometimes tarry colored stools and very frequant bowel habits. I also have developed pain sharp pains in the middle of stomach. And every now and then I have pains on my left side but not that much. I have numbness/ tingling in my left side of back and sometimes sharp pain in my right side of back. There have been times when my face turns beat red and there is some kind of rash like thing under my chin. I have also had the same rash like places on my chest and stomach. My upper stomach is after tender to touch. A while back I ate something greasy for three meals and I continually threw up until there wasn't anything else left in me. I haven't had this happen since but I hardly ever eat greasy foods and most of the time I don't eat three meals a day ...Most the time maybe one if that. If I do eat most of the time it goes staight trough me and feel full after the first bite. I week or two ago I was told I have IBS but i'm not quite sure that is the only problem. The doctor only done a endoscopy with showed bloody ulceractions all over my stomach, I have no uclers though. I'm thinking maybe I have a problem with my gallbladder or liver????? Anyone can you help me???\n\n",

Your doctor could determine if that is the case by doing an ultrasound of your gallbladder to see if you have gallstones.  Gallstones that block the bile duct can cause severe abdominal and chest pain.  Rather than enduring this pain why not have the doctor check you for this? Let us know how things work out for you, ok?

    "content": "Dear Docc,  Thank you very much for the update.  You having 800,000 copies of the virus means that the hepatitis c infection that you have is active and most probably needs treatment. The type of virus should be determined and then treatment started.  The treatment consists of pegylated interferon and ribavarin. Treatment is usually of long duration up to a year.  Interferon treatment has potential side effects that should be discussed with the treating physician fully before starting as sometimes they are severe enough that some people chose not to continue treatment after they start treatment.  Hepatitis c infection might be severe and progress to liver cirrhosis liver failure and there is a percentage that progresses to liver cancer.  You have to discuss all your options with your doctor and then decide which way you want to go. A liver biopsy might be needed before treatment.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Folliculitis is the name given to a group of skin conditions in which there are inflamed hair follicles. The result is a tender red spot, often with a surface pustule. Folliculitis can be due to infection, occlusion, irritation and specific skin diseases. There are a number of bacterial infections associated with folliculitis including staph.  While the hair follicles themselves are not contagious, the staphylococci bacteria infecting them is. Therefore, no one should come in contact with the infected area.  Since the infection has reoccurred you may need to go back to the doctor and have a culture taken in order to determine which bacteria is the cause and which antibiotic will be effective.

    "content": "Dear Docc,  Active hepatitis c infection means that the virus is replicating and increasing and destroying liver cells as it does that and this is what it is meant by increase in the liver enzymes.  Treatment should be given for an active case of hepatitis c, the specialist who does that should have adequate experience with the treatments for hepatitis c as they have lots of potential side effects. The specialist is either a gastroenterologist/hepatologist or an infectious disease specialist.

    "content": "Hi: Would anyone know if the symptoms for WNV can include headache, muscular aches & a loss of appetite, but without a fever (or a very low-grade, barely detectable one at best)?  I live in San Jose, California, where cases of WNV have been reported.  Last week, I had these symptoms for a day or two before it started tapering off.  There were no other symptoms such as rash, vomiting, diarrhea, etc.  I was particularly struck by the fact that I had flu-like achiness but without any real fever, which I don't recall ever having had before.  Very odd, hence my posting.  I suppose it could be any number of things, but considering the timing (not quite flu season yet) & the unusual (at least for me) nature of the symptoms & with all of the hoopla lately about WNV, it made me wonder   .  Any thoughts would be appreciated. - Scott\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Scot: According to the Center for Disease Control: The symptoms of severe disease (also called neuroinvasive disease, such as West Nile encephalitis or meningitis or West Nile poliomyelitis) include headache, high fever, neck stiffness, stupor, disorientation, coma, tremors, convulsions, muscle weakness, and paralysis. It is estimated that approximately 1 in 150 persons infected with the West Nile virus will develop a more severe form of disease. Serious illness can occur in people of any age, however people over age 50 and some immunocompromised persons (for example, transplant patients) are at the highest risk for getting severely ill when infected with WNV.  Most people (about 4 out of 5) who are infected with West Nile virus will not develop any type of illness (an asymptomatic infection), however you cannot know ahead of time if you'll get sick or not when infected.   The incubation period in humans (i.e., time from infection to onset of disease symptoms) for West Nile disease is 2-15 days.  The symptoms last a few days, although even some healthy people report having the illness last for several weeks. The symptoms of severe disease (encephalitis or meningitis) may last several weeks, although neurological effects may be permanent.  You are right in saying it could be a number of things, because your symptoms fit so many illness that I could not begin to guess what it is without seeing some lab tests done.  Here's hoping you are feeling better now. Thanks for using The Doctor's Lounge, Carolyn\n\n",

They had either a white cheesy fluid or a white blob in the them. They went away in a week or two, and I freaked out and went to the doctor and spent nearly $800 on testing for STD'S. The doctor told me that I was fine and there was nothing to worry about. Now a year later I have not had a bump on my penis but I do have them occuring singularly on the back of my head 1-6 bumps consistently, and sometimes a bump or two on my chest,face, thigh,buttock, and pubic hair region. I am still freaking out about this and I can't get any real answers from the doctors in this area. I don't have the money to spend for a lot more testing. Every photo of herpes and other STDs doesn't look like the bumps I have, they just look like a large pimple, Can you please offer some expert advise!!!  Thank you from the bottom of my heart!!!  P.S. I think I might have Molluscum Cantangiosum but is it common to have it last over a year? I havn't had any relations with anyone since this began...\n\n",

Would sebaceous cysts originate on the penis, then go away and spread elsewhere throughout the body? The bumps remain the size of a pimple, perfectly round with a solid-like white blob inside of them, sometimes the bumps don't even make it that far and they only remain beneath the skin, with a slight bump. I have read online that Molluscum Cantangiosum can be spread sexually, and has round raised bumps with white chessey fluid in them. I am being tested in a week, what is you opinion thus far?

    "title": "Pimples after unprotected sex!!!!",
    "content": "One week a go I had unprotected sex with a girl rumored to not shower often. I am uncircumsized.  The day after sex I noticed some small red spots on the underside of my foreskin and and a few on the head of my penis.  The next day more were on the head of my penis, but the spots dissapeared after 3-4 days.  I diagnosed myself with a mild case of balinitis (sp?).  Also the day after sex I developed 3 pimples (hopefully) on the shaft of my penis.  I think they were infected hair folicules because each pimple had a hair coming out of it.  The pimples behaved exactly like normal pimples, they developed a white head, i poped it, white puss came out followed by a tiny bit of blood, then the next day the whitehead was  back.  I took a bath to soften my skin, and pulled the hairs out of the follicule.  More white puss.  The pimples reduced in size, but today (1 week after sex) they are still there and all three have a small whitehead. I have diagnosed myself with folliculitis. I have applied salycylic acid like i do to pimples on my face.  I am very worried and if they do not go away in the next 3-4 days i will somehow go see a doctor.  Could these symptoms be from my partners possibly-unclean vaginal secreations?  I did not shower or clean up after sex, and i read somewhere that vaginal secreations (especially unclean) if left on the penis can cause mild infection ie; balinitis and folliculitis.  Please tell me what you think, as i am naturally worried about an STD.\n\n",

    "content": "Well just like you this has just happened to me very recently also, how ever unlike you i am circumsized.  Heres my story i just had sex for the first time with this girl and had sex with her twice both unprotected.  After the second time i noticed very tiny pimple like things on the glans (head) of my penis, not the shaft. These pimples on the head of my penis do not feel any pain, nor do they itch. How ever i do itch a lot in my upper thighs, around my anus, buttox, and my legs back chest armpits and arms. But the thing is the parts that mentioned above is from this dog i used to have a couple months back and me and dad were allergic to it i guess because we started itching a lot over our whole body, and my sisters and mom did not.  So i don't know if the itching in my body should be relevant to whether or not i have genital herpes or HPV, because ive done a lot of research and these tiny bumps greatly resemble those symptoms, but the thing is i know this girl has gotten tested before, and she told me she is clean... Yeah she be lying right, well i cant do anything about that.  But my question is what else causes pimples to appear on the glans? Or is it just infections that do?  Hopefully that is no the case.  Please reply thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "I've been looking up as much as I can about if topical antibiotics affect the birth control pill or not. I know that oral antibiotics can make oral contraceptives not work...but do topical antibiotics do the same? Here's my story. I'm taking Yasmin for my oral contraceptive...I take it correctly AT THE SAME TIME every day (10:00 PM sharp). But recently my doctor prescribed me a topical antibiotic called Clindamycin 1% Gel to clear up my skin. I apply a thin layer every morning and wash it off at night. So far it has been working great; my skin has cleared up some. BUT, I worry that it might reduce the effectiveness of the birth control pill. I mean, small amounts of the topical antibiotic are absorbed by the skin and get into the bloodstream, I'm assuming. Anyway, this is driving me insane. PLEASE answer my question.\n\n",

    "content": "Recently, I woke up to find my face, specifically the area around my mouth, covered with acne.  At 20 year's old I get a zit now and then, but I can't ever remember having a break-out this bad (at least 20 pimples) appearing overnight.  I tried to recall anything that might have caused this, and my only guess is that 3 nights prior to the break-out I performed oral sex on a girl.  I'm curious if it is possible that the natural bacteria from her discharge somehow caused my face to explode 3 days later.  Is that possible?  If so, is there anything that I can do besides wash my face?  The pimples are not warts, so I do not suspect herpes, but could the acne possibly be a precursor to a STD?  Any word will be valued.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I was dx'ed with HCV in 8/2001.  Since then, I tried the peg intron tx for 3 months to no avail ending in March of this year due to a very low white count and pneumonia.   Ever since ending tx, I have had bouts of this intense tiredness and body aches that are incapacitating.  I have missed numerous days of work now and I'm in danger of losing my job as a result, but what can I do?   I spoke several times with my gastroenterologist, and he has run tests, but my liver enzymes come back normal, the rheumatism tests normal.  The only thing that comes back abnormal are the thyroid tests, but they are only slightly off and his nurse says it's nothing to be worried about.  But yes I still ache from head to toes.  My fingers even hurt.  I have only experienced these symptoms under the tx on the day after.  I just don't know what to do.  My doctor says to see a psychiatrist, but even my nurse step mother says that that is usually a brush off for when they are baffled and just don't know what else to do.  I wasn't depressed before but now with the fact that I cannot even provide for my children as a result of this, I am beginning to get that way.  They are out of town this weekend and I have come down to the fact that I have 2 options.  I can either somehow find my old psychiatrist who since left his practice or push up a few daisies.  I cannot take this anymore!    People around me just cannot understand what I am faced with now.  I have called other psychiatrists who all tell me that it's almost 2 months until the next appointment.  Alot of good that does me!  Please help if you can.  No one else seems to want to or care.  I am now at my wits end.  I have no more fight... Susan\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for your response time...I guess I need to hear what I can quickly.  It's 7:30pm and the kids are gone.  Last chance for me here I guess.  I couldn't make contact with the doctor I used to see for my bipolar.   I'm not sure exactly what the tests were.  All I know is that my doctor always did a cbc, i believe it's called tsh and the extended cbc that shows my liver enzymes and such.  I was also told that there is a test that shows if there is any inflammation in your body.  All were okay as I said, with the exception of the tsh.  So he did the thyroid panel with all 3 tests (i think it's 3) and it showed that one was like 1 point below what it should be and one was one point above what it should be. Maybe I am going crazy or hypochondria has taken over.  All I know is that I really have lost my will to fight anymore.  It seems like the doctors just don't have the time to take and they are most certainly not concerned about whether I keep my job.  That is until I have no insurance and can't pay of course.  Please don't take this as an insult to you.  It's not.  I think what you do here is beyond honorable...it's literally angelic for some of us, but my experience thus far has been bad and I'm afraid I can't wait any longer.  My children will be without lights and food by the time they decide that I am even worthy of a doctor's note.  They act as if I'm lying!  I am just repulsed at this point. Please reply...even if it makes no sense.  I am depending on some kind of miracle.  I certainly need one.  I wish I could go to sleep and not wake up at this point.  It's quite a bizarre junction when you don't have the courage to take your own life even with the means and plan, but yet you don't have the courage to go on.  I am looking for the courage to do something whether it be one or the other tonight. Susan[/b]\n\n",

    "content": "Hello again, Susan rest assured that what you are going through makes a lot of sense. There are many obvious causes to what you are experiencing. First it's good that your doctors have excluded the so called organic causes for your fatigue. Thus one is left with the fact that your fatigue is a symptom of your depression. That is a viable possibility. The possiblity is that you may need your medication dose changed. In my opinion its the suicidal thoughts that are more revealing in your case. Have a look at this article at The Doctors Louge that links lexapro to suicidal behaviour and thoughts.  In my opinion you should consult a psychiatrist for a change in the type of antidepressant you are taking. You need to do this as urgently as possible. You see, Susan you are not to blame for any of the complaints you are experiencing.  Best regards and please keep us posted.\n\n",

    "content": "First i'd like to say God Bless you doctors who have given your advice for free you will all be blessed.   I posted a medical ? before and I received response. Since then i had an umbilical hernia repair. Which was needed.  my new cocern is one that my gp tells me not to worry about however sice it has reoccured i am a bit concerned. It's probably because i am a hypochondriac. But here is my dilemma. i noticed a pinkish sore on my penis it looks like this at times .                                              :  yes the dots are my demonstation, when i went to my gp he said it does not look like any kind of std to put neosporin on it. when i first saw it i put calomine lotion on it thinking it was a rash. the same thing appeared a month later but on a different part of the shaft of my penis. blood tests were run all is normal. i been with the same partner she is the mother of my children however there was a point a couple of months ago that she developed a bacterial infection that cleared up with a gel called vagogel or something of that nature paps revealed nothing wrong and she was clear.   This started after she had an abortion she was told no sex for 3-4 weeks of course the week on the third week we  became sexually active again. and thats when this all started for me that is. i had an umbilical surgery and afterwards i was unable to produce good bowel movements which was normal because of the nature of the surgery. But i did have excessive urination not that i had to go every five minutes but when i did go i could probably fill 3 8 oz cups. what could these pink little things be i am really concerned and have been thinking the worse. at times i feel a little tinglle in my penis but thats usualy when i have to urinate and then after i urinate i feel a little discomfort as if i had a minor burn i drank alot of cranberry juice and since then the irritated feeling has subsided. but the major concern to me is the pink dots that continue to occur my father says he has had this he is not circumsized however i am. is this normal?\n\n",

Since your doctor has seen the dots and did not think much of them and you are still concerned, i would recommend that you see a dermatologist.  If the infection that your wife had was a fungal infection, this could also be a fungal infection (not bacterial), the dermatologist has a certain lamp that he/she can use to see whether this is a certain type of fungal infection or not.

The groin area got red and streaks began to run down my thigh!   I have no insurance and this scared me so I went to a local 24 hour walkin. The Dr there said she had no clue, checked my vagina(!) as she thought it may be vd related (thanks) but she said there was nothing amiss there. She gave me strong antibiotics and sent me on my way.  They worked after a while,  the streak looked like a bruise for a week or two more. Nodes went down but I remained tired. I started feeling well again and returned to the gym after almost 4 weeks in bed! Then it jumped to the other side of my groin, not huge or streaking , just painful knots. Whenever I feel fatigue now my groin nodes drive me crazy! I feel so tired I cant stand it!  Any thoughts?\n\n",

    "title": "Re:What the heck? Do you know?",
    "content": "Dear Michelle,  From your description, this sure sounds like either an infection or an inflammation.   The function of the lymph nodes is basically defence against spread of infection. This is done by draining areas of the body that are affected by infection and/or inflammation. Each group of lymph nodes in the body drains a specific area. When a lymph node enlarges, this means that there is either:  1. An intrinsic lymphatic disease in the lymph nodes and this will most probably affect more than one group of lymph nodes.  2. An infection or an inflammation in the area drained by this group of lymph nodes.  The groin lymph nodes drain lower limb, external genitalia and the lower anterior abdominal wall.  If your lower extremity joint problem is still going on, this might be the culprit. Sometimes, infection in the joint is difficult to treat and becomes chronic giving you all these symptoms of feeling tired and fatigued all the time. Your joints have to be looked at as well. Your anterior abdominal wall also has to be looked at for any infection even it looks so trivial.  i would recommend that you see the doctor once more to have a look at your lower limbs including your joints and your abdominal wall.  An examination of the lymph nodes all over the body should also be done to make sure that this is not a case of generalized lymphadenopathy which means that the causes will be totally different.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, There is definitely no replacing a direct physical examination in this situation and what I am about to say here would be purely speculative.  In medical dilemmas such as the one your girlfriend is facing, some symptoms stand out more than others as possible clues to a diagnosis. Protein in urine is a very significant finding. There are well established protocols for diagnosis of diseases that cause proteinuria. At first glance it seems the most sensible approach. What exactly do you mean by proteins in urine? Was this a simple urine test or did she have a 24 hour urine evaluation?  Next comes the low grade fever. Again there are protocols for management of cases known as fever of unknown origin. I would take that approach if the proteinuria seemed like a dead end or seemed to be part of a disease process thats larger than itself.  Multisystem involvement in females usually point to the possibility of autoimmune and connective tissue disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosis.\n\n",

    "content": "Let me tell you my story, back in December 2003, I was a thriving student in college, I was changing careers from a Network Engineer. I had a boyfriend that came down with a terrible illness that put him in bed for a week. We thought it was the flu. After he felt better, we engaged in kissing, etc. A few days later he told me it was strep throat.  I shortly after began having a bad bad sore throat, and began having fever. Myself being in school, and being a single parent I had no insurance so I did not go to the doctor. I treated and dealt with it the best I could. This lasted about 2-3 weeks. Once I felt better I continued with my daily activites. A few weeks later I got so sick I thought I was going to die. My fever was so high, I sweated and 2 seconds later I got bad chills. My joints hurt like a pain I had never felt before in my life, the worst part was the base of the back of my head hurt so bad I could barely move my head. I thought it was the flu, so I waited a few days to try and let it run it's course. 3-4 days went by and still with no medical insurance, I knew I had to foot a doctor bill, because I hurt so bad. I went into the doctors office, and he did a flu test which came up negative, he sent me home with some antibiotics, and I later recovered.  Here's my problems, I had a very high IQ and prided myself on being intelligent. Now ever since my illness of unknown origion, I am contanstly confused, I can't make a decision on anything to save my life, even as simple as whether to make a turn or go straight. I forget things as soon as they were told to me, my short term memory is rediculous, and my attention span switches like a childs. I used to ahve a 4.0 grade average, now I have dropped out of school. I want to go abck to my networking job, but I can't seem to retain any information after studying. PLEASE HELP ME, what do I do? Why is this happening to me?????? HELP ME PLEASE, I feel like I'm going crazy and I am only 26 years old.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It seems that you just recovered from a serious infection. I am glad that your doing fine and your decision to go the doctor was a smart one. Its normal after such a serious illness to be a bit 'out of shape' in many aspects. Its common to be confused during and after a febrile illness. For someone of your intelligence that would be a very scary thing. I understand that its been some time now since you were ill; however, it seems that you carried the fear with you. Human intelligence is a very vulnerable thing and can easily be affected by lack of confidence, fear etc.. I think you need to be more confident in your intelectual abilities and pass this phase.  What did your doctor say his diagnosis was? It seems unlikely that he gave you an antibiotic without reaching a diagnosis. The pain at the back of your neck could have been an attack of meningitis. What antibiotic was perscribed? I think you should also give your doctor a call and ask him if he thought it could have been an attack of meningitis?  Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "I consider myself a very healthy 26 year old non-smoker.  I am currently on birth control, and that is the only medication I take regularly.    However, ever since I was a child, I have contracted strep throat nearly every year.  At worst, my symptoms include fever, headache, difficulty swallowing, puffy red throat with lots of pussy white spots.  Z-packs usually do the trick, but certain forms of penicillin make me very queasy.   Many times during the year, especially when I don't get enough sleep, I will wake with a sore throat and have somewhat drier white, round things in my throat that dislodge themselves when I cough really hard or use a cotten swab and remove them myself.  When they are gone, the sore throat goes away.  I don't see the doctor about these incidences.  Do I have some sort of chronic sickness?  What treatments might be available?  Should I consider having my tonsils removed?\n\n",

I'll just toss this out there for some help - I'm a healthy teenager, I don't smoke or drink, and as this probably relates, I'm a virgin. um, I've noticed that very recently there has been blood in my semen - its very noticeable, the semen which was previously healthy and white is now dark red. Also, shortly after that, there has developed a long rash on the underside of my 'penis stem,' or whatever you want to call it. The only thing I can think of is that I've recently begun the antibiotic Doryx - however, this is not a side effect listed.

It may indicate a problem within the urethra, testicles, epididymis, or prostate.  Blood in the semen is usually the result of inflammation of the seminal vesicles. If your ejaculate is persistently stained with blood, the following tests should be done: urinalysis and culture, semen analysis and culture, and ultrasound of the seminal vesicles.  James, why were you put on Doryx? You should call your doctor as soon as possible.\n\n",

    "content": "Alice, Thanks for dropping by! Vaginal candidiasis as far as I know cannot be transmitted by swimming. It can be transmitted by sexual intercourse. The chlorine in swimming pools could lead to vaginal irritation encouraging the development of candida infection. Infections that can be acquired by swimming include: trichomonas, cryptosporidum and some forms of tinea among others.  About 5 percent of women with vaginal yeast infections develop recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC), which is defined as four or more vaginal yeast infections in a one-year period. Although RVVC is more common in women who have diabetes or weakened immune systems, most women with RVVC have no underlying medical illness that would predispose them to recurrent Candida infections. Medical experts still are trying to determine the most effective way to treat RVVC. Currently, most doctors treat this problem with two weeks of oral medication (fluconazole), followed by up to six months of a lower maintenance dose.\n\n",

    "content": "Alice, I understand your concern for others and that in is admirable and rare to find these days. I disagree with you that you are correct not to swim.  Let me first concentrate on what you can do for your tinea:  Preventive measures      Good personal hygiene helps to prevent and treat athlete's foot.      Anti-fungal powders may be used as a preventive measure if a person is susceptible to athlete's foot.    Drying the feet thoroughly after bathing or swimming has been shown to be the best means to    prevent the disorder.    Avoid socks made of synthetic materials, because they can retain moisture against the skin.      Change the socks as frequently as needed to keep the feet dry on a daily basis. Shoes should be well    ventilated and preferably of natural material such as leather, if feet perspire greatly.     Dry your toes thoroughly after bath and try to spend time with bare feet when you can.      Wear sandals or shoes when walking on moist or wet floors.      Don't share shoes or personal care items such as towels.   Second: It's commonly believed that tinea is highly contagious -- that it is easily contracted by walking barefoot in a locker room, for example. This is not true. Medical experiments, in which the objective has been to infect healthy skin with tinea, have failed; often one may have it without infecting others in the same living space.  Third: Here's a very practical solution that will allow you to swim without in the least bit being worried about infecting others:  - After cleaning and drying your feet thoroughly, place antifungal powder on your toes.  - Get yourself a pair of aqua socks or aqua shoes (also known as water shoes) like the ones used in snorkelling and wear them on. They are probably more protective than the shoes you are wearing everyday walking around your own house etc..  Have a look at them here: Aqua socks  Please note that we are in no way affiliated with this website and do not recommend you buy their product in particular.  - After you finish swimming take them off, wash and dry your feet then apply antifungal powder again.  Happy swimming!\n\n",

    "content": "Common causes of acute tonsillitis may include: \u00b7 bacteria, such as streptoccal or hemophilus bacteria \u00b7 viruses such as adenovirus or Epstein-Barr virus, which also causes mononucleosis \u00b7 diphtheria, a serious disease that produces a false membrane in the throat. Diphtheria can be prevented by the DPT vaccine.  Subacute tonsillitis is most commonly caused by actinomyces, a normal mouth bacterium that can cause infection.   In chronic tonsillitis, there is a long-standing infection that is almost always bacterial.   Usually, no significant long-term effects result from any of the three forms of tonsillitis. However, difficulty swallowing or breathing during sleep can result if the chronic infection causes enlargement of the tonsils. The healthcare provider may recommend a tonsillectomy, or removal of the tonsils, if there are recurrent infections or difficulties with swallowing and breathing.  In cases of chronic tonsillitis, antibiotics combined with oral steroids may resolve the infection. If not, the tonsils should be removed.   Tonsillectomy may be recommended by the healthcare provider if the person has had:   \u00b7 3 to 5 bacterial infections of the tonsils within 3 to 5 years  \u00b7 more than 6 episodes of tonsillitis in one year  \u00b7 chronic tonsillitis, or infection of the tonsils, that does not respond to antibiotics  \u00b7 enlargement of the tonsils that causes sleep apnea, a breathing disorder that occurs during sleep  \u00b7 enlargement of the tonsils that causes difficulty swallowing, especially in children\n\n",

    "title": "Chronic sore throat and abnormal growths",
    "content": "I have been having a mild to severe sore throat 90% of the time for about 8 weeks now.  No fever.  I also have noticed that my left tonsil has what appears to be a lump or growth at the back of it 1-2 cm long.  The right tonsil is frequently irritated but does not have a lump.  Also above the left tonsil in I guess is the soft palate area I have a growth that appears to be pus filled, it has a white spot on it.  It is less than 1 cm at this time.  I also will have pain that radiates from the back of my throat to my left ear on occassion.  I also have been having problems with my jaw popping on that side much more frequently in the last 4-6 months.    I went to the doctor and they just said maybe it was an infection and put me on amoxicillin.  The amoxicillin has not made any of my symptoms go away, and I am through with the dosage.  I cannot decide if I should go back to a doctor or if I'm just being over concerned?  After all, my chief complaint is only the recurring sore throat.    My other question is do I go to my primary care again or go to an ENT?  My insurance co-pay is the same regardless of whether I go to a regular primary-care type doctor or make an appointment with an ENT.  I do not have to have referrals with my insurance plan.  Should I skip going to the primary care doctor again and go straight to the ENT since the primary care I question whether they know what it could be?  Or will be able to pin point it quickly?  I am not rich and can't be paying the co-pay for a visit every few weeks while it is determined what I may have.    I would appreciate another doctor(s) input on the topic or theories.  What can these signs/symptoms mean?  Should I even be concerned?  Which doctor should I visit next?  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Wushock,  Chronic sore throat is not normal. Your sinuses should be checked. Since, amoxillin did not work, i will assume that the cause of your sore throat is either not a bacteria, an unusual bacteria that is not susceptible to amoxicillin or may be you have an abcess that needs to be drained. Since viral infections do not last that long, most probably this is not a viral infection.  i would suggest that you should see an ent doctor really soon and have a biopsy done of your throat and of the lesions.

    "content": "Hi,  I was bitten on the inside thigh in 1998 in Thailand by what I think was a mosquito. As it was right where my shorts rub my thigh the bite was constantly aggravated and got to be pretty big, red and angry. It stayed that way for a year until I got back to a cooler climate. Since then however if i scratch the bite site accidentally it still itches and i can see a bump is still there looking like a nettle sting. Is this normal for aggravated mosquito bites or is it likely to have been a different insect? Is there anything I can do about it?   I realise it's not a big deal but 5+ years is a long time to be bothered by a mosquito bite!  Thanks, Duncan\n\n",

    "content": "My 1-year-old son had a stomach virus last week with spiking temps and he ended up dehydrating and needed to be hospitalized for a night for IV fluids.  He seemed to recover from that... but on the day of discharge he started what appeared to be a URI with cough and runny nose.  I took him to the pediatrician yesterday (after 4 days of a cough/runny nose), and they checked him and looked at his ears and told me he was fine, although his oxygen saturation was only at 94%.  Now the question is this, is it possible to develop an ear infection later the same day he was checked, or maybe the DR did not see it?  I ask this because my son was up ALL night and he is spiking another temp of 101.6 (via ear).  I have already placed another call to my pediatrician, I'm awaiting a call back.  Just curious if he could have developed an ear infection in that short of time?  Or could it be something else? Also, his runny nose has now changed from clear to green.  Thank you!!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear anj128,  If you take the temperature through the ear and it comes out high, this does not mean that the ear temperature is high and thus the patient has an ear infection, it means that the whole body temperature is high which could be because of the cold that your son has.  If this was not your question then i misunderstood you.   How fast can an ear infection develop? Infections are usually fast to develop, may be over one or two days, so, to develop an ear infection over a couple of hours is difficult. Could the doctor have missed it? i guess he could.   The symptom that usually point to ear infections in infants or children is the child pulling at his/her ear and if knows how to express pain by a word, he/she would do so because it is very painful as this infection is under pressure in a closed small space (the ear).

    "title": "Re: Calcified granulomas",
    "content": "Dear Moomom,  If this calcified granuloma has not grown bigger over the last 3-4 years as evidenced on the regular follow-up chest x-rays (that i assume you have been having), then, personally, i think that there is no need to worry and there is no need for a ct scan, mri or lung biopsy. Regarding the possibilty of this being a malignant nodule, to reach a size of 7 cm and left untreated for 3-4 years, it would have caused lots of symptoms and problems if it was malignant, so most probably, this is just a benign granuloma.  Regarding your skin lesions and the lung nodule, as i mentioned earlier in one of the replies to one of your messages, that this is suspicious for sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis is usually diagnosed by clinical picture and confirmed by biopsy, sometimes a biopsy is not even needed if the clinical picture is typical. There are blood tests that could be done and may help in the diagnosis of sarcoidosis if this is suspected from your clinical presentation.

    "content": "Dear Jennifer,  If you have a cold that has caused an inflammation in the membrane surrounding the lungs (a condition called pleurisy) or the membrane surrounding the heart (a condition called pericarditis), this could be the reason behind your symptoms. But also if the air that you are breathing is really cold and i would assume it is at -5, this could also give rise to this symptom. Do you have any other symptom of cold like fever, runny nose, cough, etc... or just this symptom?  If you are having other cold symptoms, this could be a cold. If not then i would assume that this most probably related to breathing cold air.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

Sometimes it is unknown why such membranes get inflammed but the majority of these cases are thought to be caused by viral infections.  Ibuprofen is an anti-inflammaotory which should take care of the inflammation and help the pain, it is not a treatment of the cause, it is a symptomatic treatment.   Regarding your dizziness, if the cold virus affects the ear sometimes dizziness can be a part of the symptoms.

    "content": "I would greatly appreciate any answers that may be provided.   My sister died in 1983.  She had guillian barre.  While in the hospital she came down with meningitis and CMV.  I was told then (20 yrs ago) that CMV is a rare virus that attacks the brain of fetuses (excuse my spelling)?  The hospital told us that they suspected that my sister contracted the virus  in the pediatric ICU unit.  Tho she was 18 yrs. at the time because of space at the hospital she stayed over night in the unit.  Now Im reading that CMV is not all that rare and  that it can lay dormant in the body for years?  Has this just been discovered in the last 20 years or was I misinformed?  In 1981 my sister gave birth to a little girl who suffers from seizure disorders and mental retardation.  Ive read so much lately, Im just wondering if there could be a link?  And almost every article I read mentions the aids virus that my sister did not have.  Ive also read that it can be an std?   They told us that she would be put in medical journals because of her brain scans and other oddeties that went along with her 7 month stay in ICU.    I have recently discovered that the majority of patients with Guillain barre survive.   Looking back it seemed like we were the only people in the world going thru all of this and it all was illnesses that we had never heard of except for the meningitits.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Renea, CMV is indeed a life-long virus that can stay dormant for years. It can cause affection of the fetal brain if infection occurs during intrauterine life. In healthy individuals infection is usually asymptomatic but in some cases it may cause an illness similar to infectious mononucleosis with glandular fever (fever and lymph gland enlargement) & atypical lymphocytes in the blood picture. In immunocompromised patients (transplant patients, AIDS patients), it produces widespread visceral involvement with fever, interstitial pneumonitis (diagnosed by transbronchial biopsy), hepatitis, hemorrhage, gastroenteritis, choroidoretinitis (inflammation of the eye). Guillain Barre is also known as post-infectious polyneuropathy. Was she daignosed to have CMV based on serological testing? As the name indicates the disease usually follows infection. Several viruses are commonly associated with Guillain Barre, HIV being the commonest. Epstein Barr (infectious mononucleosis) is also associated with polyneuropathy.  Use our search box to search for more info on Guillain Barre and CMV.   Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Hi!  Have you tried steroid or any other creams on your face before? There are different causes for Perioral Dermatitis [POD], and steroid use is one of them. Cosmetics, including fluorinated toothpaste, petrolactum or paraffin based skin applications, yeast, bacteria, and fungi have been implicated. Young women are more prone.  As with all inflammatory skin conditions, substances that dilate skin blood vessels should be avoided. Examples include alcohol and hot foods.  Perioral dermatitis can be treated by antibiotics taken orally. If topical (on top of skin) application is preferred, avoid ointments, and use gel, lotion, or cream forms.  Zero-therapy is a treatment based on the idea that, by ceasing all topical medications and cosmetics, the underlying causative factor for POD is eliminated. If one has used steroids before, an initial worsening of symptoms may occur with this stop of steroids, which is only to be anticipated.  Hope this helps.  Warm regards,  -Bill\n\n",

As for the bumps on your buttocks, some antihistamines should help the itchyness, while it would be good practice to see if helminthic infestations could be behind the scenes.   A visit to your doctor might be more revealing, and finding ova of parasites near the anal region may confirm the presence of worms inside your intestines. Once confirmed there are once-a-day medicines to cure oneself of the infestation.  I could be very well wrong, but as I always mention, there is no substitute for a clinical examination.  Hope this helps.  Warm regards,  -Bill\n\n",

    "content": "Farmerman, I cannot tell for sure what your diagnosis would be. It appears possible that you do have a penile wart and that may be caused by a HPV (human papilloma virus) infection. The point is that It may not become clinically clear until several months after inoculation with HPV. A solitary pimple probably does not warrant alarm. Only when there is number erupting in patches like a rough cauliflower.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  Dryness of vagina usually occurs after menopause. Otherwise, It can occur due to hormonal imbalances, infection of the vagina (vaginitis),  as well as part of an STD, but I do not believe it could be due to any contraceptive usage. If the vaginal dryness is felt particularly before having sex, then lack of a foreplay is to be blamed.  As a self-help guide, you might want to try a sitz bath in slightly salty water with half a cup of vinegar added. Yoghurt douching to vagina helps some.   The best insurance against infection is to wash vulva daily with plain water - no soap or bath salts - and avoid vaginal deodorants and medicated douches. Underwear should be changed daily, and sanitary towels and tampons every 6 hours at least.  A pap smear is a screening test for the early diagnosis of cervical cancer. It will not help to diagnose the cause of vaginal dryness. If there is vaginal discharge, a smear examination might clinch the cause.  Hope this helps.  Warm regards,  - Bill\n\n",

    "title": "flu or ?",
    "content": "First and foremost, thank you for this forum - It has been two days, and my doctor's office has yet to return my call, so I am searching elsewhere for advice. ( I have called them more than once, and was informed  that the doctor has not given an answer as to whether I need to come in, stay home, or ignore this and it will go away)  .  Here is the situation -  Since Thursday of last week, I have been running a slight fever (temperature) ranging from 99.0 to 99.8.  This has yet to break.  The other symptoms that I have been experiencing are dizzyness and lightheadedness, slight to midrange headache, mild to severe nausea, fatigue, and diarrea.    After 7 days of this, I am becoming quite frustrated.  I have ingested fluids as best I can (water, watered down 50/50 apple juice, Tylenol when headaches get painful, and considerable bedrest).  I do not feel ill enough to go to emergency, and thereby detracting from those that truly need emergency care.   After some research, I located information that there has indeed been cases reported in my very rural county of WNF in animals (vet report - 7) and one human.  Yes, we have mosquitoes here,  there is a slow moving creek behind my property - and yes, I have been bitten on more than one occaision.  My animals (horses and donkey) have all been vaccinated, my dogs and goose are okay, and I have not seen any dead birds, or if there were any, the stray cats and or coyotes in the area have eaten them.   I need something to tell my employer, as I have missed 4 work days now - other than saying I have a 'mild flu' I have nothing else to go on. Okay - apologies for rambling, blame this upon frustration.  If anyone has any suggestions, short of camping out in the doctor's waiting room, please advise!!  Thanks again, Baroness Catrina Von Luftmensch, of the Texas Musketeers. Johnson County, Tx\n\n",

    "content": "update - went to a doctor that fit me in on Friday - he gave me a 3 day series of Levoquin, and this had no effect.  I called Monday and returned today to his office today.  This is day 13, and still no change, still fever, nausea, dizzy, headache, etc....  He brought up the subject of West Nile, stating that his brother had contracted it (in Kansas).  Took blood tests today to see if this is a virus, (they should be back in 7 days) and prescribed an antibiotic that I am allergic to - Azithromycin, labeled as Zithromax - it clearly states so on my file that I am allergic to all 'mycin' drugs.  When I realized what the antibiotic was, I took it to his office, and brought it to their attention.  I was then put on Omnicef, which when I got home I looked it up online as the samples had no information with them.  I found out that I might have a severe reaction to this drug as well, as I am allergic to Penicillin and have mild ulcerative colitis.  Is this doctor trying to kill me or cure me? Any advice would be appreciated,  Thanks Cat\n\n",

West Nile Virus  I would like to draw your attention that WNV is a viral infection and as you well know viruses are not treated with antibiotics. What your physician is doing is giving you an emperic antibiotic in case you have a bacterial infection.  Its good that you have had your samples taken. The question is what samples were taken? Are they just testing for the presence of WNV or is this a full bacterial culture as well?  I would also like you to take a look at this page which analyses the possible causes of fever.  Fevers  West Nile Virus should definetly be considered along with the list provided.  Best wishes.\n\n",

After I appraised of the last few days of diagnosis from the other physician she immediately took me off the Omnicef - told me not to take another dose - She said I should not be taking this medication. I am presuming I should never have been given it in the first place due to my penicillian allergy and mild colitis - Omnicef has been know to cause colitis.  She did not appear very happy that I had been given the other antibiotic, either, without the lab tests first to determine if this is viral or bacterial.  She ordered more blood tests, a urine test (bacteral culture) as well as a chest xray just for extra measure.  The stool sample is being drooped off this am.  Will let you know the results as soon as I get the lab tests back.   Have a great day, Cat\n\n",

There are several conditions that can cause fever with rash and possibly orchitis (inflammation of the testicles). Measles, Mumps, salmonella, brucellosis, Q-fever are just a few of the conditions that can cause this. Where are you located? This may give an indication of the causative agent. Please tell me more about the character of the fever? Has Rocky Mountain Spotted fever been considered? Has he been bitten by a tick recently?  A good idea would be to consult an infectious disease specialist.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Pamnub, I have reviewed the pictures you have sent. Your sister has a severe form of cellulitis by the looks of things. There maybe also multiple subcutaneous abscesses. You say her blood sugar is normal? Has she done a complete blood count? Regardless of the underlying cause the infection your sister has should be treated immediately. First a pus sample needs to be taken and cultured to know which is the most appropriate antibiotic. Once the antibiotic is given and the symptoms start to reside, a search for a cause should be sought. A battery of investigations will be ordered depending on the causative organisms but will probably include a search for diseases that cause a decrease in the immunity, taking into account that she has rheumatoid arthritis. Lymphedema if present as well should prompt a search for a cause as well. Lymphedema is not treated by exercise.  So to recap, lets start with a culture and sensitivity test for the pus, her consultant may like to start her on an emperic antibiotic while the results of the C&S come in from the lab.   Methadone is an analgesic it should not be related to her condition.\n\n",

    "content": "Herpes zoster, also known as shingles or zoster, is a viral infection caused by the same virus that causes chicken pox (varicella-zoster virus). In general anyone who's had chicken pox can develop herpes zoster. The virus remains dormant (latent) in certain nerve root ganglions and under any circumstances that weaken the immune system the virus reactivates, multiplies and moves along nerve fibers towards the skin leading to the typical picture of herpes zoster (tingling, burning pain, vesicles, etc) Actually, we can say that yes herpes zoster can occur in people who have never had a history of a typical attack of chicken pox. Meaning that after the development of chickenpox (varicella) vaccine which is life attenuated vaccine, almost 90% of those who have received the vaccine develop long term immunity and are protected. In some cases, however, the vaccine may only weaken the disease. Therefore, it's possible to develop chickenpox even if you've received the vaccine however, the infection is usually mild, atypical and passed undiagnosed. Children, or those receiving the vaccine may only develop a few pox sores at the site of the vaccination. Although these people are protected from the severe form of chicken box they can still get this mild form. This is a possible explanation how someone with no history of typical attack of chicken pox develop zoster later in life when the immune system is compromised.  The virus that causes zoster (if blisters are broken) can only be passed on to others who have not had chicken pox and then they will develop chicken pox, not zoster. Zoster is much less contagious than chicken pox.   Best regards,\n\n",

I live in Canada, and we have had a scare about BSE (otherwise known as 'mad cow disease') i don't know too much about it. But my question is how long does it take for the primary symptoms (Such as anxiety, depression etc.) to start to show? The only reason i'm asking is because i had meat about 3 days ago, and that night i was feeling like crap. I couldn't sleep, could hardley breathe and felt anxious (I'd say about 3 hours later) When i finally fell asleep, i got up and my chest was in pain and i had headaches and oculdn't concentrate all that well. I went to the hospital and they did x-rays and hooked me up to the electo-cardiogram, and said they couldn't find anything wrong with me - but i told them about my symptoms aand the doctor said it could be anxiety.  So, if anyone knows...how long does it take for symptoms to start to show, especially the latter (like the heartbeat, headaches, low concentration, eyes hurting and tingling) And could it just be an anxiety disorder?[/b]\n\n",

    "content": "BSE (BOVINE SPONGIFORM ENCEPHALOPATHY) belongs to a family of diseases known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). TSEs characteristically have prolonged incubation periods and are always fatal. Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) is the TSE that affects humans and has been linked to BSE.  So humans get infected with vCJD, BSE is affects animals.   To answer your question:   The incubation time of the disease is dependent upon the type of CJD. For people with sporadic and familial CJD the incubation time is believed to be as long as 20 years. The incubation period for acquired CJD varies depending on the portal of entry of the infectious prion protein. Intracerebral infection may have an incubation period as short as a couple of months, whereas peripheral infection may have an incubation time that ranges from a few years to decades.   The initial symptoms are subtle with ambiguous symptoms of insomnia, depression, confusion, and strange physical sensations. Some problems with memory, coordination, and sight also begin to develop but are ignored as a sign of increasing age.  As the disease progresses, the initial symptoms worsen quickly and the patient develops a rapidly, progressive dementia. Involuntary and irregular jerking movements, known as myoclonus, also develop.  During the final stage of the disease, the patient may go blind, lose the ability to speak, and lapses into a coma. The bedridden patient usually succumbs to death through a secondary infection such as pneumonia. The duration of the illness can last from as short as several months to as long as two or more years.  Several symptoms of CJD can be compared to those of other neurological disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s or Huntington\u2019s disease. In fact as many as 13% of Alzheimer patients were found upon autopsy to have actually had CJD.  Again this means you can't eat meat and get sick in the next couple of days. It seems to be only anxiety if your check up turned out fine.\n\n",

    "content": "No offense but I would just like to correct the article which said that the Philippines was among the countries included in the outbreak of SARS. Until 2 weeks ago, the first ever case of SARs in the country was a Filipina who came from Canada, ( she was a nursing attendant) who came to visit her father diagnosed with terminal colon cancer. Incidentally, this overseas F  ilipino worker infected her father hence the first ever local case was the father. Close contacts of these deceased Filipinos had been quarantined and so far they were cleared. There were suspected cases of SARS but they were from countries hit by the outbreak like Hong Kong and Canada. To date, no other local cases were diagnosed as SARS therefore the Philippines should not be included in the list of countries hit with the outbreak.\n\n",

Does this also mean I am immune to Shingles?  Currently a family member has shingles and although I hear it's not \"contagious\", can't you still contract chicken pox because it's all from the same Varicella virus?  Where does my blood test fit in to all of this?    Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "i m really not sure which blood tests are u talking about.right now i can recollect the following blood tests:  *Complete blood count (CBC) may show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC), a nonspecific sign of infection.  *Rise in antibody to the virus.   if its some other,please mention it.but none of the above tests are specific for varicella virus.   Chickenpox and shingles are caused by the same virus &#8212; varicella-zoster. When a person, usually a child, is first exposed to the varicella-zoster virus, he or she develops chickenpox, a highly contagious disease. Most of us catch it during childhood because the virus can be spread through air as well as through contact with the rash. The infection begins in the upper respiratory tract where the virus reproduces over a period of 15 days or more (the incubation period). The virus then spreads to the bloodstream and migrates to the skin, giving rise to the familiar rash.    in some cases some of the virus particles leave the skin blisters and move into the nervous system. There the viruses settle down in an inactive (latent) form inside specific nerve cells.When the chickenpox virus reactivates, the virus moves down the long nerve fibers that extend from the sensory cell bodies to the skin. The viruses multiply, the telltale rash erupts, and the person now has herpes zoster, or shingles.  Contact with a person with shingles may cause chickenpox (but not shingles) in someone who has never had chickenpox before.    forget about blood tests for a moment.fact is u havent had chicken pox till now.so u are a risk.this is not to scare u but u should always be on the safer side,right?though it is not contagious,try avoiding direct or indirect contact with the lesions of ur relative who is having shingles till the disease subsides.  regards Dr Amit Rajput\n\n",

    "content": "dear merilyn,               i would try to explain few things which might be of help to u.HPV is a type of virus (Human papillomavirus) that causes warts. A few types cause warts on hands and feet but many other types cause warts on the genitals (sex organs or private parts).u didnt specify where exactly u have warts.      anyway,the most common way to get it is by having sex or touching the genitals of someone who already has the infection. Rarely, people can be born with the infection or children can get it while being bathed or changed. Sometimes people become infected with HPV and the warts will not develop for many years.      Condoms (rubbers) may help to slow its spread. If you have had sex with another person many times, they are probably already infected.       If you are a woman with genital warts, you should have a Pap smear every year to rule out cervical cancer which is found related to HPV.            well to b frank  i havent treated a wart patient yet but i can comment on treatment modalities which are commonly used:            One way is putting chemicals such as Podophyllin, Condylox, or trichloroacetic acid on the wart to kill and dissolve it. Another is to freeze them off. The warts can also be cut off using electric loops, lasers, or surgery. The medicine Aldara can activate your immune system to kill the wart cells. You should never use over the counter cures for warts near the sex organs because they can cause severe irritation. These treatments will get rid of the warts but you may not ever get rid of HPV itself. The virus may still be inside and may cause more warts in the future. This is why it may take a long time to cure genital warts. Always talk to your doctor about your treatment and make sure you understand what to do and when to come back.       i hope that answers most of your questions.if any queries,feel fre to comment.\n\n",
