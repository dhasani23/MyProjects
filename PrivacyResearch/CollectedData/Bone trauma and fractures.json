    "content": "Hello, Consider a few weeks of physical therapy to restore normal painful functional (sport) activity.  Rest is good but only to a certain extend.  If there are deficits in balance, muscle strength, muscle length/tension relationships and range of motion, then rehabilitation will correct those.  It is also important to do some cross training.  Swimming for example is a good balancer for running.  Same for cycling - works the leg muscles in a different fasion - i.e. if you tend to sprint on the field or much start and stop motions, cycling provides endurance and strength for both the anaerobic and aerobic muscle fibers respectively.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 21 year old male as indicated by my username who is also indebted to our healthcare system for almost 5 thousand dollars (my insurance plan holder dropped me without any notification @ the worst possible timing) thus I have no money.  I have an untreated orbital fracture (eye socket; its pretty bad by the feel of it) in addition to my severly inflamed elbow bursa (which was origionally septic). I have been refused adequate pain releif in the case of my elbow bursitis thus my dear friend has taken the liberty of ordering me some 30mg IR dihydrocodeine tablets from a land far away. This drug is 4x weaker than hydrocodone, which is what I would have expected to be prescribed considering my level of pain during my ER visit and orthopedic consultation (which I cannot follow up on due to money), & have always been prescribed when in such pain following such an injury. I'd rather go with the \"devils harvest\"; reefer, pot, dope, weed, mary jane (lmao); on this one but cannot aquire enough on my budget to make a tincture (extract) or even brownies (not much of a smoker), plus its illegal for some odd reason.  Anyways down to the point. I have taken every NSAID under the sun to decrease inflamation (anyone that knows anything about pain releif knows NSAIDs suck for pain releif) but to no avail. I have read how doctors go about treating such injuries, and I am about to take matters into my own hands & drain the fluid myself after sterilizing the area and inserting a needle to allow for drainage.  Please advise me on this\n\n",

    "title": "Leg pain caused by untreated fracture?",
    "content": "Hi, I have extreme pain on the outside of my lower calf on my right leg when I rollerskate or sometimes when I run or do other athletic things. It feels like the outer side of my calf is burning... but really bad burning (and the worst pain is between the ankle and about halfway up the calf). It's so bad I usually have to stop what I'm doing because it feels like it \"freezes\" from the pain. For a long time I thought it was because I have flat feet, but then I thought it was an overuse injury, so I stopped skating for almost a year. Yesterday I went out for a quick skate (to get back into it) and realized the pain was just as bad as it had been, if not worse. I had never thought about it before, but for some reason this time I remembered an x-ray that was taken of my ankle in 2007 (http://katsby.com/images/ankle.jpg). My PCP said there was a fracture on my ankle, but I didn't think much of it at the time because I figured it had already \"healed\" on its own. Now I'm learning more about avulsion fractures and bone fragments and the chronic problems they can cause. Could this be the cause of my calf pain?  Additional Information:   I am a 27 y/o female. I played roller derby for 3.5 years, but had to quit eventually due to pain preventing me from being able to make it through whole practices.  Normal activities, i.e. walking, don't hurt usually (or noticeably?), but there are days when that area of my calf hurts (especially if I walk a lot that day). Sometimes the foot on that same leg hurts while I'm walking, like it's not landing right or doesn't want to bear weight, especially when pushing off with that foot.  I went to an orthopedic for \u201cshin splints\u201d but he told me he couldn't see anything wrong with my shins and I just needed to stretch more. I never thought the ankle fracture/fragment could be related, so I never told him about it.  I don't remember any one particularly traumatic event (i.e. car accident, specific notable injury) that would explain the fracture, but I have had several (at least four big ones come to mind) SEVERE ankle sprains in my life that resulted in being unable to bear any weight for a period of 3-8 days at a time.\n\n",

As long as the fracture heals well over the next 4-6 weeks, you could expect return to regular activities soon afterward.  Take care.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: osgood schlatters disease .....",
    "content": "Hello, The quadriceps muscle (big muscle on top of the thigh) attaches to the tibia (large leg bone below the knee) at a site called the tibial tubercle.  Osgood Schlatters is a condition where the tibial tubercle becomes enlarged and the tendon attachment site becomes inflamed.   There is a normal gap in the bone at the tibial tubercle during our early years growth.  Over time this gap should fill in.   Sometimes the gap doesn't fill in - your case.   Alternatively, sometimes the tibial tubercle pulls away from the underlying bone - avulsion fracture.    In either case, since there is a gap in the bone at the tibial tubercle and you have great pain, you ought to consult an orthopedic surgeon who may need to secure the bone and gap with a screw.  Regarding the weird sounds in the knee.  This is likely patella femoral syndrome - a conditioin involving the underlying surface of the knee cap.  It is common to have this condition and Osgood Schlatters at the same time.   Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,   Aproximately 5 days ago I took a spill down 11 stairs.  I was able to catch myself, but ended up at the bottom with my left foot tucked under me.  I thought I was ok until I tried to stand.  My left foot immediately began to swell and bruise.  The next afternoon after soaking the entire foot in buckets of ice I ventured to Urgent Care.  I was told that I broke my big toe in two places, which formed a pie shape.  The doctor thought it may need surgery to repair.  He said, they may need to place a wire in there to help the bones mend.  He wasn't able to tell if there was a stress fracture in the top of the foot or not.  He wanted me to be seen by an orthopedic specialist in 5-7 days.  I am struggling to find anyone that can get me in on that short of notice.   I have been using crutches and icing and elevating the foot all day every day since the accident.  The bruising is pretty intense all over my big toe and my foot is swollen and bruised midway down the foot.  My question is - if I can not get into a specialist would I be doing long term damage to my foot?  Also, is there anyway to tell if there is a stress fracture in the top of the foot without an xray?  I sometimes feel pain in the back of my calf on the side of my big toe and just above my knee cap, is this related?\n\n",

The above knee cap and calf pain may be the result of your change of gait since the injury ...or from the fall itself. If would be beneficial to see an orthopedist early rather than late to fix a displaced first toe fracture. Stress fractures can be detected with bone scan and sometime with a tuning fork however with the other fracture site nearby, detection may be difficult. First take care of the displaced toe fracture.  Take care.\n\n",

If the inflammation persists and you are unable to prevent repetitive aggravation of the tendon, then splinting would be in order.

My surgeon has only discussed limitations during my rehabilitation - do not lift more than 10 lbs, do not ride a lawn tractor, do not bend but squat to pick up items off the floor.  I would like to have some idea what long term limitations I am likely to face - understanding every recovery must be considered for the individual and the degree of rehabilitation experienced.

    "title": "Re: Spinal Fusion and rehabilitation",
    "content": "Hello, The principal behind the lifting restriction are thus:  any weigbt held at arms lengths magnifies the force of strain on the lumbar spine at least 10fold. Therefore limiting not only lifting but carrying would be in order to decrease the stress on the fixed vertebrae site.  The first year is critical to prevent further injury and excessive force on the fixation.  Your therapist will educate you on proper bending, lifting and in general movement mechanics which best decrease strain on the spine.  Manual work load reductions should be expected.  Beside the fixation site, there is ongoing risk of causing mechanic and degenerative problems below the site of fixation.  Since the fusion extends to L3 then L4 and L5 will tend to move more.  So you will need to care extra care of the entire spinal column to prevent damage to the lower segments which will be required to do more movement.  In other words. when the lumbar spine moves, each segment works in sync with the entire lumbar spine.  When three segments are fused, the others take up the slack.   You may discuss these concepts in further detail with the physical therapist.  Take care and all the best to you in rehab.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, a while ago i fel on the stairs and my left hand hit a stair step (looked it up it appeared to be the fifth metacarpal). I felt something snapped in my hand and it hurt. I felt the bone it seemed a V-shape inwards , really felt like it was broken. That side of my hand got swollen and blue and i felt a bump on the bone. So i went to my doctor he said it must be just brused since there was not enough pain when he pressured the bone. Still concerned, i went to another doctor from the same doctorspractise, this doctor didnt seem to take me serious since i was there for the seccond time and was just calming me down , waving it away you know i felt very stupid But now after a month my hand still hurts when i move it, and it had so many symptoms it seemed broken, i just wished i could have it x rayed to get it out of my mind but i don't want to go to a doctor for the third time to ashamed anyone who can help me what to do now?? Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I am 18 years old. I hurt my right ankle on 17th july while getting off from a bus. The doctor took an x-ray and diagnosed it as ankle sprain. He put my leg in a plaster cast and told me to keep it for 3 weeks. Meanwhile, I was told to use crutches. After 5 days, my ankle started hurting badly whenever I try to sit down or walk with the crutches. I don't know if it is because of the heavy plaster. I have tried talking to the doctor but he just kept saying not to take it off before 3 weeks and refuses to listen to me. I need a suggestion badly.\n\n",

    "content": "I recently broke my 5th metatarsal and my orthopedist gave me a walking boot with a rocker bottom and an air pump. Recently, I took the boot off to take a shower after wearing it all day and all night. I noticed the top of my foot, right where the toes meet the foot, has bruising. There are three bruises the size of a pencil eraser on the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th toe. Again, these are right at the base of the toe on the top side. They don't hurt. They were dark purple but after the shower and some elevation afterward the spots faded quickly. They are still present but less pronounced.  My doctor is closed for the weekend so I can't get in touch. I'm wondering if this is bad or normal. Do I have an ill-fitting boot? I don't think so as it is very comfortable. Nothing seems to poke that area of my foot. Is there any danger from this type of bruise, for instance an indication of lack of circulation?\n\n",

As long as the pain and swelling levels are not increasing and there is no warmth in the extremity or fever, then be reassured. You may check the pulses of the feet for proper circulation and also make sure there is no numbness or tingling in the foot - a sign of nerve compression.  To be sure of your condition and your status follow up with your primary physician.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, You will need a family physician or an orthopedist to evaluate the ankle for stability and any evidence of ligament tear.   A complete ligament tear can cause prolonged pain as the under stabilized ankle is subject to inflamation and recurrent sprains and strains. An MRI or CT scan would enhance the assessment of the soft tissue and bony structures respectively.  So, in essence further evaluation is needed to judge the extent of damage in the foot/ankle.  Treatment plan would follow the results.  Take care.\n\n",

The pain isn't very great at the moment, but I sneezed earlier and it felt like someone stabbed me in the back. I am only taking aleve for pain. And only one 220 mg tab every ten hours.

    "title": "Re: are my ribs broken",
    "content": "Hi, It appears from your account that you did receive a fairly severe anteroposterior compression injury to your chest. In such injuries, there is a likelihood of fracture of the ribs. Ribs tend to fracture just in front of their angles (which is a weak spot) which are located at the back of the chest. At times, multiple ribs may fracture at the same time. Rib fractures may be displaced, or undisplaced. They can be associated with serious internal injuries as well (thoracic or abdominal).  An uncomplicated rib fracture presents with severe pain, which is aggravated on movement, coughing or sneezing. As long as there are no internal injuries, fractures or ribs generally heal spontaneously in a few weeks.  You must show to your family doctor at the very least, to exclude any internal injuries. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, You describe a very common scenario for injury (foot, leg, back etc).  A person starts a new exercise program and feels great during the exercise and shortly afterward but within 48 hours suffers a musculoskeletal malady ranging from muscle ache to tendonitis to arthritis.  Or a person starts an exercise program and feels great for two weeks then the third or fourth week bam! the injury occurs - patellar tendonitis, plantar fasciitis, shoulder bursitis. Very common. Depending on where the pain hurts I would suspect the injury you have is tendonitis either in the achilles tendon (heel cord) or plantar fascia (arch of the foot).  Treatment is ice and NSAIDs initially then switch to heat after 72 hours.   Gradually return to activity.   If you have plans to run regularly, start with walking 2-3 miles 3-4 x a week for at least the first couple weeks and a stretching / strengthening program.  This will set you up with a good base to begin running.   Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  In Jan. 2003 I fractured my left fibula at the ankle after rolling it on the ice. Fast forward to Nov. 2008 and I eventually had the hardware removed (all except one pin which was too far in the bone to be removed) no problem at all. In the past few weeks I've started to notice a large bump forming underneath the incision scar  where the initial break was. The bump, visually, is quite noticeable but despite it's cosmetic appearance is causing me no other trouble. The bump is pain free and since the hardware removal in 2008 I've put plenty of miles on the ankle running and playing sports without any problems. I know that its a common part of the healing process for the bone to develop bumps at the fracture site but it seems a bit long after the fact for my ankle to develop a bump at this point.   I'm unsure of the makeup of the bump as it appears the layer just below the skin is made up of soft tissue or fibre which eventually hardens.   I can run fine on it, no pain, full mobility but almost two years after the hardware removal and 7 years after the break should it now be developing a bump? Is it possible the screw that was left behind is now working itself out?  Thanks!\n\n",

Bacteria and foreign bodies can cause granulomas and other times they just develop. Tenderness is not uncommon and surgical exploration and removal are occasionally needed.  I have seen granulomas form around or at incision sites years afterward.   Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "I fell off a curb on June 4, 2010 and thought I had just sprained my ankle (right). I wrapped and put on ice and was careful for about 6 weeks (no x-ray). My ankle kept paining me a little and would stay swollen on the outer part of my foot. I went to my MD and mentioned it to her and she recommended an orthopedist for consultation. He x-rayed and found a small break in the Navicular bone. He has put me in a boot to isolate and not flex my foot. He mentioned the ligament near/around the bone and if I didn't wear the boot I could risk having surgery eventually because the pain would not get better. My question is -- at this late date (I started wearing the boot on Aug 9) how is the boot going to help? I have been walking and wearing normal shoes since the fall, why isolate now? I tried asking the doctor when I saw him, but he was busy and just dashed in and out. Am I wasting my comfort by wearing the boot? I just don't see how this is helping after 2 months since the injury. Thank you.\n\n",

Now my pinky finger is angulated slightly and goes inward overlapping the ring finger a little bit on the side (half the tip of the pinky is covered by the ring finger when making a fist). I have been told by an Orthopedic that a slight malrotation of only the pinky finger is acceptable and rarely performed surgery on. My question is, will this eventually correct itself a little over time and do I need to just get used to it? My pinky finger functions fine it just goes inward a bit and the tip of it rubs against my ring finger when I close my hand. But I'm thinking that this continual rubbing will eventually force the pinky finger to realign and go a little straighter... Thanks so much!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello. For the last three years I have had unbearable pain in my left ankle (I am 17 now and the pain began when I was 14) It was a gradual pain that built up to unbearable pain where I could not walk or stand on my foot. After two years I finally had an operation to remove some extra bone identified in a CT scan. Unfortunately this did not help the problem and if anything has made the problem worse (my foot seems to click more which seems to directly affect the stability of it).  Further scans including xrays, mri and bone scans have identified the injury is in the subtalar joint and as I result my subtalar joint is very stiff and barely moves (my right foot moves fine). The doctor has told me that the only operation available is a subtalar fusion surgery that has a lot of future risks and so has reccommended I: 1) Have steroid injections (I have already had one that allows me to stand on the spot and reduces swelling but does not remove the pain I am feeling) I should not have more then 3. 2) Have insoles put into my shoes to stop movement in my heel 3) Lose weight (I weigh 140kg) until I cannot take it any longer and need surgery despite it's future risks. 4) Take pain killers (They do not help me at all despite being relatively strong) I am already at this point as I haven't been able to walk for three years and I'm not sure what to do next. I can't continue like this and I was wondering if it possible there has been a misdiagnosis? Any advice would be appreciated.  After doing some internet research it seems the problem the doctor is describing is referred to as sinus tarsi syndrome P.S. I've found that after the first surgery my ankle seems to click a lot more. My doctor has explained that it is probably due to scar tissue, but I feel as if the clicking directly affects my ankle stability Thanks in advance.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, From your history, it appears that you had developed a scalp hematoma following the fall. Relatively fresh scalp hematomas, on palpation, often feel as though the skull bone itself is depressed. Such \"true\" depressions of the cranial vault do occur in newborns and infants(\"pond fractures\") as their bones are very thin.  Scalp hematomas (like hematomas elsewhere in the body), organize and then gradually disappear. Small hematomas would generally be expected to have resolved by 6 weeks.Perhaps it was somewhat larger in your case. If there is any associated headache or vomiting, one must report to the doctor urgently. In any case, it may not be a bad idea to visit your family doctor for an assessment. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "The above x-ray was taken 4 weeks ago after I was hit by a car.  It was decided by the ER to not cast the leg (due to the high location of the fracture any cast or boot would end up right about where the fracture was and I also have knee trauma and severe hematomas to both thighs) or set the fracture and the ortho I saw 2 days later confirmed this diagnosis.  I just had x-rays taken (they were not digital so the one above it the original) to take to my ortho next week and they still show after 28 days what appears to be little or no filling in of the gap seen in this picture.  Is this normal or should I be seeing more light or white between the broken ends of the bone after 4 weeks.  The x-ray tech said she didn't know what to expect other than bigger bones take longer to heal.    I am concerned because my PT's both are concerned that the bone was not set and they felt that due to the displacement the fib might not heal properly or at all.  My ortho said that the bone should heal w/o setting or casting when I originally went in and after waiting four weeks but not seeing any bone between the two parts ends of the fracture has be concerned.  What questions should I ask my ortho when I see him next week?  Thanks\n\n",

It is understandable that the fracture was not set as weight bearing should not worsen the alignment.   With a displaced fracture, non union is a concern and over the next few weeks, another radiograph will determine it's likelihood.   Discuss your treatment options with your surgeon including the treatment of non union displaced proximal fibular fracture.  Take care.\n\n",

Also, regional pain syndromes (formally known as RSD) can develop post surgery signified by increased pain, hypersensitivity to light touch and swelling.   Some studies have shown Vitamin C 500-1500mg per day helps help regional pain syndrome post distal limb fracture.  Most likely, the pain is normal for post fracture healing or may signify you are putting too much weight too soon on the area.  More will be revealed after your assessment with the podiatrist * which if available - a sooner appointment is acceptable.  * Make sure the amount of analgesics is sufficient.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "In September 09, I broke my leg in both Tibia and Fibula. Ended up being in hospital for about 6 days before going into surgery when they put a metal pin in the Tibia and this is secured with 2 screws and the top and 2 at the bottom of the Tibia.  I shouldn't really have had to wait 6 days to go into surgery and probably wouldn't be in this situation if I had have to have waited but that's another story and the hospital I was at was rubbish.  Now I have two queries regarding this:  1) Near the top of my leg around the front/side where I have scars from the incisions made for the screws to go in, I can feel what seems like the screw heads. I have never felt around that area after the surgery so don't know if that was there before but more recently I have been getting more pain around that area so I am thinking that maybe the screws are coming loose or something ?  2) The doc says that I can have the pin removed as I am now healed however it should not cause any problems if left in and there are risks if I had it removed such as: infection and damaged bone if the pin has to be hammered out and could be back where I started. I don't really do anything dangerous where it could be broken again however if it is broken again, the consequences could be far worse. I was just wondering what other people have done in this situation and what advice people have to give.  Thanks Sanj\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, This is a situation where you weigh the risk versus benefits of having the hardware removed from the lower leg.  In the least, have an x-ray done to view the screws and plate or pin.  If there is no change, and the skin around the site is healthy, you may leave them.  On the other hand, if the hardware has shifted and causing pain, then consider removal.   You can check with the hospital on their surgical infection rates and see if the surgical suite does only orthopedics (or for example does bowel surgery and orthopedics in the same suite).  You may be able to decrease your risk by having the procedure done in a hospital with low infection rates and specializes in orthopedics.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "About a month and a half ago I sprained my left ankle and since then there has been a bulge under the skin located on the top left side of my left foot, aproximately where the cuboid bone is located [at least according to the diagrams I looked up]. All swelling is completely gone so at first I thought it may have been a small snapped tendon that coiled up, but based on the location of tendons in the area it appears that if this were the case I would not be able to move my toes, which I can do easily and without pain. Walking only causes mild pain, but there is a constant ache and running is out of the question. I don't have health insurance so I'm trying to avoid having to see a doctor at all costs- thus this post- but I'm getting concerned that I may have to.  Is this the sort of injury that just needs more time to heal? Is it likely to get progressively worse if left untreated? I know that many cartilidge and tendon surgeries are very intrusive, so would it even be advisable to seek treatment for it? And just because it's nagging the back of my mind: is that really a bone popping out? Or are there possibly ligaments or tendons in the area I overlooked?   Thank you too all who took the time to read this.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, There is a small pocket on the lateral foot that usually fills with fluid post ankle sprain.  In general, swelling is often the last physical finding to vanish after an acute lower limb injury.  So this may be a pocket of swelling.  If you are particularly concerned about the bone, have a plain radiograph of the ankle.  Otherwise, do rehab exercises over the next 2-3 weeks as well as compression with an ACE wrap.  Some athletic trainers use a horse shoe foam padding under the ACE wrap to specifically compress the area around the lateral malleoli and this area of pocket swelling.  Also remember to stretch the achilles tendon which usually tightens following a lateral ankle sprain.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I assume the fractured bone in the knee was made by a physician who had taken a radiograph and saw a fracture line.  Length of recovery will depend on the type of fracture and the location.  In general however, it will take about 6 weeks for healing.  During this time, it will be important to maintain leg strength and cardiovascular capacity.  The proper regimen can be designed by a professional athletic trainer or physical therapist.  But first, check with your physician about the extent of the fracture, its location and the expected length of healing time...and any precautions or limitations to be observed.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Nearyl 1 month ago I had this fracture to my tibia while playing softball. I have been told there is damage (which I can feel) to the ligaments in my knee as a result of this injury. I had the surgery to install 2 screws into the bone three days after the injury but have yet even had orders to have an MRI done to see the extent of damage to ligaments. From researching this type of fracture, I know percentages say that more surgical repair is likely for ligaments. Should I have concern about the timing, or lack-there-of for this area. My questions arose when my friend's doctor asked what has happened and looked surprises, almost astonished, that I had not had more procedures done to this point. Thank you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Open Lateral Tibial Plateua Fracture",
    "content": "Hello, In general, it is better to have the ACL (if damaged) repaired early rather than late due to the increased risk of cartilage damage from an shifting or variably unstable knee.  However, there are some orthopedic doctors who advise against repairing ACL tear if the leg strength especially the hamstrings are sufficient to stabilize the knee.  One of the potential problems with having hardware in the knee and doing an MRI is artifacts may blur the picture of a damaged internal ligament. However, since the surgeon was able to look at the internal ligaments and cartilage during the open fixation, he ought to have a decent look or assessment of the ACL, PCL and menisci.  So check back with your orthopedic doctor and have a discussion about the integrity of the knee ligaments and cartilage to see if there is more surgical repair needed.  Take care.\n\n",

    "title": "Clavical Fracture- Large Healing Bump",
    "content": "Two weeks ago I fractured my clavicle.  I went to the ER and was told I would likely need surgery based on my X-Rays.  The following morning I went to the bone trauma surgeon, and he looked at my X-Rays and said that the other doctor (not a specialist) was wrong and this would heal by itself.  He also said that the bump, caused by the relatively profound overlapping of my clavicle, will heal on top of itself.    Although I feel much better and have not needed to use a sling at all in almost a week, the bump appears larger than it had before.  Does this have to do with the healing process?    The range of motion in my arm improves everyday and there hasn't been a feeling of much bone movement in almost a week.  Since I do not have health insurance (and only for the month this happened), surgery will be a nightmare and put me in a suddenly awful financial situation.  Is it normal that the bump may be a little larger?  https://mail.google.com/mail/?shva=1#in ... 7c7ff799f4\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The vast majority of clavicle fractures heal without surgery.   The bump can increase slightly in size as the bone heals - the callous formation increases the diameter slightly. Since your shoulder range of motion is improving and assuming pain levels are manageable then the clavicle ought to be healing nicely. If there are concerns or potential issues with healing, then the best thing to do is have another x-ray taken.   But in general, the need for surgery with a clavicle fracture is low.

So with hardware (plate and screws), it is normal to \"feel\" these through the skin.  However if the hardware pokes through the skin, then you must see the orthopedist.  A break in the skin (from any source), is an opportunity for infection so needs attention.  In your case the hardware was placed in a fashion that would not cut the skin from the inside out.  So this is not normal.  See your orthopedist.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "I broke my tibia and fibula at the end of April and had surgery two times during the 1st and 2nd week in May as the 1st surgery wasnt correctly done.  I had a soft Pot on for approx 5 weeks, during which i had alot of sharp shooting pain towards the end of my pot coming off.  I was then told to start on full weight bearing on my ankle and come off the crutches and given a flex and stretch exercise to get the movement back.  Should it have been so soon to be full weight bearing?  I have been off the crutches for about 2 months now and have had a couple of physio appointments and given exercises. My ankle is still swollen and gets worse when i have been walking but the pain is constant wether i am sitting down with my ankle up or if im moving around. I am also still getting the sharp pains in my ankle and for the past month has been starting to ride up my shin. I recently went to the doctors and they found an infection on the inside and was prescribed Flucloxocillin.   Should i still be receving pain like this?  I have been told to keep taking paracetamol and diclofenac that i have been prescribed but neither of these are working.   Is there anything that i can do to stop it hurting so much. It wasnt this painful when i broke my foot but on a scale of 1 being the least pain and 10 being the worst pain ever, its a 10.   Any Help at all would be great  P.S I am a diabetic and know that healing could take longer time than a normal person\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, From the information given, the most concerning is the \"infection on the inside\" and the history of diabetes.  There is a need to rule out osteomyelitis (bone infection).  Imagining studies (the best study is MRI), complete blood count (inc white blood cell count), sed rate, CRP, and blood cultures are indicated in the assessment for suspected osteomyelitis.  Therefore, in essence consult with your physician to rule out this potentially serious complication.  If no infection exists, then addressing the orthopedic status of the fracture fixation, joint integrity/function and soft tissue (ligaments, tendons, fascia, muscle) is the next step.  But first things first, rule out osteomyelitis.  Take care.\n\n",

I got told that im just going through a rough patch,and my fracture clinic consultant has said more or less the same as this other orthopaedic doctor, but said that the pain is normal.  I know this is going to sound silly but it doesnt feel like my ankle anymore.  im also getting like bubble popping pains going from my heel towards my toes on the side of my ankle, and you can see something popping up and down next to my screw wound.is this normal?  my pain is only on the left hand side of my right ankle where the screw was put in. and the ankle swells up to my knee size if i walk for about 20-30mins, do you think that i am over doing it?\n\n",

Since this is a distal toe fracture and does not involve the proximal toe joint, it should not in the long run affect your gait and function. Removing bone if needed likely involves the fragments...although I expect this will not be necessary.   Total healing time is 6-8 weeks.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Without a history of trauma or repetitive use such as running, a fracture is unlikely.  Tendons are abundant on top of the foot and may be dealing with tendonitis. Other potential cause is specific small foot joint arthritis or a dysfunction with the biomechanics of the midfoot.  This could cause pain especially when changing footwear.  You may benefit from seeing a podiatrist who should accurately assess the cause and thus recommend the apporpriate treatment.  For now, use ice and/or heat packs, anti-inflammatory medicine (if not contraindicated medically) and gentle painfree range of motion exercises...do these without weight on the foot i.e. with the ankle elevated.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iueNeAkAFo&feature=fvw  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "David, To differentiate between a bony problem or restriction and a muscular problem, grasp the toe and determine if it will move through full range of motion (without contracting the toe muscle).  Now actively bend it upwards just using only the toe's musculature.  Which provides more movement?  If the former is more then probably a muscle problem. If both are equal then more likely a bony problem.   In either case you can exercise the toe with range of motion exercise (passively or actively) given there is no pain or swelling.  Continue exercise several times a day for a few weeks and look for progress.    If there is pain and swelling before or after exercise, have an x-ray done first.  Take care.\n\n",

Also, with all the symptoms, you may benefit from specific exercises, hot and cold packs...in essence - some physical therapy. The swelling and tenderness may be the result of an inflamed bursa (slippery fluid filled sac) of the knee - there are several bursa at the knee.   Also, the patellafemoral joint may have been damaged...the under-surface of the knee cap.  This is a common site of motor vehicle injury as the knee hits the dashboard.  All in all, ask your physician about the need for anti inflammatory medicine, MRI and Physical Therapy.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm 38, male.  Yesterday I went to Six Flags.  I was on the Tidal Wave, a ride where you go down a steep, watery incline, then hit water at the bottom to splash your car and people on a bridge.  I bent down to avoid getting splashed, placing my rib cage against the crashbar.  The full weight of my body slammed into the bar and knocked the wind out of me.  I was sore, but not thinking a lot about the pain.  We rode three more roller coasters, by the time I rode the last one (which was after a break for dinner), I was in serious pain.  I was screaming through the whole ride, not from excitement but from the pain of getting jerked around.  I can't tell if the ribs are cracked or bruised.  I don't think they're broken.  I know that bone breaks feel like and the \"electric shock\" pain isn't present.  I'm able to move about pretty well, but lying on my back is exceptionally painful.    I'm wrapped with ace bandages and have put Tiger Balm on the skin around the painful areas.  I've also been taking Arnica Montana.  There's been marked improvement since yesterday, but I still hurt.   Wondered how you can tell, without an X-Ray, whether it's a bruised bone or a cracked bone?  Any other suggestions for non-invasive (I consider an X-Ray \"invasive\") treatment?  I've not been in enough pain to warrant pain killers.   And how long will this hurt?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Vellorian,  Both a cracked rib and a bruise could easily explain your pain.  Fortunately, both are treated the same-time, rest and pain medicines as needed.  There really is no way to differentiate the two without an x-ray.  If you are getting better you probably don't need the x-ray.  Rib fractures and severe bruises can take several days to really feel better and several weeks to completely heal.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I'm not sure if the pain is gone of if I've simply learned to live with it.  I have eschewed pain pills because the day after I took them for the first time, I was in more pain--like I did too much the day before.  Today something was different, though.  On the left side, the more injured side, it felt like there was some \"shifting\" taking place.  It wasn't really painful, just strange.  It felt as though my ribs either shifted against one another or against some cartilidge or something.  It was almost a \"grinding\", though it only lasted for a moment.  There was no extra pain, but it did hurt when I did moved so that it caused that \"shifting\" sensation.  I'm seeing my doctor tomorrow on a routine visit, but I'm going to definintely mention the injury.  Someone today said that rib injuries \"never go away\", is that true?\n\n",

Unfortunately, sometimes they end up getting flares of inflammation in the originally damaged area that can be a bit painful.  This inflammation is generally well managed by anti-inflammatories such as ibuprofen.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I saw my doctor today.  He's of the opinion that it's either a crack or a bad bruise.  Either way, it'll hurt for awhile.  Sometimes it seems like it's getting better (I can get in and out of bed with only a little pain, now) and at others it seems worse (every formerly comfortable position I could sleep it causes pain--which has damaged my sleep patterns--and I'm extremely sore and achy in the mornings).  He listened to my chest a lot with the stethiscope while I breathed and didn't have any indications of a break.  He felt around and said my responses to his touch seemed more in line with a bad bruise or a crack.  He offered to send me for x-rays.  I asked if it would make a difference to the treatment--\"no\".  Why waste my HMOs money and have invasive, damaging rays sent through my body if it won't help?  I opted not to go.  Thanks for your responses, by the way.  :)\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Sorry to hear about the injury.  Pain during deep breathing can results from strained or sprained muscles between the ribs, contusion (bruising) of the rib area, fracture of the ribs, or irritation of the lining of the chest cavity (less likely from trauma). Also, the lung tissue can be punctured or damaged releasing air into the chest cavity (pneumothorax).  It is good to have chest x-ray done following trauma to the ribs especially with lasting pain.  And take the appropriate amount of pain relief meds to help make breathing easier.  Obviously, you should review the overall situation to evaluate the need for some lifestyle changes to prevent further problems.  Trusted friends or family or church members often provide wisdom during times like this.     Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The rib cage attaches to the sternum or breastbone near the midline of the chest.  Since you have traumatized the chest cavity without fractures or punctured lungs, we would treat this as contusion to the chest or costochondritis. Pain management is very important to allow for deep respirations. Consult for family physician for pain meds. Other than that it will take at least 3 weeks for healing.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello aml1221,  This new pain may or may not be a reinjury of your first incident.  Often, areas in the ribs that have been bruised or damaged can be a triggering point for other types of chest pain such as pleurisy (inflammation of the lining of the lungs/chest wall) or costochondritis (inflammation of the area where the cartilage and bone meet in the ribs).  The area you describe initially would be a classic spot for costochondritis to develop (which also classically follows a traumatic injury).  Both these issues are not dangerous but can be quite painful.  If your pain is not improving, I would recommend you see your doctor again for a reevaluation.  This will allow for proper recommendations for treatment.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Often, when anti-coagulation is needed we start on both Warfarin and Lovenox, when the INR is between 2 and 3, we stop the Lovenox.

    "content": "Hi, Although the fall about 2 weeks earlier could have potentially caused rib fractures, your history does not suggest it very much.The pain due to fracture of a rib will usually aggravate on breathing in, or while coughing or sneezing.   You seem to be experiencing pain in the vicinity of the left rectus abdominis muscle(the \"six-pack\" muscle). One possible explanation for your symptoms is a partial tear of the rectus muscle. This could have been aggravated by by the dirt bike riding or some other activity/posture.  These tears usually are managed non-operatively(rest, analgesics and cold compresses in the acute phase). In some cases, if accompanied by a large hematoma, then they may need an aspiration or open drainage.  It will be safer for you to show it to your family doctor and get treated. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "I'm 20 years old and about a year ago I fell down some stairs and injured my ankle badly. The doctor said I had a grade 3 high ankle sprain. I was on crutches and in a boot for quite a while, but since then have been able to walk on my foot and haven't noticed a lot of instability or problems. However, recently I've been noticing bad pain in my previously injured ankle. I'm a server at a restaurant and am on my feet for 3-4 hours at a time, constantly walking. I noticed the pain, and after a while it got so intense I was limping around the rest of the day. Sometimes it even hurts now when resting as well. My ankle doesn't appear to be swollen as far as I can tell. Should I make an appointment with my doctor and is this common? What could be wrong with my ankle and can it be fixed?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, First, to answer the question of seeing your physician...yes that ought to shed some light on what you will need to decrease the pain and improve your ability to work.  It ought to be determined if the pain is the result of the previous injury being aggravated or re-injured or if a new problem has developed.  Often new problems eg. tendonitis or acute arthritis start some time after a majorly injured joint.    So besides using the same modalities (ice, heat, NSAIDS, decreased weight bearing) to treat the initial injury, see your physician to check the painful limb.  Take care.\n\n",

    "title": "Avulsion Fracture of Ischial Tuberosity",
    "content": "So last fall ( beginning of October) I was unfortunate enough to have gotten an avulsion fracture of my left ischial tuberosity. The doctors opted not to do surgery becuase the bone was not displaced far enough where it would have been necessary. Another driving factor is because i am a year round. highly engaged soccer player and it would have severely effected my time table to come back. Well months went by and i had only gotten a little better. The bone was healed according to x rays, but any awkward movement, sitting down, jogging, swinging my leg, and alot of other things still hurt extremely bad. So eventually we found a doctor that said that the reason for not getting better was because I had functional leg length discrepancy that was received when the hamstring pulled the bone off of my pelvis. I have been receiving physical therapy for this for about 2 -3 months and I have seen major improvement. But for some reason when I feel the back of my leg ( on my hamstring) I feel like a part of the outside of my hamstring is missing or something. There is a divet there when I retract my leg and I am wondering if you think that could also contribute to why I still have not been able to run or kick a ball without a lot of pain. Also, I am writing all this to just ask for any other opinions as to what could of happened to me that could result in, after 9-10 months, I am still not healed.  Thanks a lot in advance\n\n",

With the divot in the posterior thigh upon contracting the hamstring...along with avulsion fracture of the ischial tuberosity, a portion of the hamstring may have been ruptured. I would opt for an MRI to determine the integrity of the hamstring muscles and tendons (semi membranosus, semi tendonosis, and biceps femoris).  One of the three may have ruptured and still not healed.   Take care.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: 5th metatarsal fracture",
    "content": "Hello, Diabetes can delay or impair fracture healing so excellent control with insulin (in your case) is important. Also, with the nature of this fracture - base of the metatarsal fracture - a fair number of patients show poor healing (non union)...independent of co morbidities (e.g. diabetes).  Therefore surgical fixation of the fracture is sometimes needed.   Post operatively, it will be important to not only assess fracture healing and bony alignment but to monitor incision site healing.  Also, you will need to have a pre operative evaluation to assess your heart and lung condition prior to have surgery.  All in all, not surprising that the bone is not healing after 8 weeks but there are often performed surgical procedures to fix the bone.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "10 days ago I suffered an MCL (?) contusion playing basketball - another player 'kneed' me on the inside part of my knee just below the kneecap.  Not sure if exactly the MCL - in the area on the inside of my knee between the kneecap and where the top of the calf muscle sort of ends.  The area swelled up immediately, but there was no pain and no pain to the touch at all, and I continued to play.  It was if it was 'fluid'.  The following day it was fine, a little swollen, but no real pain at all.  After a couple days, I noticed a 'black and blue' line along the inside of my foot from just inside the heel to the middle of my arch, and all along my lower leg started to feel a little numb at times.  My ankle became slightly swollen.  When I apply light touching pressure on my lower leg (by the MCL, shin, and ankle), it is a little painful.  I don't feel any real pain walking, except some tightness around the ankle.  When I stretch my foot (extend, retract, side-to-side), it feels 'tight' and is painful.  Almost like a combo of tight/numb/painful - mostly in the high ankle area.  Ice helped with the swelling but not the numbness.  Heat seemed to make it a little worse.  Elevation seems to help a little, but not that much.  Doing circles with my foot seems to loosen up the stiffness a little bit.  Not sure if this will heal itself or I should see a doc.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Thanks for writing in. With trauma to the medial knee, certainly the MCL could have become damaged.  And with knee trauma in general, you can see distal (e.g. ankle) swelling and bruising (collections of fluids) which have resulting from the knee trauma and gravity pulling the fluid down.  Also, anytime a joint is injured, it is important to assess both the joint above and below the injury site (since \"the hip bone is connected to the knee bone is connect to and ankle bone\" etc).    So during the incident the ankle could have twisted - sprain.  But most likely, the injury was local to the knee and the effects at the ankle are resultant from the knee trauma, swelling and bruising.  If the knee and ankle are either unstable or not recovering, then see a physician.  Take care.\n\n",

To evaluate the underlying bone however, get a lateral view of the tibia will evaluate the bone's integrity and shape.

    "title": "Re: dislocated shoulder not seen on x ray?",
    "content": "Hi,  Your history is more suggestive of an \"acromioclavicular joint (AC joint) separation\".  This joint is betwen the outer end of the clavicle and the acromion process of the scapula.Via the clavicle, it takes part in connecting the upper limb to the axial skeleton.  Separation occurs usually by one of two mechanisms: - Direct injury: wherein a person falls on to the point of the shoulder, with the arm usually by the side(adducted shoulder). About 70% of AC joint injuries are the result of a direct injuries.   - indirect injury: wherein a person falls onto an outstretched arm.   Clinical picture: In dislocations,there is loss of the normal contour of the shoulder and the outer part of the collarbone appears prominent with a noticeable 'step deformity'.  Routine anteroposterior views of the shoulder are good to visualize the shoulder joints(glenohumeral joints).The AC joint is over-penetrated by the X-rays and therefore appears too dark ans therefore difficult to interpret. Reduced exposures improve visualization of the AC joint. Weighted views (stress X-rays) which are taken with 10-15lb weights not held but suspended from the patient's wrists,may help occasionally(not preferred by some).  Therefore, it is possible that an AC joint separation may be missed in a conventional AP X-ray of the shoulder, which is commonly performed in an emergency situation.  You must consult an orthopedic surgeon and get thoroughly assessed, as improperly managed AC joint separations may result in chronic shoulder pain. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Two weeks post injury, you are still having significant problems with the shoulder, I would consider doing an MRI. The concern is torn labrum (fibrous piece of material in the shoulder which helps keep the joint stable) and small fracture of the proximal humerus (the end of the upper arm bone). Your family practice doctor can order the MRI.   The treatment plan will be based on the results. For the time being stay in the immobilizer, use analgesics recommended by your physician and ask about MRI.  Take care.\n\n",

    "title": "Rolled Ankle Possibly Fractured, or Torn Ligament?",
    "content": "I have a history of former sprains and rolls on my ankles, which are already extremely weak due to excessive pronation. About five years ago, in my freshman year of high school, I rolled my left ankle so badly that it tore a ligament. I was able to walk on it, with a limp, about ten minutes later, but it was bruised and painful for weeks on end. When I went to the ER a couple weeks after rolling it, they took an x-ray, but never called us back. I remember the nurse saying that I had an extremely high pain threshold if I was able to walk on that ankle. It went untreated, besides a simple store-bought ankle brace, and it became a lingering pain that had me limping for about a year if I walked too much on it. Even now, I have a habitual limp from it, but my orthopedic had prescribed me a pair of custom arch supports to keep me from hurting myself again, and for a while it was helping, I usually only limp now if I've been on my feet for too long.  Just now, however, not even fifteen minutes ago, I was taking one of my daily walks around the neighborhood and I was about five minutes from home, and of course I was wearing my arch supports, but I guess they don't do much to support the ankle. I must have stepped on a rock or something, because my left ankle suddenly buckled underneath me as I stepped on it and though I didn't hear a crack (I had headphones on), I could FEEL something crack in my ankle, like popping a knuckle. Except harder and more painful. I managed to keep myself from falling, and having a bit of experience with sprains and twists, I limped and took it slow on the way home, careful not to put too much weight on it.   I don't want to have my mom take me to the hospital if I don't have to, but this time is different from the past times I've rolled my ankle. I've never heard or felt it crack before like that, and upon some self-examination, it even seems different from my previous injuries. I still have a small amount of mobility in the ankle for the time being, but it seems like it's getting stiffer by the minute, and I can't move my toes at all.   I've heard that you can't move your ankle or put weight on it at all if it's broken, but I wanted to know if there's a possibility that it could be a fracture, or if it's possible that I could have re-torn that same ligament that I injured before, four years ago. I would really like an expert's opinion on this before going to a doctor, because those visits aren't cheap and I don't want to waste money going if all they're going to tell me is to put some ice on it and call it a day.\n\n",

    "content": "My 9 year old daughter fell 3 days ago while walking across some landscape timbers. She land on the pavement, using both hands (palm down), to break her fall. She complained of pain in her left wrist, just below the thumb.  There was no bruising, or distortion of the wrist, and only a small amount of swelling. We treated her with ice and motrin for 2 days.  She has been favoring her left hand slightly, she will still move it, swing it around, but she won't pick things up with it ( this is not her dominant hand). She complains of pain when using her hand to push up from sitting, to grab or hold things, when you touch her wrist just below her thumb on the palm side, and when her arm was hanging by he side for extended periods of time.  On the 3rd day I took her to a walk in clinic. They examined her hand and took x-rays.  There was no fracture to the radius or ulna, but both the PA and the Doctor thought that one of the x-rays showed a fracture to the schapoid bone. She sent copies of the x-ray to a radiologist to read. The radiologist said that he didn't believe that there was a fracture and that he has never seen a scaphoid fracture in a child of her age, so it would be very unlikely. The doctor said that it must just be sprained and gave us a scapia splint for her to wear for the next week and told us to continue with the ice and motrin for the next couple of days. There was no follow up appointment scheduled. I have been reading online that scaphoid fractures aren't always detected by the first set of x-rays. I don't know if I should push this and have it tested further, or just treat it like it is a sprain.\n\n",

If the pain persists at the end of that time, then a repeat x-ray is needed.  Take care.\n\n",

Kindly go through the following link just to get a feel of the complexity of this issue. http://hypertextbook.com/facts/LenaWong.shtml  Also, one needs to consider other factors such as the route of measurements(oral, axillary or rectal), inter-observer variations etc.  It is true that your recorded temperatures have been too close or overlapping the lower limits of some of the quoted 'normal' ranges. It would be best to go by a combination of  - physical signs & symptoms, - labs (total WBC count, differential counts, ESR, CRP &  blood cultures).  If infection is strongly suspected based on the above, then further investigations such as - radioisotope bone scan, - bone biopsy(for culture) & - CT/MRI may be needed. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Big Toe problem",
    "content": "About roughly 3 months ago I fell down a few steps on a staircase, landing on my feet but with the big toe of my left foot facing downwards which jarred it badly. It ached constantly for the next 8 hours or so until I got some painkillers, after taking the next two days off as I couldn't walk well enough I visited a hospital, where they told me they wouldn't take an x-ray because had it been broken or not due to it being a toe, there would be nothing they could do. They strapped my toe with some tape and bandage and sent me on my way.  After about two weeks my walking greatly improved, and after a month it was more or less completely normal, the only problem being that I could not bend my big toe at the second joint at all. The first joint seemed fine, but i was physically unable to move my toe along the second joint. It would actually bend, if i took it in my hand and moved it manually, but i couldn't bend it otherwise. My toe did bruise visibly for a time, and to touch it was never particularly painful, and moving it with my hand wasn't either, but like I said walking for a while was particularly painful. Anyway, after a few weeks I was still worried and visited a doctor who gave me some anti-inflamatory tablets which i took for a few weeks. Slightly over a month since the accident, I managed to put a lot of weight on my toe by accident which seemed to set it back and made it more painful than it was to begin with, however this seemed to be temporary as it cleared up once more within about a week. 3 months on, I can walk perfectly, and I think even jogging would be ok, but, I still cannot bend my toe at the second joint without forcing it by hand.  I'm guessing it's to do with muscle damage rather than bone damage, as having broken bones before they're usually painful to touch and definitely to move, whereas this is not so much, and of course bone injuries typically clear up after 6 weeks, whereas this has been now more like 12. Also, i've shyed away from moving my toe by hand, but i've noticed lately when I have it does hurt slightly to bend it, like an ache rather than a sharp pain. This is all pretty worrying considering how ambiguous what is actually wrong with it is, the hospital and doctor not taking a great deal of interest, and considering how long its been without being able to bend my toe along the second joint at all. It's a big problem because I don't know when it's safe to excercise fully again, as it was excercising that made it far worse after I thought it was ok the first time. I might add that I think ever so slightly I can bend my toe along the second joint slightly now, though I may just be imaging it, as it may have always been like that since the accident. Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Swift eye,  Most toe injuries are as you see managed quite conservatively, and indeed an X-ray rarely changes any decision that is actually taken.  Quite understandably you  feel that, \"its all very well saying the management is the same, but it would be nice to know if...etc\".  I presume that every thing is undisplaced, or now you would have mentioned a wonky toe. The way i would classify your injury, in the absence of any extra information is firstly either you have broken it or you haven't, and if you did break it, it either involves the joint or doesn't.   Secondly, there is a soft tissue injury...we accept that, but either this involved a musculosketal soft tissue (ligaments, tendons, joint capsule) or doesn't.  Most bony injuries of your big toe heal sponateneously, without any intervention by about 4 to six weeks as you say, although X-rays may show signs for several more months after that. Joint capsule and ligamants in your toe will also take around the same time to heal.  Tendons (and by the mechanism you describe, the extensor tendon of your big toe, could be damaged) also heal, but unless immobilised may heal long ...we will talk about it later.  The healing process involves the generation of scar tissue,..the body's glue that sticks broken and torn bits together. This scar tissue, or fibrosis, is not as supple as your normal tissue, and if toccurs at close proximity to a joint, it leads to stifness, and pain when the joint is moved for sometime after the tissues have healed.  This stiffness is more likely if the fracture involved the joint, or the injury involved the joint capsule.  In fact by the mechanism you describe, it is probable that the joint capsule was involved.  How long this stiffeness and discomfort lasts is difficult to predict, but if there was a fracture, and it involved the joint surface it may last( to a lesser extent than it is at present), for some considerable time.  Another injury I alluded to in the last paragraph (but unlikely in your case), is an injury to the extensor tendon of your big toe.  If this was damaged then the mechanism that allows you to straighten your big toe fails.  You may be able to flex (bend the toe) at the joint nearest to the tip of your toe, but be unable to straighten it.   You seem to suggest that your toe is straight and that you are unable to bend it...so this probabaly doesn't apply to you.  So the treatment now...after 12 weeks, you should do gentle stretching exercises to get the toe moving.  you wilol probably get good days and bad days, but gradually there will be more good days than bad.  If, after another month or so, it is still giving you jip...it may be worth being referred to your friendly neighbourhood orthopod...but chances are that you will be cured by the time your appointment comes through, mate.  Cheers  saif\n\n",

    "title": "Clarify",
    "content": "Thank you very much for the prompt response. I'll clarify that my toe is straight, and I cannot bend it along the second joint. I describe second joint as the joint closest to the tip of my toe. The joint after that, connected to the rest of my foot if you will, seems fine.  I also forgot to mention swelling for quite some time around my toe and foot, which has seemed to subside. I did wonder if i had displaced my toe, as sometimes I think that it doesn't look quite the same as my other big toe, but I think this is me being paranoid, and obviously that they wouldn't be entirely identical anyway. I thought perhaps though that the fact that I can bend my toe at the joint if I use my hand may be an indication that it isn't displaced? I can say that immediately after the accident I lost my ability to bend it, if that is any help. After having so many breaks before I'm fairly accustomed to knowing how one 'feels' as such, which is why I've thought more towards it being muscular rather than a bone problem, it not seeming like the rest. Though I suppose all breaks are different to some extent.  It seems that even now it only takes a slight bump for my toe to be painful, if only for a minute, which I thought perhaps was a sign of it still being 'unhealed' or weak.  Thanks for the information, I'm not sure if what I say here has narrowed down the options any.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear swifteye,  I guess you know what your talking about being, by the sounds of things, fairly accident prone   , comments I would make are:- If there was a fracture and it was intra-articular, you may have stiffness for some considerable time afterwards. But in this case usually both active and passive (using your hand) movements are painful.  It may reamin tender when knocked for some many months as well If there was a capsular injury, as is the most likely, the toe remains stiff, and painful to knocks, but both active and passive movements are possible.  You did mention that you were starting to be able to move the toe actively...so I will assume that the tendons governing the movement are intact.  If they were not, then loss of active movement of the toe would be permanent and absolute.  Pain itself is usually not a feature for established tendon rupture. Fractures that do not involve the joint usually remain tender when knocked while the bone is not fully united.  Movement is not usually affected after 4 weeks or so from the injury. In addition to these other non-musculoskeletal soft tissue injuries can reamin tender after all the mechanical structures have healed.  This could potentially lead to inhibition of the muscle that work your toe...essentially this is a subconscious reflex that prevents you moving a joint that might hurt...even though passive manipulation suggests that it would not.  This is recognised in other joints such as the knee...but I guess it could happen elsewhere.  Regards  Saif\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for the response  I guess i'll just have to wait and see, i'll do some excercises. It's just pretty disconcerting; not being able to move it actively at all (I don't know that there has really been any progress there) after 12 weeks. Hopefully it'll start moving again sometime, just that excercising a while after i had the accident originally undid a lot of the healing as it must not have been ready for it, which I don't want to repeat. I've generally been estimating that a safe time to start using it fully in excercise again would be when it starts bending again, hence it not moving seeming like such a problem.\n\n",

    "content": "I have a similar problem to this, but related to an ankle (fibula) fracture.  I had surgery three days ago to place plates around the fibula and three screws (one through to the tibia, the other two holding the plates).  They kept checking the toes after surgery for bloodflow, etc, and everything seemed fine.  Now that the pain and swelling is fading a bit, I now see that my big toe will bend down at both joints, but will not straighten at the 2nd joint.  There is only a minor ache when I force the toe to move that is mostly at the top of the toe near that joint, but also seems to run along the top of the foot into my ankle.  There is also a little bit of a tingling feeling on a small part at the outside of the toe.  Should I be concerned?  At this point I find it hard to focus on anything other than the ankle, but if there's something I should do to prevent future problems, I'd like to know it!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Mail2 sax,  If this happened just a few days ago, then it is not too unusual.  The filbula is normally plated with 6 screws, and somethimes one screw goes across to the the tibia and is called a diastasis screw.  The big toe is normally spared by surgery around the fibula (the fibula being on the outer side of the leg, and the tibia is on the inner side).  Numbness and tingling can follow surgery to the fibula, but gain this normally involves the sural nerve, and is usually along the outer aspect of the ankle and foot.  I would guess that this is too early following the injury to make judgements about the mobility of your toes, and the long term implications of this tingling.  See how it develops over the next week or so...  Regards  Saif\n\n",

    "content": "Along the line of the previous posters.    I am a 72-year-old female who had bunion and hammer toe surgery in 1982.  I had no problems until 1996 when my surgery area became inflamed the big toe and bunion site were red and swollen, I could not put my foot to the floor.  There were large water type blisters along the surgery scar.  My doctor at the time could not come up with a diagnosis for the problem but prescribed antibiotics.  After several months the problem just healed itself.  On July 4, of this year the toe again has become inflamed and swollen, again the big toe and bunion area are involved again I cannot wear a shoe.  There are no blisters, the toe is very red and the only thing that seems to help is ice.  I keep the foot elevated for the most par and try not to put any weight on it.  I am perplexed as to what this might be.  I understand that I could have injured the toe in some way?  Thank you for any help you may be able to provide.\n\n",

    "content": "My problem is similar to the first posting.  I engage in martial arts and over the past months have suffered some impact to both big toes, more specifically around the top of the big toes at the joint closest to the tip.  The result is immobility of that joint, particularly on one foot, when I try to either move it by itself or through manual manipulation.  Visited by GP about it this week and what he told me worried me.  He says that I have developed bone spurs near the joints, have some arthritis and that on the least mobile toe, I have probably also lost some cartilege.  He offered that there was no therapy I could engage in for this problem.  Furthermore he told me that I must not hit my toes again!  This is simply not realistic if I am to continue with my sport as I intend to do.  Is there truly no therapy I can engage in?  Aside from the lack of mobility at the joints, I do not have sympoms but do experience quite a lot of pain when I do hit this area as I do on occasion.  Mainly I am worried about this Dr's diagnosis.  Thank you.\n\n",

(more or less) Pain lasting also depends on how much I bend my toe too. I went to the doctor today and he told me to put ice 3 times a day and quit everything (martial arts, running, even walking), he also told me to sit at work wich I cant really do cause Im a server on a restaurant. They also suggested to get ultrasound and therapy but I don't have insurance and I cant afford the threatment. now, my question to the doctor was: why I didnt heal during those six months that I didnt really hit or bent the toe? he told me that I didnt really gave it a chance to heal because of using the toe to walk around and the better way to get well is to put a cast on my foot for 4 weeks to fully recover. I don't really want to go there because I cant afford to stay home for that long doing nothing and sounds crazy that just by walking Im affecting the healing process. is there any other opction for me? I almost forget, they took x-ray's and he said bones look very good and most likely is a soft tissue injury but he didnt know if it was musculas or tendon.

In severe case, the joint dislocates; in mild cases the joint capsule (tissue which connects the two bones of the joint), is sprained or stretched.  You may be able to splint the toe rather than casting the foot.  This may allow better mobility.    Ice and NSAIDS may also help.  Take care and let us know how it goes.\n\n",

    "content": "The base of my big toe has been hurting for a week.  I think it is turf toe or a sprain.  I did not hear a snap because I ware head phones when I run.  I can't pin it down on running but I have been doing a lot of running.  I wear new balence cross trainers, the ones on sale for fifty dollars.  No proublems before I started doing 6 miles in one hour.  Felt minor proublems in same foot, kept running.  Never realized it could get so bad.    My symptoms are a constent acccute pain in the left ball of my foot, unnoticible sometimes.  I work on my foot for eight hours at a time.  I am limping by the last four hours of my shift.  Range of motion does not seem to be changed, no bruseing, change of color etc.  I can walk fine at a slow pace.  Sometimes the phone rings and I walk too fast and feel pain.  I think it is a mild form of turf toe brought on by running on a tred mill in old sneakers.  What do you think?\n\n",

    "content": "I have a BIG TOE problem as well.  As a dancer, I have used  my feet tremendously.  About 3 months ago, in typical dancer clumsiness, somehow I landed after a movement with my toes being bent under or jammed with the top part of my foot and especially my toes hitting the floor hard.  The immediate result was excruciating pain and inablility to walk normally, some swelling and some bruising.   Long story short, today, my big toe still hurts. The rest of my toes and foot are fine.  I am an avid hiker as well and can, for the most part, continue this exercise.  But I can't use my foot in dance-yet.  Reason being is that the joint closest to the foot  (as in standing on your tip toes) hurts and pointing my toes hurts my big toe and the big joint on the outside of the big toe hurts when I push on it.  Sometimes I will simply get a pain through the big toe when I am doing nothing - maybe arthritis?  Any opinions/help appreciated.\n\n",

And currently they(doctors) have perofrmed a surgery to attach the cut portion of the fingure  to the stomach(They basically said the blood flow in the stomach will help the wound heel faster and will also help mold the fingures).   My question is, what are our options to get the baby back to normal(atleast close to normal).Is there any plastic surgeries available for this ,perhaps in the future when the baby grows to acertain age ? any ideas or suggestions are greatly appreciated.Currently the baby has only the 3/4 of the fingures only.

Functionally, the child will be able to use the hand to grasp objects albeit with gross motors skills better than fine motor skills (e.g. pinching, sorting fine objects).   As the child grows, he will reach a limit of bone growth and thus skin, ligament and tendon length. Any further reconstruction or revisions will be determined over time as the child grows.  As long as their is good initial healing and no complications of infection, there should be adequate functional restoration.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "My son fell on his elbow (several times) during his basketball game today.  This happens from time to time, and we usually have no problems, however, today, he hit it hard, and kept grabbing at it throughout the game.  On our way home, it looked as if his elbow was more \"pointed\" than normal. Not quite a \"bump\", but, definately more pronounced than his other elbow. He did mention some tingling in his forearm in one certain spot.  There is a small scrape, but, nowhere near where the \"point\" is.  Maybe a little bit of swelling, but, not much.  I have put ice on it, and I have noticed he will lean (or put body weight) onto that elbow.  It really doesnt seem too significant. However, he has football practice (which Im sure includes lifting weights) in the morning.  Should I keep him out?  Should I have it looked at?  Or am I being overprotective?  From what I have read online, it seems similar to an Olecranon fracture, but, then again...I could keep searching the web and have him diagnosed with all kinds of things! There is NOT that much swelling or brusining yet, just the \"point\" and a little swelling onthe back of his arm above the elbow  Any help is appreciated.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Falling on elbow, is it broken?",
    "content": "Hi, Fractures of the olecranon process of the ulna occurs due to the following mechanisms.  - fall onto an outstretched hand with the wrist in a supine position and elbow semiflexed.This is an indirect injury as a result of sudden forcible contraction of the triceps muscle which is inserted into the olecranon. - Direct trauma (fall directly onto the point of a flexed elbow).  They are classified broadly as  - stable & - unstable fractures.  These fractures are  - usually very painful and therefore the patient invariably pays a visit to the emergency department. -elbow movement is very painful and restricted.   They are straightforward fractures to suspect clinically, diagnose radiologically & treat with good outcomes.  Although your description of the symptomatology does not fit very well with that of an olecranon fracture, you must have him examined by an orthopedic surgeon fairly quickly.Occasionally, Olecranon stress fractures in young athletes occur with minimal stress.This possibility must be excluded in your son's case. Good day!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Acetabulum fracture",
    "content": "Hi, Your concern regarding pain medications is very genuine. Elderly patients are at an higher risk of an adverse drug reaction (ADR) from  medications.  This is due to  several reasons.  - Age related alterations in pharmacokinetics of drugs with increasing age may result in increased or prolonged plasma levels of drugs.  - Altered pharmacodynamics of drugs can either diminish or exaggerate the expected response to a drug. - The increased number of diseases and medications per patient(polypharmacy) also predisposes this group to iatrogenesis.  NSAIDs possess analgesic, anti-inflammatory and anti-pyretic activity effects by inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins in the body. NSAIDs inactivate cyclooxygenase, the enzyme which forms prostaglandins(PG) from precursor archidonic acid. Because of their effets on prostaglandin metabolism, NSAIDs can affect the gastric mucosa, renal function & regulation of blood pressure.  Central nervous system (CNS) side effects of NSAIDs(non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs)include fatigue, disorientation, significant confusion, dizziness, and depression, especially in the elderly. Seizure activity may increase (esp with overdose or in conjunction with certain other drugs).Tinnitus and transient hearing loss have been reported. Another of the serious concerns about their use is Peptic ulcer disease(PUD) which can be life-threatening.  In the elderly, symptoms of PUD tend to be atypical, nonspecific or in many instances,absent. PUD may present without pain in nearly a third of of them.Unfortunately, the first indication of NSAID-induced gastric ulcer development may be a catastrophic  major GI hemorrhage or perforation. These complications are associated with higher morbidity and mortality in the elderly. The paucity of ulcer symptoms in patients taking NSAIDs may be due partly to the analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties of the drugs.  Some of the strategies for a safer analgesic/anti-inflammatory use include:  - avoiding NSAIDs as far as possible. - using NSAIDs only under medical supervision (with periodic monitoring).  - Avoiding NSAIDs for conditions where pain is the main concern and the condition is non-inflammatory (ex: osteoarthritis). Paracetamol may be a better choice. - enteric-coated preparations can reduce the topical toxicity of aspirin and other NSAIDs, but risk still remains via the systemic PG mechanism. - use of COX-2 inhibitors in favor of COX-1inhibitors.(COX-2 inhibitors have been shown to decrease the risk of PUD but not the other adverse effects common to NSAIDs.In fact, some of the cardiovascular side effects may be increased. Physician's opinion & monitoring is a must). Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "2 weeks ago I was playing on the park with my children when I (stupidly) fell off a balancing beam. I hit the beam with my left shin with quite a bit of force and it was extremely painful! I am the kind of person who never ever gets bruises no matter how hard i hit something, and I did get a bruise on my leg about the size of an apple. Strangely this disappeared after about 1 hour, however my leg became quite swollen. The pain was so bad that at first I thought I had broken it, however I was able to put some weight on it. So with the help of my 10 year old daughter I managed to walk home. Now, 2 weeks later, I still have a swollen lump at the site of the injury which is very painful if something brushes against it. Also there is a red patch of skin which is completely numb. If I touch it, I have no sensation on that part of the leg. Is this normal and will I just have to wait for the swelling to go down? Thanks so much\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, You have failed to mention some very important information- What was the nature of the trauma? What sort of treatment was given?.  Because you have not mentioned about any surgical management, i lake it that you probably had a 'stable' burst fractures (with an intact posterior column) of the L4 & L5 vertebrae.A corset might have been prescribed.  Generally, in most spinal fractures,fracture stabilization occurs in about 6-12 weeks.Fracture stabilization refers to mainly healing of the ligaments and other soft tissues around the site of the fracture so that abnormal mobility becomes restricted.Full radiological bony union (as per plain X-Rays) may take an indefinite amount of time.  I can not possibly answer you precisely how long your fractures may take to heal(as it is highly variable).Regarding the medications, you must consult your orthopedic surgeon and he/she will be able to assist you regarding this.

    "title": "Re: 4 year old fractured tibia",
    "content": "Hi, As you have not provided details of the fracture(exact location,status of the fibula,presence or absence of displacement etc),it may not be possible to be very specific about the management. However, i will try to offer some some general information regarding these fractures.  There are many types of tibial fractures (some due to accidental trauma and others due to non-accidental trauma) and spiral fractures are one among them. Most occur in toddlers.  A typical toddler's fracture is a non-displaced oblique fracture of the distal tibia in children (9 months to 3 years of age).These fractures typically occur in the lower third of the tibia.Spiral fractures also occur in older children. CAST (Childhood Accidental Spiral Tibial) fracture, which is one such, is an isolated spiral fracture of tibia.The fracture line usually begins more proximally at the midshaft and extends down to the distal tibia. The approximate age range is  2 - 6 years.  A twisting force is the underlying mechanism in spiral fractures.Twisting or rotational force through the tibia while the ankle and foot are fixed, results in these fractures.  A child with a toddler\u2019s fracture will be usually treated in a long leg cast bent at the knee joint for approximately three to four weeks. An additional 2 weeks of immobilization in a short leg walking cast is generally prescribed in most cases.  Healing is confirmed radiologically and by clinical means. As your child is slighty older than the typical toddler, decision for removing the cast should be ideally left to your orthopedic surgeon who is best placed to assess the fracture healing.  Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, you have not provided details of the extent & direction of angulation of the tibia.However, i will try to give you a general ouline.  generally accetable reduction consists of:             - > 10 deg of angulation in any plane;              - <   5 deg of varus or valgus;             - < 10 deg of anterior or posterior angulation &             - < 10 deg of rotation. As i am not aware of the extent of angulation, i can't be perhaps more specific.  Usual indications for operative correction:             - varus deformity of more than 6-10 deg;             - valgus deformity of more than 10-12 deg;             - internal rotation deformity of more than 10-15 deg;             - external rotation deformity more than 15-20 deg &             - shortening of more than 2 cm. Your orthopedic surgeon will be able to guide you as to whether any surgical intervention may be needed. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "I fell down stairs in January and was bruised extensively.  All bruises healed normally exept one.  The bruise has lost the purple/blue/green look but has a clear perpendicular line with darkened bruising exending out from the line.  It is tender when massaging the area.  It's hard to understand what the situation is or why this would continue so long. Should I pursue xrays or is there a way to look at the deep muscle that could be damaged?  If so, what kind of specialist would I need to pursue?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Shin Trauma Not Healing after 6 months",
    "content": "Hi, A bruise is caused by the seepage of blood out of the blood vessels(venules or capillaries) into the extracellular space in the vicinity.  Once formed, the bruises undergo a series of color changes from reddish(fresh),to blue or dark purple,then yellow or green & finally disappear(generally in about 2 weeks).  The spectrum of colors of bruises are due to changes in the blood as it's broken down and re-absorbed by the body. There are two major breakdown products of the hemoglobin.  - a green pigment (biliverdin) and  - a yellow-brown pigment (bilirubin).   In your case, these colour change sequence would be expected to have been completed within 2-3 weeks.As it is not the case, certain other possibilities need be entertained. - a sub-periosteal hematoma. Shin is very vulnerable to this as in this location, the tibia is sub-cuteneous. - associated injury to underlying muscles/fascia.  Traumatic sub-periosteal hematomas generally are painful & tender to begin with and may get calcified with chronicity.  It may be a good idea for you to consult an orthopedic surgeon as investigations such as plain X-rays, ultrasonography or CT scanning may be required to arrive at a diagnosis. Good luck!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: C2 Fracture not healing",
    "content": "Hi, Going by the plain films you have attached, it appears to be a 'traumatic spondylolisthesis' (the so-called \"hangman's\" fracture). Consider yourself very lucky indeed to have come out of it without neurological deficits!  I am certain that full workup must have resulted in sub-classification of this fracture (based on CT & MRI, these fractures are classified as Types 1 to Type 3).I do not know if your neck was stabilized in a Halo initially.  Based on the type of fracture, the management options are - conservative(non-operative) or - surgical (some form of internal fixation).  As far as healing is concerned, fracture stabilization occurs in approximately 6-12 weeks.Frature stabilisation refers to mainly healing of the ligaments and other soft tissues around the site of the fracture so that abnormal mobility becomes restricted.Full radiological bony union (as per plain X-Rays) may take an indefinite amount of time.So,you need not worry too much about the way your fracture looks on a plain film.  In conclusion, what really matter are - whether the patient's symptoms regress, - that no new neurologic deficits appear & - serial imaging shows progressive healing(stabiization) and no tendency towards displacement of the fractured bones.Your orthopedic surgeon will be the best person to guide you regarding the on-going management.  For all types of traumatic spondylolisthesis type of fractures, malunion and nonunion are the known significant complications of nonoperative management.Luckily, these are rare. Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "A week and half ago I was catching a ball and it hit the tip of my ring and little finger on the left hand. It hurt quite badly, swelling, bruising, pins n needles. I went to the ER, xrays taken. They suspected, but not 100 percent sure, a fracture on the top and inside of my ring finger, the joint above the knuckle. They said something about lucency? on the xray. They placed a metal type splint on the finger and said follow up with the family doctor.  I saw him today, he didn't examine the finger and I didn't have a chance to tell him where it hurt the most. He took xrays and said there is crack around the top and sort of too the side. Suggested I buddy tape the fingers, not use the splint, and use one of those  tiny exercise balls you squeeze to exercise my finger.  While at home I was looking at my finger. It's not visible to the eye (unless because of swelling hiding it?) but if I trace my finger along the inner part of the joint above the knuckle, ring finger,  along the side that is facing my middle finger, I can feel a hard bump or more roundness. Maybe bone I was feeling? I felt my good finger on my right hand  in the exact same area and it is nowhere near as large, round feeling compared to my injured finger. Could this be a bone jutting out or something to do with the fracture? It is quite painful in that area.  I have iced my finger to keep the swelling down.  Should I be seeing an orthopedic for a finger fracture? I live in Canada so to see an orthopedic I need a referral from another doctor. Thanks for your help.\n\n",

This would be a case to see an orthopedist. The other concern is too long immobilization.  Typically, less than 3 weeks in buddy taping or splint provide the best hand function results.

However I still have this large bump, bulge on the side of the finger. If I gently touch it and move the top part of my finger up and down I can hear and feel a clicking type noise in that bulged area. Could this be tendon or bone clicking? Finger continues to be quite painful.  If I try to make a fist, my ring finger will not curl or bend down. It is quite painful. I could possibly force it with the other hand but wouldn't risk doing that.Also the pinky finger which is not injured will not bend down. My middle finger will bend but the joint closest to the nail will not curl under. The index and thumb are fine. I was wondering if you have an injured finger can it affect the fingers next to it?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Since this finger is not progressing or healing, you may need to see a hand specialist.  Certainly, the tendon or joint capsule can be damaged.   In any event, the range of motion, strength, appearance (including bony appearance via x-ray) will need to be re-evaluated and then develop a treatment plan.  If the finger does not require surgical repair you may benefit from occupational therapy and splinting (to regain flexion).  Take care and keep us posted.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Shel,  It is as Tom says, difficult to know exactly what a patient  means without having the patient in front of you.  Even simple terms (like the \"top\" of the finger...or the \"knuckle\" or the \"inside\"), clearly obvious to you as the person describing the injury is confusing to me.  I apologise, as is clear to me you are trying to describe as accurately as possible the exact location of the problem you feel, but to me the \"top\" of your finger is way away from the \"knuckle\", the \"inside\" could mean the center of the finger or the \"inner side\"...the side towards the little finger anatomically.  Pardon me if that sounds thick, but hey, who said I was specialist?  er what?... I did?  oh ...so I am...hmmm.  But...I have a picture of your injury, in my head.  You injured this 5 months ago you say, as a ball struck the tip of your finger.  You don't say  whether the ball struck it end-on or just bent the finger back.  Two possible consequences are 1) a mallet injury affecting the finger joint furthest away from your hand,   generally if the ball struck your finger end on.  You have bent finger tip that can not straighten and needed splintage for 6 weeks or so. Not you?   Then there is option 2) More likely.  you had a hyper-extension injury to the joint of your finger nearer to the hand (not the knuckle, the joint in the middle of the finger).  This seems to have damaged the \"volar plate\", a strong ligament in front of the finger that stops your finger going too far back.  Consequences?  Pain...check, swelling that can last a year or longer (can't get ring back on?)... check, stiffness that improves a little with exercise...check.  Numbness and pins and needles...what?...ah...that's not part of the injury pattern typically.But as it has lasted more than a few months, suggests damage to a digital nerve.  this may recover, or may not.  If there if significant damage, recovery if it occurs can take upto 8 months.  If the digit is not absolutely numb, then chances of recovery I would say are good.  Best wishes  Saif\n\n",

    "content": "Dr. Saif,  Thank you for your help and sorry about the confusion. I know it's difficult without me being in front of someone. I will try to explain better..  I sort of remember the ball bending my finger backwards, not hitting the tip.  The problem area of my ring finger is the PIP joint (joint just above the knuckle) and the area with the most pain, symptoms (described below) is the inner side of this PIP joint that faces towards the middle finger anatomically.   This inner joint has a bump/lump that I can only feel by touch, not visible to the eye.   When I bend my ring finger I can feel a clicking sensation in the inner side of the PIP joint plus pins n' needles, pain etc. My finger does not become stuck or locked but does click. Pain is radiating into the top of my hand.  The injury is 7 months old now and still bugging me.   My concerns are the lump/bump that hasn't gone away, the clicking sensation, pins n' needles and pain radiating into my hand.  I wasn't sure if the clicking I feel  when bending the finger is due to some type of damage or this lump/bump.  I have not seen a specialist about my finger and wasn't sure if I should due to the above symptoms, especially the pins n' needles.  I hope this explanation helped.   Thank you for your help!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Shel,  Ah so you have the \"Volar plate injury\" described in scenario two.  Pain at seven months is a bit of a problem, and I would wonder if there is need for surgical exploration, to see if the ligament is now within the joint.  You see with most injuries, pain and swelling for a long time is not uncommon.  A bump may even persist.  The volar plate is a strong part of the capsule...a ligament that prevents the finger going too far back.  Imagine a sheet of tissue that attached to the front of the PIP joint.  If is stretched, it may tear.  No problem usually, it  can heal.  Occasionally the torn end ends up within the joint.  This may need surgical exploration.  An MRI may sometimes be helpful.  Stiffness and swelling/bump may be present even if surgery is successful, but pain should improve.  The pins and needles may, as I say represent a digital nerve nerve irritation, or perhaps a neuroma...  Saif\n\n",

He took an xray which showed that lump on the inside of the pip joint that faces towards the middle finger anatomically.     He figures I may need surgery (injury is  9 months old now)I will be referred to a plastic surgeon.  I looked up swan neck deformity and my finger does not look nearly as bad as what I have seen on the internet.   To me it doesn't look like it but then again I'm not an expert and he said its partial or beginnings of swan neck deformity?  He said the clicking in that lump area could be the tendons overcompensating.  I do notice pain, soreness on top of the finger (pip joint down to knuckle) and into the hand.    Is it the extensor tendons that are affected with this condition? And partial swan neck deformity means?  I mentioned I have gone for physiotherapy, ultrasound etc but the sports medicine doctor  doesn't think that will help it now although to keep it moving so I don't lose total function.    I know my problem is not an emergency. The wait time to see plastic surgeons are long (in Canada-  possibly many months or a year)but I guess it depends on the problem.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Rotation (finger crossover) after metacarpal fracture",
    "content": "Hi, \"Boxer's fracture\", bar room fracture or \"brawler's fracture\" usually is a fracture at the neck of the metacarpal of the little finger (but can also mean fractures of the necks of the other metacarpals as well.   Usually, these fractures are caused by striking a solid object with a closed fist and thus are dubbed boxer fractures, although this fracture almost never occurs during a boxing bout. Expert boxers usually tend to fracture their index metacarpal necks.  You have not mentioned which side was involved and about your 'handedness' (right handed or left handed).This is important in the final decision -making.  Metacarpal neck fractures very  rarely require surgery.   Mostly some form of immobilisation of the fracture is required.   Two aspects that are usually taken into consideration are  a) the degree of angulation and  b) minimizing axial rotation.  Whatever casting technique is used, it is essential to \"buddy tape\" the little and ring fingers (with an intervening layer of padding) in order to control axial malrotation of the  fracture.   Although the acceptable degree of angulation at the fracture is controversial, as much as 50-60\u00b0 of angulation may be tolerated with little or no functional deficit. This level of angulation is especially true for boxer's fractures of the 5th metacarpal neck. Despite acceptable functional results, this degree of angulation usually alters the dorsal knuckle contour and may result in a tender mass (palmar) with heavy gripping. Though quite unusual, fracture rotation is an indication for surgical intervention.  Your description may indicate some degree of axial rotation. I suggest that you have to consult your surgeon, who will be in a better position to judge the degree of malrotation (if any) & then to decide if any corrective surgery may be required.  Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello and thank you for the reply.  I'm right-handed and that's the affected hand. I've been able to bend the pinky fully recently whenever I clench my fist so that's an improvement. However the malrotation still occurs and my pinky seems to force itself over the ring finger whenever I grip onto something with strength. You mentioned that buddy taping is required to prevent malrotation from occuring after the cast is removed but the cast the doctor put on for me only restricted the pinky and there was no buddy taping so I think this was the reason I'm having the problem now.  I won't be able to see the doctor until next week. What I''m anxious to know is if this issue will eventually correct itself and my pinky will be able to fold parallel to the other fingers instead of crossing over the ring finger without surgery?  Thanks again.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear xelibri,  Any surgery has a risk of complications.  Finger mal-rotation surgery is not commonly done and the little finger is able to tolerate mal-rotation more than the other digits.  Your surgery is exactly as described previously by yourself...you have a scar about 3-5cm over the metacarpal.  The bone is exposed and a saw used to make a cut in the bone.  The rotation is corrected and the bone is fixed with a plate and screws.  Recovery expect 4- 6 weeks for fracture union and about a couple months of physio/rehab.  Complications 1) stiffness.... this is common, and I would say almost guaranteed, and may last several years.  Infection - about 1-2% risk of deep infection.  Infection in bone is very difficult to get rid of.  Nerve injury rare but possibly may give you an area of numbness in your hand, or a painful neuroma. Lump over the osteotomy.  This is likely even if the correction is anatomic and largely a result of scar tissue.  I do not recommend correction of little finger unless 1) more than 50% of the little finger tip is covered when making a fist. 2) there is significant difficulty in getting a good grip 3) there is distressing cosmetic deformity.  Complications of metal work removal outweigh the benefits from it in most situations.  Cheers  Saif\n\n",

    "title": "Avulsion Fracture of Ischial Tuberosity. Please Help!",
    "content": "Please read this, I am desperate for answers! About 3 years ago, when I was around 13, I started to feel a minor pain in my left hip while playing backyard football. It wasn't a bad pain and only came when i ran so i just ignored it. Eventually, we went to the doctor and they said it was an IT band syndrome. So I had some physical therapy for it which made it feel better but the pain was still there when i would run but this time it felt like it had moved into the top of m hamstring. So after I played a season of contact football my freshman year, we got an X-ray which showed nothing unusual and the doctor just thought the injury was moving around and said that was a good thing. So he thought it was some sort of tear or pull in the top part of my hamstring and sent me back to physical therapy again which did the exact same thing as last time, made it feel a lot better but i could still feel it lingering there. So i started working out with football and i played another season on it because it just felt very tight when i worked out and ran with bearable pain but it also was pretty painful to sit in the hard chairs at school. After that season i went to the doctor again and we took an X-ray and an MRI and the X-ray showed that there was a crack in my ischial tuberosity bone or ischium bone in my pelvis. I think they called it an Avulsion fracture. So after a delayed diagnosis of the injury, they told me to stay off of it for 3-4 months. No running or weightlifting and he told me to do hamstring strenthening exercises with the trainer at my high school for 15 weeks. So when we went back to the doctor he said I could start weightlifting and running again with the team. So after a couple days it felt fine like it was all better but about after a week of being with the team, the pain came back again and now its been about 2 weeks of doing no running or anything and the pain is still there like it was before. I love playing football and with this injury persisting I just don't know what to do anymore. Should I get surgery? I want it to be better before this football season in August. ANY suggestions, tips or reccomendations would be GREATLY appreciated and helpful\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, If indeed this is a complete avulsion fracture of the hamstring attachment at the ischial tuberosity surgical repair is indicated.  I would suggest a sports orthopedist who has experience with this kind of injury.  With this kind of fracture, the average length of time (according to one study) from injury to surgical repair was 12 months.  This tells me the fracture is often missed because the symptoms appear as a high hamstring sprain in which case imaging is not needed.   If you have surgery, discuss the risks and benefits beforehand.  Problems with the sciatic nerve can result from surgery. Take care and let us know how it goes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The terrible triad of the elbow is dislocation, fracture coronoid and fracture radial head.   Sounds like this was a terrible biad (no fractured radial head).   Since the fracture was classified as type I, that means the tip of the proximal ulnar was chipped off (versus types II and III in which the coronoid portion of the ulnar shatters into multiple pieces).   With rehab, you should be able to regain full mobility of the elbow but it will take some time. Did the orthopedist fix the fracture with sutures or a screw?  And are you allowed to do range of motion exercises yet. Take care and let us know how it goes.\n\n",

    "content": "Whoa, thanks for the reply, I greatly appreciate that.  I know this is a bit late, but my injury has taken a turn for the worse.  I was splinted for one week, then I was in a sling for about 4 more weeks.  The physician (who was orthopedic surgeon, although not a very good one IMO) just told me to do some simple ROM exercises to re-gain my mobility.  I also work as a Kinesiologist and did some ultrasound on myself along with ROM exercises.  I saw a Physiotherapist, who did some manual manipulation of my elbow to increase the ROM, however it has not really improved.  I even tried acupuncture. My elbow range currently both in extension and definitely in flexion has decreased.  If I sleep on my arm it's quite numb in the morning.  Physical activity for me wasn't too bad a couple of months ago.  I was actually starting to get back into my gymnastics training.  Now my elbow hurt tremendously again.  I feel I've exhausted so many options for treatment and I'm not sure what to do anymore.  Most physicians in Canada just look at me and shrug, followed with a \"if it hurts then don't do it\" but that now includes so many things.  By the way, and strangely enough, the pain is not anywhere near my coronoid.  All of the pain I feel in both extension and flexion is located near my medial epicondyle.  Any thoughts?  Advice?  I'm extremely frustrated and now I fear for the long term effect of the injury..\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Competitive Gymnast with Coronoid Fracture",
    "content": "Dear Xyrodon,  Trouble is that the coronoid fracture is a actually only a small part of your injury.  A joint is not meant to dislocate, (err... was that obvious?), so there are structures about that stop you elbow dislocating.  Your coronoid process is just one.  By the sounds of things, only a small segment of the coronoid was involved (type I means only a 1/3 or less involved), otherwise you would have had surgery to fix it.   You must therefore have also damaged the joint capsule and probably the medial collateral ligament.  These are not visible to X-rays.  So how do you manage this?  Well the elbow is vulnerable to redislocation.  This should be assessed at the time of reduction of the elbow.  If the elbow is unstable, then clearly some protection is needed.  The downside of splinatge however is the way th body heals.  It heals with scar tissue, your body's glue.  It stick broken bits together and torn structures get enveloped in this mass of fibrous and inelastic tissue.  Result... a stable but stiff elbow.  How to manage?  Well, aggressive physiotherapy sounds initially like a good idea.  In the olden days it was actually considered a no-no.  That's because aggressive physiotherapy it had been suggested leg actually to progressive increasing stiffness;  it was thought this was due the injury of physiotherapy itself leading to more scar tissue.  The result is that orthopaedic surgeons generally say no to passive exercises of the elbow...only do active exercises within limits of pain.  Passive stretching therefore would have been contra-indicated and possibly (only possibly) harmful;  I know physiotherapists and surgeons who have quite conflicting opinions on the issue.  Worst case scenario?  You could get a condition called myositis ossificans...what's that? I am not supposed to be scaring you?  Ooops sorry..withdraw that remark.  pretend I didn't put that in...myo what? never heard of it...  How would I proceed? Review with your orthopaedic surgeon.  I can not comment without having you in front of me...but if we are certain you are not getting better, and want to go the next step up the therapeutic ladder... I  would probably arrange an MRI scan and follow this up with an arthroscopic athrolysis, after putting in my usual get out clause...\"this might make you better, but could make you worse\"  Good luck  Saif\n\n",

    "title": "The Cure for Short Height?",
    "content": "------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  My question is,   Are any researchers, scientists trying to figure out a way to achieve the ability to make people grow, AFTER they've reached their adult height? And AFTER their growth plates have turned to bone and fused together?  Or have researchers and scientists feel they've already accomplished/achieved this, with the creation/release of Human Growth Hormone made available by doctors to teenagers and children only NOT adults.  Or  Are scientists and researchers trying to accomplish to be able to make it possible for ADULTS to grow? Have you heard of any research or any groups/companies pursuing this at all, in the grapevine? At all? It would be nice to hear of someone, some group, some company whom have ambitions to achieve this. It would make my day a little brighter.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  I know there's a market for people who want to grow taller. A huge market. Like the industry for weight loss, which is HUGE, considering there's millions of people, no...make that billions...no...make that infinite numbers of people who want to lose weight...in fact, pretty much almost every girl wants to lose weight...a pound or two..  The industry for weight loss is enormous. WeightWatchers, weight loss products, weight loss gyms, magazines, weight loss food promising lower calories, no fat...milkshakes that serve as a complete dinner..   There's also an industry for people who want to gain muscle. There's thousands of products out there. Whey Protein, human growth hormone, steroids, magazines.  And the same goes for height. There's a huge potential industry for it. How do i know this? Well, when Human Growth Hormones came out and was announced. People all over, thousands of ADULT men asked if Human Growth Hormone can make them grow. Which the unfortunate answer they got was that the growth plates fuse together and become bone material after 18 years of age. (I asked my doctor the same thing and he gave me the same answer...)  Don't forget. The response to the desire to gain a few inches by women, have given birth to High heeled shoes. Now, literally almost every woman wears high heeled shoes. Even the tall women wear them. If a woman is 5'10, chances are very likely that she'll still wear high heels on an occasional basis, because the additional height will make her look even better. Now, almost every shoe store sells high heeled shoes and they are sold very very well. A huge business for high heel.  Well, there are some scam sites and hoax formulas and products out there that are trying to tap into people's desire to grow taller. So, already there is a market for it, as small and tiny as it is. Even if the market is totally incapable and false and can not deliver its promises. There is already a market, people making websites promising legitimate products that can make people grow. ( http://www.growth-flex.com/growthflex.html )  that claim, \"IS IT NOW POSSIBLE TO IMPROVE YOUR HEIGHT?\"  \"Most people stop growing taller sooon after puberty, but more continue to grow. Researchers are starting to understand the mechanism behind this difference\"  Don't know if they're saying that you can continue to grow after puberty and after 18 years of age. Some claim you stop growing at 25. Don't know which is right.  Another example is, in China, alot of people are currently having a height craze. Where they're undergoing surgery on their legs to extend their length. How can normal average citizens afford this? I have no clue. But obviously, there's a huge market that already exists in China for the desire to increase height. And this is how China have pursued the industry to satisfy the mass desire of the populace to increase a person's height  But, my question is, as huge the potential for the market for people who want to lose weight, there's a huge potential market for people who want to gain height, for men and women alike.  And Bovine Growth Hormone came so close, to achieving that. For the entire skeletal structure, every bone grows in syncrony, so that the person, having gained height, doesn't look abnormal, but like any regular tall dude or dudette. So, he passes as if he just continued to grow, no abnormally long legs like surgery would give him the appearance of.  If not for the bone cancer and the extra space in the head, failed growth of the brain to compensate for the additional space, to go along with the bone growth.\n\n",

    "content": "Growth is actually quite a fascinating thing.  Boys and girls will experience a growth spurt during puberty where they will gain a significant amount of height.  After this growth spurt, both boys and girls will continue to grow, but generally only a little more-they won't be growing 6 or 7 inches more.   The reason for this lies in the growth plates, as you have suggested.  The same hormones that induce puberty and the growth spurt also induce growth plate closure.  Once the growth plates are closed, growth is essentially finished.  Growth hormone can be given to children before their growth plates are closed to induce some growth; however, after their growth plates close it becomes inneffective.  To my knowledge, there are no current treatments for short stature as an adult.  I am also not aware of any research in that area.  Hope this helps address your questions.\n\n",

    "content": "Hey,   I am an 18 year old male and am fairly confident that I am done growing. My doctor claimed I would hit about 5'11, he was right.  I am about 5'10-1/2\"     I have heard/read some articles on growth..childishly hoping perhaps, that I may find a product that works and grow at least 3-4 in to hit a little over 6 ft.   Some sites/companies/ doctors claim the growth plates close around early 20's, some say it occurs earlier.  Which is more accurate?   Call me stupid, but do growth pills work?  Do any of them work? Is it right to reject all who claim their's works?  Many websites CLAIM research and tests prove their items can cause growth anywhere from 2 to 6+ in. without side effects and with full skeletor and muscle growth along with height, in an even, 'natural' growth spurt (allowing for a natural look, and keeping stress off your body with an even growth).  Sorry for the repetition, I only seek to be accurate in what I am trying to express.  Does anyone have an answer to these questions? I would really appreciate it.  Sincerely,  ~Ghost~  Isn't it possible though, to arouse growth hormones and get a few more in. in before the plates close for good?\n\n",

    "content": "There are no exercises or pharmaceutical remedies that will increase height after the growth plates have fused.  Growth hormones applied after the growth plates have fused result in a condition called acromegally, resulting in coarse features and other problems.  I know that height is an issue for many people.   It is question of \"body image\", I guess, and as an orthopaedic surgeon, I generally advise against height adjustment procedures.  This does give significant risk to someone who is otherwise healthy.  Having said that, many people feel that will be more attractive, have better career prospects etc and are willing to accept these risks.  Surgical limb lengthening procedures are usually directed towards the femurs and tibiae, breaking the bones, and gradually pulling them longer using either frames or expanding intra-medullary nails..  Over-lengthening produces a disproportionate body, with long legs and short looking trunks.  Risks are many, but too often brushed aside by both patients and clinicians who are eager to please.  Counselling is very important.\n\n",

The Xray showed the fracture is not properly healed, it was in a cast for 2 weeks, then 3 weeks..I had it for a week without knowing...  Anyway, ive noticed swelling in my armpit, doctor said its lymph node and that its most probably due to the broken bone in my hand.. The swelling is on the right armpit, and the fracture is in my right hand.   I noticed small swelling and tenderness about 2 weeks ago in my armpit, but since yesterday its gotten larger and more tender and red on the skin. Is this normal? I also think i am fighting a small chest infection. The size of the node feels small enough, about 1-2cm at the most, and its quite rubbery/tender...Its not painful, more uncomfortable.

    "content": "Hi, The broken metacarpal by itself would not be normally expected to cause enlargement of the axillary lymph node.However, skin lesions (excoriations,furuncles etc) may occur under the casts which can certainly cause this.Any other septic lesion in the area of drainage of the axillay lymph nodes must also be excluded.  If these are excluded, then, most clinicians would perhaps start a course of antibiotics and observe the response.If the 'acute lymphadenitis' does not respond in a week or two, further investigations(such as Fine needle aspiration-FNA or an open biopsy) may be needed.

    "content": "Absolutely agree with Dr Kamath.  If the fracture of the 5th metacarpal occurred with minimal trauma (you suggest that you had had it for a week without knowing about it) then it is imperative that you exclude conditions that can lead to spontaneous fractures.  Normally fractures of the 5th Metacarpal do heal readily...although they may heal with some deformity, so I am not clearly what you mean by \"not healed properly\"...  If there has been no signs of progress towards healing, and certainly if there was no history of trauma to cause the fracture I would agree that a biopsy is more important than antibiotics.  If the lymph node is not painful (most infected lymph nodes are) then again biopsy should be high on the list of priorities.  Best wishes  Saif\n\n",

    "content": "To whom it may concern,  I've stumbled across this site while searching for unanswered question and or information on UBC (Bone Cyst in the upper Humerus) of my 9yr old son. Yesterday was the third fracture in this area after the cyst went undetected on the first occurrence. Only later (second fracture) we were recommended to a peadiatric orthopedic surgeon who later prognosed time as the cure. Firstly, for the fracture to heal then another period of 6-8 weeks for the cyst or bone to repair on it's own, as we were told that there is a high percentage of cases that do recover that way. Five months ago we seemed to be heading on the right track as the Doctor asked us to return six months later to review the progress.  Unfortunately we have not made it and are back at square one i.e . Day two of another fracture and the cyst still there. After a telephonic conversation with our orthopedic surgeon, who plans to see us in two weeks time to discuss the options/ path forward, has requested that we consider supporting or strengthening the bone with \"rods\". This of course, I'm assuming will be major surgery and will come with its own complications.   In order for my own education could you assist with the following:  - Where could I find detail on this bone support procedure the surgeon may use? - Why won't the surgeon treat the cyst by injection? or other? - Supporting the bone does nothing for the root cause. i.e. treating the cyst.  Kind regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, First of all, my sympathies for you and your son.  Here is an update on my son, that may or may not help you.  After our intial visit to the E.R in January, we were refered to a local orthopedic surgeon.  He treated only the fracture, which consisted of wearing a sling for a few weeks, and then monthly checkups with x-rays to monitor the fracture.  Once the fracture healed, the doctor then refered us to an specialist in bone tumors/cysts in Spokane, WA.  Dr. Andrew Howlett from Providence Orthopedics Specialties. I don't know your location, but here is the number (509) 464-7880, maybe speaking to someone here may help you find a specialist in your area. Anyway, in April we went to see the specialist he suggested two possible options for treatment.  The first treatment was bone cutterage and graphing.  This procedure involves removing the cyst and inserting bone graft material from a cadaver into the hollowed cavity.  There is no need to find a match for this bone graft.  This treatment is supposed to stimulate new bone growth. The second option was to wait and see if the bone cyst would correct itself or move farther away from the growth plate so a more conclusive surgery can be performed.  I say this because my son's cyst was so close to the growth plate that the doctor wouldn't risk going near it to remove all the the cyst.  Of course everything is patient specific, the location of cyst, the existing fractured area, the size and the risk for re-injury.  My son's cyst was very large and close to the growth plate. If my son were to have fallen and recieve a break on the growth plate this could have stunted the growth of his arm. So, we decided to have the surgery, however we were informed that there was ~20% chance the cyst would reoccur.  My very confident doctor informed us that his success rate for this surgery was higher than the norm. He specifically said that steroid injections(which I researched online) is hardly practiced anymore and not effective.   We could've waited but that would have meant putting my very active boy in a bubble for at least a year, and hope that nothing would happen to his arm in the meantime.  My son's bone we were later informed was \"less than an eggshell\" as far as stability. So the doctor had to place a metal rod on his bone during surgery for added strength.  This rod doesn't need to be removed because it will not disrupt growth in his arm, the growth plate is above and below the metal rod.  So basically the section of bone the rod is attached to will not grow. Two weeks after surgery we went for a follow-up appt, the x-rays revealed no new bone growth, but it really is too soon to tell.  The good news is that we could clearly see the bone graft material, which is good because sometimes this can be reabsorbed into the bone.  I was informed that my doctor freezes the bone with liquid nitrogen during surgery to help prevent this from happening, which I believe is a fairly new procedure.   So now its another ~4 weeks in the sling with orders for physical therapy.  After 4 weeks we will get another set of x-rays and it's my prayer that we'll see new bone growth. Feel free to keep e-mailing me with questions.  Blessings!\n\n",

    "title": "fractured shoulder severe muscle spasms",
    "content": "Two and a half weeks ago I fell and my humerous is cracked just below the ball part of the bone so they are calling it a shoulder fracture.  I was in the hospital from Monday night till Wednesday afternoon and experienced severe sharp pains that I think are muscle spasms in the upper arm .  They started that first day.  The strong pain and muscle relaxer meds I got in the hospital through IV and pills upon release are not helping.  The bone is aligned and surgery is not needed.  I saw the Specialist a week after release and new x-rays show it is still aligned.  I was put in an immobilizer that holds my arm next to my body and my hand next to my stomach.  I take my hand out 3 or 4 times per day to exercise my fingers, wrist and elbow.   The spasms hit me suddenly and are severe but pass very quickly. They make my arm feel sore but the sharp pain only lasts for a second at a time but I am having over 50 of these a day. They usually happen if I move in some way but sometimes while I am sitting still. I can just take a deep breath and will have one.  If I am riding in a car they will happen if the car takes a turn or if the road is bumpy.  They often happen when I move to either stand from a seated position or if I sit down.  The shoulder area where the break is only aches a little bit at times.  The sharp sudden pain is about half way down my upper arm and I'm not really sure if they are muscle spasms or if there is a pinched nerve or something else.  The Orthopedic Dr I saw in the hospital and for the follow up has seen me when this severe pain hits me but only says muscle spasms are normal because I''m not using the muscles.  I have reminded him they started the very first day so I don't feel they started because I am not using the muscles.  I am concerned there is something else wrong with me but he is just dismissing me saying they will stop when I get out of the immobilizer in 3 to 4 weeks.  He doesn't think an MRI is necessary to see if there is some muscle, nerve or other damage.  I don't know what to do.  The sharp pains wear me out.  I move very slowly and carefully trying to avoid them but they continue.  I am really concerned that I will continue to have these even after the bone is healed or that I could have long term damage.  If something is torn or damaged causing these will it heal on it's own?  Should I see a different Dr?  Any insights, suggestions and information would be greatly appreciated!\n\n",

Imaging and neurological testing is also important to do of the cervical spine. As a rule of thumb, the joints above and below the injured part should be assessed.

    "content": "I badly rolled my ankle last week playing basketball and am still experiencing discomfort. I am (and have been) able to move my toes and even put limited weight on my foot. I can walk now, but have a slight limp. There is swelling on both sides of my foot towards the soul of my foot. It has been exactly 7 days since the injury. I've sprained my ankle in the past, and was typically fully recovered within 4-5 days. I have taken all necessary steps to reduce swelling (elevation + icing), which has subsided the swelling, however, as I've mentioned, I still have a slight limp. I haven't seen much improvement in the last 2-3 days. Just wondering if I should be concerned that it might be something more serious than an ankle sprain. Thanks\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Ankle sprain or fracture?",
    "content": "Hi, Missed fractures (occult fractures) around the ankle and in the foot do occur at times. The most commonly missed fractures are that of the talus, the bone that articulates with the lower ends tibia and fibula, forming the ankle joint proper.  Other fractures that are known to be missed at first presentation are... - fractures of the base of the fifth metatarsal bone, - calcaneal stress fractures ,and  - tibiofibular syndesmotic injuries.  Fractures of the talar dome (the most commonly missed), are usually the result of inversion injuries of the ankle. They are located medially or laterally on the talar dome with equal frequency and occasionally through both. Lateral talar dome fractures are almost always associated with trauma, while medial talar dome fractures can be traumatic or atraumatic.  Fractures of the base of the fifth mata-tarsal bone(styloid process) can present with swelling over the outer aspect of the foot.  All these fractures present like ankle sprains and can be missed on routine plain X-ray projections.They tend to show up on plain films weeks after the injury.  As you have not responded satisfactorily to the conservative management for the 'ankle sprain', it will be best to consult an orthopedic surgeon and exclude any underlying fractures such as the ones mentioned above. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,    My son fell off a handrail 3 months ago and almost completely tore his tricep tendon from the olecranon. This was misdiagnosed for 3 weeks as soft tissue damage, so he had no treatment other than a sling. He finally (after much pushing from me to get secondary x-rays and an ultrasound) was correctly diagnosed and had surgery to reattach the tricep tendon.   After surgery he had a half cast for 3 weeks then a splint for 4 weeks with no exercise of the arm.   He's now undergoing light physiotherapy with minimal progress, he can almost fully open his arm but can close it to only approx 90 degrees.   His doctors have been very vague about his eventual recovery, even though I've asked them every time I see them.   My question is how long (generally speaking) does it take til you know it's as good as it's going to get? I (and my son) are prepared for whatever we get told, whether it's that it won't improve anymore, or it'll take 12 months to regain maximum flexibility.   I understand this is a very rare injury, but any insight or advice would be tremendously appreciated.  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, His progress actually sounds pretty good - almost full extension and 90 degrees flexion.  You are correct that this is an uncommon injury.    He will likely have some deficit in the elbow to what degree I do not know.  It depends on his age, his activity level, his dedication to rehab and any re-injury.  I would expect the range of motion to reach 90% of normal.  At some point the stretching for flexion will need to be aggressive (but wait until the surgeon gives the ok - the reattached tendon must be fully healed before cranking on the elbow).  The strength will come but will take 8-12 weeks. So I would anticipate rehab will be for 6 months.  Come Decemeber/January he will have reached maximum potential.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you so much for your reply Tom. Since this happened I have scoured the internet for information, of which there is relatively little. I truly appreciate the time you took for your response. Since first writing, my son has gained perhaps 5 degrees further flexion. He's now on a bit more intensive rehab, previously he was just flexing and relaxing his arm with no pressure. Now they have him using a 2 kilogram weight and also applying some pressure to his arm during flexion exercises. He's only 16 but has been very good at maintaining his own exercise regime which is a miracle within itself as 16 year olds normally need reminding 85 times to do anything ! I did allow him to start using his skateboard again about a month ago as he really missed it, but after splitting his chin open and another trip to the emergency room the skateboards off limits. Although the chin injury happened because as he fell he instictively didn't put his injured arm down to stop himself.  Thanks again for your response, take care, Kelly.\n\n",

    "content": "My son has finally made a full recovery, but only after a second surgery.  After making no further progress in movement for almost 8 months I consulted an orthopaedic surgeon who was brilliant. He discovered further irregularities in my sons injury, most tricep avulsion recovery limitations are in extension, whereas my son could fully extend, but couldn't flex past the 90 degrees. Following the first surgery his arm was completely immobilised for 8 weeks.  The surgeon re-opened the initial incision site and discovered that the immobilisation had caused the whole elbow to be 'gunked' up with scar tissue, which he then cut out. Then forced my sons arm into full flexion, strapping it there for 2 days. After 2 months of aggressive physiotherapy 3 times a week his arms finally back to normal.  I'd urge anybody reading this with a similar injury to not settle for a possible permanent disability. I had 4 different consultations who said that my son just had to learn to live with it. All it took was one specialist who cared enough to research the problem, be convinced that it was worth opening his arm up again to see if he could discover what the problem was, he even rearranged his whole surgical schedule to bump the procedure from a 7 month waiting list to 2 weeks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi all,  Hoping that someone out there can give me some help.  I have been struggling with an injury in my right big toe for the past month or so.  I was playing football (soccer, depening on your geographical location :P) in early December, and during the game I was tripped by a player on the opposite team. I'm not too sure exactly what happened but I fell forwards and I think my right foot jammed in the floor (I play indoors on concrete) and I fell forwards.  Immediately after this, I felt a pain in my big toe (although it was quite slight) and I felt a sever pain in the area around where my hip meets the gluteus muscle. This pain was severe and affected me when I tried to run in the rest of the game.  The following day I didn't have the hip pain, but the toe pain persisted. I tried to keep off it, and it's been feeling slightly better since (I've not been playing football since the injury) but it's still not 100% healed.  There seems to be a swelling on the base of the big toe, which has subsided slightly but is still present even today. It  causes me pain when I bend my toe fully downwards, where there is a sharp pain around the bump. It feels almost like I am pulling ligaments/tendons which are trapped within the bump? There is practically no pain when I bend the toe upwards.   When I walk for a long time, there seems to be a pain in the ball of my foot, but it subsides when I stop walking and then feels fine when I'm off my toe.  Any ideas what this could be? Do I need to see a doc?!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It sounds like you have sprained your first MTP (metatarsal phalangeal) joint...aka turf toe.  Turf toe can be treated with rest, ice, anti-inflamatory medicine and gradually return to sport.  Sometimes taping or a stiffer shoe is needed to support the toe.   Difficulty as you have mentioned is walking, running and pushing off the toe - all movements required of football (soccer).   An xray may help rule out an avulsion fracture.    Seeing your family physician for an xray order and some physiotherapy would be appropriate.    Take care and keep us posted.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Healing Boxers Fracture",
    "content": "Hi, \"Boxer's fracture\", bar room fracture or \"brawler's fracture\" usually occurs at the neck of the metacarpal of the little finger (but can also mean fractures of the necks of the other metacarpals as well).   Mostly some form of immobilisation of the fracture is required.  Two aspects that are usually taken into consideration are  a) the degree of angulation and  b) minimizing axial rotation.  Whatever casting technique is used, it is essential to \"buddy tape\" the little and ring fingers (with an intervening layer of padding) in order to control axial malrotation of the fracture.  As to how long to keep the cast, the protocols vary between orthopedic surgeons.Also, whether a patient could be followed up at fairly short intervals,the follow-up findings,the degree of angulation and axial rotation.  There are some who would apply a cast for a week and then follow it up with mobiization of the finger.  Another protocol would be to apply a cast for 4-6 weeks and then allow mobilization and intermittent splinting.  So, without first-hand knowledge of the exact type of fracture in your case it may not be possible to offer a plan of management. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: knee injury playing soccer",
    "content": "Hi, It is likely from your description that you suffered an injury to the 'medial collateral ligament' (MCL) of the knee.  'Medial collateral ligament' injuries cheifly occur in three situations.... - contact injuries (due to a direct blow to the outer side of the       knee, causing it to open up in its inner aspect,   thus stretching the MCL.  - Non-contact, or indirect injuries occur during    deceleration,cutting, and pivoting motions.    Usually a partial tear results. - Overuse injuries which usually occur in swimmers.  At times, the deep part of ligament becomes damaged and this may lead to tears of the medial meniscus of the knee joint.   It is probable that your injury belongs to the Non-contact variety.  If your problem should continue to bother you, you may need an MRI scan to assess the injury and perhaps to decide if non-operative means (support bandage or plaster cast, 'local' ultrasound or laser therapy) would be adequate of if surgery is indicated.

    "content": "Broken Femur-mis aligned bone frag? Hi I broke my femur (comminuted rotated butterfly femur fracture-shaft) in a car accident on th 8th of Aug 2009. My Doc put in an IM titanium rod, with 3; 4.5mm dist screws, to stablise and align the fracture. My question is, in the xray, there is a piece of bone: which is not too big, but not small at all, rotated, and thats not aligned-so much so that there is a bump on my thigh. Is this normal? Its approx 35 degrees in angle against the femur. Its not callus beacuse its been there since day1. Also, when i bend my leg, i feel that frag moving, which is my biggest issue. I guess its always interfiering with my Quadriceps. Should the doc have reduced the fracture completely or is the piece thats not in alignment okay? Is the movement of the frag causing non-growth. also will it make it more sensitive when it does heal i.e, easy to refracture in the future? I came to kenya for vacation (was born n raised here) from the US for vacation, and this happend 2 days before i was supposed to leave. I am 19 yrs old male 6ft2 190lbs. don't smoke. Also, are the chances of non-union higher because of the piece? My ROM is excellent and muscle strength is not bad...I am currently on 50% WeightBearing. My xrays show no growth at the frag and slow growth at the very tiny pieces that are the only ones in contact!  Thank you so much for reading this...i really want to go out and play Basketball!

    "title": "Re: Femur Fracture non union",
    "content": "Hi, Femoral shaft fractures can be classified with the Winquist classification or the AO/OTA classification. The Winquist classification is based on the extent of comminution.   Type I represents a femoral shaft fracture with no comminution or a small butterfly fragment <25% of the bone.  Type II is a comminuted femoral shaft fracture with a butterfly fragment 50% or less of the width of the bone.  Type III is comminuted with a large butterfly fragment >50% of the width of bone.  Type IV is severe comminution of an entire segment of bone. Type V is a fracture with segmental bone loss.  Generally larger the butterfly fragment, more are the chances of non-union.  Isolated femoral shaft fractures treated with IM rods are expected to do well with nearly 90-100% union, <1% infection, and <10% incidence of malunion.  The fact that you are now 50% weight bearing indicates that the bone healing had been progressing well.It is probable that a small fragment of bone is still attached(pedicled) to the quadriceps or it could be an organised hematoma.  You must consult your ortho surgeon who will be able to assess and address your concerns. Best wishes!\n\n",

However, I moved and had to see a different surgeon and was told I can come back next week to get the cast removed and placed in a boot and that I am healing well and can start putting some weight on my foot.  I tried putting a little bit of weight but I start to feel pain so I stop.  Is this normal?  Everything I have been reading goes against putting weight on the injury so early so I don't want to interfere with the healing process by putting weight on it now.\n\n",

    "title": "Pain in lower left leg.  (Calf area)",
    "content": "Hello, for the past two weeks, I've been experiencing pain and a clicking sensation in what feels like the fibula area?  What happened was I took a pretty hard knee into the left side of my left leg directly onto my calf muscle.  Almost immediately, I could feel my leg buckl under my knee and a sharp pain deep in or maybe behind my calf muscle on the bone.  I iced it for two days after along with an application of ICY HOT before going to bed.   The strange thing is that the calf muscle itself does not actually feel pain a week later.  The most significant change is there is a clicking sensation behind the muscle on what I'm assuming to be the fibula.  The clicking can be either painful or painless - most of the time, it just feels really awkward when it clicks.  The clicking persists in any kind of movement.  Whether walking, going up/down stairs, moving my leg while I sleep, or even just massaging it, there will be a clicking noise and feeling.  As for strength and range of motion, I am having trouble starting flatfooted and extending onto my tiptoes.  Balancing on my left leg seems more of a challenge now.  And doing any kind of jumping feels as if my leg just can't complete a full hop/jump.  I've already ruled out any knee damage - even though the knee into my calf was a really hard knee, it was well below the knee area (thank god) and centered mostly on the body of my calf.\n\n",

I have been wearing a sling as prescribed by my doctor but after 3 weeks he said it is not healing.

He said to continue to wear the sling and come back in three weeks.  I am a little worried about this diagnosis mainly because out of all my research I have yet to see any information on a nonunion clavicle healing not with bone, but with fiber.   \tPlease advise me with some information so that I can better understand what is going on.  This is the same doctor that preformed surgery on the same shoulder on Feb 12, 2009 for a level 5 separation. What does it mean to heal with fiber instead of bone?\n\n",

    "title": "Inflammation of Right Middle Finger",
    "content": "The middle finger on my right hand has been swollen/inflamed nearly constantly since the end of August.  The swelling is greatest around the minor knuckle, but the area in between the major knuckle and minor knuckle is also quite inflamed.  The area distal from my minor knuckle apparently has no swelling.   My entire middle finger is quite stiff.  I am able to move it, but sometimes it is moderately painful (about a 5 or 6, if 10 is the greatest pain I've ever felt).  It is usually very stiff overnight and when I first wake up.  It will usually wake me up overnight though, and it\u2019s very hard to find a position to sleep in which it does not bother me.  The pain can sometimes be sharp, but it is usually a very dull and aching pain (this is when nothing is touching it).  If I push on the inflamed part I feel slightly more pain, but not that much as the skin there (i.e. epidermis/dermis) feels numb.  I have good sensation distal from the minor knuckle, but very poor sensation between the minor and major knuckle.    Initially I thought this problem was due to repeated stress to the finger.  I would estimate that over the summer (May-August) I used a computer on average 40hrs per week.  My hand was nearly always on a mouse, and with the way my middle finger is positioned on the mouse when I use it, it seemed to me that I had strained it from overuse.  As best I can remember, I did not do anything else consciously that could have injured it.   The inflammation has increased over time.  It seems greatest when the weather is warm.  When the weather got very cool a few weeks ago my finger seemed to go back to near normal size and hurt me very little. But now the weather has gotten warmer again, it is bothering me more than ever.  I'm not saying that it is definitely related to the weather, but I have noticed these changes in it with the weather.   Therefore, I have begun to think that I could have some type of arthritis or autoimmune disease, or that something is seriously wrong.  I have had two med student friends examine my finger.  One said it may be a dislocation.  The other said it was likely not arthritis, but it could be broken.  Both recommended an x ray.  I tried taking Ibuprofen for a week.  I took Ibuprofen 200mg, 3 times per day (200 mg in morning, 400 mg at night with dinner), for this past week.  I seemed to find some minor alleviation of the problem with this (minor decrease in pain and minor decrease in inflammation), but overall the problem has not been solved.  Now that I have gone 2 days without the anti-inflammatory, the condition seems to be as bad as it has ever been.   I don't have health insurance, so I'd like to narrow down this problem as far as possible before going to the doctor.  I would prefer not to have to go the doctor or get an x-ray unless it is absolutely necessary.   Thanks for any help\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Allowing the stress fracture to heal is important. What was the cause of the stress fracture: spasms,overuse, trauma? If the bony islands in the ankle are causing pain and dysfunction then talk to your orthopedist about surgical removal. The thickening of achilles is probably due to chronic tendonitis. Essentially, address the stress fracture and bony islands first and consider the entire lower extremity function for long term injury prevention.  Do you wear braces?  Have you had physical therapy?  Any corrective surgery planned?  Hope this helps. Keep us posted.\n\n",

    "title": "Clavicle plate removal, arm and hand numbness and tingling",
    "content": "I had a plate fitted to my fractured left clavicle two years ago.  Earlier this month I had the plate removed.  10 days after surgery I quite suddenly felt intense pain down the inside of my left forearm through the elbow.  Since then (4 days ago) I have had decreased sensation in my left hand and intermittent tingling all over my left arm.  The surgeon says this can no way be due to the surgery and suggests maybe I have done something to the elbow.  I was worried I had done something to the nerve by overusing the left arm in terms of weight bearing or rotation at the shoulder but X rays show the clavicle itself is perfectly united.  I am looking for some reassurance (if appropriate) that this really is nothing to do with the clavicle and any further suggestions.  My family doctor is not concerned because there is no objective neurological deficit on examination, but it is not a nice feeling.  Thanks.\n\n",

A thorough neurological exam in the office is needed include assessment of neck, shoulder, elbow and hand.  If the symptoms persist or worsen, do an EMG and nerve conduction velocity test to assess the status of the nerve.   Take care\n\n",

    "content": "Hey. I broke my ankle in three places almost thirteen weeks ago. I had an operation where one large screw, several small screws and one plate was put in. About ten days ago I had another operation to remove the large screw. My cast also came off that day. They told me to bear weight on it gradually and I should be off the crutches in two weeks. However it's now ten days later and I am still completley dependent on the crutches. What am I doing wrong? I am not due to return to the hospital for another two weeks and was wondering if you could recommend some exercises I could be doing in the time being? Thank you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: broken ankle rehab",
    "content": "Hello, Make sure the ankle has adequate dorsiflexion.  You can achieve this by actively working the toe or foot back toward you. You may also practice weight bearing by doing repetitive sit to stand maneuver keeping weight equally over both feet, leaning forward and standing then slowly sit down keeping equal weight over both feet.  Use arms only as needed.  Do this only in painfree manner and should not cause swelling.  Another practice is taking one step forward and one step back leading with either foot for several repetitions.  This should prepare you somewhat for regular gait without crutches.  Another option is to use a straight cane on the opposite side of the injured foot.  Advance the foot and cane in tandem and gradually reduce the amount of pressure or use on the cane over time.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Alright, barely one year ago I broke my 5th metacarpal, I broke it twice it the same 2 month period (long story). I had to have surgery with two temporary pins placed in, the doctor said my hand healed fast, and looked great, that was almost a year ago in December 09 when I got my cast off. I'm a very healthy 16 year old boy. I've taken lot's of protein since then and fair amounts of calcium, for a period of time I took Centrum Multi-Vitamins with a separate Vitamin D supplement. Weight bearing started soon after cast off but barely, In May that year started most of the weight bearing with lots of protein consumption.  My point is, I'm worried, That if I get into a self defense situation (which may happen soon) will I break my hand again? Given I have a tight fist, a straight punch, and attempt to use mostly if not only the first two knuckles. NOTE: I tested my strength a little, If I punch my other hand (fairly hard) I have no pain even if I hit it hard several times. Ive actually had a friend hold his hands out, and hit a few times with my right, my hand felt fine, knuckles turned red tho, but that's normal. So I don't think my hand will break, I just need reassurance.\n\n",

    "content": "I fell on my shoulder Sunday afternoon playing soccer - it was pretty painful, but it didn't cause me to exit the game.  At halftime I noticed it was sore and I iced a bump along my clavicle.  I proceeded to play the second half.  My shoulder was very sore that night and I had limited movement/flexibility. The bump is along the clavicle near near the AC joint and was fairly noticeable (you could definitely feel). I continued to ice on/off 20-30 min the rest of Sunday. It was stiff Monday morning and the bump was still there, but the soreness gradually went away throughout the day. I iced it again after work Monday night and it felt very good on Tuesday (most of my range of motion was back - only certain movements like pulling tape from a dispenser caused discomfort).  It also looked like the swelling was down.  So I decided to play soccer Tuesday evening w/ some discomfort, but not enough to stop playing. Today it is sore again and it seems like the bump is bigger.  The bone itself feels connected/consistent (compared to my other should/clavicle), except for the bump. I can press on the bump with some discomfort, but not excruciating pain.  I would think if it were broken, I would be in a lot of paint (and wouldn't be able to play soccer).  I haven't really noticed any bruising 3 days later.  I had a friend who broke his collarbone in high school (almost through the skin) and he was in tears until they numbed it - so maybe I am being paranoid.  Should this be the case?  Or is it possible the bone is just bruised?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi =)  My nose was broken as a child (unfortunately I was a victim of abuse by my father).  I did not receive medical attention at the time, nor did I know it was broken.  I am 25 years old now, and it is obvious my nose was broken -- it is noticably crooked, and I constantly have a pressure under one of my eyes and a dull headache originating in that area.  When I put pressure on my nose in the opposite direction it appears to be broken, the pressure lifts immediately and the headache is clear (pretty much the only time I am ever without a headache completely).  I am at a point in my life now where I do not want to live with this any more; I want this taken care of.  I can't afford big medical bills at the moment, but I do have Medicaid.  I do NOT want my face changed at all (as in plastic surgery); I just want it to be the way it is \"supposed\" to be, and mainly the chronic headache and pressure to be gone.   I have no idea where I need to go or whom I need to see to help me with this problem.  Since my insurance is not the best, I am a little worried about the quality of care I will receive.  I wanted to ask a doctor, what should my route of action be to take care of this issue?  What kind of doctor should I see, etc.? Thank you so much=) Kay\n\n",

I know they did xrays of my elbow (hit the pavement first upon impact), but I don't know if they did xrays of my ribs (they did all of the xrays on the right side).  I think they were also a little wary becuase there's a chance I could be pregnant.. (also a big cause of concern for the well-being of a potential fetus.).  So I guess my question is, is it possible for my ribs to just be bruised (no visible bruises on the skin) or should I ask for additional xrays be done?  Thank you and I appreciate any and all opinions/information provided!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I am sorry to hear about your accident.  From the sounds of your story the outcome could have been much worse.  It will be important to see your physician to evaluate the right side and examine the belly.  It will also be good to check on the status of pregnancy because abdominal pain in a female may also be caused from a failed pregnancy.  Yes, the ribs can be bruised.  Xrays should reveal fractures and injury to the lung.    Again, ask to see your physician ASAP for a complete history and physical of your symptoms.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,   I suffered a Maisonneuve Fracture about 10 months ago.  After the injury I was 3 months non-weight bearing and another 3 months after that still not participating in exercises, sports requiring twisting.  Aside from the injury to the syndesmosis I tore and sprained several ligaments in my ankle. My question is how long does it take to get back to normal.  Any exercises I do now that have any kind of twisting or cutting cause pain.  I haven't completely gone back to my usual routine for fear of further injury until my leg/calf/ankle seem strong enough.  I do also experience pain in my knee with these same twisting exercises.  My PT stated after three months of continuing the ankle exercises at home (which consisted of eversion/inversion/calf raises c/band) at this point I would be fine, running around and doing all I did previous to this injury but it really isn't the case. I do work out 6 days a week regardless of the stiffness/pain in my ankle or knee but I'm wondering if I'm causing more damage.  Do ligaments take this long to heal or are they easily aggrevated or injured after the initial tear?  Is there something else I should be doing or not doing?  Stopping exercising is not an option, I went 8 months without already and it was miserable.  How long do these type of fractures keep on bothering your bones/ligaments/activity?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The fracture to the proximal fibula itself should heal within 2 months.  The ligaments take a bit longer depending on the extent of the damage. A knee and ankle MRI would be indicated to see if there is damage inside the knee and how the ankle structures are situated. Other than that, exercise and activity should be as tolerated.   You may also consider bracing.  Severe ankle sprains should be braced for 6-12 months depending on activity level. Take care.\n\n",

With trauma to the rib cage, xrays will help determine if there are fractures and/or lung injury.  Once these are ruled out, you can expect recovery from 2-6 weeks depending on the extent of damage.    Treatment also include pain management to allow full deep breaths.  Return to activity is pain dependent so easy does it.  Take care.\n\n",

Everything I read is all about ganglion cysts but there is little to describe the difference between what one of those are like vs. what a bone tumor or other tumor would be like.

When I bent my wrist down when it hurt like this, I could see the bump VERY pronounced and a dent right above it. These little episodes come of gradually and randomly, there's nothing to set them off and there's been no injury in the past to my wrist. It will last for a few days, then go away on it's own.

Just kidding!!!  Sorry couldn't help myself, and very unprofessional I know.  The green discoloration is caused by the breakdown of the constituents of a bruise.  The bruise is actually cause by blood leaking into the damaged tissues.  Blood contains Haemoglobin, which is bluish when deoxygenated (hence the intial bruise is purple or blue) the Haem contains iron, and as it transforms from the ferric (orange) to the ferrous (green) form the bruise can go through a various shades of color.  The orthopedic surgeon is quite correct to reassure you that the discoloration itself is not much to worry about.  I hope your recovery will continue uneventfully, and once again apologise for my sense of humour     Regards  Saif\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 24 y/o female firefighter. About 3 -4 months ago after climbing a ladder fully geared to a second story window, I was climbing over the window sill and fell in onto my right hand. Onto a concrete floor( the whole building is made of concrete or some other similar hard surface so when we practice burns it wont burn) It had a little swelling (gone in a couple days) and some bruising at the time and didnt think anything of it.( Not to mention the adrenaline sorta minimized it) However at the base where my thumb meets the wrist more inside it the wrist thumb area it has grown more painful over the past few months. I have been instructed to work on my upper body strength and especially when doing push ups at that angle it is getting much more painful. Also I am starting to get a shooting pain from the wrist up the thumb as well. Other tasks are also starting to get painful. I did some research and am worried about a scaphoid fracture. ( would a scaphoid fracture not be swollen and not bruised this late into it) I am getting concerned and am wondering what this may be. I keep reading the scaphoid information online I have found and a lot of it sounds like my hand/ wrist.  I guess what I am asking does it sound like a scaphoid fracture? what other problems could it be?  and if it is a fracture of the scaphoid and this late after the fracture what now? I understand x rays are the only way to tell but I guess before I become one of those patients going in and freaking out I wanted some feedback. Thank you for your help.\n\n",

The more likely cause of the pain however is tenosynovitis of the thumb (deQuervain's tenosynovitis). This can be treated with NSAID, ice or heat or steroid injection.  Splinting may help too.  In either case, see your family doc for an accurate diagnosis.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, As long as the x-ray are satisfactory for healing and your orthopedist has approved bearing weight on the ankle, you can feel confident the bones are fine. However, the foot may not be ready for full weight bearing (since you have been off the foot for at least 7 weeks).    You may need to start with using crutches and placing only 25% weight and gradually work up to full weight. Again, check with your physician regarding the weight bearing status and \"easy does it\" at first.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 20 year old female, and have a history of endometriosis, ibs and collitis. Just over a year ago i woke up in the night with a shooting and crushing pain on the left hand side of my chest. The pain shot down my left arm and up my neck and into my left shoulder blade. I assumed i was having a heart attack the pain was that intense! After 30mins the pain slowly subsided. This continued for a few nights, i visited my GP who refered me to hospital. An ECG came back clear and a chest xray was also clear. At this point i was told it was chest inflammation and to take NSAID's.  I had also noticed a lump by this point on my 2nd rib down from my collar bone, on the left hand side next to my sternum- this is where the pains were starting, the lump was about 3cm x 2cm big. The dr advised this was just inflammation. Since then ( over 6 months ago) the lump has spread and it is pretty much the entire front of the rib now that has swollen up. It is really painful when pressed, and very hard. I have learnt to control the pain as best i can by moving my arms about into different positions, but this in itself is annoying! I am also having pain in my left breast and im unsure if it is hormonal or related to the rib pain. The pain now is mostly centralised along the rib and shoots through to my left shoulder blade. The pain doesnt intensify with exercize, its usually worse at night and i am completely unable to lie on my front without being in agony! My boyfriend has noticed (after giving me many back rubs to ease the pain!) that the muscles on my left shoulder blade and under my arm coming towards the left of my chest are all very stiff and hard and can be sort of moved around as if theyre not attached to anything! I am now in pain everyday and have been for a year which is annoying, but i am just worried as to why NSAID'S arent slowing the growth of this lump! It sometimes feels as if my chest is very tight, as if someone has crushed it and then let it go, but this doesnt affect my breathing. If anyone could please help i would be most grateful! Thank you\n\n",

    "content": "I had a second bunionectomy done in April 2009 2 years after the first on the same right big toe to straighten it out and remove some cartilage that had broken off.  I was recovering wonderfully and was in a normal shoe about 6 weeks with no pain.  Unfortunately, I dropped the a blunt object on that toe at the nail bed.  I immediately iced it and took some anti-inflam pills.  The nail never discolored beside a small white mark but I started feeling pain in the joint with walking.  X-rays were done and nothing broken but was told to rest it for about 3 weeks and check back.  The pain got worse even with just standing and to the touch and walking was painful.  MRI revealed a bone contusion in my big toe and I should wear my surgery shoe for 3-6 weeks more with no activity. R.I.C.E.  Which I did.  I started to feel better in a week and felt I was progressing but now I'm on week 8 and it seems worse again.  My job requires walking constantly which I have tried to limit but now even in the surgical shoe it hurts.  There is no swelling but the area around the joint does get red.  Hard to find information on this.  Could there be something more wrong now or is there anything that I can do to help the healing process?  I was told that contusions could turn into a fracture.  I will try anything to walk again with no pain.\n\n",

There's only a sliver of pain when I bend my wrist and quite a bit of pain when I lift heavy things for a while.

The following morning most of the underside of my finger (and the area slightly below) had turned bluish/purple/grey nearly up to the tip and the back part has bruised a bit on the joint area. Also my finger has swelled up a bit.  I can still move my finger a little forwards and backwards but I can hardly bend it.  It's been nearly 2 days and it's pretty much the same, I don't know what's happened to my finger and was wondering if it is either nothing to worry about and it will heal properly by itself or could it be anything serious that it's worth getting it checked out?\n\n",

For the next few days, buddy taping the 4th and 5th digits together will splint and protect the injured finger.  Afterward, start gentle motion. If the finger worsens or does not improve, see a physician. Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, A spinal disc condition could mean a lot of things.  Yes, the disc eventually can bulge or protrude and irritate a nerve. This is not life threatening but can cause pain,numbness and tingling in the lower extremities.  In the worse case, the bundle of nerves called the cauda equina can be pinched.  This is may cause numbness and weakness in the legs, numbness in the lower pelvic area and inability to urinate.  Although rare, cauda equina is an emergency due to the extent of nerve involvement and potential for permanent damage.  I have presented the worse case scenario which again would be unlikely given a disc problem which is not giving him mild problems at this point.  If he takes care of his back now, his chances of leading a healthy painfree life are fairly good (granted the damage to the disc at this point is not too great).    Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "I recently suffered a trauma to my chest & I'm wondering if I should go get it checked out or not. I was walking next to my car with my hands full, trying not to drop anything. I somehow slammed my right side under my breast into my side-view mirrior. Heard no cracking that I can recall. It was a very hard hit & it knocked the wind out of me & I couldn't catch my breath for a while. Got in bed that night & could barely move. Got up the next morning & there was no bruise like expected, but the area that I hit is EXTREMELY tender to the touch & I am having some slight discomfort breathing. I know there is really nothing that can be done about the rib but I just needed to know if I should make a trip to the dr's office or if I'm better off just taking Tylonal & icing it untill the pain goes away. I am currently on day 2 after the injury & still cannot catch my breath & having a very hard time sleeping but have pretty intense fatigue & am in pretty intense pain. Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "I broke my ankle in three places on 8 August. On 17 August I had ORIF surgery. On 28 August I hade stitches removed and consultation with doctor in fracture clinic. He told me that I would a) have a limp for the rest of my life,  b) undoubtedly have athritis (I am 64) and c) would probably need further surgery in the future. I was depressed bu have been doing everything I was told to do and was looking forward to shedding my cast on 25 September and trying to recuperate. Last week - about 7 September my injured leg started to tighten and swell more than normal so I got an appointment at fracture clinic and saw another doctor. He took one look at my xrays (the one's taken on 28 August - so post surgery) and said he wasn't happy with my ankle. Xrayed again and then I had a CT scan. I was then informed that I would have to have revision surgery because two of the bones were further apart than they should be. This is going to take place on Friday 17 September. Today I saw the surgeon and he kind of reassured me - well I suppose as much as he could. I am worried about the outcome of this second operation and wonder how long the recovery time will be. I am also concerned about the risks of revision surgery so soon after the original operation. Any advice would be welcome. Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "I injured my right ring finger in March while running and trying to catch a football coming from behind me.. not sure exactly what happened, and didn't know I had hurt it until after the play was over? I have not had health insurance for a while.  (job loss, can't afford the COBRA payments... same old story.)  I really couldn't afford an x-ray, and as I have broken fingers before, I assumed I would just need the typical rest, ice, NSAIDS, tape to other finger etc.  I thought it was going to be fine, but the overall healing process seemed to get about half way back to normal, and then stopped?  I still have pretty significant pain in the proximal inter-phalangeal joint (I believe that's right- had to look that up) and there is a slightly larger bump than before on the top of the knuckle, toward the outside of my hand.  The skin over that bump is consistently red, or appears extremely \"stretched\" when I bend the finger.  The finger is SIGNIFICANTLY swollen from the base to above that knuckle, and still won't bend all the way to a fist... Also cannot get it to align flush with middle finger when making a palm (!?) and I cannot fit any of my rings on that finger from before.  The tip of the finger consistently turns 100% numb if I do anything like writing or sewing, and while this may have nothing to do with it, the finger nail appears to be turning a very odd shape.. it seems to be getting much flatter and wider?  Does this sound like something that could be a potential problem, or should I just hang in there?  I know these things take a while to heal, but I'm just nervous that the healing process appears to have come to a standstill, and it has been over 6 months now!?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The recommendation to rest and ice the shoulder is sounds right.  With increasing pain after 3 weeks, it is time to re-xray the shoulder.  If you can not get in to see a physician within the next week or two then immobilize the extremity (despite the risk of frozen shoulder).  Eventually you may need an MRI too to rule out damage to the labrum in the glenoid (socket of the shoulder).  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,   This is my first time on this board so I hope I make sense.  I fractured my wrist when I was 13 (i am now almost 35) and have had a lump develop on the side of my wrist where I fractured the bone since;  I assume its scar tissue... its not really noticeable too much and has never really hurt or caused me any trouble.  A few months ago I developed another lump on the top of the same wrist, possibly a ganglion cyst?  its hard and has slowly been getting bigger.  And my old wrist injury has been hurting lately with slight numbness in the hand.    My questions are:  if it is a ganglion cyst, could it re-injure my old fracture or cause it to hurt?  Could it make it worse as it grows?   when do ganglion cysts stop growing?  seeing a doctor right now in my life would be very financially \"painful\" so I am praying it is something that will go away eventually without using the old \"bible bump\" method preferably.\n\n",

The risk of not realigning the bone are compromise of the blood vessels and nerve supply to the wrist or hand.  And the risk of non union may increase.  If there is any skin abrasion or cut in the skin near the fracture, you must get an antibiotic to prevent infection of the bone.  Take care and get medical attention ASAP.\n\n",

On the other hand cancerous tumors of the bones near the knee can be a reason for amputation for example in osteosarcoma.  It will be important to take the x-ray of the knee to an experienced orthopedist.  If there is a lesion of the knee which looks like cancer, the next step may be a bone biopsy.  Again, a benign calcium deposit on the knee is not reason to amputate.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, hope this isnt in the wrong section.  So my partner had a large glass bottle dropped on her foot and it cut her pretty good. A shard about 1 1/2 inches went in just below her ankle and up in a direction toward her ankle. The cut was cleaned, and stitched by emergency staff, we were at the running of the bulls in Spain, so no doctors, just ambulance staff. They did a good job though.  But now its been over a month since that and she still has some swelling in her foot, pain when she scrunches her toes together, when she points her foot and turns it to the right (she cut her left foot), and it is still sometimes tender to the touch. Though she can walk on it fine.  Were just wondering if this is kind of normal, I read it can take a long time for tendons to heal, if she in-fact did cut the tendon. Its about the only thing I can think of that would still be causing this. We're pretty confident that there is no glass in it, but I guess we cant be sure - I would have thought she would be in a lot more pain if glass was still moving around in there.  Thanks very much for any suggestions or help.\n\n",

I doubt that the tendon was lacerated as this would affect the active motion of the foot (a tendon is the end of a muscle as it attaches to the bone).    I would expect a simple laceration which does not affect tendon, ligament, joints, or blood vessels to heal and not cause too much pain by 4 weeks.  A visit to your family physician would be in order to determine if there was more damage than just cut of the skin.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, my son fell about four feet out of a tree yesterday, cried for about 45 mins - an hour, refused to move it until 30 mins after medicine was administered. I have had to give tylenol and ibuprofen constant since yesterday.  He fell directly on his elbow, no other part of his body broke his fall. There is only one tiny bruise near the \"tip\" of his bent elbow. It is obviously swollen compared to his other arm, however its not red or bruised. He has most of his function and actually played hard with it yesterday, sliding, swinging running around. Today, his body temp is slightly elevated, 99.2. I know thats near the normal range but his normal range is around 97.3.  I have observed him today, he plays normally for the most part, he can dress himself, takes him a little longer as he manueuvers his arm. He just doesn't seem to be in extreme pain. I tried to touch it and move it in his sleep and he jerks awake and says \"ouch\" but falls back asleep.    When looking at him directly, if his arms are outstretched, with his elbows slightly bent and his palms towards the sky, HIS left arm is swollen compared to the other elbow towards his body only. Nothing on the outside of his arm, and it seems to be slightly above the elbow joint, maybe 1 to 2 fingers width.   If he wasn't running an elevated temp, I would just not worry about it, but I don't want to underestimate the injury.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: 6yr old boy, swollen slightly above elbow, no bruising",
    "content": "Hello -  The fact that there is swelling just above the elbow suggests the  possibility of a \"greenstick\" fracture. These happen quite a lot in young children, and are due to the resilient nature of their bones. Often they are not treated, although  sometimes they are immobilized to ensure proper healing. There is no deformity other than possible swelling, and usually not much to do other than manage the generallly mild-to-moderate pain. Still, an x-ray should be taken to determine if this is in fact the case, and if so, to determine if it should be immobilized.   Even if there is such a fracture the child  usualy tolerates it pretty well after the initial trauma, but it still warrants a look, especially when the potential fracture is near a joint (in this case the elbow), as this can sometimes cause some misalignment which might cause problems later on.   I hope this answers your question. Please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

It does not seem that the old injuries are the cause of the problem since both feet have swollen at the same time. I also assume you are not pregnant which can cause swelling. Other areas to consider are: kidney and liver problems circulatory problems in the legs heart failure (unlikely in a 26 y.o. female without cardiac history and no current symptoms of shortness of breath, chest pain, or irregular heart beat) leg arthritis   At other times we do not find a cause and recommend exercise, salt restriction, and leg elevation.  Your family physician can take a thorough history and do a physical exam and order some blood test, urine analysis, x-ray if needed, and doppler ultrasound to check leg circulation if needed.  Take care and let us know how it goes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Sorry to hear about the accident.  With all the fractures, it must have been a major collision.  Good thing you made it out alive.  Regarding some of your questions. The swelling is to expected.  Without much walking, the fluid will tend to pool.  It is important to prevent blood clots in the legs by doing ankle pumps and wearing some type of compression on the legs (eg. ACE wrap or pneumatic pump on the feet).  Walking and getting out of bed will help.  Your weight bearing status will progress as the fractures heal.  The hardware will stay in unless causing a problem.  Double check with the orthopedist about this though.  You probably have a good team of nurses and therapists helping you.  Ask lots of questions if needed and keep up the good work through rehab.  It is difficult but you have a good chance of walking without assistance if the fractures heal well and there are few complications.  All the best to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, At four weeks the fracture is not likely healed and therefore a potential pain contributor.  I would ask about the fracture healing, about weight bearing status and about pain control measures (physical therapy, medicine, physical modalities, and TENS). You may also ask for the health of the fibular nerve which runs near the proximal fibula on the upper outside part of the leg.  I am not sure why the pain syndrome would be in the upper extremity unless there was trauma there too in which case a full evaluation would be needed.  Take care and keep us posted on your progress.\n\n",

    "content": "I was diving into a pool-After walking a few steps I planted my feet on the board with pretty strong impact hoping to get off a fairly high dive.  After I pushed down  elevated, I heard a slight pop and then felt pain.  I had ACL surgery 2 years ago, and was worried I tore it again.  However, the pain is not as severe and there is no swelling.  Also, there is no knee pain on the knee, below the knee or to the left or right. I also have full motion when I bend the knee.  The pain is above the knee and slightly to the left.  When I walk there is pain and it doesn't \"feel right\" If it helps to know, my patella tendon was used for the surgery.  Is this possibly a torn quad muscle?  If so what is the best treatment and would swimming still be ok to do?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, If the pain is localized to above the knee and above the patella, this is probably a quadricep sprain/strain.  Whether the muscle is actually torn is a matter of degrees - some fibers may be overstretched but for the muscle to be completely torn or ruptured is very rare.   Nevertheless, for a strain or partially torn quadricep, treatment is initially rest, ice, compression and elevation and NSAID. After 72 hours, switch to heat and gentle stretching.  Return to activity as tolerated.  For certain, see a physician for an accurate diagnosis.\n\n",

    "title": "How to tream a bad muscle pull (over the knee)",
    "content": "Hello. I was a soccer player at age 14-17 and stopped playing for 20 years. Today I'm 37 and wanted to start playing again. I am not in a good shape, I know that, but I did start jogging 2-3 times a week for 25 min and my body seemed to handle it fine.  The first time I went to play I was very stressed and it was cold outside - in the warm-up I pulled a muscle. It was a pretty bad pull, the muscle above the knee. I couldn't walk at all, and when i came back home I put ice on it. The next day I woke up in a better shape (surprisingly, for me since most of my injuries seemed to be worse the next day) - better shape meaning I could walk, but obviously very sore.  Its been almost 2 weeks, and I still feel it - it still hurts.  My question - I heard that moderate activity of the muscle could help heal it. But I wasn't sure if i'll start jogging, will i make more harm. Should I just let time do its magic? Or maybe there's some cream or medication I can take to help it go away? I haven't asked my doctor yet since I felt a bit silly asking for an appointment over a pulled muscle. Any help would be appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I am sorry to hear about your injury.  Good to hear it wasn't more than a pulled muscles.   Nevertheless, take some steps to provide healing and return to sport. 1. Use a mix of Aspercreme (contains salicylic) and a menthol cream (e.g. Icy/Hot or Flex-All 454).  Massage the cream into the muscle and apply a moist heat pack. 2. Gentle stretch the quadricep. 3.  Before returning to jogging, walk at a brisk pace for 25 minutes (the same time spent jogging) for 1 week.  If no soreness or problem then do some light running but cut the time by 75% and build slowly.  Also, some NSAIDs should help with pain and inflammation.  If all else fails, it never hurts to see your family physician (unless of course they give you a shot!)  Take care.\n\n",

    "title": "Wrist Fracture/Nerve Damage",
    "content": "One year ago (May 2008) I experienced repeated trauma to my hands & wrists. I fell on them repeatedly during a fight, each time slamming them hard on the pavement. I fractured my right wrist because of this, but since it didn't show up on the x-rays, I didn't discover it had been fractured until a few months went by and I realized the bone had healed differently than my other hand - the wrist bone on the outer part of my right wrist sticks out slightly. I did have another doctor look at x-rays of my wrist after it had healed and there was no mention of anything looking like it might cause a problem.  In addition to the fracture, I experienced extreme pain and discomfort (particularly in my right wrist) that affected my outer wrist, through my arm, all the way to my elbow. Clearly there was some nerve trauma. For months I barely used both hands because of the pain and soreness. I felt pain both on the top side and under side of my wrists, the part of my palm where my thumbs are extended from, and pain on both sides of my right wrist, especially on the outside that stretched through my arm to my elbow. The ligaments must have been very inflamed. After several months, my hands stiffened because I was not using them -  in order to use them again I needed to soak them in warm water for 10 min. twice a day and stretch them.  Now a year has passed and although they have improved greatly, not a day goes by that I don't suffer from pain or soreness. Soaking and stretching them in warm water every morning and night helps a little. I am doing some small weight workouts for my wrists also, in order to try to strengthen them and the muscles that extend into my forearm. Finally my question: What is the best way to address this problem? I don't have health insurance, which means I would like to do all that I can without having to see a doctor or specialist. What are the best exercises/therapy/treatments? As I type this, I feel slight pain in my thumb (where it extends from my palm) and my outer wrist on my left hand. On my right hand I feel un-ignorable pain in my outer right wrist and right elbow, as well as the thumb/palm area. If it is suggested I see someone for this, please indicate the best type of physician in your opinion. Bone? Nerve? Hand? Physical therapist?   THANK YOU!!!\n\n",

    "content": "I feel so terrible for the pain you are suffering.    While I have had experience with nerve damage, my injury was very different.  A broken humerus caused paralysis for 7 months. The final recovery was done by an ocupational therapist, specializing in hands.  It only took three weeks to get my fingers moving again and it was worth going there for sure.  One thing I learned from this injury is that when some parts of the body are not able to perform, others take over.  I had to relearn how to use my muscles again. I don't know if this is relevant enough for you but I do wish you the very best.  Please research what doctor (hand specialist?) you should see and spend what you can to improve your position. Good luck. Barbara\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, If pain and stiffness are the main problems without numbness, tingling or pins/needles sensation ( a sign of nerve damage in the elbow or hand/wrist), I would stear you to a physical or occupational therapist.    There may be pain in the wrist for some time especially as you use the wrist and hands more.  However, as long as the alignment on x-ray looks good, then rehab is the way to go.    Likely, the therapist will use paraffin bath, hot packs, range of motion exercises and gradual strengthening, ice.  If you want the economic therapy path, go to therapy for 1-2 visits and ask them to teach you everything you need to do over the next 6-12 months...and go do it.  But first things first, get an x-ray to make sure the bones are healed and in good alignment.  Take care.\n\n",

Pain with pointing the toes makes sense as the top of the foot structures were traumatized.

I think the question becomes: is the back pain from the coccyx or from the herniated disk. (or both)  If the pain is from the disk, is surgery required?  It is also important to monitor neurological symptoms (numbness, tingling, and pins and needles in either leg; leg weakness; loss of reflexes) which may result from bulging disks.  With unresolved neurological symptoms, surgery becomes a pronounced possibility.  All the best to you.\n\n",

That can be achieved by using crutches.  Bedrest should be for a limited time only.  Activity as tolerated is the rule as long as you protect the ankle.    But going out of the home or to the bathroom should not injury or damage the ankle as long as you are following the weight bearing precautions.  A good set of crutches is in order.   You may also benefit from straight leg raises in bed to maintain the hip strength.  Take care.\n\n",

For the past 11 years (since my auto accident) I have also had severe back pain. However, nothing is showing up in CAT Scans, MRI's, X-Rays, etc.   I noticed about a year ago that the inner corner of my right shoe (by my big toe) is warn down. This is true with every pair of shoes that I own. I did not have this problem before breaking my femur and having the metal rod put in my femur. This proves that I am walking differently, causing my right foot to drag a little against the ground when I walk.   I am wondering if it is possible that the metal rod placement could be a little off, causing me to walk differently, which could be creating my back pain? Is that a crazy thought?\n\n",

    "content": "Dec. 2008 I fell off a ladder and fractured my proximal humerus while visiting in Georgia.  The doctor there told me I would need surgery and set me up with a wonderful sling, compression sleeve and pain killers. I saw a New York doctor immediately upon arriving home and was told that therapy would be best for me.   Now I have completed 4 months of therapy and still have pain and difficulty with certain movements. MRI findings are....Deformity of proximal humerus at level of the surgical neck with linear marrow signal changes corresponding to prior fracture deformity.  Posterior rotation of the humeral head with a fracture fragment involving the posterior aspect of the greater tuberosity.....small full thickness tear anteriorly near the distal supraspinatus tendon attachment.  Fluid extends into the subacromial/subdeltoid bursa.  High grade partial thickness articular surface tearing involving the anterior fibers of the infraspinatus tendon.   My doctor has told me to have a cortizone shot.  Does that seem appropriate? He does not think surgery or more therapy will help.     Do I need a second opinion?  I will suck it up if I have to but am disabled to some extent. I have gotten opinions from 3 therapists and a nurse (friends and family) all saying if it was their shoulder, they would get a second opinion and probably surgery. I would appreciate your input to help me make a good decision. Thank you so much. Barbara\n\n",

It sounds like the rotator cuff was torn from its insertion on the greater tuberosity.  This may be fixable with surgery.  There will be no guarantees for restoration of full use but with 4 months of therapy and no improvement, surgery may be a good option.  Take care.\n\n",

This was achieved by quickly reaching down to grab my cat as he was darting out into the garage and cracking my cheekbone on the corner of a shelf unit that did not give.  It has been 4 days.  The majority of swelling has receeded - icing and Ibuprofen.  The area is slightly off color.  It hurts a bit to look up and the sinus near the area is irritated, and I can't touch the actual bruise with out sharp pain.  How long should it take for the goose egg to dissipate and the bone bruise to heal?  Thank you very much. Cindy\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The cast which you are describing sounds actually like a splint.  Usually the splints can be removed in order to clean the skin but depends on the instructions from your orthopedist.  He may want the splint left on around the clock to prevent motion of the wrist.  A splint was used instead of a cast because of the external fixator.    The external fixator will remain until the bone fracture sites are stable - up to six weeks.  Again, it depends on the extent of the fracture and how well you heal.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Not at all bad to have a lump on the clavicle following a fracture.    With clavicle fractures the bone is usually not reset and no surgery is needed.  You will need to watch for numbness, tingling, pins and needles, and/or weakness in the hand on the side of the fracture.  Occasionally, a nerve gets damaged with clavicle fractures and can cause these symptoms.  Your orthopedist can reassess the fracture at the 6-8 week mark to make sure the bone is healing properly.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "[img]Hello,  My name is Phil, im 22, 6ft3, and am in good health apart from the issue im talking about. In May 2008 i came of my scooter, and as a result broke my tibia no more than a couple of centimetres above my ankle.   Immediately i went to my accident and emergency where they drew the conclusion that my tibia was broken. They put me in a temporary cast, and i had to return the following day to have my proper cast fitted. Indeed i did so and they said i was looking at having the cast on for 6 weeks. They could not fit me in on the 6th week, so i returned on the 7th where again i saw the consultant who said that i was now allowed to weight bare, and that it would be quite uncomfortable for a number of weeks after. On my return appointment the hospital did not take an xray which i thought was slightly odd, but went along with it. [img][img][img][img][/img][/img][/img][/img]   Now more than a year on there are still issues. My right leg (the one that was fractured) is nothing like the left, has been bruised since i broke it, is quite swollen all the time, and in some cases it gets to the point where i cant stand, and again the swelling gets worse causing me quite a lot of pain.  In the last year i have seen 4 Dr's. In the first six months after having the cast removed they advised this was normal while it is propperly healed. I then saw my company dr who again said i can expect discomfort for around 12 months. It got to a point where i made my dr refer me for xrays for which im waiting the results.  I was wanting to know what you thought.\n\n",

Another concern is infection.  Is the bone infected?  A bone infection would require a bone biopsy and IV antibiotics.  So, these concerns should have been or will be addressed as you see the follow up x-ray results and discuss it with the orthopedist.  Take care.\n\n",

    "title": "Fell on the hand, elbow slightly twisted on wrong side",
    "content": "Hello, I'm a Parkour practitioner for 3 years now. I'm around 186 cm high and weight around 96kg, 27 years old.  Three weeks ago, on a training I had an accident. I was jumping over a wall by using my hands, however, my left hand slipped and I started falling on my back. Instinctively I tried to land on the hand that slipped, and as I hit the ground with it (around half a meter height), because of forward inertia and wrong hand rotation upon hitting, my elbow 'wanted' to stretch on the wrong side. I want to make a point that I hit the ground with my open fist, not the elbow; the impact and forward inertia did the elbow joint trauma.  Luckily, it didn't, but I've felt two slight cracks, similar to those like when you 'crack' fingers on purpose. As I got up, I immediately checked the joint for fractures (nothing was moving), and tested if I can move my arm freely and without pain in all directions, and that was possible, no pain felt. After around 10-15 minutes, arm started feeling very tired and started swelling, and I noticed that movement started to be constrained, and I applied Tiger's balm on it (bad move, I know I should have applied ice). During afternoon and night, the elbow swell slightly and I was unable to move it more than maybe few degrees, and unable to rotate the fist completely, elbow was basically locked in 'rest' position - 45 degrees, open hand facing torso.  I was applying ice during that afternoon and following day. Third day, a huge bruise started manifesting, from the half between shoulder and elbow to the half of my elbow and wrist, with wrist developing slightly smaller bruise. Day fourth, bruise became dark red. Same day I started applying Arnica oil. As days went on, bruise started changing to yellow, and then faded away.  To this day, bruise completely went away, I can rotate my wrist as much as I could before, however my elbow is still locked for full movement: it takes few degrees to stretch arm completely, and when contracting, I'm half the way touching my shoulder. I cannot raise myself on my arms yet, and I cannot use my muscle fully, like for example lifting heavy things.  I would like to know if its possible to know if any permanent damage occurred, how can I heal my arm faster, and is this 'just' tendons stretch or something worse?  Thank you, please ask me if I need to provide any more information.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Parkour sounds like a great activity except during unwanted falls.  You could have a fractured bone in the elbow which is limiting the motion.  It would be worthwhile to have it x-rayed.  If no fracture then feel confident to continue working on the motion and edema.  Watch out also for numbness and tingling in the arm or hand as this may indicate nerve damage.  Muscle weakness may also be an indication of nerve damage.  Take care and ... move efficiently, quickly, and successfully getting over those obstacles.\n\n",

I did my 1st parkour training in 6 weeks and mostly everything feels fine, except that I can still feel its 'not there' while climbing - which is natural I guess since its still weak from the injury. Parkour is awesome, natural workout and tremendously fun. And yes, pretty much only downside is falling when you don't expect to :-)  Thanks for the reply once again, sincerely\n\n",

I had a hairline (fissure) fracture in the first and second rib of the right chest and also a hairline fracture in the back of the right shoulder due to an attack with sticks  4 years ago.     Recently I felt a pain in the chest ONLY when I was playing a basketball match. I did one view x-ray on the chest and two views on the right shoulder to make sure that everything is fine. Here are the x-ray results:  X-RAY OF THE CHEST AND BILATERAL RIBS:  Views of the bilateral ribs and the chest were obtained.  The study failed to reveal any obvious fracture or dislocation. No pneumothorax or pleural effusions were seen. The cardiac size was normal. The lungs appear to be unremarkable. The mediastinum and the soft tissues were unremarkable.   X-RAY OF THE RIGHT SHOULDER:  Two views of the right shoulder obtained reveal osseous structure without any acute bony findings. The soft tissues and the bony mineralization were normal.   The x-ray did not show any symptoms of a fracture according to the radiologist report. Is that possible for the ribs and shoulder bones to be completely healed within 4 years that it doesn't show any past fracture in the x-ray?  N.B. please reply as soon as possible, because I need your opinion to comfort me as I am afraid of that pain i felt to be something else.\n\n",

Fracture lines may disappear when healed in a few months time...so 4 years is plenty of time to heal the fracture.  The chest pain could be something non related to the injury.  Consider the lungs and heart as sources of pain.  Your physician can ask the appropriate history questions and do an examination to determine if either of these organs is causing the chest pain during basketball.  Take care.\n\n",

I havent been to the doctors due to paying for school on my own and not having insurance or parents to help out.     In the meantime I have done quite the amount of research and from my symptoms I believe I have fractured my zygomatic buttress.  My symptoms include.   - Complete balck eye  - Blood on right side of right eye - Swelling of entire right cheeck. - Still blood in my flem spit - Numbness of cheek, lip, and no feeling in about 6 teeth - Chest pain on right side ( could this be blood?  )  - Slight vision impairment on right eye. ( will this get better? )  - Slight upper 6 teeth misalignment on right side ( how is this possible if my upper jaw seems to be fine? ) - not much pain, just more or less constant pressure - Can lightly push and move what feels to be the fracture up near eye and nose      - when doing so I can feel it in my gums where I have no feeling in those 6 teeth       - Definitely can feel some sort of bone movement  Although- there isnt any sinking or \"hole\" on cheek and symmetry seems to be there from what I can see and others can see. Unless slight swolleness is masking a slight asymmetry. I can also grap my Maxillary ( upper jaw ) wiggle, push, pull, etc and nothing happens. IE no pain or movement etc.  So its been 4 days now and Im wondering what my options are. I have no insurance or a way to pay for health care. Is there anyway that I can have this surgery performed regardless of my financial situation.  Its just really hard to pay for school, living expense, vehicle, etc and go to school 50 hours a week and not have a job either, let alone pay for surgery.    Any insight or help would be greatly appreciated.  What am I up against  Thanks in Advance, Allen\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The post operative x-ray looks good.  Since the fibula plays such a little, if any, role in weight bearing of the lower limb it is reasonable to allow the bone to heal without relocating it.     It may pose more problems trying to relocate the fibula then to leave it to heal.  Also discussing this with your orthopedist is a good route to take.  Take care.\n\n",

If the fracture is unstable then movement may worsen the fracture. If the fracture is stable and is not displaced then there may be minor pain and moving the limb may be easier - less painful.  X-ray is the test to do for suspected fracture.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "About 4 days ago I dropped a socket wrench and it bounced off my right inner ankle bone, It swelled and bruised and hurt to touch, two days later i could barely walk and my whole ankle was swollen.  I went to dr they x-rayed said no chip or break let it heal.  I still cannot touch my ankle, it is still swollen and now hurts down the top of my foot and up my calf,  everytime I step I get an intense burning sensation radiating out from where the wrench hit me.  The dr said the xray was normal and he thinks i caught the vein in between the wrench and the bone but it should not cause as much pain as I am in to touch or move it if that is the case, he doesn't know why it hurts so bad, just be gentle on it for a while.  I am in serious pain and want to know what I should do I've been gentle, been icing it, elevating it, and all that. Should i wrap it, boot it, or will I cause more damage by doing that?  Is there something else I could have done to it that my family practitioner might not have thought of. Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, You are doing everything right with the ice and elevation.  I would add compression ie ACE wrap.  If it is painful to bear weight using crutches to take weight off for a few days will help with the healing.    You may start gentle painfree range of motion ie ankle pumps during the time on crutches to maintain motion.  Any of the structures in the foot could have been damaged (skin, blood vessels, nerves, ligaments and bone) so it is hard to tell which exact structure is causing the problem.  But we know there is no bone fracture.  So I would continue to treat the symptoms and give this time to heal.  All the best to you.\n\n",

Because the end of the bone shattered into multiple pieces my MD wanted to wait and see if it would heal on its own before we decided on surgery to remove the pieces and reattach the tendon somewhere else on the bone.     I still have pain.  X-rays showed that the fracture was healing approx 10 weeks later, but I have nearly daily foot pain.  Often the pain is more in my ankle than the actual location of the break.  I'm an ER nurse and I spend 12+ hours on my feet.  It's starting to impact my quality of life.  Since I was treated I've moved to a different state.  I know I should probably have the situation re-evaluated, but what do you feel is the out look?\n\n",

I suspect the ankle pain is from standing or walking in an awkward or compensatory manner.  Standing for prolonged periods of time does not help either.  But there is hope. I would start with a re-assessment of the fracture site: x-ray, physical exam.  Then start some rehab (depending on re-assessment).  If the bones are stable and healing then you can proceed with progressive rehab.    Hope this helps and all the best to you.\n\n",

There probably has been ligament damage due to the dislocation and would explain the swelling and soreness.    Since the symptoms persist then you should discuss with an orthopedist.  The finger could be unable or may have been re-injured after the splint was off.  You may need to let it rest a bit more and rehab the finger with occupational or physical therapy for 4-6 weeks.    As a rule, with hyperextension dislocations of fingers without fractures, it is important to buddy tape the fingers after relocation and gently flex the fingers gradually over time without causing additional pain and swelling...and avoid any hyperextension movements.   Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "I fell really hard playing tennis exactly 2 weeks ago and I scraped just below my knee to the right. A day later it was black and blue and swollen. A week ago I noticed that the inside of my ankle hurts to the touch and the arch of my foot was also black and blue. Today I have black and blue marks down my leg and the top of my foot hurts too. The area where I scraped is swollen bad, and I feel a knot. The swelling is about two inches wide, it itches like crazy and the area is hot. When I push it in, it leaves dimples in my skin. I'm so afraid because I didn't go to the doctor. Do I need to worry? Please write back soon. I don't have insurance, but I've been told to go to the ER room ASAP. I'm going in the morning, well in a few hours.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I agree with the suggestion to see a physician who will evaluate the scraped site for infection and order an needed treatment.  The bruising down the leg is typical for a pulled muscle or traumatized tissue in the leg where bruising and swelling tend to work downward toward the foot.  Often, an x-ray is needed to rule out fracture in the painful swollen part but depends on the type of injury and its location.  I would be surprised if there were any fractures with this type of injury.  Take care and let us know how it goes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Yes, the numbness and pain in the big toe would need to be evaluated by a physician because this could be a problem with the foot itself, the ankle, knee, hip or lumbar spine. You are correct to think that the change in weight bearing of the affected leg could cause the pain however the numbness is a neurological sign rather than a joint or tendon problem. Certainly swelling from an injured knee could compromise a nerve or set of nerves.   Thirdly, lumbar issues which could be exaccerbated by trauma or by change in gait patterns can cause toe numbness. So a thorough history and physical are needed at this time to determine the exact cause.  Take care and let us know how things go.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Thanks for the picture! Without trauma, rib fracture is unlikely. At 18 y.o., cardiac issues are unlikely unless there is a history of heart defect at birth or you are an athlete with an enlarged heart. Sometimes heavy repetitive lifting or pushing/pulling can cause inflammation in this area. The more likely suspicion is the fact that you have a history of asthma and are smoking - a bad combination for the lungs. Try not smoking for 1-2 weeks. Increase water intake (good expectorant). Take albuterol inhaler per your family physicians orders. If no better or worse within 1-2 weeks follow up with a physician.  You may consider seeing your physician now for an exact diagnosis as a face to face history and physical may shed more light on the problem.   Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I suppose the prescription for the corticosteroids is to reduce the inflammation of the rib cage area - either muscles between the ribs or the lining of the thoracic wall (pleurisy).  I see the steroids as a reasonable option since the pain meds for the leg fracture do not help with the chest problem.  Generally, corticosteroids orally only help with musculoskeletal inflammation briefly but with internal tissue like lung and inner lining of the chest cavity does a better job.    Unless you have had an adverse reaction to steroids in the past they are generally safe for short term use (less than 3 weeks).  From your story, it sounds like you were in an accident which resulted in broken leg bone and left sided chest / clavicle injury.  There is a host of bone and joint problems in the shoulder and clavicle area which could have resulted from the trauma and can best be sorted out through your family doctor ...or with referral to orthopedist.  Thanks for writing in.  Let us know how it goes.\n\n",

    "content": "I think I dislocated my left little finger about six weeks ago playing basketball. Since this time by middle joint on the finger has been severly swollen and slightly brusied. At first the whole finger was brusied, but this has now gone away, and its just around the joint. The first joint closest to the fingernail also has sharp pains from time to time. The finger can't be extended all the way, nor can I competely make a fist with the finger. My sister who is an ocupational theropist tells me that if I go to the doctor all they will do is x-ray it and put it in a splint. Therefore I should just ice and massage the finger to reduce the swelling. But my friend who has a certified EMT license tells me to go to the doctor.  My question is; is it to late for the doctor to resist the finger? If it is to late for the finger to be resist, should I even bother going to the doctor, since its been six weeks since the injury?  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Shoulder impingement can be caused by either a structural abnormality like a bone spur or from poor mechanics while using the arm (or both). Impingement can be painful and can predispose to rotator cuff to tear and/or frozen shoulder to develop.  The question of surgery is a good one.  If P.T. is making things worse, then discussing surgical options with an orthopedist is reasonable.  The surgeon can shave off the end of the scapula (called acromioplasty) and decompress the impinged rotator cuff tendon.  Depending on the extent of damage and duration of your shoulder problem the prognosis is good - 8-12 weeks of rehab to restore range of motion f/b strengthening.    Take care and let us know how things turn out.\n\n",

    "content": "On Nov 21 2005 oops I meant 2004. I had a accident on my atv. I broke my right femur. It is now march 10, 2005 and my leg is barley healing. I go to the orthopedic surgeon monthly, after seeing the x-rays, he still wants me on toe touch weight bearing. I need to get better fast. What can I do at home to speed up the recovery process. I also must include that I have had an I.M. Rod surgically installed the day after the accident, along with 5 screws. 2 at the knee and 3 by the hip. I went to the doctor today and the x-rays look the same as 3 months ago, with minimal to no healing. What can I do? Also I have minimal to no pain at this time in the healing process.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Metal..  Presumably the accident was November last year  otherwise we're looking to get healing before the fracture...sorry, couldn't help myself.  One of the earliest battlefield surgeons remarked \"I dressed the wound. God healed it\".  And that's about it really.  It sounds like you had quite a nasty fracture, and with high energy injuries, often there is sufficient damage to the soft tissues and vessels supplying the bone with nutrition that fracture healing is delayed.  X-ray changes can take some considerable time, and sometimes, the bone fails t heal altogether (non-union).  Non-union is declared after about 9 months of non progression of the fracture evolution.    There are things that can theoretically speed recovery (other than prayer).  The best judge would be the surgon looking after you, but depending on the fracture configuration, one could remove some screws and allow some limited weight bearing.Tthis is called dynamisation. Exchange nailing with bone grafting  can also be done,( removing and replacing the nail with another one with some bone applied to the fracture site).  Some people claim that electrical impulses or ultrasound vibrations can also help.    What can you do?  That's tough.  Assuming that you are a helathy individual, eating a balanced western diet probably not much more my friend...  Saif   .\n\n",

He also measured my legs and my right leg is 1\" smaller than the left.

August 12, 2005 Surgery Day. Went into manhattan for surgery, everything went well. A lot of pain, just as bad as when I had the first surgery if not more. It's now August 16 and the pain is still severe but not as intense. I go back to the orthopedic tomorrow. Hopefully this works. It has been a long time. Since November 21, 2004. Almost 9 months.

    "content": "Thanks to all who have wrote back. Today is december 18th 2005. I want to give you all an update on my situation. First I would like to say that this is too my first broken bone and very painful I might add. I will be going back to the doctor on dec 21st I have not had an x-ray in six weeks. I have been back to work since nov 21st. I am doing ok I guess. I still limp and after working for about 3 or four hours my leg stiffens up and I am no longer limping but dragging my leg. I start work at 3:30 and work till 11:30 I am a janitor so I am constantly on my feet. I too am a smoker and a lot of people told me to quit and a lot of doctors told me it shouldn't matter because I am young enough (25). Eventually I plan on quitting but we will see. I can say that everyday gets a little easier. I d still need to take pain medication only during working hours when I am constantly on my feet. Overall when I had my 3rd surgery on august 12 the doctor was suppose to straiten my leg out so it was the same length of the left leg. Unfortunatley due to a loss of a signifigant amount of blood and the fact that he did not want to chip away at my new bone growth (since it took so long to heal the little bit that it did.) he was unable to make my leg the exact length but pretty close. I don't know if the limp is from pain or the diffrence in leg sizes.   Well anyway I will give you guys an update soon. I promise I won't wait so long to get back to you. Thanks for all the support.   ~steve~\n\n",

    "content": "Shooter 28,  It has been quite some time now since I fractured my femur. I haven't visited this site since my last post, but they sent me an email saying someone replied.  To cut to the chase. I had the surgery redone where the pulled out the old rod and reemed out the bone marrow installed a new one and some new screws. Within 6 months my leg healed ok. It is still an inch short and on occasion it bothers me a little. As far as pain goes. Sometimes when the weather changes I can feel a dull ache, but nothing serious. Going to the gym (when you feel ready) and doing leg exercises helped a lot. I am looking to have the screws by the knee removed soon because it does still hurt near the knee where the screws are, when I try to run or go up and down stairs a lot within a short period of time. I really don't limp anymore except if I have been sitting down for a while and then stand up and walk around. I will limp for about 3 or 4 steps and then it goes away.   Over the past few years I have noticed that the leg is getting stronger and does not bother me as much as it used to. It's not to the point where I can say nothing happened, but I can walk normally 95% of the time.  I know what it's like to be laid up for a long period of time. It's not fun. Thats for sure. I too felt like my leg was never gonna heal and what it was like to just \"walk\". You'll get there soon.   Good Luck I hope you heal quickly. If you have any questions, let me know.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Broken FEMUR NEED HELP!",
    "content": "I know I am replying to this post which is considered to be significantly old by now, but I wanted to just express some thoughts and ideas that may be helpful to people who have sustained this injury or know someone who has, and are looking to find out what to expect as well as what practices will speed up the healing and recovery process.  First off, it is important to note that femur fractures come in all shapes, sizes and severity. Fracture severity varies with the amount of breakage as well as how many breakages have occurred in the femur bone. As you may or may not know, the human femur is the strongest part of the human body and on the same note, will require a significant amount of time to heal.  Upon fracturing of the femur one should expect swelling or minor-major inflammation. A common practice for a person who has sustained this injury is doses of morphine to mitigate the pain to a bearable state. Surgery is almost the top choice in healing a femur fracture and is usually preformed with in 24-48 hours of the accident or injury. A cast is usually a secondary choice depending on once again severity of the injury.  In the case of surgery, metal rods are placed and screwed into the area of the fracture to aid in mending the injury. Surgeries of this nature are done relatively quickly, but sometimes require up to 3 hours to conclude. Note: Rods are almost always usually removed at a later time in a following surgery after bone starts to heal.   After surgery is completed casts are almost never usually used to support the fractured femur except in younger children. In terms of surgery risk, there is very little risk of complications. Statistics have shown that the most complication that has risen from a surgery of this nature is infection, which is a natural risk as with any other surgery.  After surgery is completed, one may expect to stay at the hospital for a minimum of 2 says to ensure that there is no infection and that the body has not rejected the metal rod.   Healing process from this point on takes between 4-6 months for a full recovery. Crutches are the main utensil used to aid in movement. People with this type of injury will experience chronic pain and will probably be on a regimen of percocet. It is important that patients take their pain medication exactly as directed to minimize pain.   In the following months of rehabilitation, your doctor will schedule you for biweekly xrays to asses the rate of your bone healing and fusing. You may also have a physical therapist to help rehabilitate your movement back to normal.   During the healing process you can do certain things to mitigate the pain such as placing ice on the affected area as well as elevating the affected limb which will help in minimizing pain.   After it has been determined that your bones are healing and fusing back together a second operation is done to remove the rod and screws and one may slowly start transitioning back into leading a normal life. Good luck, I hope you found this useful.  Ramy Mohamed El-Helw\n\n",

    "content": "ON Jan 10 2009 i broke my femur(thigh bone in middle) and got a rod placed d same nite with two nails on both sides. was advised bed rest for 6 weeks and i was doing leg raises 100 daily on bed, after 6 weeks doctor said der was no healing and non unions and had to take one screw out frm near knee.   feb 25 i consulted other Dr and he suggested nt necessary itz healing. he noticed my extra bone(ostochondroma) on the same leg(below knee whihc was quite big) and got it removed in d same week. i was again on bed rest for couple of weeks. he advised toe bearing partial walking using cruthes. at beginning d leg was very weak and lowly it started getting stronger.   on march25th i had taken x ray which showed d breaking bone was much closer where as side view showed little gap(den dr suggested put as much weight as u can on d leg without limping) and  d extra bone reports wer normal.   on april 11 i had my x ray taken and he said its not uniting and had to take two screws out from top.  i requested him to do it in july as m busy next month.  M almost walking without crutches with little or no pain sometimes( thouh he didnt suggested, i use one crutch wen i have to walk a lot in clge for gud support). wat i have seen in x ray first the bone was not straight aligned and slowly it has moved to a straight position. but the latest x ray taken after four month still showed up a thin line at the breakage so its nt uniting. I suppose i stressed up my leg in the recent few days before x ray was taken by trying fold my fractured leg completely with force(i guess). so i have stopped excercing (leg raises and folding it much force as m walking). i hope in july d bone heals and i dnt need a another surgery to take out proximal screws. ( by the way rite now my leg is much stronger now upto 60% and m walking without support with little pain or no pain sumtimes and m limp very very little :))   I hope it heals faster and i need only one surgery to remove my screws and rod at once.  (Wat i suggest for people with such fractures...  life gonna be back to 70% normal sooner ( max 4 month even if it doesn't heal much) care should be taken to avoid injuries.( no too much stressing) have calcium tabs and vitamin tabs. exercise slowly and correct to make leg stronger.( leg raises and toe movement to stimulate blood supply) Have abundant calcium intake in terms of MILK, eggs, even Vitamin D is IMP (oranges , also have  a cup of goats unboiled milk in d morning-> escalated pain frm near knees screws in one week)) ( have less sugar, tea or coffee, smoking as it contains caffeine) And thank god dat u still have ur leg with u . it cud have been worse without d leg...  and be confident and stop searching information abt broken femur :P atleats if its not more than a two month.  Best of luck. God Bless you\n\n",

    "content": "The other day I was sitting in my old wooden desk chair when I dropped a kleenex on the floor.  Being lazy that day, I reached down with my left hand to try to reach it.  My chest by left breast was leaning heavily against the chair's wooden arm.    I could barely reach the tissue so I stretched further.  All of a sudden my body slipped on the wooden chair arm.  I head a loud crack come from my chest.  I had a sudden pain  under my breast, but I did grab the tissue.    Right after than the ribs to the left and back of the left breast has been really tender and painful.  If I take a deep breath, or a big yawn I have pain.  I don't have pain when I twist my torso though.  The first night sleeping was awful, it was extremely painful, and here I am alreay taking 100mcg/hour of fentanyl in my duragesic patch.  I tried putting ice on it, but it didn't really work.    Its been a few days now and the pain is still there.  Now I cannot reach out with my hand outstrectched because it seems that where my pectoral muscle attaches to my ribcage, there is a lot of pain.  I tried cleaning something off the floor with my RIGHT arm and it even hurt quite a bit.    Anyway - I'm wondering if I have a broken rib or broken cartilage?  If this pain keeps up, I'll be goign to see my Doctor on Monday.    thanks!    Ken\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Ken,  Thank you very much for using our website.  If you have one or more broken ribs, the treatment would be pain control unless each of the ribs is broken at 2 different places thus making a piece of the chest wall that has separated from the rest of it (a condition called flail chest). Otherwise treatment mostly relies on pain control to be able to breath comfortably and cough to clear out lung secretions thus preventing lung collapse or pneumonia.  Pain relievers, motrin and the like actually aim at the underlying inflammation that accompanies the fracture and in most of the times can control the pain well. There are other pain relievers of course that are available that are used for people who have stomach problems like ulcers and these are of the celebrex family.  Going to your doctor to be seen if the pain does not improve or develop new symptoms is a very good step so that you make sure that nothing serious is missed.  Once more, thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "title": "broken rib",
    "content": "I would like to ask the doctor whether the symptoms I am exhibiting could, possibly, be a broken or bruised rib.  I had a rather bad fall, blackening my eye, swollen nose, knee damage, etc., due to my severe osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia and Relfex Sympathetic Dystrophy, Type 1, a week or so ago whilst getting up in the middle of the night.  Around this time I also developed bronchitis and everytime I coughed the pain under my left rib was unbearable. My doctor chalked it up to my extensive coughing due to my bronchitis, as did I, at the time, but now that my bronchitis has improved and my cough is gone I still have the severe pain and burning (inflammation) under my left ribcage, difficulty breathing, lying down and, generally, even when sedentary.  I cannot sleep in any position because of this pain and there is extreme inflammation (very hot to the touch, and internally) at the site.  I'm constantly holding this area to protect it (instinctive) and to try and relieve the discomfort.  My 19 year old son compared the two ribcages, at the exact points, and when he touches one particular point on the left side I scream with pain, even though I am on Oxycontin for my chronic pain syndrome (RSD-Type 1), fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis and trigeminal neuralgia.  Even with the high dosages of Oxycontin, and breakthrough Oxy IR, I am still experiencing excruciating pain. I cannot take ANY NSAIDs, nor any nonsteroidal/steroidal medications, due to past bleedings and my hiatal hernia, Acid Reflux, including IBS-D and diverticulitis. I cannot take Celebrex nor Vioxx because of my varying GI conditions, nor, of course, ibuprofen or ASA and am allergic to aceteminophen (I'm also allergic to morphine and codeine).  Does the symptoms I'm relaying to you sound similar to a break/bruise, or any other problem you can think of with your expertise, with my left rib? I am sitting at my computer at this moment in terrible pain and burning and only holding my ribcage helps about 5%.  The only time any pain relief is achieved is right after I take my pain meds but soon afterward the pain and inflammation returns.  Please provide me with any advice you may have.  Thank you.\n\n",

Yesterday while training i suffered a freak accident where i was momentarily crushed on my side by a training partner (jiu jitsu), said crushing was accompanied by an audible\"crack/crunch\" noise from my ribs and i felt \"something\" there strangely though it doesnt really hurt and i can twist to the side etc easily, although it does hurt a little when i move quickly or bend over a certain way etc.  Does this sound like a broken/fractured rib or have i just pulled something/bruised rib??  I would really appreciate any advice as being a professional sportsman this injury could prevent me from earning money which i NEED, therfore i need to be training again asap, as i have a scheduled competition for the 15 oct!! any advice on how to promote recovery etc would also be gratefully recieved.

    "content": "Hello, I am a male, 38 years old, and generally in good health.  Late last year I had a herniated disk, due to picking up a heavy object.  I went though much treatment to no avail.  I went in for microsurgery, so that my nerve could be relieved, and my herniated portion of my disk removed.  Upon my home coming, I experienced much pain.  The pain which I did not understand is that which radiated around my chest.  I told the doctors about this and they just assumed it was the operation, the gallbladder, or swelling.  I had severe spasms, trouble moving and pressure upon breathing.  It has been 3 months since my operation, and my back and nerve feel much better, however, on my mid section of my rib (under my arm), and around the front chest (following the same rib pattern), I still have sharp pains, and I feel my rib move around (and click) if pressed on.  I have trouble lowering my arm when I sit down and, leaning towards that direction when I sit, is unbearable.  It is my thought that my rib(s) was broken during the surgery, when pressure was applied to my back.  I have paid for x-rays, but my doctor pre-worned me that a break would be hard to see on conventional x-rays.  Needless to say, when the x-rays returned the doctor could not see anything.  What other methods are the best, to \"view\" ribs which may have been broken?\n\n",

My question too is...how long does it take for a fracture to heal. My rib is much better compared to what it was initially. However, every time I lift something, move the wrong way, or do anything lightly strenuous, I usually will hurt it again. Once the pain starts coming back, it hurts to breathe, bend over (is the worst), lay on it, move from my torso, really any type of movement. I would think by now, it would have started to heal more...  Please, if someone could answer our questions, that would be so helpful. Thanks in advance.  I hope this information helps.\n\n",

The pain is always in the front or side and never near the solar plexus or the back.  There seems to be no chronic weakening of specific points, as the pain location varies with each injury (depending on exactly how I \u2018tweaked\u2019 my rib cage this time).  The pain is not severe, but significantly discomforting and, remarkably, lasts almost exactly 21 days in each instance.  Am I experiencing repetitive broken ribs OR torn cartilage?

    "content": "First off, I think that this website is a godsend.  I was researching about my little problem and I found this place.  Anyway, I was at a concert last Sunday (April 26) and a guy was falling toward my direction and I tried to push him away from me and his head hit my left hand.  I don't recall feeling anything significant(a pop or break), but my hand started to hurt pretty bad.  My first thought was that I jammed or sprained my fingers because his head went dead on with my fingertips.  I couldn't bend my middle finger very much, so I sat down during the rest of the concert.  ALSO, THERE WAS NO SWELLING OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.  THERE HASN'T BEEN A CASE OF SWELLING EVER SINCE IT HAS HAPPENED.  I splinted it with a wooden stick and gauze as a just in case.  As the week went on, I could flex the finger more and more.  Well, It's now Friday, May 1st.  I've been able to make a complete, tight fist with my left hand, but I have a question.  My fingers feel fine, but there is a bruise right on the joint of the middle finger with the rest of my hand (the bottom side of the hand).  Just wondering what it could be.  Was it just a bad case of finger jamming or spraining?  I'm concerned about this because I'm a guitar player and when I try to bend strings on my guitar with my middle finger, it starts to hurt.  Also, when I press down on anything with just my middle finger, it hurts.  I was thinking that if it was a jammed finger, it hasn't healed up all the way.  I just want to get down to the bottom of this because playing guitar is my favorite hobby and I'm hoping to be a career musician and I don't want my playing ability hindered.  I have a gig to play in early June and I can't really afford a visit to the doctor, so any advice would be really awesome.   Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It sounds like you have sprained the distal interphalangeal joint of the middle finger.  The bruising is normal and should go away with time.    Ability to bend the finger and no swelling are reassuring signs. Of course xray is the only true way of telling a fracture. (unless a bone fragment is sticking out of the skin)  You can use heating pad on the finger for twenty minutes following by gentle range of motion; gradually return to regular activities; NSAIDS as needed.  Take care and all the best to you and your future.\n\n",

This is the first day that I have used the medication, and the pain is already starting to dissipate.  I was kind of freaked out because I love playing music, but it wasn't that bad after all.

    "title": "Fractured patella?",
    "content": "(resubmitting with precise title so it will be approved)  About 2 months ago I fell on my knee. I was carrying my daughter and going down some steps to the driveway. Somehow I misstepped off of the first step and fell the final 36 inches. In order to save my little girl from smacking her head, I stuck my knee out and landed full force on it and then rolled. She was fine, but my knee was in excruciating pain. But ... I'm one of those \"walk it off\" kind of guys so I got up and walked it off. It was quite painful to walk, but not unbearable, however there was a very slight occasional grinding feeling. The knee swelled up pretty bad, but by the next day without ever using ice or a wrap, swelling was down and I was walking with no pain, just minor discomfort. However, I made the mistake of kneeling down. As soon as my knee hit the floor and felt the pressure, the pain was so bad I collapsed. It felt as though my knee cap was in two pieces, and when I knelt on it they went in opposite directions. This was the case for at least 3 weeks - kneeling was not an option. But I followed some tests, such as lying on my back and raising my straightened leg - no problem. Percussion test - fine except for one area of patella on outer side. Mild pressing on various areas of patella caused excruciating pain on outer side of patella traveling diagonally toward the inner side. I assumed that it was a simple fracture of the patella not affecting the cartilage underside.  After only a week, most the swelling was gone and I could walk, jog, run, jump and climb stairs as though nothing happened. Although, prolonged standing or walking would cause the knee to ache later. However, here's the odd part.  It's now 2 months later. I can actually get into a kneel position on the knee VERY carefully but still without full weight/pressure. Walking etc is a breeze. I can be standing/walking all day with no ache later. However, on the medial side of the kneecap near the bottom tip of the patella (and actually partially on the patella), there is a quarter sized raised knot. It's a soft knot that feels very tendon-like, not hard like bone. It sticks out rather noticeably. Despite all the swelling being gone for weeks, this knot has persisted. And I can move it. It doesn't hurt for me to move it medially and press it into my knee beside the patella - where strangely it seems it belongs. Is this just residual swelling, or is it possible that a small fragment of the patella did in fact break off and is now pulled out of position by the patellar tendon? The patella feels completely intact when compared to the right patella, but on the medial side where the knot is, it's hard to be sure that side of the patella is fully intact. I can grasp the patella with my leg propped up and knee relaxed, and can move it without pain in the exact range as the right patella.   So I keep thinking that it's healing just fine, but that knot is really throwing me off. And the knot feels \"in the way\" when pressure is applied from kneeling ... unless I move it. I apologize for the long post, but I wanted to be thorough. I just need some help in understanding what might be wrong, if anything, because I was laid off and have no health insurance and cannot afford to pay to visit a doctor. Any advice or insight will be GREATLY appreciated. Many thanks. Jason\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, There is a bursa on top of the knee cap called the prepatellar bursa which may be causing the bump on the knee cap.    Often with this type of injury the bone under the cartilage is bruised (pain with kneeling).   This is all beside the point of a possible patellar fracture which can only be diagnosed with an xray.  I do not think the bump is a bone chip but xray is the obvious and only way to know for sure.   Sometimes plica just inside the medial aspect of the patella can become fibrous and feel like a tendon.  It is of little concern unless inflamed and causing problems.   Hope this helps give you something to go on. Take care and keep us posted.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you very much Tom. That does make a lot of sense. I guess my next question would be ... how serious is a ruptured bursa? Is this something that eventually heals itself?  Or does it require draining, surgery, etc?  It really doesn't bother me much anymore, except when kneeling it may feel \"in the way\" though not really painful. The patella feels pretty good now. And I'm curious as well ... does this sort of injury lead to stuff like arthritis later on? Again, thank you very much. I sincerely appreciate your insight and assistance. Jason\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Doctors,                         Years ago I consumed alcohol on a daily basis after work (Beer) I stopped from drinking completly after being warned by my Doctor about rising enzyme levels. I guess I consumed beer for about 15 years or so on a regular basis and probably too much I admit. After I refrained from alcohol I was feeling stronger than ever and was actually praised by my PCP for taking such good care of myself. I was working out, lost a ton of weight and just never felt better in my life. After that I was helping my brother move some heavy items into his apartment and I felt a snap of some sort and had very minor pain, so minor I was not even going to go to the hospital but my mother said I had better just in case. So I went to ER and x-rays were taken and at that time the attending radiologist and attending nurse at the ER said I was fine , that it was a mucsle strain and noted is was an unremarkable hip and pelvis , gave me some ALEVE for pain and sent me home. I was so thrilled it wasnt serious and I continued on with my work and life as usual. About 4 to 6 months later I awoke from sleep in the morning and could not walk on that leg. I went to the local hospital where I was living and the ER doctors told me I had a partially healed non displaced fracture (old) which now was infected with nercrosis and collapse , further MRI proved it needed total replacement which I had done a few years back and have nothing but praise for my surgeons top skills. I guess my question is: Why didnt the first hospital just tell me I had a fracture ? And what that could cause, or if there was anything I could do to save my hip. I value your opinion and I thank you for your generous donation of your knowledge. Jim\n\n",

    "content": "It is quite possible that the fracture was too small to notice initially when it occurred.  Often, if there is suspicion of a fracture, but it cannot be seen on x-ray, the films can be repeated in about a week.  By that point a callous will have formed where the fracture was, allowing it to be seen.  If in that week's time, the symptoms resolve, often the films are not repeated.  Without being able to see the fracture on the initial films, it is often much more likely to be a muscular problem.  The avascular necrosis is a known, but not frequently seen, outcome with fracture of the femoral head and neck.    In terms of what could have been done to prevent this, there isn't much, unfortunately.  If the fracture were identified the doctors may have wanted to follow you a bit more closely for the possibility of this complication; however, it sounds as if your symptoms occurred quite quickly, so even knowing a fracture had been present would likely have not caused anyone to be concerned enough to have looked for developing avascular necrosis.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

Code-blue, loss too much blood, doctor removed uterus thinking that was where the blood was coming from. Then they noticed artery was cut. Cardiac surgeon repaired artery. Ureter was sewed up in process. I had to wear a bag for 2 weeks to drain kidney. Stint was then put in. Stint removed after approx 6 weeks. Since this ordeal, I have been having pain with my leg on the same side as the problems.  The pain is on the left side in my groin area. I have been to several doctors and none can determine the cause of my leg pain. My leg was in so much pain 2 times that I had to use crutches and not put pressure on it for a few days. That seemed to help relieve the severe pain. The pain is becoming more constant instead of getting better with time as doctors are suggesting.  I am just hoping someone can give me any ideas of what could be causing this pain and what I can do to fix it.  Thank you for any help. I have been to an orthopedic who thought it may be this avascular nercrosis because of the trauma during the surgery, but the MRI proved negative on that. Is it even possible that the surgery could have caused this, or would it have had to been like a fracture to that area to be avascular necrosis? I am just trying to figure out what could be causing this pain. It is getting worse and no one can, or will help me.  Any ideas or suggestions of what can be causing this and what I can do. I am starting PT next week to see if it will help, but how long should I do physical therapy to see if it works? What if it does not help? Any help will be greatly appreciated.  Thank you in advance for your time.\n\n",

An MRA and/or arterial doppler study on the iliac and femoral artery may be revealing.   The problem does not sound like a nerve problem -- I would expect numbness with a nerve problem.  Otherwise, examining the sacral illiac joints, the lumbar area, the hip joint itself are all source of hip and groin pain.  Take care and let us know how is goes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello  I hurt my foot 5 weeks ago (4 april). It was a thick iron bar on the street i did not notice and hit the top part of my foot. It had swollen right away and turned black and blue - The part from the mid to the toes, like from below my big toe and the 3rd or 4th toe.   I was able to walk but was bit painful and black and swollen.I got the Xray done a day later. The doc said that there were no broken bones, but a blunt injury. He prescribed rest.  I had to travel abroad the next morning and have been walking at least 2 kilometers everyday since then. A couple of days as much as 10 Kms. I did not take any medication either. Tight shoes have been hurting. I do not wear high heels.  The blackness is almost gone but for a small lumpy area near the mid foot(top). Also slightly swollen. But for the past 4-5 days it is extremely painful.  I am unable to set foot on ground since yesterday and it hurts even though I am lying in bed since last 24 hours.   Please let me know your suggestion and advice about what I must do. I am in foreign country and language is a problem.  Someone back home suggested that I use elastoplaster and it will be fine. Please let me know if it is true?  All advice will be a great help indeed.  Thanks a lot in advance.\n\n",

At this point, using an Ace wrap, foot elevation, and ice packs is the most immediate treatment.  Crutches will help with walking and allow the foot to heal faster.  In general, ease up on the activity level and treat the pain and swelling as mentioned above.  NSAIDS will help too.  If the pain continues despite these measures, you will need to see a physician.

Had growth plates affected then and underwent Osteotomy to correct 2/3 CM difference. Fibula excised as it's growth not affected and started proturding outwards. It's a hard ball that hit on the tibia face which affected the growth plate.  In the current surgery both tibia and fibula is cut for distraction.  My questions: 1. I told my doctor that I have severe ankle pain. The doctors analyzed the X-Rays and found that my fibula is not distracting but only tibia. But I had the same severe ankle pain when I had femur distraction. Is my ankle pain source is because of fibula not distracting or it can be something else. Please note my ankle pain went off when I had a break after my Femur surgery.  2. The surgery site got swelled up after 3 weeks and its not going down at all. It's been swelled like that for almost a week continuously now. I'm yet to see my doctor and explain this. I know the whole leg swelling is normal when I sit for a long time, but not just the surgery site. Yes I'm doing more physical activity (like walking) than before as advised by the doctor.

    "content": "Hello, To answer the first question, it is hard to tell if the ankle pain is do to the fibula.  If the ankle joint space on x-ray looks normal and the distal fibula position is normal I would think something else is causing the pain.   If the pain occurs mostly with weight bearing then assessment is focused on leg length, compensatory movements, and integrity of foot joints, ligaments and tendons.  For the second question, with localized swelling at the surgical site it is important to follow up with the physician for examination.  Look for other signs of infection (pain, drainage, foul smell, redness, and warmth.)    You may be doing too much weight bearing too soon - this could cause the swelling and even affect the ankle.

    "content": "Hello, If your pain is on the inside part of the shin, this is probably shin splints.  Shin splints result from athletic activity and can be quite painful and debilitating. Shin splints results from microtrauma of the medial tibia where the posterior tibialis, soleus, or flexor digitorum longus muscles attach.  Sometimes stress fractures can occur so xray may be needed and in some cases a bone scan.  People with flattened or flattening arches can develop shin splints so it is important to check your foot type and quality of shoe support.  Treatment for shin splints includes ice, rest, stretching, correcting any muscle tightness or weakness problems in the leg, checking and correcting any foot problems, and sometimes taping or bracing.

If there is no fracture then we stick with the sprained wrist diagnosis and give it more time to heal.   Avoid the rotation movement for the time being.  If no fracture then work on straight plane motions e.g. flexion and extension of the wrist.  Then proceed to strengthening after full painfree range of motion. Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "I totally face planted as I missed a step and landed on the concrete basement floor. My worst injury was my right hand. The knuckle swelled on my index finger and between it and my pointer finger. There was no bruising and it did not swell on my palm side but the top of my hand. The fingers did not swell and I could bend them forward into a fist with minimal to no pain. I can extend it and place my palm flat on the table, however any upward or sideway motion is not happening and there is fairly decent pain.  I can rub the area and touch it I have even had a hand massage and they have gently pulled on the area, does not hurt to have this done. This happened almost three week ago and there is still some swelling and no better movement. Another strange thing is if I create a fist with both hands I notice I have a definite prominent knuckle on the uninjured left hand and a much more smaller knuckle protrusion on the index finger of the injured right hand. Any insight as to what I did to the area?\n\n",

Unfortunately during this time I had to deal with a physically abusive boyfriend, now ex-boyfriend. He proceeded to hurt me physically a few times. The latest incident, he hit my arm with a hammer where I had surgery (two weeks ago). Now I have spasms, slight tingling, numbness in the arm where I had surgery. Also my fifth finger has been sore for weeks. If I try to make a fist, pinky will not bend completely, pulling sensation and pain. Also my knuckle area is quite sore. When trying to  make a fist, knuckle is not as prominent. If I wiggle knuckle area with other finger, there is a slightly funny noise Also have alot of swelling, so not sure if that is why knuckle is not prominent. I know I should probably see a doctor, but feel quite humiliated by what happened to me.\n\n",

It is not your fault and I hope for your sake that he was reported to the authorities. Although you may have possibly suffered a fracture to your finger, I would first relate your symptoms to possible damage in the arm in which you had your surgical procedure.

    "content": "I had the splint taken off my finger about one week ago. Suppose to start physiotherapy within the next two weeks. I noticed my pinky finger will still overlap/rotate over my other finger and if I force my pinky finger down to the palm, it stays that way for a few second, pops back up. Also when holding  hand straight up, pinky finger bends forward. When laying hand flat on table, pinky finger bends, does not lay flat on table. Finger does not feel that stiff.  I did see my GP and he is concerned about nerve damage/problem. That tingling sensation I posted about before has increased since the fracture. I have been experiencing tingling for 3 months. I did tell the surgeon vaguely about the tingling 3 weeks ago, but he just said it should go away. I did not press the issue, so he probably doesn't know the full scoop. My GP wants me to tell the surgeon at my next appt, 5 weeks down the road, that he is concerned about nerve damage.  My 4th and 5th finger  and palm area below these fingers have a tingling sensation (similar to when your foot falls asleep).  Someone said this is the ulnar nerve? I hope I don't have nerve damage, but if I do, what can they do about it?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Generally speaking, it takes 6 weeks for bone to heal however with a plate and screws some fracture care will allow more use sooner than later.  This may be the case with your hand.  Talk to the ortho doc about restrictions on movement.  If he allows active range of motion but no strengthening then some typing may be fine.  I would not overdo it though.  Again, check with the ortho doc before starting exercise or return to work activity.   The likelihood of displacing the screws is low especially with guarded activities.   Swelling, pain, and stiffness will prevent full range of motion but with time this should improve.  The main thing is not to overdo activity at this point.   Take care and keep us posted.\n\n",

    "content": "i recently broke my wrist which was treated without surgery. However the doctor i first talked to recommended surgery for it. I have had the cast off for about 2 months and there is still a slight bump where my wrist broke (Radius bone) i believe. Anyway when i push the bone upwards my ulna shifts downwards. The doctor I saw got an MRI and said it looked like a properly healing fracture However im concerned about why the bone slips up and down when i push on the radius. I am not doubting the Fracture itself healed correctly but the position of my radius and Ulna are not correct. I have had the same injury to my right wrist and it had no slipping so im not sure if this is normal or not. Any suggestions would be great\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The follow up xrays after the cast was removed should show the alignment of the bones and if there is any abnormal displacement or angulation.  Perhaps the initial recommendation for operative reduction (ie open reduction) was to better align the bones prior to immobilization.    If the fracture has indeed healed, there should be no \"play\" or shifted of the bone fragments.  So, again the issue is how does the post cast xray look in comparison to previous xrays.    In general, your symptoms should be discussed with an orthopedist who can better evaluate the wrist and see if any treatment is needed.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello and Many Thanks for Your Help!  I fell off a jet ski over a week ago onto my right side and have since had a really bad pain in my upper right rib cage area - it does not feel severe enough to be a break. When I press down on the area it feels tender and a bit painful - the REAL BAD PAIN is when I cough, laugh, sneeze, clear my throat or try to get up if I am lying down - at that point the pain is unbearable. I cannot sleep on my right side at all as it is too painful and recently it even hurts if I sleep on my back. It only feels bearable if I am completely spreadout and my legs are straight.  Could this be a bruise or a break or is it just a muscle injury? Either way, should I wait it out or go to a doctor? I have waited a week and it hasn't gotten better at all......PLEASE HELP!\n\n",

    "title": "hole in shin bone?",
    "content": "I went to the doctor about a year ago, because i kept feeling a sharp pain in my shin whenever i put any lateral stress on it. So, they took xrays. There was a hole close to the top of the tibia. it was a good sized hole, too. They told me that it was mostlikely from how fast i grew (i am 6'4 and grew there in about 16 years), and because i played soccer for six years, and the repeated truma could have caused a cavity to form. After the xrays, I got a CT scan done. It showed another hole, about 1/4 the size of the first one, on the opposite side of the tibia. So, in june last year, they operated and filled the cavity with bone from a bone bank, and some bone they took from the top of the tibia.  It has been 10 months since the surgery, and there are three small holes where the first hole was ( went into the doctor last week and got xrays again) and also there is still nerve damage from the surgery. they cut the nerve that runs down the right side of the leg because it was in the way of them operating, and they said it would heal on its own.   My shin is extremely sensitive now due to the nerve damage, and after 9 holes of golf (using a cart, just from hitting the balls) my leg starts to hurt and gets to be unbearable. My doctor told me to give it a couple more months, and if the pain continues, to get another CT scan. For the mean time, he gave me Voltaren (75mg).  I have no idea why it would still hurt, and was reading about a type of cancer in the bone marrow (myeloma) that can stop the body's natural regrowth of bones. I just want a second (or more) opinion on this.  Any help if appreciated. Thank you in advance\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, With holes in the tibia that have not resolved the question is: Could this be myeloma? You would need to talk to your family physician about this for a review of your body systems for symptoms of myeloma (e.g. weight loss, pallor, bone pain especially in the lumbar area, sternum, skull and ribs).  A complete history and physical including lab work would be needed. From what you have described it doesn't sound like myeloma (however talk to doc about this).   The pain sounds like it is from the damaged nerve.  I am wondering if the superficial or deep peroneal nerve was damaged.  The surgeon would be able to asses for changes in sensation and strength of the leg supplied by these nerves.  It sounds like more follow up will be needed to examine these two area further and in more detail. Take care and let us know how it goes.\n\n",

    "content": "I have always excercised regularly, but it was non-weight bearing (e.g., elliptical machine, stationary bike). I started running this past March, and started out a pretty heavy shcedule. I ran 5 times a week anywhere from 3 to 4 miles. About 3 weeks later, I developed pain in my right foot, saw a doctor, and was diagnosed with a stress fracture in my third metarsal. I was put in a walking boot for 4 weeks, and just got the OK to go without it this past Tuesday (2 days ago). Since then, I have developed pain in my lower shin. It feels like very bad shin splint. It hurts when I walk and when I flex my foot. I am wondering if this is because I am just not used to walking without the boot yet (I am a college student at a large university, so I walk around campus all day long) or if it could possibly be another stress fracture in my tibia?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Yes and yes to your question about the shin splint.   It could be secondary to wearing the boot for 4 weeks then resuming regular walking.   It may be residual from the running and now presenting itself. Thirdly, it may be a stress fracture.  Shin splints are microtears or trauma at the medial tibia.   An examination and symptomatic treatment with NSAIDS, Ice or heat and rest would be indicated.  Xray may or may not show the fracture (if there is one).  Treatment would not change however may give you a clearly prognosis and when you may return to regular activities (granted that the running regimen was too much too fast). Take care.\n\n",

I ended up going the the emergency room and had x-rays done, but when they came back i guess they saw nothing there. They told me to take some tylenol and i should be fine, they even made jokes about going to the E.R. because of my pinky.  I get a SEVERE pain when ever i move my hand (right below my pinky knuckle) and the area where the pain is coming from has swollen and become bruised. The swelling is between my ring finger and my pinky finger knuckles. When i touch the area where i think the break is i cannot feel any kind of sensation on the skin surface (skin is numb). I thought maybe the doctors were right that i might have torn some tissue in there and it will heal over time. As it stand right now it is getting worste than when it first happened. What worries me the most about this is the numbness im getting to my skin where the swelling is. It feels like my vein is turning solid (which is creepy).  My question is: If this is not a break then what could this possibly be?  Or Could this really be a break and the doctors just missed it somehow?\n\n",

    "content": "If this has been a month ago and symptoms are worsening, please see a doctor very very soon.  Even if not broken it could have done some damage temporarily to the connective tissues.  (eg. sprain).  The numbness is a little conerning also.  It sounds as if either the swelling itself is affecting a nerve or that you could have something else going on as a result of the injury causing a problem with a nerve. Do not let this go.    And I just want to add that you did the right thing by going to the ER in the first place.  As far as missing something on an x/ray, I don't know.  However, I do not think it is common to miss a fracture diagnosis with an x/ray.    Some temporary things that you might do is to keep the hand elevated as often as possible to reduce the swelling.  You might call your doctor and ask him if you can use some ice packs on the hand also.  Maybe apply ice for about 10 minutes  and then remove it  for a few minutes.  Do this several times a day.   Also ask the doc if you can take some Ibuprofen over the counter as it is an anti inflamatory medication that may also help relieve some of the pain.  Seek attention for that hand.

The brachial plexus (the main nerve bundle innervating the upper limbs) can be compromised or damaged with a distal clavicle fracture and can cause sensory changes in the limb. It will therefore be important to evaluate the neurological function.  I may recommend a consult with an orthopedist and physiatrist. Take care and let us know how it goes.\n\n",

The best chance at getting some range of motion to return is to have the finger surgically fixed and start early motion. An orthopedic surgeon can guide you through all the details. Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "About 4 months ago my husband and I were going for a walk and I rolled my ankle inward on an uneven sidewalk.  I immediately fell to the ground and had severe pain.  After a few minutes rest, I walked home with my husbands help.  I still had pain, but it had subsided a bit from the initial accident.  I'm not typically the kind of person to be a complainer about things, so I just let it go and really did nothing for it.  After a few days it started feeling better, but not completely.  I thought in time I would be ok.  However, its been at least 4 months now, and I have this painful popping/cracking on the outer portion of my ankle if I turn it certain ways.  (ATFL?)  It doesn't particularly bother me if I'm walking, but I drive a stick shift and I notice that when I move my foot from the gas to the clutch, this is when most of the discomfort takes place.     Is this something that is a big deal that I should get it looked at, or in time will it be ok?   It just worries me that I didnt do anything after the initial injury and something might be wrong.   Thanks for your help\n\n",

    "title": "Re: possible ATFL injury?",
    "content": "Hello, focusgrl824: ATFL stands for anterior talo fibular ligament.  It commonly is sprained with an inversion ankle sprain.  It sounds like the ankle hurts moving from gas to brake...this would require the ankle evertors (e.g. peroneus brevis and longus muscles) to contract.  However, if you press on the brake with the ball of the foot with the ankle turned in slightly, this may mimic the motion that sprained the ankle. If any case, it is important to do some rehab exercises with the ankle and even see a physical therapist.  This can be set up through your family physician.   donovan0311:  The ankle pain may indeed be arthritis which can occur secondary to trauma or overuse.  An xray would be my choice of test to see if the ankle joint and bones around the ankle are healthy.   Otherwise a thorough history and physical exam may reveal a causative factor.  This may be done by an orthopedist who specializes in foot and ankle problems.  Take care and let us know how it goes.\n\n",

I read somewhere on the internet that after some rhinoplasty that some surgeons suggest pressing the nose to help it to get narrow in the right place etc.. but that didnt really help. Infact it made it swell a bit so looked a bit worse.  Can you suggest any way of me helping lessen the bump in it? I have an appointment at the hospital but its not until September (long waiting list!) and im not even sure they will help without making me pay thousands (i like in the UK so its either free or expensive). They may help because it was an injury but im not too confident.  Anyway i was wondering if i should continue trying with the pressure to see if it lessens the bump?  Also, is there any way of me knowing if the lump is just swelling that could be drained with a needle? It feels sorta soft when i press it and doesnt feel like bone is sticking out. It woud take alot of my mind if i knew they could maybe just drain it.  Sorry if this sounds vain but it really ruined my face and makes me look quite ugly especially from a side profile and its making me pretty depressed and self conscious   Any help desperatly welcome\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Regarding the rhinoplasty, I do not know if the shape of the nose is due to the surgery or not.  I can only suggest that you talk to the surgeon who did the procedure and see what the further options are to correct the problem if it is affecting your daily living.   Regarding the closed reduction to straighten the nose, usually the reduction is done post trauma.  So,at this point, the question is would we correct the deformity for cosmetic reasons or to allow better breathing or prevention of sinus infections.  An ear,nose and throat doctor can evaluate the nose and nasal cavity to determine the best next step.  All the best to both of you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Any high or repetitive impact traumatic injury causing sudden onset of pain warrants an xray.   If no fracture, then we write this a sprain.  Sprains traumatize ligaments and the tissue around joints.  Since the pain is radiating to the thumb, there may be some acute arthrtis in the wrist or carpal joints on the thumb side (radial side).   It is important to have this x-ray before moving on with rigorous hand use because a re-traumatized fracture will not heal well. If no fracture, you may consider some physical therapy on the hand for a few weeks. Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "I slipped on ice while going down stairs and fell HARD and landed on my upper rump (rear end) with massive impact.  I had hit the edge of the step.  Owie!!!!  I had a MASSIVE bruise that is healing nicely almost 3 weeks later but a rather large bump remains and is quite prominent.  It is hard.  I am thinking it might be damaged tissue or a hematoma.  I am not sure if I should go get it checked.  I am just glad I didn't land any higher...it would have been an expensive trip to the ER.  Anyway, do hematomas resolve on their own?  How do they function and work?  How long should I wait to see if it eventually goes away?  Does this seem characteristic of one?  I currently have a very odd contour on that right buttocks where I hit it.    Also, I checked my blood pressure with the home-device used to monitor my elderly parents blood-pressure and it was lower than normal ...quite consistently (97/60).  Just a couple of months ago I was having problems with elevated blood pressure and headaches (the only trigger I could find was taking Yasmin - I stopped taking it and my blood pressure seemed to regulate).  Now it is lower than normal.  Could lower blood pressure have an impact on healing properly from this fall?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: When is a hematoma a problem?",
    "content": "Hello, Thanks for the question. A hematoma (literally: a blood tumor) is a collection of blood within a specific area of the body usually the result of trauma.  In your case, the gluteal area has a large bump that has not resolved.  This could be a hematoma.   The body will reabsorb the blood and can be assisted with heat and gentle exercise.  It is important to watch for numbness in the leg, increasing local pain or pain down the leg or up the back.  Since the gluteal muscle is contained within fascia, you could suffer from compartment syndrome which may compress nerves in the gluteal area (sciatic nerve).  Also, calcification build up can occur and cause a permanent hard nodule in the muscle.  Sometime physical therapy can help resolve some the swelling, pain, and any loss of motion.  It is important to have this evaluated by a physician who can make a better determination of the exact diagnosis.  Let us know how it goes or if you have any further questions.  Take care.\n\n",

Now that I am 32 and bald I have discovered the crack is a U shape and starts in the front and U's around to the side of my skull (around right frontal lobe.)  It is old, deep and prevelant.  The top front right off skull is somewhat flat.  The rest of skull us symetrical.  Is it normal to have cracks in the skull in this area.  Could it of caused issues?  Is it is still causing issues?  When I was a child I experienced learning issues regardless of a high IQ.  I am left handed and my handwriting is terrible regardless of practice and a decent education.  I want to bounce this off a few forums before I spend lots of money on it since my insurance, like most Americans, sucks and pays for nothing; especially \"pre-existing.\"  Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, As young children the skull bones are not fused until later childhood.   Some skull abnormalities occasionally exist where the sutures (between the individual skull bone) fuse prematurely.  Whether this was your case, I do not know.  The result can be abnormal shape of the head and potentially poor brain development.   As an adult, skull fractures can obviously cause lots of problems - bleeding and swelling and since the brain controls many body functions, a host of secondary problems can result.   If there are no neurological problems (weakness, speech problems, hearing, vision, taste, salivation, cognition, mood, memory, poor balance, seizures.), then the shape of the skull is likely not causing problems. I would consider asking a physician to check the skull and cranial nerves and other neurological office tests/exam to rule out any deficits.   Take care.\n\n",

    "title": "Stress fracture found a year later...can it still heal?",
    "content": "Over a year ago, I ran into the outside corner of a protruding wall while running and broke the long bone of my middle toe quite badly.  It broke at a diagonal clean through the length of the bone.  It took 3 months in a post op shoe and on crutches before I could bear weight without shooting pain.  I continued to have issues with the three middle toes and the front half of my foot after it had supposedly healed, but I was told it was probably tissue damage and to give it time...so I did.   Recently it flared up quite badly and I went to a different doc for x-rays and another opinion.  The x-rays showed that the broken toe had not healed very well because it was not set and the raw ends did not meet up well.  This is secondary to the other finding though.  The new x-rays show a stress fracture in the metatarsal bone just below the broken toe bone.  This fracture runs the center third of the bone.  Because it was not known at the time, it did not heal because it would have required a cast or surgical boot in order to do so effectively.     I\u2019m advised to wear a surgical boot for 8-12 weeks now to see if the fracture will stabilize.  The Doc is hoping this will also allow more time for the toe to heal better.  This sounds good to me, since I don\u2019t want to be \u201cGimpygal\u201d my whole life.    My concern is that everyone who thinks they know anything is telling me that stress fractures never really heal and that a year after a break heals, it\u2019s as healed as it ever will be.    It would give me great comfort to hear that this is not true and that my Doc is correct and it still stands a good chance of healing.  Which is right?  Can I still heal with stabilization at this point?     If so, are there additional tips to help the healing process along.  I do plan on taking more calcium and vitamin D.  Are icing, heat therapy, elevation and the like any use at this point?  What else can I do to help myself if anything?   Thank you for any advise and support.\n\n",

    "title": "joint pain in wrist, post fracture",
    "content": "Hello.  I'm a 21 year old male, with little substantial medical history.  At age 15, I broke my left wrist (through both growth plates).  This was not a hairline fracture, my hand was literally attached by skin and connective tissue.  The orthopedic surgeon re-set the bones under conscious sedation, no invasive surgery was necessary.  The bones healed normally, however, in the years following the wrist has become stiff and I've lost a lot of mobility and lifting capability.  I'm also a left-handed writer, and the pain and stiffness is so bad I've had to learn to write with my right hand.  X-ray imaging has shown the growth plates to be slightly enlarged, which would explain loss of range of motion and pain with movement.  In the past 8 months, I've felt moderate to severe pain in said wrist (6 to 9 on the meaningless pain scale) and it's worse if I try to move it.  This is interfering with both work and school.  I've tried taking aspirin, advil, and even various over the counter arthritis medication, to no avail.  1000mg acetemenaphin (sp?) does nothing but make me fall asleep, which is nice however I don't want to damage my liver at such a young age.  Recently I had an unrelated medical problem where I was prescribed hydrocodone, then oxycodone for renal colic, which worked wonderfully for the wrist pain however I've heard so much about the horrors opiate dependency and addiction, that that's something I don't want to risk.    What kind of specialist should I see?  What can I expect? Is this a problem I can have fixed through surgery? Do the risks outweigh the pain and inconvenience of living with this problem?  I'm so confused, uncertain, and tired of living with this that any help you can offer would be forever appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The fracture in the growth plate is classified according to Salter/Harris classification system.  At 15 y.o. your growth plate was nearly matured.  It is possible a bony bridge developed across the growth plate to retard further growth in the wrist.  This can predispose the wrist to angular deformities...leading to pain and dysfunction.  Since you are 21 y.o. there is no indication to remove the bony bridge.  Certainly follow up xrays are important to see if any secondary deformities exist and if any splinting or surgical correction can be done.  Otherwise, the remaining treatment options involve rehabilitating the hand and possible splinting. Hope this gives you some direction. Take care and let us know how things turn out.\n\n",

    "content": "I was injured in a bicycle accident in May of last year. I did not have money for the ER, so I waited hoping it would get better. I was out of the country during the summer for study abroad and it did improve some but very slowly. When I returned in August, I was diagnosed with a Gamekeeper's Fracture, although the physician suggested it would probably heal alright. He tested my movement and said it shouldn't be impaired. He suggested I return if pain was still present in a couple months, to discuss possible surgery.       Unfortunately, my insurance ran completely out in a couple months, and pain was still present. Encouraged by the seemingly good news, I continued to wait for the pain to go away. It is now 5 months since my diagnosis, and my thumb is bothering me quite a bit. Not only the fracture hurts, but the muscles around it. It affects my life greatly, as I am a semi-professional guitar player.       Is surgery still an option? Can my thumb be repaired this late? Is there any hope of ever getting this fixed, if I manage to acquire insurance within a month or two? Is there anything I should do that would help until I can get seen by a professional again?  Thank you very, very much for your time. I am in a state of total despair over this.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Gamekeepers fracture is due to strained or torn ulnar collateral ligament of the MCP joint of the thumb.  With splinting, this usually heals over 4-6 weeks.  However, chronic gamekeepers thumb can cause an unstable joint which leads to chronic pain and poor healing.  Sometimes the joint is fused to stabilize the joint.   Unfortunately, the thumb probably wasn't stabilized initially and has not healed.  It would be helpful to see an orthopedist to see if a cast or splint for 6-8 weeks would allow healing or if the joint needs to be fused.

Risk factors for non union include infection, severe displacement or angulation, open fracture, comminuted fractures, poor blood supply, smokers, or poor stabilization of bony reduction.   You may need to internally fixate the bone again with small plate or nails or bone graft.  But first you may use a bone scan with radionucleotide to see if there is good blood flow to the bone.  This will help determine prognosis and if the bone should be fixed for a prolonged period of time. Take care and let us know how it goes.\n\n",

I went though all the doctor visits and x-rays, all the treatment given to me was a Figure-o-eight brace and a mini ultrasound unit to help the bone heal, which I was told is what is done in most cases. Well around Dec of last year and early Jan this year, it started to bother me a lot, discomfort, and pain, I figured this was due to the cold weather seeing how other places I have had broken bones tend to get sore during cold temperatures. Well now that its almost April (year later) and warm temperatures, its still been bother me, starting to hurt even more, I would also like to add that my movement in my right arm is limited, been like this since the break, and was told that it should clear with a few months, but still can barely move it around. Mine didn't heal correctly (term being Non-Union i believe) as in lining up the break, and the bone sorta over lapped the other one, and here lately it feels like the top piece is digging into my shoulder, I've check a few website and talked to a few people, and been told that the doctor should have done surgery on me, pull the bones back, connect the end and pin and plate it. The break was about a inch away from my shoulder. Now for my question should I have had surgery for this break, and if so what should i be in store for over this, seeing how that I've been told to get this fix ASAP due to the break being close to something called a A/C joint. Thank you for you help and if you have any questions I'll be more then happy to answer them.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi. I am a 33 year old male, about 60-70 pounds overweight. I've been have chronic pain in my left knee for a little over a year now. It's always worse at the end of the day after activity. I had an accident 10 years ago when a car I was working on slipped off jackstands and landed on my left knee. I was able to pull it out since it was on gravel and was walking (gingerly) on it the next day. I didn't go to the ER but I should have. I was wondering what type of injury this may have caused and what kind of problems I should expect as I get older.  Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It is so hard to tell what could have been damaged from the car landing on your knee.  Any of the structures internally (cartilage, menisci, ligaments, bone) or externally (ligaments, bone, joint capsule) could have been damaged.  With pain that worsens at the end of the day, I think about tendonitis or arthritis. Both may cause pain in the evening plus can cause morning stiffness - usually arthritis more than tendonitis.   I would recommend seeing your family doc to have the knee examined.  In the office, your physciain can test the internal and external structures with certain manuevers and tests. He may also prescribe anti inflammatory medicine. Let us know how it goes and if we can answer any further question. Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello I am new here but am looking for some suggestions. For the past several months I have had pain in my lower legs. It feels like the bone cause if i walk or turn my legs they hurt but touch doesnt hurt. Also a sense of relief is when I stretch the legs or sit in hot water. For years I was told I had arthritis in my knees but 5 years later I was told that I do not have arthritis but that my knees were dislocated and last year I underwent 2 medial plications with lateral release. THis helped significantly but has not stopped the leg pain. It feels like my legs are bruised and aching but I cant touch the pain. It is so frustrating cause I have no idea what the cause is. Ive read about overworked muscles in my legs but I don't have any new habits and its not occasionally its been constant. Im not sure what else to include so if you have anyother questions I can answer but I hope someone has an idea of what the cause is.  thank you   sandra\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Sandra --  Bone pain is possible but rather unlikely, especially given your history. While you can't \"touch\" the pain, or reproduce it through prodding, it is relieved by stretching your legs and by immersion in warm water, so it's very likely due to either inflammation of muscle/connective tissue (although this should be possible to reproduce through prodding or very firm touch), or possibly shortened, somewhat atrophied muscle due to adjustment following plication and release. This may not cause tenderness by palpation, but would certainly cause some aching and might well be relieved by the methods you mention. If this works then perhaps this is the best approach: stretching and application of moist heat.   There is also the possibility this is nerve pain related to the procedures, and this may not be reproduceable by manual pressure. If this can be identified,the problem can be managed medically via pain blocking medications.   Hope this is helpful. Good luck to you. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I agree with John's assessment and would like to elaborate on another possibility.  Another consideration is claudication either neurological or vascular.  Claudication is a term which describes leg pain which increases during walking and sometimes standing.  The pain usually occurs in both calves.  In one case, the blood vessels ie arteries are clogged and prevent blood flow and oxygen to the muscles causing pain; in the second case spinal stenosis (narrowing of the spinal canal) pressing on central nerve tissue causing bilateral leg pain. In any case, if what I have described in terms of pain in both legs especially the calf which worsens with standing or walking, see your physician for further testing.  All the best to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Seven days ago I fell on a icy step and hurt my wrist. It became very swollen and bruised. I figured it wasn't broken, maybe sprained and there is no bone deformity. By the next day the pain was worse so I went to the ER.  They took an xray of the scaphoid and top of wrist. Xrays showed no fractures. ER doctor gave me pain meds, told me not to use my wrist. That is all that was said and I left. No splint applied ( I figured if there isn't a fracture they would likely not splint it anyways).   Time has passed and I still have a lot of pain, bruising and swelling. The majority of pain is in the scaphoid area. My neighbour told me that if there is a problem with the scaphoid such as a fracture, they don't always show up on an xray, hard to diagnose.  Injury is to my right wrist, my dominant hand. If I try to grip a pencil it hurts in that area. Pressing in that area causes pain ( I don't make a point of pressing there, just testing pain area a few times).  Should I wait this out longer, for another week or more or should I be seen by someone else soon?  I don't see any deformity except I am guessing swelling is causing my whole hand  (when you look at it palm side up)to curve somewhat to the left.  I keep it elevated and applying ice packs.  Thanks for your help\n\n",

    "content": "You are doing the right things by keeping the hand elevated and ice packs.  Limited use of the hand according to pain level is also important.  An ACE wrap or splint would help support the hand and control swelling.  Scaphoid fractures are notorious for hiding.  A repeat xray or an MRI will be needed. Scaphoid fractures are also notorious for not healing (depending on where the break is).   So it is important to follow up in a week unless the hand becomes cold and numb in which case see physician ASAP.    Keep us posted.\n\n",

Wearing a cast and/or arm sling can cause strain on these areas and potentially neurological problems (such as pins and needles).

I came in and he said that he wanted the cast changed but I would have to go elsewhere since he is limited in supplies. Figured another cast clinic would have fibre glass casts etc. I phoned one place and they needed a referral. He wrote me one that basically said date of injury, he had strong suspicion of scaphoid fracture despite normal xrays and to please change the cast.   I made an appointment with this other clinic and gave them the referral note. They removed the cast, took xrays. The orthopaedic doctor on duty asked me how it was injured, I explained what happened, where the pain is, casted for past two weeks etc. The referral letter was in front of him which he looked at quickly. He looked at the xrays and said hmm can't see anything, hard to say. The ortho started to walk out of the room and said 'no need to see me again' and was gone. Didn't see him around to ask anymore questions. I mentioned to the cast technician in the hallway about getting the cast replaced according to the doctor referral note which is on my chart. He said if the doctor didn't mention a cast change I guess he doesn't want it done. The doctor had already left for the day.  I contacted the doctor who originally saw me. He is away on holidays and I do have an appointment that was booked a few weeks ago to see him next week.  So basically I have nothing on my wrist. I don't want to wear a cast if I don't need it but at the same time if something is going on like a scaphoid problem I'm a bit worried.  Is there anything I should do? I have pain in the scaphoid area and take tylenol 3 when needed, try to avoid using wrist too much.\n\n",

Maintaining full and normal hand range of motion will be important so gentle range of motion exercises may begin at week 2-3.  However check with your physician before starting any exercise with the hand.    Whether you can type without the splint will depend on the extent of the fracture and the amount of pain and swelling both during and after the activity.  Your hand will tell you if the activity is too much too soon.  Again, check with your physician before doing activity without the splint.

I have placed the hand on \"light duty\" and use my left hand for activities that require strength. btw , the cupboard is fixed , you could hardly tell that it was damaged.

With a hairline fracture, there is usually no displacement or angulation of the bone The bone stays straight (no reduction needed) and heals with time and avoidance of trauma.  Hope this helps. If in doubt, check with your orthopedist for details in treating your condition.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm getting pretty sick of how I am still not very able to have full use of my left hand like I did before I broke it. Three years ago, I got into a scuffle and acted in self defense..somehow, I got a Boxer's Fracture, it was to my 5th metacarpal..except, it wasn't fractured (not sure why the doc said both of these things), it was totally broken in the middle of the metacarpal. Adding to that, I fractured my ring finger knuckle...now I am left with a bad deformity of my dominant hand and no pinky knuckle. I've been in and out of the same ortho's office and they always say \"it's just a contusion that's causing your swelling, go to a physical therapist\". I was in two different casts for a total of 9 weeks, was in physical therapy for 5 weeks..that didn't help. Whenever I write a lot ( I have to since I am in high school) or I play my guitar (I was taught the right handed way, just my luck)  there's MAJOR swelling. I hardly even notice the bruise colors on my bad hand anymore! When I have the swelling around my knuckles (ring finger and middle finger), my pinky starts to jam up..I guess because I don't have a knuckle anymore (how my hand healed was goofy, my 5th metacarpal curves up then indents majorly where the pinky knuckle was), plus my wrist snaps a lot now and that radiates up my forearm...I don't know what to do anymore.   Is there ANY kind of answer besides it's just bruising. There must be more than that. Is there any surgery to correct this? knuckle replacement? anything? PLEASE help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Thanks for writing in. You have described right hand dysfunction (pain, swelling, loss of mobility) due to boxer's fracture (aka break in bone) and MCP damage.    It is difficult to advise about surgical options since I can not see the xray but it would be important to evaluate the radiograph of the hand to look for alignment of the metatarsal bones and MCP joints.  An MRI may also be helpful to look at the soft tissue structures of the hand.  Hand can be difficult to rehab.  First things first: make sure the hand is structually intact (bones are straight, no dislocations, and ligaments and tendons are secure). Next, focus on restoring normal range of motion and controlling swelling.  Finally, regain strength.   An occupational therapist (one who has experience with hand rehab) can best guide you through the rehab.  But first make sure all structures are intact - using radiographs, MRI, and clinical assessment.  The wrist clicking and pain is probably due to compensatory movements of the hand ie secondary to the boxer's fracture.   Let us know how it goes.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Last year I had an EMG on my hand and it came back fine. no nerve or muscle damage, which is good, but the doctor still didn't give me an alternative answer. I definitely need to go to a different doctor for this because the old one definitely did not help. One night probably in February of 08, I went a local ER and the doctor looked at it and told me the x-ray came back with no broken or fractured bones (which was a given at the time) but the lack of my knuckle not being there caused my the left side of my hand to not have much support which is why it slumps. And yes, the bone healed with a slight downward curve that you can definitely see...not to mention is very odd to feel. I think when it was in the cast, the bone was a little rotated...but I'm not a doctor so I do not know.  I have one of those grippers in effort to make my hand strong again but unfortunately that doesn't help. But I'll definitely look into going to a different doctor and seeing what they can really do...If you have anymore advice, it's much appreciated!\n\n",

If leg swelling worsens, you may develop compartment syndrome which can cause nerve and blood vessel damage and irreversible muscle paralysis.

    "content": "Hello, It is a common question whether or not to xray a jammed toe.    A toe can be fracture and the person be able to walk.  Ability to walk, level of pain and swelling are somewhat helpful in assessing for toe fractures.  However, if you suspect a fracture, it is important to xray it.  Although the treatment (ice, elevation, rest, and usually budding taping) may not change, knowing there is or is not a fracture changes your level of activity, the amount of caution used in daily activities, and expected healing time.  So I would recommend an xray for a severely jammed toe.    Take care and let us know how it goes.\n\n",

My Therapist is concerned that two fingers are still very swollen and numb and the numbness seems to be spreading from the tips down to the palm. I suspect ulnar nerve damage, as my Dr said, and he believes the swelling will go down. But yesterday, a woman at therapy warned me her mother had swelling and it could be a sign of an oncoming stroke or other condition. Is this posssible?   Seperately, I have been suffering from some  great fatigue and hair loss,etc and thought it was a thyroid issue (My psychiatrist had me on Lithium) and had blood tests. My TSH levels were in the low normal range (.525) of the .5 - 5.0 (or .3 - 3.0) whichever range you use. I heard low thyroid function could aggravate numbness and thought this may be prolonging the issue. My T4 level is normal.\n\n",

First, about the thyroid: a low TSH usually is a sign of hyperthyroidism (symptoms: intolerance to heat, weight loss, anxiety and nervousness, palpitations).  Check for a low free T3.  Occasionally, the T4 does not convert to T3 (activated component of thyroid hormone).  Regarding the finger numbness.  An EMG would show any ulnar nerve palsy (which innervates the intrinsic hand muscles and skin over the 5th digit and 1/2 of the 4th digit).    It is important to control the swelling (elevation, compression, and ice) as the swelling may cause some tingling or numbness.   In essence, follow up with the orthopedist and family physician for above considerations.    Let us know how it goes.  Take care.\n\n",

I have it in a gel cast and am on crutches for 1 to 2 weeks per their instructions.  It is swollen extremely around the ankle bone area and can't bare any weight.

I am at my desk job keeping it up on a chair for elevation.  The foot rest is just slightly lower than my chair I sit in.  The problem is that it hurts more to keep it up... I start to get numb and tingly like my foot is falling asleep. Even after I bring it down from the foot rest it is as if I can feel the blood flow in a tingly way for a long time.  There isn't any discoloration of my toes.. some slight bruising starting around the ankle.  Should I be concerned about blood clots or nerve damage?  Should I see an orthopedic?\n\n",

Is there numb and tingly sensation at times other than after elevating the foot on the stool at work.  It may be just this position - stretching posterior leg tissue including sciatic nerve.  How about when you lie flat and elevate the foot.   Other helps with swelling are ice packs and ACE wrap.  Try another position for elevating the foot, continue with previously recommended treatment, add ice packs and ACE wrap.  If no change after a few days or if it worsens see your family physician.

    "content": "Hello - about 10 days ago I was in the shower and reaching for a towel when my feet slipped out from under me.  I landed with my full weight on the right side of my upper torso on the ceramic bathtub ledge with my arms landing outside the tub on the floor.  Other than severe pain I didn't have any other physical symtoms so I thought it was maybe a bruised rib.  I figured that even if I cracked a rib nothing could be done about it, since I've heard that they don't tape them anymore so I didn't go to the doctor.  It continued to be very painful, mainly in the area a few inches below my right armpit and hurts if I cough or breathe very deeply. I never could see a bruise or swelling.  I knew that it would take a long time to heal, but the pain has gotten a lot worse the last couple days and I can't find a way to sleep that doesn't hurt.  Also, although the area under my right arm still hurts, now my back seems to hurt more.  I can't bend or twist my upper body.  Is that the normal progression for bruised or cracked ribs while they are healing? Also in the last couple days I have a very low grade fever and feel like I'm getting a cold in my chest.  Could that be related?  I've been trying to cough up what is in my chest from the cold, but it's pretty painful.  (I guess this means I can't go skiing next week!).  Thank you very much.\n\n",

With suspected rib injury/fracture, it is important to get an xray to see the extent of the damage.  Sometimes lungs are punctured (pneumothorax).   Also, it is important to take pain meds (even prescription strength) to help with breathing / pain control.  Folks with rib injuries are at risk of some lung collapse (atelectasis) and pneumonia due to not taking deep breaths. In sum, see a physician for evaluation especially now that you feel a chest cold developing. Keep in touch and let us know how it turns out.\n\n",

    "content": "I got in a fight last night. One hitter quitter. The knuckle of my middle finger is pretty swollen right now. It wasn't that bad last night. Two hours after the fight, I was playing pool with minimal pain. Since I have no insurance, I'm wondering how long I can wait before having the more serious consequences of a fractured hand... my friend's mom says hours... but I'd guess a couple days?? Hopefully the swelling will decrease, and I'll be able to close my fist in those couple days of icing & elevation.  There's also a bump on the back of my hand... right above my wrist, and what seems to be my middle finger (and maybe index too, but I can still move that one). I've read that this bump prolly wont go away. Is this a clear sign of a fracture? Is there any clear sign??  I've also read that boxer's fractures are usually associated with ring and/or pinky fingers. What's up with that?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Pain and swelling in the hand are signs of either fracture of sprain.  Judging by the mechanism, fracture should be ruled out with an xray.  A fracture to 5th metacarpal bone (boxer's fracture) occur as a result an angulated force to the hand (eg a right cross) rather than a direct blow down straight through the hand (eg a jab).  Martial arts users are taught to strike a straight forward blow thus avoiding hand fracture.  If you watch a fella break a board with his fist, you will notice the force is directly parallel or axial to the forearm bones and the wrist is locked in neutral - there is no roundhouse punch to break the board as this would break the hand.    Take care.  Let us know how it turns out.\n\n",

Guy was a bit bigger than me and had just gotten outta jail, so I knew I only had 1 shot or I woulda been pulp for not putting him down.  I really don't have money to be spending on x-rays, but I had to go since I definitely need use of my hand/finger.  I guess I'm lucky that it wasn't fractured, but even if it was... there's not much a doctor could do besides put it in a splint/cast, right?  I mean, it's not completely broken... so there's nothing that needs to be reset.  My own personal recommendation to any others who think they have a boxer's fracture on their middle knuckle from punching someone in the face and not a wall... if you can move the finger thru approx 1/3 its normal motion, then just put the thing in a splint and don't move it, keep it elevated, and alternate icing every 20 min.  Due to my lack of insurance and the possibility of others not having it... what's the max time you docs would hold out on visiting for x-rays??  I got paranoid when people were telling me I only had \"hours to properly set a fracture\"... but am I wrong in thinking you could make it 3 or 4 days.  I'd think it should be obvious by that point if it's just a sprain or not.  Opinions?  Facts?  Thanks again.\n\n",

You can get healing with splinting, ice, and pain meds.  However some fracutures shatter bone or show significant angulation or displacement then reduction (bringing the pieces together and in good alignment) is needed.  I say all this to say, it is important to xray bones which may be fractured.   Take care and keep us posted.\n\n",

Some remedies for a stiff and sore joint include acetominophen or ibuprofen, warm compresses followed by gentle passive motion (use your other hand to gently bend the pinky), and support (there are self adhesive stretchy bandages on the market that works nicely when wrapping digits - not too tight though).    Repetitive work with the hands can cause joint inflammation.  What kind of work do you do?  Let us know how things turn out.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for the info. I've tried taking ibuprofen and it helps take away the pain but its only temporary. It seems to be the second knuckle only, ie I can bend the last knuckle and it doesnt hurt and I can bend it from the joint/knuckle at the base but the middle knuckle feels as if the bones are fused almost.   I type a lot, and I also play mandolin which requires me to stretch that finger, but I've had this longer than I've been playing. Also when I type I don't use that finger much and it doesnt seem to hurt when I type.  My main question I guess is, why is it lacking in flexibility so much? My other fingers can all bend normally but this one seems to just not bend right, as if there was a break in the past that didnt heal right, but I've never injured that finger as far as I know.  Should I break down and pay for xrays to see if there is some sort of spur or something affecting the mobility of hte finger?\n\n",

Someone told me that my collar bone will never return to normal again.. and I could have some shoulder soreness for the rest of my life.

There was immediate swelling (golf ball sized) lump, tenderness and light pain. I used ice to reduce the swelling and rested it for some time. The pain dissipated and I now have full range of motion with hardly any discomfort at all. The only thing that is still present is some swelling in that area. There is still a lump/bump there that will not go away. Again, it is not painful, but I wonder if it could be a ganglionic cyst of some sort or something which needs to be aspirated. What do you think?  Also, the lump is roundish, as wide as a plum and fairly hard. No discoloration. It is about 1-1.5cm in height. It seems when I wrap it with an ace bandage the swelling gets diffused. ie, after I take the wrap off after wearing it for 8 hours there is hardly any swelling at all. Then it goes back to that area.\n\n",

Ganglion cysts usually occur on the back of the hand or top of the foot and can be caused by trauma. The treatment options are: treat the swelling and wait; aspirate the fluid; aspirate the fluid and inject with corticosteroid; or surgical removal of the cyst.  Option two and three carry the same 50% rate of resolution.  Ganglion cysts are notorious for returning so recurrent cysts should be considered for surgical removal.  Hope this helps.

You should discuss return to activity time frame with your orthopedist because he or she alone knows the details of the fusion i.e. the extent of the initial damage, how the operation went, what was the quality of bone, and which specific bones were fused - talus to the calcaneus and/or talus to the navicular.   Remember that strengthening muscles around the ankle and in the foot will take 6 weeks plus 3 weeks of proprioceptive training.  So total recovery time takes about 4 months minimum.  When you do return to regular activities, do so gradually.  Problems may not present themselves for several days or weeks.  So easy does it.  Let us know how it goes.\n\n",

Too much swelling in the leg can cut off blood flow to and from the leg and compress nerves to the foot.    Generally, the limb will hurt more when you stand.  Blood is pooling in the limb.  It pools because the lower leg muscles can not contract and work to pump the blood back up the leg.  So stopping and elevating the leg periodically is important.  Pain is the body's natural way of protecting the limb from too much swelling.     Nevertheless, it is important to call the orthopedist and let them know what is happening, they may need to check and/or change the cast.    Let us know how things go and if we can answer any more questions.\n\n",

    "content": "I fell down 15 stairs June 8 and broke my elbow - they called it a \"terrible triad\" injury.  I had surgery to repair it and they put in 3 pins and 2 screws.  6 weeks later I had to have surgery to \"unfreeze\" my arm and remove 1 screw.  I have recovered well and even surprised my doctor with having 95% use of my arm.  But within the last couple of days I've noticed a knot forming on my elbow, right beneath my incision.  Occasionally it itches, but it's solid and swells when I use it a lot.  My surgeon has released me, but could this be a pin or screw backing out and coming loose?  If so, do I have to have surgery to remove it (I had to quit my job because I was off work for more than 3 months) so I now am uninsured.  If I don't have surgery, what will happen?  Thank you for your time.  My surgeon is on vacation, so I can't ask him.\n\n",

Regarding the hard, itchy, swelling knot near the incision, it may be a screw or pin withdrawing from the bone so an xray will be necessary.    If this is a screw loosening, it will continue to cause problems and need to be removed or replaced.    First things first, have the elbow xray'd and follow up with your physician for results.

    "content": "Hello,  Best case scenario is the screw needs to be removed and not replaced.  The screw stays where it is (does not back out of the bone any further) and causes no more local irritation and the body does not recognize it as a foreign body (which could cause increased swelling, redness, pain)... and the hardware does not poke through the skin causing a fresh wound and the wound does not get infected.   Worst case scenario is that the screw needs to be replaced but you wait.  It backs out of the bone.  The bone is somewhat unstable.  You hit the elbow accidentally and break it again.  More surgery, more rehab, more pain.  You and your surgeon ought to discuss the pros and cons of waiting before making your final decision.  Keep us posted.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The thumb spica splint is a specific splint for thumb injuries.  It can be purchased at a medical supply company.    Taping the thumb with medical or athletic tape is another option but needs an athletic training to show someone else (ie family member) how to tape it.  A tape job can not be done one handed... at least not an adequate tape job. Essentially, if there is pain bending the thumb back, the direction of the tape should pull the thumb in the opposite direction preventing the painful movement.    Again, the best bet is to seek a medical professional who can give the proper attention to this.  Keep us posted.\n\n",

    "content": "Doctors Lounge-  Thank you so much for making this website available for people with questions regarding their conditions or questions. When I was very young, 2 years old to be exact, I was diagnosed with Neuroblastoma cancer in my left leg. I underwent chemotherapy, radiation, and a bone marrow transplant. I am now in remission at 17 years old. When I was about 7 years old, I broke my left femur (the same leg and area where I had cancer and had the radiation and BMT). I have many health problems that hold me back from things that I love, but one thing that is a major setback in my daily life is my left leg. It is extremely thin compared to the other one and very weak. I know that the radiation and breakage in that leg has caused it to definitely be a lot weaker than my other leg, but I have a very hard time walking without my left leg giving out on me. So, I was wondering is it possible for me to ever strengthen the muscle enough in that leg again so I can do things that I love to do?? And also, is there any kind of brace or something that I can wear around that leg to support it so maybe it won't give out on me as much?  Thanks again for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Thank you for writing to us.   I admire your courage and ambition.  To answer your question about strengthening the leg and using a brace: the answer to both is yes.  Strengthening will focus on both large and small leg muscles that cross the hip, knee and ankle.  It will be good to consult a professional like a physical therapist who can teach you the appropriate exercise and how to gradually progress the intensity.  The therapist can also recommend a specific brace.  The brace will help protect the knee which is probably the area of poor control when the leg gives out.  With bracing, it is a must to strengthen the muscle.  Muscle power is the best way to guard the leg from giving out.    Make sure you check with your physician before starting the program to make sure the leg (i.e. the bone) is ready for strengthening.    A pool make be a good place to start as it provides buoyancy and you can use water as resistance.    Let us know how things go and if you have any more questions.  Take care.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: hip surgery with pins",
    "content": "Hello, Thanks for the question.  The surgeon will look at the hips aligned making sure any hardware (pins, plates, rods, or replacement parts) are in good alignment and \"well seated\" - meaning that a new hip's components are not coming loose.  He will also look for calcification along fracture lines. 3 months is sufficient time for healing.  It is not uncommon for the hip to hurt after it was fixed.  If the surgery went well and the bone healed well, be reassured that the joint is good and safe to use it.  The pain is probably from surrounding muscles, tendons, and ligament inflamation or soreness.  Also, check leg lengths.  Often after hip surgery, the operative leg length changes and can have an effect on pain levels and function. Also, remember that she should continue to do her prescribed exercises. The orthopedist can re check the hip at any time to make sure everything is intact and stable.   You may consider asking her physician about pain medicine too.  All the best to you and your Mom.  Let us know if you have any more questions.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Beginning about 5 days ago I started noticing tenderness when i press on the lower part of my rib cage on my left side. Looking at me from the left side it starts about an inch toward the front from my center line and spreads about 3 to 4 inches along the lower edge of my rib cage. It's been steadily getting worse although I've done nothing to the area or to myself anywhere for that matter. Now it hurts just to the touch with very slight pressure. I've probed around and it seems the pain is actually from the ribs and not an organ behind them but the probing is painful so it's hard to tell.  It's worst at the tip of the ribs where it crosses over to soft abdomen area. Normally I am very active for work but my routine has not included manual labor for a couple weeks now due to snow. We've been stuck inside for the last week but I've been out for walks each day and trying to watch my computer work posture.   Just a side note: Two days ago I had a pressure pain that lasted for about 2 days in my underarm.  I couldn't find any lumps or swelling and it went away yesterday.  That's all i can think of. I've never injured my ribs, haven't been lifting lately and am not accustomed to issues in the area.  I'm healthy, 5-11, 170lbs, decent diet.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, If there is a cracked rib it would obviously resulted from the fall.  The only way to find out is to do an xray. With suspected rib fractures, it is important to have an xray done for a number of reasons.  The lung tissue can be damaged with a rib fracture; you'll better know the length of healing time; and more caution to used for activities.   It is also important to take appropriate strength pain medicine to allow deep breathing.  We want to prevent pneumonia. Best bet is to see your physician for evaluation. Let us know how it goes.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Pain on the top of foot",
    "content": "It would be good for a podiatrist or orthopedist to take a look at this foot.    For you, footwear is important.  Flat shoes may not be the best.  It depends on what kind of arch you have - flat vs high arch.    Other areas to evaluate on the foot are: pulses any swelling? temperature mobility of the bones (rear foot, midfoot and forefoot) muscular tightness not only in the foot but throughout the entire leg strength of leg muscles  Since there was no trauma, all of these areas will help determine the cause of the pain and lead to a solution.  Have the foot evaluated by a physician (preferrably one who specializes in orthopedics or foot care) and use caution when walking on the outside of the foot - this can cause more pain and may risk a lateral ankle sprain.  Keep us posted.  ps Motrin sounds like a better option than Vicodin for pain control.  This probably is tendonitis and will get better with rest, elevation, and proper foot wear nevertheless have it checked out.\n\n",

    "content": "5 month ago, in August I fell at work on a transmission jack landing on a 1/2\" round 2\"long spike. Besides the severe pain, I have numbness in my left leg. The doctor ordered a CT scan of the thoracic spine and a MRI of the C-spine;nothing showed up on the imaging;it wasn't until 1 1/2 month had gone buy when a regular Xray was taken and showed a brake in the 11th rib. I am currently seeing a pain management doctor. I was told initialy that would take about 8 weeks to heal; it's now 21 weeks later and I still have severe pain below the fracture between the 11th and 12th rib , the 11th rib from the fracture point to the tip also has pain, and also have pain radiating through my left side from back to front just below my rib cage. All my pain management doctor wants to do is give me more methodone and mask the pain. I would like to get to the bottom of it. Is there any other test that could or should be done to help me with this ? My family doctor feels that a CT scan should be done in the affected area and another doctor I saw recomended MRI of the area should be done because there is visible signs of tissue loss on my back below the fracture. Neither one are the overseing physician so they can not order these tests. Please help me get to the bottom of this. I am tired of the pain pills and I just want to find it and fix it. Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Since you have left sided pain from a rib fracture and left leg numbness, an MRI of the rib cage and lumbar spine would be a good choice. It would be important for a physician to check the reflexes, sensation, and strength of the legs to correlate any MRI findings with your physical status.  It is worthwhile considering the lumbar spine as a source of pain since the rib fracture should have healing by now and the mechanism was a fall with perhaps a twisting motion.    Certainly, it sounds like the muscles between the rib are still tender.  Does ice or heat help?  Physical therapy may be in order to assess the ribs and back.  Some therapist have specialized training in adjusting rib back to their normal position.  You would need to call around to find a therapist who has this skill since all therapist are not trained alike.    Keep us posted\n\n",

    "content": "I slipped on black ice about two weeks ago and landed on my right hand. It was stretched out in front of me so it hit the ground on the flat of my hand. Also, I was holding my cane in that hand at the time.   I splinted it, went to the ER, and was told they couldn't determine if it was broken. I saw an orthopedist a week later who thought it was probably sprained but also couldn't tell. He did, however, find that the brace the ER gave me was making it worse and put me in a new brace which I've been wearing ever since.   Most of my pain has been in my thumb moving down into my hand and a bit of my wrist. It worsens if I try to grip with the hand so I've been resting it. For the last hour my thumb has been nearly all numb. I can feel a bit on the surface but it's numb internally, if that makes sense. Of course this happens on a Friday night. I have another appointment with the orthopedist in two weeks, but I'm wondering if I should push to be seen sooner.  Thanks!\n\n",

With limb injuries, we are concerned about the neurological (sensation and strength) and vascular (blood supply and return) integrity of the limb.  Sometimes swelling can compromise blood vessels and nerves and cause problems like numbness.  Also, check for temperature of the skin compared with the other hand.    Keep us posted.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for the reply.  I did eventually call the doctor on call, who sent me to the ER to be evaluated. They thought the brace might have been rubbing on something and splinted it instead. I then spoke to my hand surgeon's PA earlier this week who seconded the brace theory and said it should clear up in a few more days.  However, not only has it not gotten better, but the numb area has gotten larger. The thumb is noticeably swollen compared to the other, though there isn't much difference in temperature. I'm still concerned about what's causing the numbness. If it is internal swelling pressing on a nerve, it's getting worse, and that makes me wonder why it is still doing so.  Becca\n\n",

I could not lift my leg for the first week, and now (1- 1/2 weeks later) it is extremely painful to the touch. I can walk pretty well, but sitting down is excrutiating.

It also hurts in the front around the top of my hip down to almost the groin, that pain is at least bearable, though. I am trying to avoid a large hospital bill, as I have no insurance. I reserched and found maybe it was a sacroilliac fracture. Is it o.k. to heal on my own? I have been taking Lortabs for the pain that were prescibed from a previous accident, about 3 a day.

They gave me a shot of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory, and a shot of \"dalotid\"? (not quite sure of the splelling) narcotic for the pain.  Xrays came up negative- but attending physician said that there was a good chance the fracture(s) would not show up anyway. They sent me on my way with a presciption for oral Vicodin (500mg tablet-1 every 4-6 hrs as needed). i am trying to take the vicodin sparingly (every 5-6 hours or so) and the pain is bearable. How should I restrict physical activity? I realize i shouldnt do any sports etc... but  just dayto day activities- should they be restricted in order to expedite the healing process? Also any suggestions regarding vitamin or mineral supplents that could speed up the healing process? any I should stay away from?  your opinion on chest strap?   I am breathing as deeply as I can regularly, and trying to keep congestion clear etc.... Thanks in advance for any advice!!!\n\n",

    "content": "Avoid: heavy lifting repetitive twisting, bending, or reaching climbing pushing and pulling  ...until painfree.  If there were fractures, these would take up to six weeks to heel.  See your family physician for any work restrictions.   A chest strap is too restrictive. Vitamins and minerals will not speed up healing unless you are deficient in calcium or Vit D.  If you have a regular diet and in general good health, should not need supplements.  Keep us posted.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  There are a lot of potential causes of this sort of thing, from strain due to wearing pumps to gout, to an unnoticed (at the time) injury which is now starting to become irritated. It sounds as though it may be fractured (because of the bruising, although that normally would have shown up right away). I'd go to a medical facility and have it x-rayed and checked, as it may need an orthotic device or some other sort of care. In the meantime, keep it elevated as much as is practical and use over-the-counter pain meds to help manage the pain.   Hope this helps.  Best of luck to you. Keep us updated.\n\n",

    "title": "Blunt Blow To Chest: No lasting Pain But Deformed Appearance",
    "content": "Good evening!  I am hoping that perhaps someone will be able to provide a little more insight into the structural nature of the ribcage than I have been able to glean on my own, and perhaps provide some ideas on whether I am overstressing this or not. If not, I am not sure what type of professional I should see for further assistance.   Over the weekend I had a ladder slip out from under me. (I suppose it ought to have occured to me that a dusty, slick garage floor isn't exactly the best traction. o.0 ) Long story short it resulting in a pretty nasty blow to the chest since it got caught on some junk, and I took it pretty full on in the chest. Aside from the obvious soreness/bruise or two, I seriously got the wind knocked out of me. Definately not pleasant. But after a few minutes I was able to move around pretty well and it was only slightly tender to the touch. I just put some ice on it and chilled for awhile. I figured if something were actually wrong, my body would sure as heck let me know it.  The wierd thing is that I did notice some continuing pressure on the right side where it happened for the next few days, and it looked like my ribcage had actually been dented in at the lower part. That kind of continued to get to be a nuisance, feeling like something was pushing on my lung. A doctor looked at it and said there was no injury and I'm probably fine. I got a second opinion in a walk in clinic, though this was an NP, and she said the same thing. That if there were any actual injury I would be in pain and not walking around and picking up my daughter with no problems, etc. The annoying this is it felt like she was just blowing me off as some yuppie who has insurance so comes in for so much as a paper cut. I kept trying to ask her about the dent in my chest and she kept insisting nothing looked out of place. I couldn't believe her because it was such an OBVIOUSLY unsymettrical appearance, and anybody I knew who I'd asked found it obvious as well.  I guess she just had made up her mind there wasn't a problem.  I know this sounds like a terribly dumb thing to mess with but I actually went home and to some extent \"pulled my rib out of my lung\"... And got some serious relief on the lung pressure that way. By pulling on my ribcage out. It really at this point looks a bit better but there is still to some extent an inward indentation where the 7th rib should be connecting to what I understand is the cartilage structure connecting it to the sternum. Where the rib should connect to the costal ( ? ) cartilige it just turns into the ribcage.   I read about an injury called a costal separation that isn't very hard to get, and that sounds like a pretty good fit. Except I get the picture I would be in a lot of pain, not just a little tender if you push on exactly the right spot. I certainly would not have been able to mess around with my ribs that way from the sound of it.  Am I overthinking this and will things just line up right on its own? I hate to sound like a hypochondriac and I cant really afford to run around visiting clinics till I hit the right  person (I'm sure my insurance would kill me too heh).    If not, what kind of doctor is the person to ask? Someone mentioned a chiropractor might be the sort of person to push the rib back into place. I read elsewhere to just leave it alone (assuming its a separation) and it will heal on its own.   Again I'm not in pain and I don't want to make something out of nothing, it just really doesn't look right!  Thank you a million times for anybody who answers. I'm extremely appreciative of you folks for being so kind as to share your knowledge in this way.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  You could have a costal separation, but it would be difficult to know for sure without having an x-ray of the area, since no one seems able to visualize or palpate it. The other possibility is that you already had a floating rib and it was disturbed by the blow. Since most rib injuries don't require much in the way of treatment anyway,  and adding to the the fact that most of us have visibly assymetrical anatomies anyway, this probably accounts for the rather  casual reception you've received twice. I would think, however, that an x-ray wouldn't be  unreasonable. If you could know just what is going on you could then  perhaps get comfortable with it, since it doesn't seem to be causing you any real problems.   I hope this is helpful, as rib injuries (other  than gross trauma/crusing injuries) don't usually require much care. Best of luck to you. Please let us know how things play out.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  While the problem is unlikely to become life-threatening (though it's not impossible for that to happen), the permanent damage potential is great enough that the thing really does need proper medical attention. What you'll need to do is either go to an emergency room (where they're required to treat you regardless of your ability to pay) and/or find a doctor who will work with you on a sliding scale or some similar arrangement (and many are willing to do this rather than let someone just walk around  in pain or halfway maimed, which is how this sounds at this point). Trut me, the future pain and disability this could cause you isn't worth holding back because of the inability to pay.  Like you said, if it were life-threatening you'd find a way to deal  with it; Well there are things  almost as bad,  and a painful lifelong physical problem (and potentially worse), can make life hardly worth living. The big toe is especially crucial to our ability to walk and maneuver (you'd probably be surprised except that by now you're probably realizing this). So please, try and find a way to get this taken care of, as it's pretty clear there's a break and it's going to heal wrong and cause lots of problems in the future. I'm sorry it happened, but hopefully this will get taken care of and you can  move on. Best of luck to you and please follow up with us.\n\n",

    "content": "I had neck surgury last November (11th of 2007).  They took a piece of my hip bone and fused my C4/C5 vertabras.  Recovery has been very slow and I have been on multiple pain killers the entire time.

He is talking about another surgury, but I am very concerned why I am not having any new bone growth.  I am 34 years old and a non smoker.  I have expressed my concern to my doctor and he doesn't know why I am not growing any bone.  Should I be alarmed that not only is the pain not gettting any better, but I am unable to heal from  this type of surgury?  It is throwing up a red flag and I want to know why.

    "content": "One question that comes to mind is the cervical bone quality (which could be assessed during the operation) and the alignment of the cervical spine post operatively. This would be starting points for assessing why the spine has not fused and why the screws are slipping out. Other questions to address are the general state of the cervical spine pre operatively and what were the expected outcomes (pain relief, movement).  Of course your neck is not near expected outcome but how severely damaged was the next before surgery.   How was the rehab?   Often times the levels above and below the fusion site become hypermobile and arthritc and may degenerate.  How are these levels? Talk through these things with the orthopedist and perhaps ask for a second opinion.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  Most  likely, given the circumstances of your shoulder injury, you pulled a tendon, perhaps popping it over a structure  that normally confines it. This can cause quite startling sudden pain, with significant tenderness for a while afterward, but most often is simply inflammatory and nothing is damaged. Resting the shoulder as much  as possible, use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatories and, in stubborn cases, local steroid injection,  usually will get things under control. If the pain becomes worse or persists more than a week, the  shoulder should be x-rayed to be sure there's no previous injury nor any unusual tear of any structure. This  is pretty unlikely, but some individuals are more prone to this than most. Since you seem to have no history of this sort of problem, this was probably a relatively freak thing, perhaps due to overreaching while very relaxed.    I hope this is helpful to you.

    "content": "Hello -  This probably warrants a visit to the doctor or an acute care walk-in clinic, since it sounds as though you may have done some damage to the bursa in the joint or caused some other damage. It may not be especially worrisome right now, and it may well resolve on its own, but if it doesn't it could result in permanent irritation and eventually require far more than the simple care it may need right now. Since I can't see it or feel it, let alone x-ray it, I can't in good conscience tell you to just ice it and wait to see what happens. Hopefully it's fine, and the fine details of how you came to punch a wall really aren't essential information.   I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

For now I would ice it constantly to slow down the swelling. If it continues to hurt with movement I would prefer you to take you appropriate low dose pain killer like Advil which is an Ibuprofen supplement. If you do so,follow correct dosage instructions or contact your doctor just to be sure.  Please do not be embarrassed about your nucleus or any medical condition you may have because as an orthopedic physician I see a lot of interesting cases.\n\n",

I personally do think your finger is out of place because it would be the finger bone causing the blood circulation to slow down. I think you need to get an x-ray of this and a finger brace which you can purchase at you local pharmacy. I would get this examined quickly because if the circulation stops it will damage the nerves in your finger causing you to have no sense of feel in your finger.\n\n",

    "title": "Possible bruised rib. Pain between lat and oblique",
    "content": "7 days ago my room mate and I were horsing around. I ended up getting pushed through the sheet rock wall in kitchen. The next morning I awoke with pain on my right side. The pain lines up PERFECTLY with a lower portion of the hole in the wall that did not give way as much as the rest. Sort of like an obtrusive corner of the hole. There is no visible bruise or discoloration on me. The pain initially seemed like back/lower lat/side pain. I went to my chin up bar and tried to do a chin up. I felt fine free hanging. Upon doing an actual chin up I was able to do about 60%-70% of the exercise before feeling fairly intense pain under my lat and above my oblique. If you were looking a side view of me, I would say the pain is 8 inched below my armpit and 4 inches towards my back from the centerline split of my body (sorry mechanical engineer here). I can complete a chin up and all of my strength is present, but the pain kicks in at the top portion of the exercise.  The pain only kicks up when doing similar movements. While walking it can tend to mildly hurt on the back stroke of my swinging arm. I suppose this movement mimics a seated row style exercise (elbow moving back). It has been a week since the trauma. I ran a mile to the gym and had minor pain similar to when I walk. At the gym I was able to perform chest and bicep workouts with minimal irritation. Any irritation came from movements that slightly resembled something involving a back exercise.   I also feel pain when leaning to my left side, as to stretch my right side. The pain feels like it may be a rib. It feels as though it is under the surface of my skin, yet on top of the bone surface. The pain seems to stay in the same spot, even when my muscles move. It feels as though maybe the muscle are aggravating the rib. My back muscles are pretty large. I rowed crew and also dabble in body building, so I am hoping that it isn't anything muscular. The last thing I want is a major athletic set back (although it would be my own fault). Could it be a bruised rib?  The pain has not become worse, but also has not become much better. I still have similar problems with chin ups, where the pain is present during a portion of the exercise. I have been taking IB profin, and I also iced it for the first time after the gym last night. I don't have much time to get to the dr's. I am just wondering what it could be so I know how to watch what I do and whatnot.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi -  While the pain could be due to a bruised rib, it also could be due to a muscle pull which has not been allowed to heal. It seems you've been busy challenging the injury in a very mechancal engineer kind of way, but any sort of musculoskeletal injury does require rest, and possibly icing as well. Try giving it a break for several days consecutively, icing it for 15 minutes at a stretch (if you can tolerate this), and not challenging it til it seems to have healed. Then start working it out slowly over a couple more days. I realize this could disrupt a training schedule, but if you don't allow it to heal it may become chronically inflamed. A cracked rib actually has less chance of becoming a chronic problem as a rule.  Best  of luck to you. I hope this is helpful.\n\n",

This may result in a lump that with healing will be reduced in size. However, growing in size is of concern and direct clinical examination is essential.  It is also important to follow up with a plain X ray to make sure that there is a normal union of the fracture.  I would advise you to follow up with your doctor; he may recommend a new X-ray to exclude complications.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Jones Fracture Swelling",
    "content": "Hi there -  A Jones fracture can be a really difficult thing to deal with. Most of them heal without surgery, but it can take up to eight weeks. The swelling and pain you're experiencing is very likely due to the freedom from the regular cast and transition to a walking cast, which not only takes away some restriction (and so allows swelling) but also allows you to place weight on the foot, which also encourages pain and swelling.   If things don't improve in a week or two, let your doctor know, as it may not be healing properly. About one quarter of all Jones fractures wind up having to be repaired surgically. The area doen't have a real good blood supply to begin with, which makes things more problematic. That plus the weight bearing issue can slow healing or sometimes prevent it.   To put a positive slant on this, odds are 3:1 that it will heal without surgery. It does take some time, though. If the swelling becomes severe or if the pain becomes unmanageable, by all means let your doctor know. Otherwise, it sounds as though it's following a fairly typical course so far.  I hope this is helpful. Please try to be patient with the injury and hopefully it will start to improve soon. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: bump or lump on ulna",
    "content": "Hello -  Due to the rather rapid development of this bump, which seems to be on the bone, with some initial soreness, I strongly suspect it to be a ganglion (or \"bible\") cyst. These are of little medical concern other than the possible appearance of deformity and sometimes pain or bumping into objects.   These cysts often appear to be attached to the adjacent bone but are actually on a tendon (tissue which connects muscle to bone). They can be soft or hard, and are sometimes immovable during normal, non-violent attempts at manipulation.  Ganglion cysts earned their nickname of \"bible\" cysts because the old home remedy was to strike the cyst with a book (preferably a  bible) to rupture it. This is no longer accepted nor recommended. They can be neatly and successfully drained by needle aspiration with some local chilling or other local anesthetic. They are prone to recur but may not just was easily.   I think this is the most likely explanation for your bump. See a doctor, who most likely will be able to diagnose this for what it is and probably aspirate it right in the office.  I hope this is helpful to you. Best of luck with this.  Please follow up with  us as needed.\n\n",

Pain in shoulder,neck,back,numbness in hand,arm, and even my face, began to increase. Another Dr, recommended and ordered another MRI of my neck this time which showed some minor buldging, but nothing serious i guess. Pain and numbness was still there, so family Dr sent me for a bone scan, which indicated a fractured first rib(left side) Now, my question is this, could these symptoms be a result of this fractured first rib?? Also, the raidioligist  who did the bone scan recommended additional x-rays to rule out any other pathologies.....but my family Dr won't order any more. i asked for a referral to a orthopedic Dr, and he refuses to do that as well....his answer was, its an old fracture,there's nothing that can be done, i will be labelled as chronic pain, and here's more pills(not the answer i was looking for) Is there some reason he won't investigate this further??

    "content": "Hello,  It is highly possible that your symptoms are related to the accident you have been exposed to two years ago. Probably a mild form of damage has occurred and after exposure to any precipitating factor your condition progressed and you started feeling these symptoms.  The MRI is the test of choice to diagnose conditions like yours. Although your MRI result is reassuring, your symptoms are indicative of nereve or nerve root compression. Pain and numbness result from nerve compression, and being progressive is more concerning.  Sometimes muscle pain and spasm give clinical picture similar to yours and with physiotherapy symptoms improve, but proper diagnosis is essential before any intervention.  So, I may agree with your doctor that the rib fracture is due to an old trauma and your MRI findings are not serious but I would advise you to discuss with him orthopaedic consultation to exclude serious causes like nerve (or nerve root) compression.  Hope you find this information useful. Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  While the initial diagnosis of sprain was no doubt correct, seven weeks along you shouldn't be having so many ongoing symptoms based on a sprain alone. Unfortunately the affected area contains some pretty sensitive and much-used tendons and I strongly suspect you have developed a sequel of tendinitis in the wrist, especially based on your detailed description of the way you fell. Your mention a bruise in the scaphoid area. Is the bruse still present? If so this could represent a significant tendinitis with swelling, discoloration (bruise) and pretty severe pain. You probably should be wearing a wrist brace and limiting the amount of work you do with the affected hand until it has healed. Anti-inflammatory medication would probably also be in order. I am assuming there were initial x-rays taken? Or at least during the orthopedic followup? This would likely demonstrate any fracture.   I'm still betting on severe tendinitis.

    "content": "Hi Cassie -  Yes, a fall such as you describe could definitely cause severe tendinitis -- and reflex sympathetic (RSD) which leads to complex regional pain syndrome (two types) can also result from this sort of injury. In fact, some of what you describe does sound like CRPS, since some of the cardinal signs are pain (often severe), local swelling,  sensitivity to touch/pressure, and changes in local bone structures. I suspect you have a combination going on, and treatment would depend on which is the case or if  it is both. Tendinitis is easier to treat, mainly with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, possible local site injection of steroids, and bracing or immobilization of the part as with a brace. If it is found to be RSD/CRPS only, this  is treated largely by physical therapy.   I'd definitely bring this to the attention of your doctor and perhaps get a referral to an orthopedist or physiotherapist. It's not normal for an injury like this to continue on this long based on the initial trauma alone. A secondary inflammatory process of some sort has taken place and needs attention.  I hope you can find some relief from this condition sooner than  later. Please do stay in touch with us and keep us updated.\n\n",

If there is a fracture it has taken a long time to resolve, but that may be because it's not been immobilized properly and if there is an injured or ruptured tendon it would require at least anti-inflammatory pain relievers and/or surgical repair.

Sometimes using an unbraced hand that's been injured can keep it irritated even though there's nothing that seems grossly out of line. The hand specialist should be  able to throw a lot more light on this, since you've had this going on for quite a long time. Hopefully the specialist will be able to determine just what's going on and help it begin to heal properly.  Thanks for the update. We'll be interested to hear what you learn.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi -  OK, this is where it can get confusing. The cortisone shot will reduce pain, swelling, and inflammation at the site of the injury. This may actually allow the tear to heal on its own, but probably not, since steroids paradoxically impede the body's ability to heal on its own, so you'll very likely need the surgical repair anyway. Meanwhile, though, the discomfort should be a lot less and with the swelling and inflammation reduced, the surgery will be far more easy to accomplish properly.   Hope this explains that. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  No, cortisone shots don't always work, and while it was a reasonable thing to try, the duration of the injury has probably created some other problems with scarring, sclerosing, etc., which the cortisone likely wouldn't be able to touch, at least not in a good way. That's probably why it not only hasn't helped but may seem to have made things a little worse. There's also the possibility of such sensitivity in the injured hand that a bolus of cortisone simply is putting pressure on irritated nerves and cancelling out any good effect. Hopefully it will at least go back to the way it was, shortly, and then surgery will likely correct the rest of the problem.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I am 20 years old and broke my scaphoid around February/March of this year. From the X-rays and ct scan it is a non union. My problem is that it is a VERY tiny piece at the proximal end that is broken off, so the doctor is sending me to a specialist. I am just wondering what type of options I have, I would like to eventually get my full strength and range of motion back in my wrist, but will that ever be possible? And what type of surgery do you think they will suggest? Is is possible for my wrist to heal with such a small break? I don't think a bone graph or pins will be an option. The one doctor said I might have to just leave it until it really starts bugging me and then they will remove the piece since it is so small. But then I will have pseudoarthrits. If this is the case what is the severity of the arthrits? Hand deforming? Unable to flex at all? Anyways I do have a cd with the CT scan and xray that I could send if needed. Thanks for your time. -Johnny\n\n",

    "content": "Hi jwalsh10, Non-union of the scaphoid bone essentially means nonhealing. There is a small amount of blood supply to that particular area and if too little blood is received in the fractured area the bone will not heal properly. An orthopedic specialist is exactly whom you need to see as that can identify the precise course of action required in your case. Some examples of treatment options in non-unions may include pin or screw fixation unless there is necrosis (death of the bone) which in that case a bone graft is a possible recommendation. I hope this was somewhat helpful. Best wishes. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

When it first happened It was diagnosed as a bruise/moderate sparin and i wound up walking on it for a month before the root cause was found via an MRI. I was in 2 casts for 7.5 weeks and had PT for a month after wards. My ankle has never felt 100% after this injury and in the past month or so I have had a few instances where my ankle \"twists\" really easy and wants to buckle. I don't have much pain after these \"twisting\" events but there is a dull underlying pain on the inside of my leg in the ankle joint it's self just below and forward of the bump in the bone . Also is the joint is torqued the pain is a bit more noticable. I know after any kind of joint injury it's never 100% again but I'm afaid I'm going to twist it again and not be able to catch my self and wind of breaking in. I'm a 39 year old male non smoker in VERY good health just looking for some advice.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  Some part of the ankle mechanics isn't working properly. While this may be unavoidable, I can't help but thinking there is some injury or perhaps rupture of a ligament or tendon down there, that's allowing this to happen. Since it would be an old or maybe even progressive injury, that would explain it's not announcing itself before it buckles. I'd definitely have it looked at by an orthopedist to see if there's anything that can be done to set things right, since it's true that if this keeps happening it increases the risk of a re-break or some other related injury due to a twist or resultant fall. No point  in going through that if you don't have to, and I strongly suspect you don't. This sounds fixable.  Best of luck to you. Please keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "In October 07 I was in a car accident...My first car accident, ambulance, and ER experience.    A lady ran a stop sign at 45 mph and hit the truck I was ridding in as a passenger. She never applied her breaks and hit us full speed. She hit the front left of the truck taking our tire off then she spun and hit the back of our truck..we slid across the road and hit the curb and went up over it and slid 110ft in a field.  I was wearing my seatbelt..But because she hit is from the side I did it the window with my head and my ribs went into the center console of the truck. I also strained my back and neck.   When I was taken to the ER all they did was check my neck and send me on my way.   A few weeks later a lump appeard over my bruised left lower rib ( the one second from the bottom). I went to the doctor and he said it was swollen cartilage...and it should go away. Well here I am today its still there. The lump is still there and my rib pops in and out of place from time to time. Its really painful and now it goes into my back and its out of place now in my back. Its really tender to the touch all the way around. You can see the rib that is out of place. Its noticable compared to my ribs on the right side. Sometime I cant even move b/c the pain is just unbearable. I cant sleep on my stomach or either side due to my ribs...im forced to sleep on my back and with a pillow under the injured side so it takes the pressure off it.   Any advice on what I can do till the doctor can get me in? And what can I expect them to do with my rib?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Rib out of place and back pain",
    "content": "Hello -  Usually the most that is done for this  sort of injury is to tape or otherwise hold the side steady by some sort of bandage or binding. However, due to the location of this rib, which appears from your description to be now free of its moorings, you'll have to exercise some care until it is immobilized, because of the proximity to the spleen.   Oddly enough,  lying on the affected side tends to be more comfortable and seems to help the injured (or freed) rib to stay in place. Of course, if for some reason this causes you inordinate discomfort, don't do it. That shouldn't happen, but I  want to cover all the possible bases. Cushioning it with a pillow is a good plan also. Whatever keeps you  most comfortable is appropriate.  Don't do anything requiring heavy lifting, no contact sports, nothing that causes you to twist and turn, as this could just aggravate the situation. The main concern is that the freed end of the rib doesn't come into contact with your spleen. It probably won't, due to the way the rib cage is designed, but that and discomfort are the two biggest concerns.  There's not much else I can tell you, except  that I would recommend bothering the doctor's office to see if they can get you in to be seen sooner than later.   Best of luck to you. Please stay in touch.\n\n",

    "title": "Cracked Rib .. From a Sneeze ?",
    "content": "Before i say anything, i did not injure myself in any way possible prior to this accident. I am very fit, work out every day but now i cannot. Okay so this may sound really weird, but i was at work and i had just finished my shift. I grabbed my til so i could start to count my cash and set it on the counter. my co-worker had asked me the time, so i turned around opened the office door and saw the time. instead of walking back to the counter to count my cash, i turned my upper body around to the left (with my lower still facing the clock) and yelled the time BUT at the same time i had to sneeze. So i sneezed, and when i did i felt a snap in my side and a lot of damn pain to follow with it. This is the second time this has happened to me in my entire life.. but the worst out of thee two. It has now been 10 days of pain. no deep breathing, no weight lifting, no bending in certain areas, no sleeping on my left side, no weight on my left side. If im in the car or on the bus going to work, and they just do a simple turn im in pain. I cant even relax and take a deep breaths. Sooo in conclusion, i just want to know.. what the heck happened ? lol. Some are saying i could have cracked my rib.. but from a sneeze ? sounds silly. Yet then again, it was a very very big sneeze & having my body twisted could have done it. When i press on the rib cage the bone hurts and the muscles hurt to. Just wanted to see what your opinions on this would be. If its still the same by the end of the week, i will go see a doctor. In the mean time is there anything i can do ? I can't really \"relax\". I still workout, just not every day. But then again, i work at the beer store and im constantly carrying heavy cases and slinging them all day. I try to work around the pain. Thankyou for your time,  J'Mar Marquez\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  The short answer to your question: absolutely. A cracked rib,  especially during a sneeze in an awkward position is not only possible but more common than  you'd guess. However, it also could be a bad muscle pull or even an inflamed bit of cartilage from the same basic cause, that sneeze.   The only concern with this, other  than pain (which I realize is no fun in itself),  is the restriction of deep breathing. Little is usually done for a fractured rib so long as it isn't free (as a blunt trauma to the chest can cause), but guarded breathing can sometimes cause problems such as pneumonia -- although if you are working through the pain you're probably in little danger of that. Still, it would be wise to do some occasional  deep-breathing exercises against the pain, to make certain you don't lost capacity in the affected side.  Other than that, over-the-counter pain meds and whatever else helps  increase your comfort level. If it  doesn't get better withing  a week of the initial injury you might want to bring it to the attention of a doctor, but it's  unlikely anything will be done (although a doctor could  prescribe something stronger for the pain).  I hope this  is helpful. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 27 year old female and about 6 weeks ago while out walking around the neighborhood for our relay for life time I stepped in a hole and twisted my ankle. Right after it happened the foot and ankle were swollen and difficult to walk/stand on. The following day I visited the ER and the major area of pain was the outside of the foot so the foot was x-rayed and I was diagnosed with a foot sprain. Rest and use of crutches reduced pain in the foot but then I realized there was also pain in the ankle that has persisted. I have pain all the time that worsens with standing, walking (especially uneven terrain) and any pressure on the outside of the ankle including if I sit crosslegged and it sits on the floor. Is it possible that there is a fracture that wasn't diagnosed when it was first checked? Sorry this is so long but I started back to school a few weeks ago and walking across campus isn't fun.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  While it is possible there is a fracture that was missed on the first pass, it is unlikely. More probably you have some residual inflammation, possible of a tendon or ligament, left over from the twist of the ankle and foot. (I winced just reading about that). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (ibuprofin, naprosyn) and resting the extremity as often as practical (keeping it elevated when possible) and icing occasionally, may cause it to heal. Of course, if the pain increases or any swelling develops late, you should go to an ER or acute care facility and have it re-checked. It does sound as though you suffered a pretty severe sprain with some lingering inflammation due to failure to rest the foot/ankle long enough for it to heal.  And don't sit cross-legged on the floor for the time being!   Hope this is helpful. Please follow up with us as needed. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

The several times I have tried to quit, i get seriously ill and want to die.  This goes on for several days and just seems to get worse, not better.  My question is, how do i get off them.  I have recently lost my medical insurance and can't even get into see a doctor. I have tried to pay cash but still no help.   (I don't know why the doctors don't feel they have a resposibility to their patient to ween them off the painkillers after the patient has told them about the addiction created by the prescriptions.) But anyhow, I have gone to the Hospital regarding my problem and the advice nurse informed me that I shouldn't have any problem getting off the opiates and to just \"tuff\" it out.  I have tried.....Please tell me what to do  I have never had an addiction to anything my whole life until now.  Never even smoked a ciggarette.  Please help.  My whole life is going down the toilet.  I can deal with the physical pain but this addiction is ruining my life. Thanks, for any advice will be taken and used. chucktrucker@comcast.net  rustybones\n\n",

I would look for a substance abuse program through your local health department or mental health agency.  These are often available without charge.  I am not implying you are deliberately abusing drugs, but it does come under this umbrella.  It is important for you to get the support you need.  Others have done it and they can help you now.  You're right, there could be better assistance with reducing and then eliminating the painkillers through your provider but at this point blaming won't help your situation.  Thank you for bringing this serious concern up so others can learn from  your experience and providers may also take your recommendation to heart.  Good luck.  It is worth the effort.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Sever ankle sprain",
    "content": "Hello -  There seems to be some equivocation over whether or not there is something more than a severe sprain (which could easily be enough to cause the problems you've been having anyway). Normally an MRI wouldn't be necessary to clarify this, and a good orthopedist should be able to determine exactly what's wrong. I suspect it was a severe sprain and you've in part taken positive steps to help it heal (the air splint was a good idea). However, in order for it to properly heal you need to stay off it as much as practical. That isn't easy, I know. Still, it needs to be iced, kept elevated as much as possible, and used as little as possible. Gravity and weight-bearing both slow healing of these kinds of injuries.  While that's about the most I can tell you at a distance, I would definitely try and see an orthopedist, since the thing hasn't healed well and the longer it goes on, as you point, out, the longer before you can work and have insurance. If there's some way you can  work it out, an orthopedist could probably determine what's wrong and also give you some help in getting it to heal if there's nothing else wrong.   Best thing I can tell you from here. Good luck and please do check back in with us here.\n\n",

    "content": "One week ago I was playing volleyball and collided with another player while in mid air and then fell to the floor very hard on my shin just below my knee and slightly to the left. It was very painful immediately and swelled a lot right away. I did the whole RICE routine and limped around (I could barely put weight on it) for 2 days. It only hurt more and more, so I went to get an xray just to check. Doc said no fractures, so I figured I was in the clear. Now it is day 7 and I am still in a great deal of pain and my entire lower leg is a giant bruise. The area that took the blow is still swollen, as is my ankle now.  Is this still the normal course for a shin contusion or is something else going on ?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: shin contusion",
    "content": "Hello -  While  you don't seem to have a fracture or deformity,  your tibea did  take a what sounds to have been a pretty hard blow where knee tendons connect to the muscle, and you appear to have treated it properly but then proceded to try and walk it off. This latter is probably why it is hurting and looking so ugly right now. I'd suggest getting off it for a few days as much as practical and maybe even using a crutch or cane briefly to relieve some  of the work imposed on it. People tend to wildly underestimate how much work and pressure is presented to the lower leg, especially at and just below the knee. You've got quite a contusion and probably some trauma to the connective tissues right where you landed. The signs you describe would be consistent with such an injury followed by use instead of rest. The swelling is less than surprising for the same reason the lower leg is so vulnerable: gravity. Please give it a rest, keep it elevated, and continue the RICE routine for a couple days at least. It  should begin to improve. If not, by all means go back for a re-evaluation. It's possible sometimes for a fracture to be missed on x-ray, although it is rare.  Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "6  monhts ago i was thrown from my motorcycle and landed with my chest across the edge of the windshield. x-rays were taken and it was determined that i had a fractured sternum - not displaced but a noticeable stepoff on the x-ray. i had considerable pain for a while which eventually went away and now is mostly gone - EXCEPT when I'm laying in bed.  sometimes the pain in my sternum starts as soon as i lie down but always wakes me up by 2-3am with so much pain that it hurts to move my body and arms - even breathing hurts.  as soon as i'm up it is still quite painful to move arms and take in moderate to deep breaths.  however after an hour or two this pain dissipates until it is gone.  this happens every night.  i'm feeling short rested most of the time.  all my primary dr. says is that this fracture can take 1-2 yrs to completely heal.  even pt's who've undergone open heart surgery is feeling better sooner that this.  what do you think can cause this and is there something i can do but wait?  thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hello  bikergrandma -   First, my apologies for your question not having been replied to sooner. It's hard to know how yours may have been missed. I myself cover a different area normally, but was just scanning the various topics tonight and found your question and will attempt to help with this, although I'm not sure I will be able to give you any real useful information.  Sternal fractures, comparable, as you mention, to open-heart surgery patients, often heal adequately for activity fairly quickly, but complete healing can take a long time, and lying supine (on one's back) can often cause a settling effect in the  chest which will aggravate soreness or frank pain that acts exactly as you describe.  I don't see where pain ever deserves being poo-pooed, and am surprised your doctor hasn't offered some sort of pain medication  you could at least take at night. One of the milder opiods like tramadol, taken at night, could serve two complimentary purposes by reducing your pain level and making you a little more drowsy, which together might get you a good, uninterrupted night's sleep. If I were you I'd bring this up to the doctor and, if he continues to poo-poo your discomfort, perhaps a second opinion would be in order.  I hope  this finds you feeling better and that you will follow up with us. I'll be advised if you post here, so your post wouldn't be missed next time.\n\n",

    "title": "Not able to walk after healed ankle fracture",
    "content": "Hi,  6 weeks ago I fractured my right ankle (by slipping on a wet pavement). I was near a hospital at the time, so within a couple hours had a cast around my leg. 4 days later, I had my appointment with the bone doctor who decided I needed a new plaster, which would keep the foot in a 90 degree angle (I don't know why the first plaster wasn't done this way). He noted that the fibula bone was what was fractured.   Today (6 weeks after I had my first plaster put on, 5.5 if we're going by the second plaster), I had the plaster removed.   What worries me is that I am struggling to walk around. The doctor said my foot is just feeling sore, not having used it for 6 weeks and suggested that I leave the crutches behind in the hospital. I ended up taking them with me, however, because I could see that I was having trouble moving without them - at least, without the right one supporting my weak ankle.   I asked if perhaps an x-ray would be beneficial - but the doctor said that the bone would have healed, there was nothing to worry about.  I'm wondering if he could have overlooked anything? I feel exactly as I did six weeks ago (minus the appearance of a twisted foot) - I can stand on two legs, but trying to walk, putting weight on the right foot only makes it painful. If I try to put too much weight on the right foot, I have the feeling I will fall. Basically, without the crutch on my right side, I can't walk.   So should I be worried? To be honest the doctor didn't seem like he was paying much attention to my ankle in the first place. Or is this natural and I should just give it a couple days to see how things develop? I wasn't exactly expecting to be able to run from the moment the plaster was off, but not being able to walk unaided is a bit extreme too.   I'm 23 years old, male.   Thanks.  Tim\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Tim -  It seems likely, based on your description of the injury, the initial and followup treatment, and the location of the fracture, that the weakness you're experiencing is fairly normal. A short course of physical therapy might be in order, but only if your doctor would order it and your insurance would cover it. If not, then you're probably going to have to practice, for brief periods several times per day, walking or at least lifting weight with the foot to rebuild the strength on the ankle area. You'd be amazed at how quickly muscle can decondition!   I think if you push things a little you will soon start to notice incremental improvement. Please let us know how things go.\n\n",

    "content": "Gender : Female Age: 60  On december 15 2007 I fell off and fractured my left foot's 5th metatarsal bone. X-ray report confirmed proper fracture. I had a cast up to my knee on my left leg. After one month cast was removed. My second X-ray was still showing fracture and no healing. I went for my bone Profile test,Dr recommended vitamen D3 injections along with Oscal(Calscium and vitamen D3 supplement) and One-Alpha tablets(alfacalcidol----1 alpha hydroxy vitamen D3).   First injection was taken on March 12 2008 , while the 2nd one was taken on March 27 2008. I am still on my oral medicine. It is the end of 5th month, I still have swelling and pain in my left foot. My Orthopedic Doctor told an X-ray cannot show that bone is joined back.  Please give me advice. What should I do to recover my bone?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  There are several points which should  be addressed here. First, while it is generally true that an x-ray cannot disclose whether or not a fracture has knitted (unless it was a displaced fracture  to start with), a sharp-eyed orthopedist usually would be able to tell using serial x-rays over time, because there normally would be some changes visible. Clearly the doctor wanted to treat for possible osteoporosis as well. This latter could be causing a very slow healing process, but there also needs to be ruled out the possibility of osteomyelitis subsequent to the initial injury. While this would no doubt have caused some swelling, discoloration, local heat or even a fever and feeling of generalized illness, these don't always happen.   While osteoporosis is the likely culprit, you are doing everything reasonable to move the healing process along. If there is no improvement soon, you might consider getting a second opinion.   Please let us know how things go.\n\n",

    "title": "Fractured toe 4 months ago, still not healed",
    "content": "Hello,  I'm a 39-year-old healthy male. About four months ago, I was walking past a brick structure and hit it with my bare foot. The toe next to my little toe was obviously broken, as it was twisted upward and toward my little toe. I went to a walk-in clinic that day, where the doctor x-rayed, set, buddy-taped, and x-rayed it again, then gave me the usual 4-6 week diagnosis. She did not say anything about joints being involved, and to the best of my knowledge it was only a broken phalange.  Here I am, four months later, and still on crutches. My whole foot swells up and turns a deep reddish purple if I leave it down for any amount of time, even when I sleep, so I keep my foot elevated above my heart constantly when I'm awake.  About three(?) weeks before I got the crutches, I hobbled around on my heel with a cane. Since I've heard of people walking with a broken toe and my doctor merely told me to wear supportive shoes, it seemed ok to do that at the time, but I'm wondering if putting the pressure on my heel affected the healing time, or even made the injury worse.  I've done a lot of research on this, but I'm still stuck with the following questions: Is it totally unheard of for a toe fracture to take this long to heal and still cause purple swelling of the whole foot? Also, can walking on the heel for a few weeks immediately after the injury affect the healing time of a phalange? Could my doctor have missed something in her diagnosis?  Thank you for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you, Dr. Lowe. :)  Orthopedic specialists wouldn't take me without a referral, so since I don't have a family doctor, I went to a walk-in clinic yesterday evening. They took full-foot x-rays, said my bones had a moth-eaten appearance, gave me possible causes including vascular, bone infection, osteoporosis, and cancer, and put in his diagnosis that my first metatarsal was fractured, even though he said it might be a sesamoid bone he was seeing on the x-ray. They called ortho first thing this morning to schedule an appointment, then called me back and said I needed to go to the ER instead, because ortho couldn't perform all of the tests I needed.  The ER doctor didn't understand why I was sent there instead of ortho (I suspect it having something to do with me not having insurance?). They took my blood pressure, my temperature and drew blood, I showed him the x-rays from last night and the ones from 4 months ago, answered a few questions while he pushed in various places, then the ER doctor said he saw an orthopedic specialist walking around and took the x-rays to show him.  Before I go further, two of the places I feel pain are between my 1st and 2nd toes and my heel, but only when considerable pressure is applied.  After he came back from talking to the ortho specialist, he said he was pretty sure it was reflex sympathetic dystrophy and that the specialist agreed. He also said the specialist didn't see a problem with my bones, so I guess this means both sets of x-rays were underdeveloped, since the ones from 4 months ago appeared to have this same \"moth-eaten\" appearance when I compared the two sets.  When the blood test came back, there was no sign of infection. However, I don't know if they were only checking for bone infection, or if soft tissue infection would show up in the test they ran.  The ER sent me home with a prescription for Anaprox, told me to follow up with the doctor from last night (who had me quite worried with all of his possibilities), and said I might need physical therapy and a neurologist.  Coming home and reading up on it online, I don't trust the ER doc's diagnosis. My foot doesn't sweat, nor do I feel pain unless there is pressure applied, and I have never felt the burning sensation. My condition has not progressed in all this time. It has merely stayed the same, except for the fact that I used to feel pain in the area of my initial fracture when I moved it, until just a few weeks ago. I'm wondering if the ER doctor didn't know enough about reflex sympathetic dystrophy or didn't pay attention to my answers, and perhaps was too suggestive when he spoke with the orthopedic specialist. Unfortunately, I didn't witness that conversation to know what was said.  Also, there is the issue of the clinic doctor's diagnosis of a fractured 1st metatarsal, which might be a sesamoid bone he was seeing (the ER doc said it was a sesamoid). I do feel pain there when pressure is applied, but I can't conceive of any possible way I could have fractured anything in that area. Could it be my flexor hallucis longus tendon that hurts there when it's pressed, and what about my heel?  Sorry for asking so many questions, and thanks again for your help so far.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Dr. Lowe,  Yesterday I tried standing, gradually applying pressure to the injured foot until there was equal pressure on each foot, and felt intense pain in my ankle or heel, I'm not sure which. Also, when I go to step forward on my injured foot, I feel similar pain in my big toe joint where my toe connects to my foot. I can move my ankle and toe in any direction and it doesn't hurt; but the more pressure I put on either area, the more it hurts, being intense if I put enough pressure on it to walk.  Today, my knee hurts if I lift my knee toward my chest from a sitting position. I just noticed this symptom today, so I figure it has something to do with standing yesterday. My ankle and toe joint feel the same as yesterday, moving feels ok, but applying pressure hurts.  As a reminder, I hobbled on a cane and my heel for a few weeks after my toe fracture; after that, I used crutches without applying any pressure whatsoever on my injured left foot or my left leg for the rest of these 4+ months, keeping it elevated constantly all that time.  I really want to see a specialist to properly diagnose my problem(s), but the orthopedic specialist wouldn't take me due to lack of insurance when my doctor tried to set an appointment. So, I'm stuck with trying to get whatever free advice I can get for now, in hopes that I can get medicaid when I apply next week.  I also tried to take pictures of my x-rays with a cheap digital camera, which I'm sure you know can be a daunting task. The quality isn't that great, but I'm posting them in case it helps for my previous post. I kept different shots of each one, because they show more or less details in different areas.  Front view Angular view  My question for this post is, can non-use of my left foot and leg cause atrophy in my joints, and could that be what's causing the pain when I apply pressure? Or could I have swollen tendons from lack of use? Other suggestions?  Thank you so much for any information you can give me.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Fractured toe 4 months ago, still not healed",
    "content": "For others who may find this information useful, here's what happened.  After breaking my toe, I hobbled around on my heel with a cane for a couple of weeks, as mentioned in my first post. This caused unnatural use of the injured foot and it started to cause pain in my heel and other places of my foot that weren't broken, so I switched to using crutches with my injured foot off the ground, and continued using crutches this way for about four more months, not using the injured foot at all, because the pain never went away. The toe itself, however, was fully healed, albeit a little crooked because I didn't go back for that initial one-week followup after having the fracture reduced (set) and my toe buddy-taped.  The pain in weird places turned out to be Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS), otherwise known as Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy (RSD). This is a condition of the nervous system that can occasionally occur after a relatively minor injury, usually when the injured limb is used unnaturally as a result of that injury. Mistake #1 was using the cane improperly and keeping my toes off the floor when I hobbled around on my heel.  The moth-eaten appearance... remember, this is after four months or so of not walking on the foot at all, suspending it in the air while I walked on one foot and two crutches during that whole time... That's right, bone atrophy. It was porous because it hadn't been used in over 4 months, not because of some disease. That was mistake #2, babying it for all those months when I should have been using it, at least a little bit, despite the pain.  My orthopaedic specialist explained all of this to me after we spent 3 hours in her office last October, looking at my foot and the x-rays, going over my medical history and physical lifestyle, and creating a detailed timeline of my condition over the previous 4 and a half months. She was very thorough and very straight-forward, and I truly appreciate all that she has done for me. I haven't been back for a few months, but have an appointment for a followup next weekend.  I still have some pain in my foot from the RSD, but I'm walking on it normally, and luckily it isn't nearly as severe as many of the cases I've read about. But for all of you people out there who are reading this after fracturing a toe, ankle, or whatever, if it's too painful to walk on it, it's better to stay off of it for a week or two until you can flex it normally while walking, than to end up with a possible lifetime of RSD.  Don't stay off of it too long or it will atrophy from non-use. You can regain bone mass with physical therapy afterward, but the more your bones atrophy, the longer it takes to reverse it, and the more you risk another fracture from the thin bones while you're trying to build them up again (which luckily didn't happen to me). Do ask your doctor how to use a cane properly, and follow those instructions. It should be held opposite the injured foot, not on the same side as the injury, and I repeat, the movement of your foot needs to be natural, even if you're not putting your full weight on it.  If I am wrong in any detail here, I'm sure a doctor will correct me. However, I speak from what my orthopaedic specialist has told me after thorough examination, as well as from my own experience.  Of course, pain where you don't expect it isn't necessarily CRPS/RSD, and you should see a qualified specialist to make that diagnosis. But I hope this information will help prevent someone else from getting it, because I've read some horror stories from people whose condition is far more severe than mine, even when the initial injury was no worse.  Thanks again for your time. :)\n\n",

    "content": "I broke my toe almost a month ago and went to the hospital for X-rays.  They showed that I'd broken the longest bone in my middle toe. It was broken in half lengthwise in a jagged diagonal.  I've done everything they told me to do, but am still seeing swelling and am unable to tolerate much weight at all.  There are improvements, like most of the bruising is gone and of course being able to handle a bit of weight, but it seems like it should be better than this.  I have heard that a bone can heal in a non union and new X-rays are required to see this.  Is there a rule of thumb as to how long you should wait before running (gimping) back for more x-rays?  I don't want to rush in if a month is an acceptable period to still be on crutches.  That's why I thought I'd ask here first, because I really can't afford to spend that kind of money if there's nothing actually amiss here...but I don't want to cripple myself for life cause I'm too broke to go back to the Doctor.  Thank you for any advise you might offer.\n\n",

    "content": "Toe breaks are mortal pain. A normal bone takes 6 weeks to heal at least - depending on your age and diet and weight and activity.   It seems that foot injuries are more likely to be rushed as we need to use our legs for every day activities.  Can you wiggle your individual toe that was injured without too much pain? Weight bearing can cause pain as the toe is trying to heal on its own and is obviously not used to weight as you stated that you were on crutches. Even sprained ankles are treated with a cast as immobility of the sprained ankle heals the ankle the best.  Range of motion of the injuried toe without pain is a good sign - take it easy and let yourself heal.  Pain is a sign of tissue damage and this could mean improper healing. Then I would have the toe checked out via x-ray....\n\n",

    "content": "Can you help me? A 2 years ago, I was having a contest against a kid and we were to jump off the swing and see who could jump farthest. We were in a playground area. I jumped off, and flew about 10 feet in the air. On the edge of the playground, there was this black border (to keep the sand in) and the head of a nail was standing out. After jumping off the swing, I landed straight on the head of the nail. My back, arms, legs, and neck went numb. The only thing I could feel was the excruitiating pain in my coccyx. I could not move at all. I had to fake that I was all right however. When I walked, I could not walk in a straight line, not even close to one. It was black and swollen. When I bent down to get something, I went down with my whole body as to not injure myself more. But when I tried to pick the thing up, my back and my coccyx area twisted in an impossible way. I could feel every muscle in my back pulling on my coccyx. I couldn't sit or sleep. We had a championship soccer game the next day. I tried to run in a straight line but I could not. My hips and my back were writhing, like they hada mind of their own. My coach noticed, and made me sit for the rest of the game, which was really painful. Even now, as I sit, it makes me cry after like 10 minutes. I cannot run as fast as I used to, nor do any sit ups. I used to be a really good athlete, but now I can't even exercise painlessly. I cannot sleep on my back nor use my back muscles at all. I did not go to the doctor when I hurt myself or anytime near that time. My grandma told me that it was just a bruise and it would go away. Well, its now 2 years since I hurt myself and it is not even close to going away. Can you help me? What has gone wrong? Can I do anything to help myself?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Hopefully you were able to put ice on your wrist - always a good idea with an injury such as this to help reduce swelling and pain.  The only way to determine a break from a sprain or strain is to get an xray.  It does not necessarily have to be done in an ER but can be done later during regular office hours once you have applied first aid of ice and immobilization and rest for the first 24 - 48 hours, assuming you aren't having protruding bones, blue, cold fingers or other symptoms.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Screw and plates removal in tibia",
    "content": "Hi KirstenC,  When the screws are removed there are some holes left but they will heal in, basically just like the break heals.  The initial break was unstable so the plates/screws were needed to stabilize the fracture and allow it to heal.  When the screws are removed, the holes will be stable so they will heal in well.  The biggest risk is that the bone is a little weak while the holes are healing in so some care should be take to avoid trauma to the area until the bone heals.  I'm less familiar with the actual time this takes but I would expect it to be around 6-8 weeks, like a typical fracture would.  It may be less than this since the holes are smaller.  I would suggest that you discuss these issues with your doctor to get more specific information regarding your individual case.  Removal of hardware is a routine thing and complications are quite unlikely, although like all surgeries, it is not without risk so your surgeon can give you the best information about this.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Good morning, I dislocated the middle joint of my index finger about 8-9 weeks ago.  It had went back into place right away and xrays showed nothing to be broken.  It has continued to remain swollen and seems my range of motion is getting less.  I just followed up with a specialist and he is going to start me on therapy for the range of motion.  I'm just looking for a 2nd opinion to be sure the treatment is sufficient.  He has ruled out any collateral ligament damage. My concern now is the length of time since the injury.  Will this affect how much movement I evenually get back in this finger or will my outcome still be the same?  What types of PT should I expect out of them to make sure they are correctly treating my finger?  I am currently using Coban wraps to push some of the swelling out.  I know the healing time is months but I want to be aggressive in treatment.  Thanks so much for your forums!!!  And TIME :)\n\n",

    "content": "Hello first off nice Forum.  Male 38 excellent health 5' 8\" 135# non-smoker  long story short  \"sort of\" in mid June of this year triped down the stairs and bent foot awkwardly up onto the inside of my shin. walked on it for 2 weeks before seeing DR. X-rays were negative big surprise. 2 weeks later returne to Dr. sent for MRI revealed sever bone bruising to Cubid and Talus was advised no tissue damge evenden. was given the option of cam boot \"but not weght bearing\" or cast . I choose the cast option My job I'm on my feet 10 hours a day on concrete and wanted it to heal properly.  I was to be casted for 4 weeks. 3 weeks in  cast had loosened up and ahd pain again in the ankle area with leg movemnet inside the cast. I went back and was given a cam still no weight bearing for 4 more weeks. after 1 week in the cam went back pain worse than in a loose cast was pressing right on the \"hot spot\" was put back into a non weight bearing cast for another 4 week a total of 8 weeks. Dr. didn't prescribe PT said I didn't need it for this type of injury. After walking around like peg leg for a week and it not lossening up I contacted my MD and he sent me for PT 3 weeks. The first 2 weeks helped the second week it trailed off. I have been back to work now for a month and a half and I still have a great deal of ankle pain at times. It is just below and in front of the knob that sticks out on the inside of the leg. I can walk okay and side to side movemnet is okay but twisting of the foot expecially towards the outside that \"hot spot\" is painful also if the spot is pressed apon by boots or tight sneakers it's sensitive as well. Also being out in the cold affects it as well when going back indoors the joint tightens up and is quite painfull. From time to time it has a burning sensation and most of the time there is a slight sensation of pressure at that spot. I have no swelling in the joint now when this first happend I had all kinds of it. I'm sure this is all leading to some sort of ligament damage/issue. What is the treatment for this type of injury and subsequent healing time? The first time I was off from work 11 weeks when this first happened. I'm not looing forward to having to be off agin if this doesn't settle down. Thank you so much for reading my rambeling\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Tcpuccio1,  There are a few possibilities as to the cause of your pain.  First, it may be that you have some cartilage damage so the bone is rubbing against bone.  This can be quite painful.    There is also a syndrome, which I am suspicious you may have, called reflex sympathetic dystrophy.  Basically, with this syndrome, after an injury to a muscle, etc., when the area is casted or imobilized for an extended period of time (necessary for healing) the nerves become hypersensitive so that any movement causes severe pain.  The treatment for this is actually to stretch and move the joint-basically more physical therapy-to help retrain the nerves.  I would recommend that you follow up with your orthopedic specialist to evaluate this pain and see if further treatment is needed.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks Dr. Lowe.  Since I last posted that The pain has been and I can handle it I was walking on this for a month before an MRI found the problem. The pain sensation to that area has let up quite a bit. But I do notice if the joint is torqued or flexed towads it's limit tor walk flat footed with out anything on he pain can be much more. I had to chase Down my son 2 weeks ago and it tweeked the joint gain an it has take almost 2 weeks for it to settle down. I do not have any swelling but if you compair the troublesome ankle to the good one it looks different right where the injury is/was. One last thing If I'm out in the cold for an extended amount of time it feels okay untill i go back indoors and then it tightenes up almost instantly for a while then it starts to settle down again. Is that a sight of tissue damage or just the bone injury feeling the cold? It's wierd and thankfully I'm not out in the cold that much or long. I am considering seeing a different OS about this. Thanks again for you time\n\n",

    "content": "I am not sure if I should be posting but getting nowhere trying to ask. I had a similar fall tripped over a cord and landed on my toes and top of my foot. I thought it was a strain so applied ice and elevated and could still walk on it, but went on a trip and could not put any weight, so ended up renting a scooter and the entire foot was black and blue and swollen. I never went to a Doctor out of stupidity and fear I suppose and taped the toes wrapped the foot with a bandage--everything I thought was right. Now, 5 months later, the entire foot is painful and I walk with a cane and people say go to the Doctor, but I think it is too late and very ignorant of me to not overcome my fear initially & should have went to the Doctor. Anyways, just want to tell people to go the the Doctor immediately because you do not wan to end up like me. A fear of walking with a cane for the rest of your life when easily treated should be your main concern. From reading this post, I think I may recover, but if you are reading and it just happened go to the doctor and get proper care even if you think it is a strain. Best of luck and my apology if I am posting on the wrong forum.\n\n",

    "content": "HISTORY: My father is 61 years old and in good health. No signs of diabetese after blood work. He has compressed discs at the base of his spine, but has suffered no real effects from them, other than occasional twinges. He fell from a ladder in July and fractured his coccyx  and stretched his pelvic ligaments. He subsequently had surgery to repair the coxyx. They put two screws into the bone to hold it stable, along with a plate in his pelvic area. The screws can be removed if necessary, since the bone has healed. He takes cholesterol medicine and I believe, an anti-depressant, both of which he has been on for several years.   ISSUE:He has been experiencing numbness and sciatic nerve pain since the surgery. The sciatic nerve pain crops up when he is more active or if the weather is extreme - cold or hot. The numbness is constant, but also increases with activity levels or weather. He has never suffered any type of numbness in the past, despite his vertebrae compression, and has always been very active, going to the gym 6 days a week, kayaking at least twice a week in the warm weather and bike riding.   QUESTION: What could be causing the numbness? Should he have the screws removed? He's concerned about his mobility which is still severely hampered. The surgeon keeps saying that is must be his previous back issues and has nothing to do with the surgery, although the symptoms never existed until then.  Thanks so much for your help.\n\n",

First, a fall hard enough to break the coccyx may also have caused some damage higher up the spine that could now be causing some pressure on the sciatic nerve.   With his pain getting worse with cold weather I wonder if he is developing some arthritis around the area of the sciatic nerve roots.  There may also be some scar tissue that has developed compressing the nerves some.  I would recommend your father follow up with his orthopedic surgeon about this.  I'm less likely to think the screws are causing a problem but his surgeon can better comment on this also.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Sunlover36,  Sometimes during surgery, the best plan to repair the area changes once the surgeon is able to see the actual area.  It may be that during the surgery, his doctor determined that the cadaveric bone would not be a good option to repair the area.    Unfortunately, surgeries do have a risk of failure and it sounds like your husband's bone did not heal as expected.  At this point, my best advise is for your husband to continue to follow up with his orthopedic surgeon regarding the area.  If you are concerned it is always reasonable to request a second opinion.  Most physicians are not offended by this because having another person review the case can often bring to light things that weren't thought of before.  Basically, the more minds the better.

    "content": "I am a 22 year old male, I started running after being very lethargic and having a poor diet for about 4 years. I have had no surgeries, and am not taking any medicaitons.  I did get diagnosesed with some small amount of cartalage in my left knee as well as a small amount of fluid, but the MRI used showed no sign of any damage to any tendons in or near the knee, in fact no real damage at all.  I changed my diet and my lifestyle, but after running for about a month I started developing a pain in my lower left leg. I'm using a good pair of running shoes and taking time to stretch. I was not concerned at first and took a few days off, that resumed running, but the pain got worse. Now I have stopped running (but continued other work outs and maintaining a healthy diet) except once a week, where I'm required to run for weekly Marine Corps preparation training. I'm not sure what's wrong with my leg. I saw a sports doctor during a free day, he took a quick xray suggested it was most likely shin splints and told me to take a week~10 days off. It has been over 4 weeks sense than and the pain is still there, and I am concerned it might be a stress fracture, which I hear is hard to see even with an xray unless your really looking for it.  The pain is very sharp and centered on one point. If feels like it's coming from the middle of the leg, around the bone area, but I can't be sure. When I massage the leg, the most pain comes from applying some pressure to the bone on the inside of the leg in one place, the muscles around it don't feel sore when I rub them thought.  It doesn't hurt at rest, only when applying or releasing pressure on the leg. It has gotten better to wear I can't feel much pain (if any, some days) when walking, but the moment I try to run, the pain becomes acute with every step on the left leg. I used to be active in High School and have had muscle pain and such before (though admittedly never shin splints) and this just doesn't feel like any muscle pain I know of. If it was shin splints, I would have expected it to go away in 4+ weeks. It has me really concerned, and I want to know if this is worth going to another doctor to get another more detailed examination. I want to know exactly whats going on so I can take care of it and heal it properly I can resume normal training as fast as possible.  Thank you very much for any help and/or advice.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Bean,  What you are describing certainly sounds like it could be shin splints or a stress fracture.  Given that the typical method of treating shin splints isn't working it makes a stress fracture a bit more likely, especially given your description of point tenderness along the bone.  Initially, stress fractures may not be visible on x-rays as you've indicated.  Generally, if there is concern for a fracture that was not seen on the first x-rays and pain persists after about a week the x-rays will be repeated.  Often, then signs of a fracture will be present.  If you are continuing to have this pain I would recommend you follow up with your doctor.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Rachel,  It sounds as if your daughter has a spiral fracture (twist fracture).  In general, fractures of children's bones heal very, very well, even if there is a significant angle to the two bone parts.  What is needed for them to heal is for the bones to be immobilized.  There needs to be immobilization of the joints above and below the fracture.  If it is the lower arm, the wrist and elbow should be immobilized.  If it is the upper arm, the elbow and shoulder need to be immobilized.    The reason to immobilize the joints is because even though the bone may not be able to move if splinted/casted without the joints, the bones can still be moved when the joint moves.  A splint, if done properly can be just as good as a cast at immobilizing the joints/bones.  Typical healing time is 6-8 weeks for a fracture.  If it is not healing well I would recommend that she see an orthopedic specialist (bone specialist).  Best wishes.\n\n",

I currently have a plaster cast above my elbow and I am going back for my two week x-ray in 6 days.  My doctors advice was to forget about it but I think he might have been a bit hasty.  There is already minimal pain in my arm and i still have over two weeks healing time left.  Am I fooling myself or is there any chance, maybe with a fiberglass cast or something?  Thanks, Mal\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Mal,  There are a few things to consider.  1st is that even though the pain has improved, the bone is still not back to its full strength.  Much less force will be needed to rebreak the bone until it is fully healed, which can take a few months.  Even though the bone is casted the arm is still subject to twisting forces that could cause injury.  2nd, plaster does not do well with moisture.    The likelihood of your orthopedist giving you clearance to go skiing is probably none.    I would have to agree as well.  Sorry.  Best wishes.\n\n",

In addition, the dorsal (backside) of the hand has two protruding fourth and fifth metacarpal bones at the fourth and fifth carpometacarpol joint.  Is this just a matter of prying back the metacarpal bones back into place? At least the fingers have feeling, and the hand no longer is swollen and discolored black and yellow completely as before. When the injury had occurred I could not even sleep due to the pain. Unfortunately, I have no medical coverage, and currently unemployed. If that wasn't all, I am also in major debt. So I would really like to heal my hand as it's required to do the most basic functions, that are often needed and required for almost all types of employment. Can you be of any help?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Fulong,  I completely understand your concern about the financial aspect of seeing a doctor but I am a bit concerned about your hand based on what you are describing.  The protrusions may actually be dislocated bones.  A broken bone causing a deformity is a possibility and would probably still be pretty painful to push on at this point.    I would recommend you have this evaluated if at all possible to be sure that what ever is going on heals properly so you don't loose any functionality of your hand.  You may want to call your local health department to see if there are any clinics that see patients on a free or reduced fee scale based on income.  These clinics are often available and are good choices for those without insurance.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Dr. Chan,   Thank you for your prompt reply back to this forum. Unfortunately, I have no telephone, no automobile and I am new to this area, so I want to ask, if it is not so much a trouble for you, can you refer to me such free clinics that would be available in the Greensboro, NC area?   Perhaps, you can arrange for a doctor to just meet with me? Also, you did not specify if the dislocated bones would only need to be physically pushed back into place, thinking I will need to do this myself?  I was also thinking that if I could have a X-ray taken of my hand, this would certainly be helpful to me to indicate just how the dislocated bones can be put back into position without causing additional nerve damage of course!   Any help is appreciated.   By chance if you haven't yet seen the documentary film by Michael Moore, called \"Sicko\", it's a documentary comparing the highly profitable American health care industry to other nations, which I recommend that you become aware and anyone else reading this comment posted here: http://www.michaelmoore.com/sicko\n\n",

    "content": "ok so basically i went snowboarding over the weekend and i pretty much landed with my arm locked straight with the palm of my hand making contact with the ground first.  my arm felt like it got jammed, similar to jamming a finger.  i was able to move my arm right away, bending it was not a problem.  However when i made my arm straight, and bent it i would hear 3 small popping sounds.  I was given a sling right away and i went home and iced it up.    The following day it swelled up like crazy. i was unable to bend it much without any pain. 3 days later, which is today the swelling went down a little.  I am now able to bend it some, but i feel a bit of tightness when i am trying to fully bend it. i can make a right angle out of my arm but if i bend it any further than that i feel the tightness and it would begin to hurt. I can almost fully extend my arm, but if i start to twist it a little it would begin to hurt.  I can rotate my wrist and move all my fingers without any pain, i can also make a really tight fist and rotate that around. Most of the swelling is going on at the bottom of my triceps, right around the elbow area.  i am really curious to know what kind of injury i suffered and if it seems serious to you guys. i don't know if i should just let it heal on its own or go get it checked out.  everyday it has gotten a little better, but not by much. thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Joeyy,  It is quite possible to sprain the elbow (just as one would sprain the ankle).  A finger \"jam\" is actually also a sprain of the finger joint.  The mechanism of injury that you are describing could cause a sprained elbow.  It could also cause a fracture.  If you are having any specific point tenderness I would suggest that you see your doctor as this can be a sign of a fracture.  Otherwise, from what you are describing it sounds like you are slowly improving as would be expected of a sprain.  If you stop getting better or if your pain gets worse you should see your doctor also.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Hazel Carnell,  The answer to this depends a bit on where the collar bone was broken but overall I suspect the likelihood is low that the bone itself is causing the pain issues.  The reason for this is that the nerves that supply the arm leave the spin in the neck and travel below the musculature into the arm pit where they form the brachial plexus.  Subsequently they travel down the arm.  The Brachial Plexus and spinal nerve roots are a fair distance away from the clavicle (collar bone).    However, it may be that the trauma that caused the broken clavicle also caused some stretching of or damage to the nerves that supply the arm, giving you the pain.  You may want to see you regular doctor or a neurologist for further evaluation of this.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Greetings,  I am a 30 year old male, exactly four weeks ago, I suffered a pretty serious wrist injury while skateboarding.  As the night went on, the pain worsened and my range of motion decreased.  I used the RICE technique, and by the next morning the symptoms had in fact gotten worse.    There was swelling on the top of the wrist.  There is a bone on the top of my wrist that makes a little \"bump\", right below the hand on the outer side of the arm.  This bone was swollen, and I was certain that I had broken my wrist.    I went to the emergency room that morning and the doctor there informed me that the wrist was not broken, only badly sprained.  I was given a splint and told to continue icing the wrist.  In the next few days, the pain and swelling in the wrist improved dramatically, and after the second week I stopped wearing the splint.  The problem is, that in the two weeks that have passed, the pain has only improved slightly and the bone that was swollen is still swollen.  On a day to day basis, there seems to be no real improvement.  Is there a chance that my sprain was mis-diagnosed?  I have heard that bad sprains can take up to 10 weeks to fully heal.  Is this the case.  I do not usually experience pain, unless I rotate the wrist counter clockwise.  Thanks for your help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Skating_injury,  Severe sprains can take a long time to heal, sometimes months.  But, you should be noticing at least some slight improvement on a consistent basis.    Sometimes, small fractures may not be visible on the initial x-rays.  If there is persisting pain repeat x-rays can be done after about 7-10 days to see if the fracture now shows up.  If your pain is not getting better I would recommend you follow up with your doctor.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi EmuSoda,  It is possible that you have fractured your finger.  It is also possible that the joint itself is injured, commonly referred to as a \"jammed finger\" as you've said.  Joint injuries such as this can actually continue to produce a significant amount of pain and swelling for several days.  They slowly get better over time.  It can be difficult to distinguish the two without an x-ray so if your pain is still significant and you are worried you have a fracture I would recommend you have your doctor take a look at this.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Mine is similar to a few posts down on this forum. no one has answerd his post so her is mine.  I'm 36 years and also  a non smoker. 4 months ago I fell down  chasing my son and twisted my ankle badly I went to an urgent care  facility and it was x-rayed and they found nothing they aid it was a moderate  sprain an maybe a bad bruise. I was given a air brace thing and was  told if it didn't ease up to see an orthopedic Dr. It didn't so I did 2  weeks later I went to a OS and more x-rays and still noting conclusive I  was sent for an MRI and it revealed a stress fracture to the Talis?? I  was placed in a short leg cast for 4 weeks and then I returned for a  follow up and it was still very sore and tender. I was placed in a  second cast for 3 more weeks the whole time I was not permitted to walk on  it. After the 3 weeks I went back and the cast was removed and the DR.  pretty much expected me to walk right on out of his office That didn't  happen. He did take a another set of X-rays I don't know why he didn't  see anything in the first set but who am I to say.  after a week of  limping around badly I called back and he prescribed PT which I did for 3  weeks the first 2 weeks helped a lot the last week not so much it was  actually hurting it some. I haven't had any more Pt but have been doing  the exercises the therapist gave me to do. okay that's the history now  I'm still experiencing pain and discomfort in the ankle joint on the  inside of my leg almost on the top of the foot right where the Talis would  be?? It is a constant pressure feeling and from time to time a burning  sensation. I can walk okay  and side to side  movement it bearable but if it twists or i am walking and change directions I  really feel it. Is it possible that something could have been missed  on an MRI some kind of tissue damage? My 3 year old keeps me busy and a few times a day watching after him and chasing after him I can really feel where the damage was/is.\n\n",

Falling while ice skating can produce enough force to break bones, including ribs if you land with the right orientation.    Treatment is basically supportive.  Sometimes splinting the ribs can help with the pain if a rib is cracked.  If your pain is not improving I would recommend you follow up with your doctor.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I admit that i was rocking out too hard and it all ended with me on the floor with my left kneecap dislocated.  The ambulance came and they popped it back in place.  I refused to go to the hospital because i felt as if i could walk fine, but i woke up in the morning an it was, of course, swollen and painful.  I got an ace bandage and a knee brace on and am walking with a cane for now.  I saw a doctor and the only thing he recommended was an MRI.  I have health insurance, but i would be paying for the MRI totally out of pocket if i had it done.  I called a sports injury specialist and he said that an MRI was a bit of an overkill and made an appointment with him.    My question is: it has popped out once since the last time, and now it is a little more painful.  My knee is still swollen, but this morning i woke up to find that my ankle is also swollen and there is a purple/yellow streak across the back and side of my leg about 3 or 4 inches above the knee.  What would cause the ankle swelling and what is the deal with the discoloration?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Whoafatrandy,  I would agree that doing an MRI immediately may not be necessary.  Swelling of the knee following patellar dislocation is expected.  It can be thought of as similar to a sprained knee in terms of healing time and pain/swelling.  If the kneecap repeatedly is dislocating and MRI may be helpful to see if there are underlying causes.  Seeing the sports medicine doctor is an excellent idea.  It sounds as if your ankle has also been sprained.  The coloring sounds like a bruise that is beginning to resolve.  If you have not had trauma to the area I would recommend you have it evaluated.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Cats51,  Typically a fall with fractured vertebrae would not be though of as a cause for exagerated lumbar lordosis.  The lumbar portion of the spine normally has a lordotic curve (inward) curve to it.  In situations where this curve is too much it can cause lower back pain.    It has a few causes, such as tight muscles.  In the case of fractured vertebrae, the way this could potentially result is if the muscles are contracted tightly to protect the fractured area and minimize movement.  If the muscles are contracted excessively for a prolonged period of time the spine may take on an increased curvature.  This would be uncommon, though.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "First let me thank you for this forum's existence and thank you to all the generous professionals who help others here.  I am a developer and Sysadmin to forums for many and they are so beneficial, informative, and a godsend for many people.  I have a simple question regarding my Emergency Room visit for a broken foot earlier this month.  I am a 40 yo single mom with one still at home (14 yo son).  At 4:30 pm on my porch, my heel slipped out of my sandal and I heard the foot break.  At that same moment I fell over (I think more out of shock than anything) onto my left knee on the concrete.  Knowing the foot was definitely broke (5th Metatarsal between a Jones and Avulsion fracture) we went to the Emergency Room.  Prior to X-rays I was asked several times how I did it by the nurses, doctors and techs.  After the results of the X-ray I was asked again by those who assisted me.    My question I suppose is more out of curiousity - is there a specific reason that they ask so many times?  Were they asking to ensure I wasn't harmed by another person or if it was self-inflicted?  I think the PA was a little surprised I had told her right where the break was.  Could they have wanted to be sure how it happened based on the break itself?    I know it seems silly to ask this question, but I had never been asked so many times and thought it was odd.  Is it SOP?  I know they couldn't suspect my 14yo of harming me, he's just a little mouse.  :)  Thank you in advance!!!!!\n\n",

    "title": "Misdiagnosed talus fracture",
    "content": "Hi, i'm a 24 year old male. I have had an accident falling from the a wall around three meters high and it was four and a half months ago (04/06/07 to be exact). Initially I was diagnosed with distortion of talocrural joint (2nd degree). But as the pain in my ankle did not get any better over time and in fact it increased. My first orthopedist sent me to do a CT of the TC joint. That CT showed an unhealed fracture of the medial portion of the talus. After that I've been to two other doctors who sent me to ask for second opinion because they were, as they said, more of a knee specialist. A few days ago I did a MS-CT which showed the same big fragment and also a few other smaller ones (up to 0,5 cm). Pain in the ankle is bearable but quite uncomfortable when I'm not active, but during any activity that includes standing and walking it gets more paintful. Also I experience some pain flexing my big toe, which is probably due to the fact that the fracture goes through sulcus of the FHL muscle tendon.  My question is what is your opinion the treatment should be. It's been more than four months since the accident. And the fragment clearly isn't going to heal on it's own. Is surgery the best way to go, actually is there an alternative? If so, is the fragment suitable for arthroscopic surgery or open surgery would be required? And what are long term consequences of the procedure or if some other less invasive method would relieve the pain? Also I would like to know is there a techinque of reattaching the fragment after such a long time?  In the attachment you'll find transverse and coronal section of the MS-CT scan. Upon request I can deliver all the images from the scan.  Thank you.\n\n",

My fibula ended up being broken in two places and my tibia had a chip off it, this resulted in an ORIF with a plate and 9 screws. The OS put me in an aircast and I have been testing my ROM. I think a ligament maybe severly damaged because my dorsiflexion is terrible. its been three weeks since I have been in the walking cast and testing my dorsiflexion every day. It is still terrible and seems to not make any progress. I remeber bruising directly above the top of my ankle when i broke it and think this may have been a completely torn ligament. Is it possible the ligament will not heal? could it be completely torn off and the OS did no notice. its been about a month and a half and nothing has been done is it too late to fix this?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Ankleboy66,  It is possible that a tendon or ligament was damaged in the accident.  Plain x-rays, most commonly used for diagnosis of broken bones, do not show the tendons so damage may be missed.  During the ORIF it is likely that your surgeon was not working in the proper area to see such an injury.  I would recommend you talk with your orthopedic surgeon about your difficulty in dorsiflexion.  You may need an MRI to get a better idea of how things are going there.  If there is a torn ligament it may still be able to be repaired.  Best wishes.\n\n",

My right hand center knuckle has grown about double it's size if not bigger and the area behind the knuckle has swollen a bit aswell.

Now my question is because i'm currently on holidays untill the third of september if i could wait with going to the doctor untill i'm back at home. And i wonder what your diagnoses is, broken, bruised or anything els alltough i know it's almost impossible to determine without actually seeing it and feeling it and even then it can be tough without on x-ray but i'll respect your toughts and your opinion very much.

Certainly, though, by now the bone is well healed so removal of the nail is likely an option.  I suspect it would need a bit more than local anesthesia but it probably would not require full general anesthesia to do.  They anesthesiologist or surgeon may be able to just give you some medicine by IV to make you sleepy and get good pain control without having to make you go all the way to sleep.  My advice would be to talk with your surgeon about this, though, to verify what I am saying.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Foot Fracture",
    "content": "I am a 20 year old female. About 5 weeks ago I fell on my right foot and immediately had tremendous throbbing pain, swelling and bruising. The pain was initially more localized to the midfoot but began to spread throughout the whole foot and then up my leg. I went to the ER and was told I had a navicular avulsion fracture. At the fracture clinic the next day I was given a fracture boot for comfort but was told that it would heal with or without anything on it. For the next few weeks I wore the boot mostly when I was out and not around the house. I went back to the fracture clinic 3 weeks post injury and this time the xrays also showed some sort of cuboid fracture aswell as I was still having a lot of pain, swelling and tenderness mostly on the lateral side of my foot. The orthopedic said that both fractures would still heal fine with no further treatment. It has now been over 5 weeks and I am still having pain and some swelling on the lateral side of my foot especially when walking on it. A lot of the pain and swelling is felt and seen where the calcaneous and cuboid meet as well as where the cuboid meets the 5th metatarsal. I have not used the boot for the past 2 weeks, but occasionally wear and slip on tensor. Is this normal to still have swelling and pain that long after the injury. I am pretty sure the fractures are mostly healed but could there be other damage that needs to be treated or will that all just heal with time?  Thanks for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Aprilgirl12,  Feet fractures can take a long time to heal because the feet are used on a constant basis.  They should heal fine, though.  It is possible that you may have damaged some of the tendons/ligaments in the foot as well.  These may be causing you some pain also.  If your pain is not slowly, but steadily, getting better I would recommend you follow up with your orthopedist just to be sure all is well.  Best wishes.\n\n",

It is not uncommon for people with these fractures to be off the affected side for 6-8 weeks.

There was swelling and it hurt to walk, so I immediately put ice on it and rested it for the rest of the week. Last week, I tried to start runing again and about 1 mile in, my knee felt weak with every stride and after I stopped, it was followed with some more pain and swelling. I began resting again for another week, following a good icing routine (about 15 min on/1 hr off). Today, I tried to run again and got about 3 miles with no pain until the same problem started to creep in again. I need to get running pain free again soon because I am training for a race, so any advice would be greatly appreciated!!!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Efhsxc23,  There are several things in the knee that can be damaged with trauma, including the patella (knee cap), tendons, ligaments and cartilage.  You may have a fracture of your patella or may have damaged one of the cartilage meniscus that helps cushion the knee.  I would recommend you see a sports medicine doctor or an orthopedic surgeon to have your knee fully evaluated.  If you don't have one of these doctors in your area your primary care doctor may feel quite comfortable evaluating the knee.  Best wishes.\n\n",

It may also be that you have a fracture of your femur.  It does take a fair amount of force to do this; however, a fall can easily generate this force.  If it is not a complete break you may still be able to walk on it.  It sounds like you should probably be seen by your doctor for an evaluation to make sure everything is alright.

    "content": "Hi Mortgageguy,  Unfortunately the picture isn't coming through for me.  Perhaps I can give you some advice without it though.  Several years ago a group of physicians developed the Ottowa Ankle Criteria to help determine when an x-ray should be done on an ankle with these type of injuries.  An x-ray should be performed if: 1) there is point tenderness over the medial or lateral maleolus (the bones of the bottom of the lower leg where they stick out). 2) There is point tenderness over the lateral edge of the foot (over the 5th metatarsal) 3) There is point tenderness over the navicular bone (on the medial aspect of the foot near the back side of the arch). 4) The patient was unable to bear weight immediately after the injury AND the patient cannot bear weight for 4 steps when being evaluated.  If any of these are present an x-ray should be done as the possibility of a fracture is higher.  If these are not present a fracture is less likely but not definitively ruled out.  In these cases, an x-ray may still be appropriate if the clinician feels there are signs of a break.  It can take several days for an ankle injury to really seem like it is getting better.  If your friend's ankle is not improving I would agree with you that he should be evaluated.  Best wishes.\n\n",

The doctor didn't really speak to me after the surgery as I was pretty out of it, he instead called my home.  Couple questions.  1. I am 3 days out of surgery and have such burning pain in my cast that it keeps me up all hours of the day and night 2. are they going to take the plate/ screws out?  3. Should my toes go from icy cold to totally hot on my cast foot?

    "content": "Dear Sjanegray, I trust you have indeed had the cast checked.  Swelling of a limb inside a cast can contribute to numbness and tingling in that limb by constricting circulation and putting pressure on sensitive nerves.  As far as the surgery goes: you have had what is called an ORIF - open reduction internal fixation - of your foot and ankle.  This involves the permanent placement of hardware to support bones that would not probably heal well without extra support. Certain types of fractures may heal without such drastic intervention. Sometimes the fractures are more complicated, or involve certain bones of the body that need the extra reinforcement in order to permit the patient to return to a  place of normal or near-normal function.  It sounds like you do not have an external fixator - if you have a cast, but the cast does need ongoing assessment.  Ask your doctor what signs you should watch for that might signal problems, so you can let him/her know if they occur.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Sjanegray, Do you/did you have physical therapy working with you as you began your weight bearing?  Having been off weight bearing for 6 weeks, sometimes you almost have to learn to walk again - due to changes in physical condition (remember you have hardware installed in your foot now) plus some atrophy in that R leg (it starts to set in very quickly in a limb that is not being used), plus some natural inherent extra caution pleaded out by the brain to be careful!  Without seeing the area of purpling I can only guess, which wouldnt be fair to you. I do suspect however, if your Doctor put you back in a splint, then he/she has not determined this to be a major problem at this time. Keep your followup appointments, and ask if a referral to physical therapy is possible for when they release you again to weight bearing.\n\n",

It was like a dark purple, and then it got swollen and it hurt to touch it. Well its been the 2 days and it's not so dark in color and it still hurts alot to touch and just a little bit ago I had started to walk to the kitchen from my computer(only a few feet) and I got this really bad pain in the back of my leg so I didn't go into the kitchen since it hurt so bad to walk. There is a line of the bruise and it goes across my shin bone like this / . I tried to feel for a broken bone but it hurts to bad to feel real good and its still swollen not as much but it still is. I don't know if its broke or not or just really swollen. If its broke it might be a hairline fracture. Also if i try and stretch my leg it hurts.\n\n",

Most probably you had a slight nerve injury at the time of fracture that is causing that shooting pain...nerve cells regenerate very slowly and I advice you to take vitamin B12 to help in that.

    "content": "I would recommend you talk to your obstetrician and possibly consider seeing an orthopedist.  While plain film x-rays are relatively low in radiation, pelvic x-rays do have a bit more radiation than others (not much but it is more).  If there is high suspicion, your orthopedist and obstetrician may elect to treat you as if you have a fracture rather than expose you to the radiation.  If there is concern and the diagnosis is uncertain they may feel it is safe to get the single set of plain film x-rays.  A CT scan would show a fracture very well but I would strongly recommend against a CT scan at this point do to the significant amount of radiation exposure.  MRI may also show a fracture and does not involve radiation.  We believe MRI is probably safe during pregnancy but we really don't have long term data that I am aware of so generally I avoid MRI's if possible.  (Given the choice I would do MRI before CT).  Ultrasound is unlikely to show anything.  There really isn't a great imaging method for a suspected pelvic fracture in pregnancy, unfortunately.  As such, treatment recommendations are likely to be conservative.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Wendy, A walking boot is designed to provide a certain amount of stability to an injured foot.  A cast tends to be more rigid and unwielding.  The doctor typically would not allow a switch to a boot unless in your case either a boot or a cast would be suitable alternatives.  Which bones were fractured?  Sometimes either a boot or a cast are equally stabilizing (except that your friends cannot sign a boot as easily as a cast!) If the cast was too cumbersome, or felt too confining, then a walking boot may be a suitable alternative - so long as you adhere to your doctor's instructions regarding weight bearing, and foot care.  The boot may require that you are more deliberately adherent to the doctor's instructions since it is technically a removable device.  Please adhere strictly to your doctor's instructions, so that the outcome may be just as positive as if you had kept the cast.\n\n",

    "title": "Sternoclavicular joint dislocation",
    "content": "Hi,  I am a female born 07/02/1991. And have for the past almost a year and half been sufferring from upper abdominal pain. This upper abdominal pain is always present and is increased by activity... it seems as though lifting things is causing the most of my problem in terms of increasing the pain. I have always belived this to be a muscular problem as my upper abdominal pain is increased with activity. However, i have had a gastroscopy, numerous blood tests, a CT Scan of my abdomen and pelvis, and X-rays of my chest, X-rays of my Spine and an ultrasound. All these tests have come back 'normal'.   Recently, i was looking over all the films from my chest x-ray (taken in december 2006). I had noticed somethign on one of the x-rays in particular when i first recieved them back, however i was told it was probably just an abnormality. So, i was looking over these again and decided to do a few searches on the internet.  ~ I would scan this particullar x-rays into the computor, however i do not have access to the equipment required for it, so i'm hoping you can go one what i tell you~  The 'abnormality' is at the site of the Sternoclavicular Joint. My left clavicle appears to be in the right position. However, my right clavicle appears to have a signifigant gap where it should come nicely in and 'appear' to meet with the point where it should connect to the sternum. An example of this which i've found on the internet is below:    As you can see one of the clavicles is considerably 'apart' from where it should be. Although not as 'severe' looking as this x-ray i have the same type of thing happenning with my right clavicle. As i say similar, but not as severe as the one above.  So, i dropped the chest x-ray back at my gp with a printed copy of my example and a little information about sternoclavicular Joint Dislocations. My Gp told me to go back to the doctor who had ordered the x-rays. So i did and he said there is a possibility that it is a Sternoclavicular Joint Dislocation- however, it oculd also be that i was crokked when the x-rays were 'taken'.   >>>In the meantime between when my gp had the x-rays and when the doctor who ordered the x-rays had the x-rays and reviewed them himself. I had another look at the x-rays of my spine which were taken in June 2006 (by another doctor). The same 'abnormality' was on one of them which had viewed the top region of my spine. <<<  When i told the doctor who had sent be for the chect x-rays that there was the same thing on the other spine x-rays he seemed to turn his review around and said that having 2 of the same things changed everything. Needless to say he told me to go back to my GP and get a referral to a Orhtopedic Surgeoon.  So i have gone back to the Gp who looked at the chest x-rays again and again said that there appears to be somethign wrong there. I showed her the spine x-rays and she too was convinved that because there are 2 that it is unlikely that what i am seeing is just from being 'crooked'.  So have now got a referral to an Orhtopedic Surgeon and an appointment booked for the 28th of this month. Am hoping this will finally get me back to normal again.  However, if anyone can give me any information at all about wether a sternoclavicular joint dislocation could trigger upper abdominal pain i woudl really appreciate it. My GP said that my upper abdominal pain could be a case of referred pain from the sternoclavicular joint dislocation. Or if it is dislocated that it may be pushing on nerves which travel around my upper abdomen.  I know that i don't have the clinical signs of a sternoclavicular joint dislocation but my  in the initial horse riding accient (and we've been telling doctors this all along) i landed on my shoulders. I cannot rememeber back that far now as to wether i had shoulder/clavicle pain but i do feel tendernedd underneath the clavicle which appears abnormal in the example (above). I have heard of people who ahve 'broken' their collar bones and they've felt neaseaus so yeah...   If anyone can give me any info as i said before it owuld be greatly appreciated. :)\n\n",

It may be that you had a prior dislocation that never reduced and now is not causing you any trouble.  It may also be that you simply have a normal variation of your joint.  The orthopedist will be able to help determine this for you.  If you have not seen a GI specialist this may be helpful.  You may have a hiatal hernia, where the stomach moves up into the chest some.  This can cause upper abdominal pain and be worsened by activity.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Direct Fall to Left Side (Hip,Back injury) HELP!",
    "content": "I am 25 female who slipped and fell landing on my left side almost 1 1/2 years ago.  I landed primarily on the hip, elbow, and slamming my leg.   My first concern when I fell was my neck and right shoulder because they were previously injured and I have pins in the shoulder due to open stabilization surgery. I did not have immediate pain but when I woke up I  had exteme pain and could barely walk. I went to ER and an x-ray showed I chipped the left hip at the outside of the socket. I was told it may be previous injury but I have never had so much pain in my hip my entire life before this injury. I was not put on crutches until the second week due to the left elbow pain, and previous right shoulder injury.  I was told the \"chip\" was no big deal and the back could be causing the pain. So I was sent for an MRI of the back and it showed bulging disks from L2-S1, mainly at L4-L5 and a radial tear at the same level.  My treatment has included cortisone shot in the hip without relief. An Epidural Steroid Injection into L4-L5 L5-S1 without relief. A negative EMG and QSART test. Many months of PT to realign my SI joint without benefit. The use of a SI belt without relief due to the pressure it causes and the fact I do not stay aligned. I have seen a hip surgeon 8 months after injury who does believe I can still be having hip pain. I have also seen two back surgeons who are afraid to do surgery because it is a multi level injury and it is not specific what the direct cause of pain is.   Even though I have been told the hip pain is caused by the back it is my belief that I have separate injuries because my pain is in two separate areas and patterns. Around my SI joint the pain  goes into my butt and down the back of my thigh into my lower leg to the big toe side of my foot. The pain I believe due to my hip injury goes from around the socket, into the groin area, and down the outside of my leg into my knee and continues down the outside of my calf. I have a lot of pain sitting, walking, and climbing stairs. Usually laying down gives me relief but often I cannot get relief. I have been prescribed 1/2 of 5mg Loritab at bedtime for the pain but it does not give me relief. Many times I cannot walk for more than 1/2 hour or be in a vehicle and even that long puts me out of commission for the rest of the day.  I also walk with a limp and at times have to use crutches to take the weight off my hip.  I am looking for any advice or  information that may help me with pain relief.  I am also wondering if there are any tests that may help in diagnosing the injury correctly\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Shorti81, Wow, you have a complicated case!  Without a direct exam, I am hard pressed to give best guess support.  It sounds like you have insurance which will be a help.  I will offer what insight I can from the information in your post.  The bones in the lower back, specifically SI joint (which is a movable joint and not a completely fixed joint) will cause serious pain when out of place.  It can be bad enough to feel like someone shoved a red hot rebar through the lower back, out the front, and then decides to jump on the end.  It takes a specialist to know how to manipulate it into proper position.  While I greatly respect the role and skill of a PT (physical therapist), I recommend such an injury be evaluated and treated by a Chiropractic Physician instead, or a DO (Doctor of Osteopathy) who has special knowledge in spinal manipulation.  With the multiple injuries you have sustained, there will need to be a stairstep approach to helping you.  The body guards to pain and locks up already injured joints, preventing readjustment by anyone except a true specialist.  A combination of ice therapy with pain medication will be needed prior to any adjustments.   On the basis of the information you have provided, l tend to agree that a single chip out of the hip bone will not be debilitating.The hardware in the shoulder may continue to ache at times, but will be bearable compared to the agony you are currently experiencing.    On another note - at this point it doesn't seem to really matter if the injuries are from separate incidences.  The important thing is to regain your independence and freedom from pain.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Theone, Injuries to the hand can sometimes turn out more serious than previously guessed.  While we consider our hands to be formidable (we do EVERYTHING with them after all!) they are actually made up of an intricate skeletal system with 27 - yes 27- bones of varying sizes and fragility.  Combine these with a knitted network of tendons, ligaments and veins/arteries, and you have the potential for quick disaster at the freakiest accidents!  It certainly sounds like you have possibly hurt one or more of each of these components, and it would be wise for you to have your hand evaluated by your primary care physician or the local urgent care/ER.  An xray would easily tell if any fractures have occurred, and with further diagnostic tests they can determine if nerve endings or veins have been damaged.  You have a potentially long life projected ahead of you, and any small damages you think you may have experienced now could certainly turn out to be long lasting and debilitating.  Yes, I recommend you have this injury further evaluated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I am a 21 year old female and I work as a baker.  A few weeks ago, my shoulder started to hurt badly, and felt like something was out of place.  I thought that I had just slept on it wrong, so I waited for it to go away.  However, it did not go away.  I think, now, that I did something to it by swinging a large, heavy, box of cinnamon rolls onto my shoulder to carry them.  It's been about 3 weeks now, and it is still in pain.  There is a lump that I can see and feel on the top of my shoulder, and constant stinging/tingling pain.  I can feel it pop occassionally, and I can hear it...it is loud.  I looked it up on WebMD, and it lead me to the idea of a separated shoulder.    Any help is greatly appreciated\n\n",

Another possibility is a small fracture, particularly of the outside end of the clavicle.  It doesn't take much force to fracture the clavicle.  There are also many other small, weaker areas of bones in the shoulder joint.  If your pain is not improving I would recommend that you see your doctor and possibly have some x-rays done.

    "content": "Hi, I am a 42 y/o female. Five days ago I tripped and fell hard against a vacuum canister, directly on my knee cap. There was a discernable dent. The pain was horrendous but two days of rest and I was and am able to walk with hardly any pain, apart from going up stairs. However, when I sit still, esp. with my knee at a right angle, for any length of time, the area I struck begins to ache. Last night the pain woke me from sleep. Is this just the normal healing process from a trauma to a bone or should I have an x-ray? How many days healing should I expect (roughly) before the pain goes away, if you don't think it is fractured? This is a great service and I Thank You for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Patellar fractures are possible.  It does take a fair amount of force to do this, though.  If you have pain over the knee cap when pushing on it, a fracture is possible.  If pressure does not cause pain it is less likely to be fractured.  It may be that you have some bruising of the tissues surrounding the patella as well.  These can take a while to really heal completely because they get moved with every step you take.  If the pain is not improving after about a week I would recommend that you see your doctor.

Everything seemed to be healing well until Friday morning when I woke up.  My left elbow and just below the elbow impacted during the crash but the skin wasn't broken.  It was tender for the last two weeks, but barely bruised or swollen.  On Friday when I woke up there was some pretty good swelling and tenderness.  Over the weekend the swelling has gotten worse and moved down into my forearm.  The area is extremely tender and red.  It is warmer to the touch than my other arm and even a little itchy.  My range of motion isn't limited and the pain only occurs when presssure is applied.  I was wondering why after two weeks its just now swelling and if there could possibly be an infection even though the skin wasn't broken.  I did recieve road rash in other areas.  Also ice doesn't seem to reduce the swelling and advil does little.  I had flu like symptoms immediately following the crash, but those dissapeared after a week.  Whats up with my elbow?\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 31 year old female, and I play softball in a local co-ed church league. I was making a catch of a line drive hit by a man and because I was at a weird angle I put my right hand up to cover the ball in my mitt. Apparently it hit my bare hand first because the pain was immeadiate and so bad it was undescribable. There was swelling and brusing. I also had numbness and tingling in two fingers. Hubby took me to the ER where the doc sent for X-rays and then told me I had a nondisplaced fracture in one of the bones in my hand. I was put in a half cast type thing and told to follow up with ortho.  When I took the X-rays to the Dr.s office they had me see a physicians assistant. She said it was hard to tell, there was a spot on the x-ray that could be a fracture, and with the pain and brusing she felt it was probably fractured. (top of the 5th metacarpal) She put me in a wrist splint so I could use most of my fingers, and so I couldn't move the affected bone in my hand. She said it will take 6 weeks to heal. I go back in 2 weeks to have more x-rays to look for calcium deposits which I guess is a sign of healing? Now the weird part.  The radiology report at the hospital has now come back saying there was no evidence of a fracture. So now I have conflicting reports and have no idea if it is broken or not. I am in a great deal of pain, and am not sure what steps to take next. I hate not knowing if it is in fact broken or not. Which person should I go with? The ER Doc, the radiologist, or the PA at the Ortho's office?\n\n",

    "content": "There are a few possibilities.  One is that you do not have a fracture.  In this case, your pain is likely due to severe bruising of the bone/ligaments/muscles in the area that can take several weeks to begin to improve.  Treatment is with rest and time.  The other, I suspect more likely, possibility is that you do have a fracture.  Orthopedists will treat injuries as if they are fractured even if the x-rays are not completely consistent.  While most fractures will show up on x-ray some do not.  Generally, you would see the calcifications that you are mentioning if there was a fracture but this is not a guarantee.  Treatment in this case is rest (using the splint) and time.  Fortunately, which ever the actual case is the treatment is really the same.  I would recommend continuing to wear your splint and resting the hand as much as possible.  If your pain is not improving over the next week or so you should follow up with your doctor.

The docter also gave him a Script for a air cast/splint to get at a medical store   This dr does not want to see him again but my concern is that it is still VERY VERY swollen and has a bruise and he cant even put weight on it. Do you think we should go see another Dr. Is it normal to be this swollen this long(almost a week) still that big?  it is swollen all the way up to his toes and up past the top of the ankle.

If he is unable to walk at all after a week he may need repeat x-rays even if the first ones were normal.  Sometimes small fractures can be missed that subsequently can be seen a week or so later.  The swelling is certainly possibly caused by a severe sprain.  Swelling and bruising can take weeks to fully resolve.  I would recommend that your husband be seen again if his pain is not improving.

I was recently sick (for about 2 months) with a very bad cough that caused what I can only describe as attacks of coughing in which I was gasping for air.  I then began to have terrible pain in my back, right side, and under my right breast.  It was painful to move, breath, cough, sneeze, and even to talk.  It was painful to the touch.  My doctor originally said pleuracy but when the pain continued into the next week he sent me to a pulmonologist who said he believes I may have fractured a rib from coughing so hard.  So I went for a rib series and it showed a \"deformity\" of the 7th rib but they could not say it was definitly a fracture.  What other deformity would it actually be or is it most likely a fracture that wasn't picked up well by the x ray?  How long does the pain last with a fracture?  I am currently taking a pain medication and an anti inflammatory med.  Thanks for your help.  Nicole\n\n",

If you had the x-ray done a few months after the initial accident, any evidence of a fracture may have been healed up; however, assymmetry such as one side being higher than the other should still show up.  This makes me suspicious that you may actually have a muscular or soft tissue issue.  Your doctor can help you determine which specialist would be the best to help you, perhaps a plastic surgeon.

I have been on  different meds. I had therapy for 3 days. I I did end of breaking my tailbone. My tailbone is fine. My lower back still hurts. I had a MRI,and bone scan. Nothing serious showed. The pain I have is a dull ache at times going into  a stabbing pain. Its mainly in one spot in my back but it feels like a very bruised bone. When this happens at the pain goes from my back to my rear and straight down my left leg. I can walk for about 15 to 20 mins. before my leg aches or goes numb. The MRI showed no nerve damage. I was told that you can have nerve damage and the test wont show. It is considered chronic back pain or nuero(something) I forget the name. I was wondering if it is true that staright forward therapy or even an epideral could help me.  Thank You\n\n",

    "content": "hey there i am a 15 (almost 16) year old guy, and i have really bad knee problems. since last summer, i have grown an awefull lot, and now i am 171cm tall. i weigh 81 kg, so im heavily build ^^  as i started this year of school, i joined the basketball team and the training was very tough. especially also because i have astma. we were training for an upcomming basketball tournament which took place here in march. Nearing march, my knees would start to hurt alot during practise. so i went to the school nurse many tiems to get painkillers and to put ice on them. she said that its most likely a common diseas that most teanagers get when they grow fast and paly alot of sport. Something called the Sholowschs Hollowf Diseas.. (as u can see i cannot remember the name at all, its also very complicated) this is where there is this \"bumb\" that forms under my knee kalp and that pulls out alitle bone which sits in the knee... (thats what i have learnt from it)  but just to be on the safe side i went to an Orthopaedic doctor. he also suggested that it was these disease and wanted me to take some X-rays of the knees, to see how bad it was. (if its really bad u might kneed an oporation!) so i got the xrays and brought them to him. He said that it wasnt that bad and it would go away as i grow. but few weeks after my knees became very weak and sensitive (note that i stopped all my sport after the tournament.. so i was puzzled that it wouldnt stop hurting) he did some examinations again, pulled it and moved around with my legs (lol) and then asked me to get a Ultra Vision Scan of them (the type that pregnatn women get to see their baby) i did that, and he concluded that it still wasnt serious, and that i should do special \"knee\" exercises with the nurses at his clinic.  i havnt gone there yet because i have been so busy, and i just wanted to hear some second thoughts from you guys. my knees feel like they are in a very bad condition right now. they are so stiff, i cant run probaly; everytime i lift my knee it hurts ALOT. i cant walk straight down and up of stairs, so i must plant my feet sideways when passin stairs :(  when lieing on my back, and then putting my legs in mid air and try to stretch them out so they arnt bending, it hurts on my left knee but i can still manage, but on my right i can stretch it to an angle of ca. 100-150 degrees (out of 180) and then it will hurt too much to proceed. also when i move my legs fast (trying to play football) and i do quick movements with them my knee's sometimes \"backlock\" as i call it. as if they have been stunned, or moved into a real bad position and thne it hurts alot.  i can take pictures of the xray and ultra vision pictures if that would be helpfull and i really hope that some of you ahve some advice  thankyou very much in advanced Karsten\n\n",

    "content": "I suspect the name of the disease that you have is \"Osgood-Schlatter Disease\".  It was first described by Dr. Osgood and Dr. Schlatter seperately in 1903.  The pain with this disease is generally located just below the knee as you describe.  This is where the patellar ligament attaches to the bone below it.  The quadraceps muscles essentially all focus their attachment to the patella which is then attached to the bone via the patellar ligament.    A good way to think of this disease is that the tibia (the main bone of the lower part of the leg) gets lots of microscopic fractures in it from the stress of the muscles pulling on it.  Treatment is essentially rest and avoiding painful exercises, etc. until the pain has resolved.  It may take several months for the pain to resolve.  During this time, strenuous activity and deep knee bends should be avoided.  Once all the pain is gone activity can be resumed very slowly.    The prognosis for this disease is almost always excellent recovery with conservative management (not needing surgery).  Best wishes.\n\n",

The next day was a completely different story.  It really hurt to walk & it was intense pain if I stepped on something that pushed my arch up.  This pain lasted for about 2 days.  Now it is just tender and slightly painful when I walk, push on it.    The pain is (I believe) in my 5th metatarsal mostly tender on the top.  It is more tender than painful.  No swelling, bruising or redness.  Only slight pain/discomfort when I walk (moreso when I bend it (arch)).    Could it be broken?

    "content": "Hi, I am a 45 year old, male, reasonably fit albeit slightly overweight but not obese.  I walk 3 miles per day at least and exercise once or twice per week.  Broke right leg (spiral fracture of tib just above ankle and broken top of fib) skiing Jan 05 in France and experienced excellent repair and text book recovery (according to my Consultant).  Previous year  fell off ladder and jarred same knee with possible mensiscus damage. Had intramedullary tib nail removed mid-Sept 06.  Op went very well with no probs and full weight bearing immediately after.  Signed off by Consultant but began experiencing infrequent (once or twice daily) intense and excrutiating stabbing pains in my knee in early Dec.  Pain lasts for max of 30 secs then back to completely normal.  No joint locking or anything like that and no apparent reason for it occurring.  Also cannot seem to affect pain by repositioning leg, bending it or anything else.  Consultant thinks it could be nerve damage or something similar.  I would be grateful for any thoughts or suggestions.  If no thoughts other than nerve regrowth, how long does this take and is there anything that can be done?[/b]\n\n",

    "content": "You may, indeed, be experiencing some nerve type pain as the area heals.  There is a syndrome known as reflex sympathetic dystrophy that essentially is nerve pain as the nerves regenerate.  It doesn't tend to be the episodic, intense, short-lived pain (at least according to the few patients I've seen with it) but this may be what's going on in your case.  I would recommend that you contact your orthopedist if the pain is not getting better soon or if it gets worse.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, 37 yr old male with a \"slight\" snowmobile accident. 6 Weeks ago I crashed and broke 2 vertibre and 3 ribs. They are better but as I started healing I noticed that my shoulder was not moving above level. (of course the hospital was more worried about keeping me alive than anything else) So when I went to the neurologist for a follow up I asked him. He just said well, it must be a problem between your ribs and your shoulder. I COULD'VE TOLD HIM THAT! I also have a \"large lump\" on the same bicept and my shoulderblade seems to stick out about an extra inch. I am still in pain with it but it has gotten better. So, could there be some corolation between the broken ribs and my shoulder problem? Thanks much!!\n\n",

    "content": "Any trauma that is strong enough to fracture ribs and vertebrae is certainly able to cause damage to the shoulder as well.  Essentially, it could be a problem with the bones of the shoulder, the muscles of the shoulder, the nerves, or the attachments (ligaments and tendons).  There really isn't much else involved.    A thorough physical exam and some x-rays should guide your diagnosis nicely.  If these are not revealing you may need an MRI of your shoulder to look for any other problems or impingements.    You may consider requesting a referral to an orthopedic or sports medicine specialist as they are the musculoskeletal experts.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

I can still move my fingers and my hand with ease but there is a small stinging pain regardless of movement. when I make a fist it causes great discomfort in my pinky knuckle and when I lay my hand flat on a flat surface, there is a hard lump that is not on my other hand which appears to be my knuckel pushed back.. its soar to put pressure on my knuckle and my bone in that area. just wondering whats wrong with it and i have not been to see a doctor yet. i'm a 17 year old male by the way\n\n",

Unfortunately, from the description of your MRI showing a lesion, I cannot say if it represents a fracture, an increase in bone or possibly a decrease in bone in that area.  The possibilities are numerous.    Osteochondral defect is a similar term that is a little more specific.  It simply means that there is a defect in the bone/cartilage area of your talus.  I agree with the recommendation to see a foot specialist.  Your doctor should be able to give you more information regarding the MRI.  Sorry I can't be of more help.\n\n",

    "content": "Determining the presence of a fracture vs. a deep bruise can be difficult.  If the pain is getting better over the course of 1-2 days a fracture is less likely.  If the pain worsens or continues, especially if there is tenderness when pressing along a small area, there may be a fracture.  These are far from definite rules, however.  If you are concerned about a fracture I suggest that you be evaluated by your doctor.  If there is still concern, x-rays can be done to look for fractures.  Hope this helps some.\n\n",

An X- ray chest would give also better idea about the bone density and the presence of any anatomical problems.  Inflammatory causes in the costochondral joint (costochondrtis) or in the ribs may be the causes.  Muscle spasm and pain may be another cause for your pain. It may be due to wrong posture or inflammation of the muscle caused by muscle injury.  If there is a previous history of trauma  to the chest, then abnormal bone healing may cause anatomical changes which may result in muscle spasm and pain.  You should seek direct medical consultation for proper management.  Best regards.\n\n",

Even though you think the finger \"popped back\" in place, a physician can identify appropriate alignment of the bone to assure that problems don't appear at a later time in the joint itself. Typical treatment of finger dislocations after the area is appropriately aligned, are done by splinting or \"buddy taping\" to support the injured area. Keeping the injured area elevated above the level of the heart and applying ice (always covered with a material as not to apply the ice directly to the skin itself) will aide in reduction of swelling and discomfort.

I wasn't sure whether to  make a new post or put it with  my old one.  age: 35 sex:female past surgeries: ulnar nerve compression surgery left elbow current medications: Ortho Tri Cyclen  Birth Control, Nortriptyline 25mg one time a day, take it at night, Advil maximum dose allowed per day for this recent injury.  A few days ago I partially dislocated my little finger left hand, middle joint. I could see that the bone was sticking upwards and wiggled my finger and felt it click back in. As time progressed my finger became more swollen, bruised, painful. I headed to a walk in clinic that specializes in broken bones, cuts etc. They took xrays, no broken bones. The doctor said I likely had a partial dislocation. They put a splint on and I go back in 10 days. I understand there will be swelling, bruising etc. The swelling is intense and the splint is really tight. He told me I could remove the splint while showering etc, reapply it. Last night my swelling was really bad and I had to take it off and apply ice to the area. The bruising has spread into my hand. I have been taking Advil (anti-inflammatory) maximum dose. I also have noticed some numbness in my little finger, not severe, but its there. Is this normal after a dislocation? Any other tips to help? Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Since my last post, my fingre has popped out of place twice again. Approximately two weeks ago I took off the removable splint while showering (was told I could do that by doctor) and when I was reaching for the litre size shampoo bottle with my good hand it slipped and banged against my left hand, thus popping my finger out once again. I had a follow up appt with the doctor about 4 days later. Took xrays, no breaks, splinted it again for one week, told me I could remove splint in one week, then come back for a follow appt. So I headed back, splint removed and said I should start exercising it. At home I slowly started to bend my finger etc. Well about two days later after I saw the doctor, my finger popped again after exercising it. I headed back today. The doctor felt my finger and said that the tendon on the side of my finger, right side of finger, appeared to be loose. He buddy taped my ring and little finger together, has to stay this way for three weeks, then I go back to him. He was annoyed with me and said \"Be smart, don't let it pop out of place again.\"  Anyways I was wondering what can be done to fix this problem.?I figure physiotherapy will help strengthen that loose tendon?   By the way the doctor I saw is a sports medicine doctor at a walk in clinic, not an orthopaedic.\n\n",

    "content": "Update...  Since my last post there has been a change with my finger/hand. I get a buzzing sensation in the palm of my hand below my pinky and ring finger.  Back in April 2006 I had surgery on my left elbow for ulnar nerve compression, they found alot of scar tissue. Prior to this surgery I experienced the same buzzing sensation in my hand but was told this is normal due to the ulnar nerve being compressed. After surgery, buzzing was relieved or better.  Now since this latest partial dislocation that buzzing has come back in my hand. I am wondering if the partial dislocation disrupted the ulnar nerve? I understand the ulnar nerve runs up into your hand and pinky finger. Or could there be scar tissue in my finger pressing down?  I go back to see the doctor (non specialist) in about 10 days. Last time I was in, about 2 weeks ago, buzzing sensation wasn't around. It started maybe 4 days after I saw him. He just said I have a loose tendon on the right side of my pinky finger, facing the ring finger.  Any ideas of what is going on? Wondering if physio would help strengthen the tendon? Someone told me that tendons cannot be strengthened? Thanks for your help!\n\n",

    "content": "A little over a month ago I broke my pinky toe (or so i assumed) since it was the pinky toe I figured I didn't need to go to the hospital, to just ice the area, elevate it and buddy tape the toes. After a month went by the toe was still swollen, bruised and painful (it was also still twisted 90 degrees to the left). so i decided to see a doctor. He diagnosed it has fractured and that it was fractured down the bone as well as across and went into my joint. I was told my options were a cast, a flat soled shoe or surgery to place a pin in my toe. I chose the flat soled shoe but am starting to rethink my choice. could you explain my options further? What is the length of time the cast needs to be kept on? how flexible is it? which is the best choice for healing? any idea the general cost of the surgery? (i do have cigna health insurance) any information you could give me would be great!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi jbertz23, Fractures are difficult to heal unless there is stabilization to the affected area. When there is a lack of stabilization the opportunity for shifting of bone occurs. Typically the shoe is not flexible and can be removed for showering etc. A cast, generally speaking, is placed for 4-6 weeks. The cost for surgery would depend on the physician and outpatient procedure department of your area hospital. Inquire with your insurance company as to their general coverage for such procedures. Best wishes. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

In MRI negative individuals, inflammation of the sacroiliac joint is suspected and special tests and maneuvers can help in the diagnosis.  - Herniated disk, in which the inter-vertebral disc press on the nerves & other spinal disorders should be excluded.

    "content": "Hello there,  Your symptoms may be the result of two conditions. First of all, you mention that you have injured your ribs twice in the past year, but you did not mention whether this was before the start of the pain, or after. It would also be useful if you could provide us with a more accurate timescale from the onset of the injuries to the development of the pain if it preceded it. An important first step would be to see your family practitioner and with his advice, organise a chest x-ray to have a look at the ribs. If they had been fractured and failed to heal, or healed in the wrong position (mal-union), then this would be obvious to the trained eye. If they are in the process of healing, then an area of new bone formation or 'callus' would be visible on the x-ray, also detectable to the trained eye. However, unless the fracture, if one occurred, was in the recent past it would be unlikely to cause ongoing pain as you have described.  The other more likely possibility, therefore, that may explain your pain is a condition called costochondritis. This is an inflammatory process of the costochondral junction, which is the intersection between the ribs and the cartilage at the end of the ribs attached to the sternum (breast bone). It is a condition that affects women more often than men and is benign in nature and self-limiting. Interestingly, although its origin is unknown, a description of a traumatic injury usually accompanies the story of the pain. A useful and  diagnostic test would be to try and elicit tenderness over the site by pressing on the anatomical area described earlier. Tenderness over the costochondral joints is almost always found in costocondritis. If you are unsure where to touch, consult an anatomical diagram which can be found on the web. It would be sensible to also undertake some basic blood tests to ensure no underlying infectious or chronic inflammatory process is taking place and if symptoms worsen or change,  then an ECG tracing of your heart to exclude a cardiac cause, which is very unlikely, is indicated.  If, as I suspect, this condition is the cause of your pain, treatment is simple and involves pain control and anti-inflammatory medication. Most people recover and are pain-free within a year. I advise you to confirm everything with your doctor before self-diagnosing.  Kind regards,  Dr Tino Solomon BSc(Hons) MBBS Senior House Officer in Surgery[/b]\n\n",

    "content": "Hello there,  The first point to remember and to put your mind at rest is that your consultant will be acting in the best interest of your child and, being an orthopaedic surgeon, is the most qualified to advise on the method of treatment. You should have faith in him as he will have seen thousands of cases like your son's condition. From my experience in orthopaedics and from formal training that we undergo, a fibula fracture is treated conservatively unless in specific situations such as when it is fractured in many pieces, when it can be repositioned and held with a metal plate or nail. In young children, bones tend to be more malleable than adults and thus bend more especially when under stress. The fracture itself may have been a 'greenstick' fracture, where one side of the fracture has broken and one side is bent; therefore it is classified as an incomplete break. The name comes from the analogy of breaking a young, fresh tree branch. The broken branch snaps on one side while the inner side is bent, and still in continuity. A nancy nail is an \u2018intramedullary\u2019 (through the canal of the bone) nail which gives the bone stability, but can itself also bend.   Most fractures, whether in the acute or chronic phase are managed based on angulation and/or displacement. The angle that a fragment of broken bone is, in relation to its other previously joined part, determines when fixation is needed. However, if fixation has taken place, this may need to be corrected or revised. This is a very complicated and controversial area which I will not go into, simply because I am neither qualified in the field nor do I have the experience to do so. You part is simply to maintain follow-up and if you notice any obvious change in the shape of your child's leg or he finds walking more difficult, then book an urgent appointment to see your surgeon or GP who will arrange a repeat X-ray. You are in good hands, so try not to worry!  Regards,  Dr Tino Solomon BSc(Hons) MBBS Senior House Officer in Surgery\n\n",

    "title": "Flail chest",
    "content": "Hello  there,  'Flail chest' is often treated conservatively, provided no complications arise as a direct or indirect result of injury. Conservative treatment essentially entails adequate pain control and oxygenation because  normal breathing patterns may  be  disrupted. If the subject cannot adequately ventilate himself,  then invasive ventilation may be required. This scenario is more likely in multiple rib fractures and fractures that involve injuries to underlying structures. The ribs are normally allowed to heal on their own and rarely is  surgery required. A later complication  that  can occur after any trauma is an  Acute Respiratory  Distress Syndrome (ARDS) which is a condition that is diagnosed using technical and invasive investigations and requires advanced ventilation procedures in an intensive care setting to manage, all of which I doubt would have been  available in the middle  ages!   It would therefore be safe and plausible to write into your story a natural healing method as the mode of treatment.   Dr Tino Solomon MB BS  BSc(Hons) Senior House Officer in Surgery\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I am a female 26 years old, my birthday is this month, so I will be 27. My question relates to my hip, but I do need to give some history. In August of 2003 I was in a serious car accident that left me with two severly comminuted fractures, one of my left elbow, and one of my right wrist. I also had a dislocated left hip. I as well suffered a mild traumatic brain injury. None the less my question is about my hip. I have had an MRI on it that showed nothing remarkable except excess fluid on my hip. My orthopedic surgeon would not comment on it. I do not know what this means. But I am in pain. My hip is consistently sore, at first it started being in pain intermittedly with no ryme or reason, but now it has gotten to the point where I must move every so often because of the discomfort level. I work in an office and am at a computer most of the day. Every once in a while it feels as though my hip despereatly needs to be cracked but just won't. And sometimes when it does crack it feels like heaven. It has recently started to hurt that side of my hip when I evacute my bowels, and I am concerend that this is of greater importance than what my surgeon feels. I am worried about avascular necrosis and osteoarthritis. What could possibly cause excess fluid on my hip? and what do my symptoms mean? I would appreciate any opinions on the matter, thank you for taking the time to read my email. This is a wonderful thing you lovely peoiple are doing.\n\n",

    "title": "Strange muscular/rib/back pain",
    "content": "Hi  About a week and a half ago I started to have digestive issues, it made a tensing, cramping, sensation on my sides, mostly the right side. Shortly afterwards (few days) I started to develop back pain. The pain would shift from low back, to mid back, to upper back. The pain would sometimes be a dull ache, a throbbing, and sometimes a burning sensation along areas of my spine. Tha pain is not unbearable but rather annoying and still there although my digestive issues have since subsided.   Eventually other bones started to seem affacted, starting about 3 days ago. I got a fairly bad stiff neck which has subsided somewhat, but after getting it I can hear click/grinding noise when I turn my head...but it doesn't hurt to turn.  The next day I noticed that when I pressed  gently on my ribs, especially the lower ones, they too make a noise, slight click/crackly sound. It doesn't hurt to do this although the areas are tender to the touch (possibly from me pressing on them)...it does NOT hurt to breathe though, even deeply.  I bought a back brace which is helping with the back pain, but I am concerned about all the bones affected and why my ribs would make noise. Does this sound like a serious problem or something that will heal on its own? If I need to see a doctor what type of doctor is qualified? Orthopedics? Please help, I'm getting more concerned everyday.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear elley0531,  The symptoms you have described are very suggestive of viral infection and muscle pain and spasm.  Muscle spasm is a body reaction to injury in tissues Causes of muscle injury include: Muscle fatigue  Heavy exercise  Flu Metabolic abnormalities like low Magnesium level and Hypocalcemia Hypoparathyroidism  The correct diagnosis is easier when other symptoms exist. In your condition, Viral infection and an associated muscle pain and spasm are more likely to be the cause. The GI problems that came first are probably a form of gastroenteritis which is mostly of viral origin.  Self care and avoiding the precipitating cause will lead to a gradual but clear improvement in the pain. Home treatment includes the use of analgesics, cold or hot therapy. Rest for maximum two days is also beneficial.  I advise you to follow up with your doctor. Complete history and physical examination, are essential for correct diagnosis.   Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Freedom57,   Pelvic fracture commonly results from blunt trauma and is usually complicated by severe bleeding due to trauma of the major pelvic vessels.   Pelvic fracture can be silent but more often presents with tenderness, crepitance, or hematomas.    Pelvic x-ray should be done for any suspicious case even if there are no signs of injury.  Orthopedic referral is essential with screening for any vessel or urological injury.  If you feel any pain, tenderness, any limitation of movement  or urological symptoms, you should consult your doctor for proper medical care.  Best regards,\n\n",

I've been splinted for the last 5 weeks and yesterday my doctor tested it and I cannot bring the end of the finger up on my own. He's keeping me in a splint for another 3 weeks but said that if its still drooping a lot then, we may have to consider surgery. I'm not sure I want to go that route as I don't need fine movement with that finger, since I don't have an occupation that requires it. If its then just mostly for cosmetic reasons I would rather not have surgery. Are there any long-term  complications to the finger as a whole if I don't opt for surgery?  Hilts\n\n",

Specific care must be taken not to remove the splint except of course for washing the finger being sure that the area is not permitted to bend because allowing this essentially starts you back at the beginning of treatment. Although there are complications related to surgical treatment, ie, infection, disruption of vascular flow, etc., I am not aware of specific complications with more conservative treatment.

I had a medial reefing, Lateral release and exstensor realignment to correct the problem.  It worked for about 8 months and then the problem started again.  I had a second surgury in Jan 2002 and I have not had any major problems since.  I do have occasional pain from cartilage loss but that is about all.  Last weel I fell on the ice and I landed on my right knee.  Actually I landed with my rearend on my right foot with my knee and leg bent and under me.  I initially felt a small pop, not loud or painful, but I could not put weight on it.  In a few minutes I was able to walk on it, but with pain.  Since that time the pain has persisted and at times it is bad.  The pain is not located where my first injury was, but on the outside of my knee below the joint.  There is no swelling or discoloration.  My knee also does not seem to be unstable.  I have been walking and moving with pain but no other issues.  Do you have any idea what this could be?\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 29 year old female and for the last 6 months or so I have had a popping feeling on my lower left side. I think it is my rib because the popping happens if I push on the very edge of one of my lower ribs. Also if I bend to the side or sit down with my body slightly turned to that side I will get a popping sensation. When it pops in it take my breath away and then it will pop back out again. I thought if I do not touch that area it would go away but now it has been a couple months and it is still happening. It mostly happens when I am laying on my back. If I breathe deep it will push out and if I turn to my side it pops in. This does not happen on the other side of my body. I have never had any trauma to my ribs but I have had a child and I wonder if maybe that got my rib out of place. Any advice would be appreciated\n\n",

    "content": "Yesterday as I was sitting in the living room, there was a knock on the door. My Mom got up to get it, and told me to grab the dog so she could get out. I reached down as he went to run past and grabbed his harness, but him not slowing down cracked my arm behind me bending my elbow backwards, causing quite a bit of pain. Once I got over the initial pain, I was fine. I could bend it fine, but noticed 5 minutes later that the whole elbow was already getting a bruise all the way across it, and the tingling numb feeling I had in it going all the way down into my fingers lasted about an  hour to an hour and a half. After that it was okay though...achey, but fine.  I woke up this morning after having slept on that side, with my arm under me and my lower arm is in a constant state of being asleep. I don't really want to go get an x-ray unless totally necessary, since I just got all my medical bills all paid off, but it doesn't sound to me like a break anyway. Could this be a sprain? Nothing to worry about at all? Or maybe something more serious that I should get checked out afterall?\n\n",

I even had some new painkillers prescribed and those don't even do anything..i had knee pain all through the healing months, but never as bad as it is now. Is this normal? Also, my doctor says i had a delayed nonunion, that was back in January...and he also told me that my knee pain could be from my top screw that had apparently moved a bit, like it got loosend up. He said this was fine and just to leave it...i had an xray done last week and the on duty doctor there said it was still nonunion.   I've even been using this ultrasound machine since january...but i guess its not helping and it seems the screw has moved a little more. Does anyone know how long you need to wait until the doctors asses whether or not a bone graft may be needed or what can be done to help the knee pain?  So far its been around 18 weeks and the bone still hasnt healed.\n\n",

    "content": "Just because the ankle does not swell does not mean it is not injured. An injury that is left untreated may not heal properly, and can cause a lot of pain and other problems for years to come. A parent that refuses to take a child to the doctor when the child is in need of medical care is concidered neglect. The mother of this child should not need to \"convince\" her husband to be allowed to take her child to the doctor. If they have insurance and money is not an issue,. then why doesn't he want to take his daughter to the doctor? I am sure she is in pain, I do not understand why the father wouldn't want to help his daughter? Tell the husband that even a sprained ankle needs to be treated by a doctor for the proper treatment to promote healing,.and that swelling does not always indicate an injury, and that if she is inujured without proper treatment she would be at risk to have lifelong pain and trouble with the ankle not healing properly. A mother should not need to prove to anyone why a child needs to be seen by a doctor.\n\n",

    "content": "my son 10 yr old son took off his shoe and stomped his foot as hard as he could on the ice 2 days ago just to see what might happen. (stupid thing to do). he has since been limping and whining in pain and at times actually in tears. the pain is in his heel more toward the inside of the foot. I took him to his pcp and they ordered and x-ray only to tell me that his pinky toe is fractured. now I was told to tape it to the toe next to it.I pulled the toes out to tape them and he had no pain.I am baffled as is he. he is insisting that his toe is fine. the pain is in the back of the foot on the other side. as a matter of fact, for the last 2 days, he has been walking ON his toes to avoid putting weight anywhere near the heel. any thoughts on why the dx is so different from what he is feeling. he is seeing ortho on Tues.\n\n",

The pain he is experiencing in is heel may be significantly worse than in his toe (essentially over-riding), if that makes sense.

    "content": "HI  I was getting into a car  last Thursday evening and my right leg just gave way and i heard a loud crunching snapping sounds. The paramedic came before an ambulance as i could not move and the pain was so intense. The paramedic said it was my knee had come out of it's socket and after trying 3 times he managed to get my knee back in places it kept coming back out. I had Xray and was told it was all ok but needed to go to the fracture clinic the following day. Anyway i have not been back since because i was got the flue and thought it would just mend itself. My knee at present is swollen more now like a balloon than when i first did it 7 days ago and my thigh and foot have also started to swell.I can't put my leg fully on the ground as it hurts to much and my leg is bent and seems stuck in a locked position as i can only bend it so much and just taking pain meds all the time for it.   I was looking for a place to attach a picture to show how swollen but can't see one...anyway I was planning to go to get it seen at the fracture clinic this coming monday but how it looks now thought i would ask for advice if i need it seen to sooner. Thank you   Rob\n\n",

The other ankle (right) wasn't really assessed, and now it is especially sore. I am wondering if it is because I am using it more to take the weight off the other foot? Also, the right leg (calf) is very swollen and my quad is quite painful in certain areas. I have pain in specific areas of my torso and my hips and knees are very sore as well. Is this normal for high impact falls? Should I have my other leg xrayed or should I just ice and wait a bit?  Thanks...\n\n",

It resulted in having been admitted to the ER where upon arrival it was determined that he had fractured to consecutive ribs on his left side. Upon determinig this they also diagnosis him with having excess fluids in his chest cavity. They proceded to tap his side with a tube and exctracted with in an hour and a half time a liter that was 90% blood. After 5 days in the hospital he was released. 4 out of those 5 days they kept the tube in him for drainage through that time he only had a half a liter more of fluid drained. Two weeks have pasted and upon a follow up exam they have readmitted him into the hospital. Apprently he has built up fluids again in his chest cavity and now they plan to surgically do a scope tomorrow morning to discover where or why he is bleeding. My question is what possibly could he bleeding from?\n\n",

That wasn't the cause of my lower back pain, but it did explain why I experienced pain during certain activities such as sit-ups, lying on flat surfaces and raising into a sitting position. He said that a non invasive surgery could be done to straighten the bone into its correct position, but that it wasn't really necessary. Should I just deal with the pain during these activities, or will repositioning the tailbone actually get rid of the pain?\n\n",

At the time I did it there was hardly any brusing although my right hand was swollen.  My question is can I get this simply crunched back into place? I assume they will want to take x-rays etc. My hand works fine although when I do some tasks I do have discomfort. One task is using a rolling pin on a ball of dough - placing my hands on top of the rolling pin (not using handles) & as I roll the pin over my bung knucle it hurts a bit & is really uncomfortable.  Is it worth getting this fixed? Can something go wrong trying to fix it? Is it brocken? How much will it cost (Australia)?  Sorry for all the questions & I really really apreciate your help. I don't have much money & that is why I am asking here - I can not afford the doctor consultation & the public hospital would most likely tell me to go away.  Thanks again - sam.\n\n",

    "title": "Post Surgery (of broken tibia, fibula) - can you help??",
    "content": "I am a 45yr old female who recently had my first bone break when my footing found a hole in a footpath resulting in right ankle dislocation, both the tib and fib fracturing as well as the tib & fib fracturing apart where it joins near the ankle/foot. I acquired 2xplates and a pin during surgery.  I broke my leg on 28th July,2005.  Not having experienced anything like this and having not been given any \"what to expect\" post op education I have a couple of questions I hope you can answer. Firstly,what levels of pain should one experience and or/how long should this continue - ie - should I be finding improvement eg. every few days?  If so, I haven't noticed any yet. I currently take pain killers all day long otherwise I find my pain grows to 8-10  levels (out of 1 - 10) I currently take Panadeine 15x 2 tabs at night and take one with a paracetamol during the day if regular pain killers don't suffice.  I find Paracetemol 500mg x2 tabs on its own only give me approx. 1 1/2-2hrs pain relief.  I've also tried x2 Nurofen caplets which give a little longer relief. My pain is mostly ankle to ankle and above the heal. When aching I have considerable discomfort being unable to rest the leg on a pillow, the bed whatever without piercing/tearing kind of pain and  it is not unusual for me to take 1-2hrs trying to get around this before being able to sleep.  I feel weeping but last check there appeared to be no infection.  I also get what feels like skin/muscle shudders in the calf area.  Spend most of day with leg up but when it is put down can't leave it down long without discomfort, some swelling, tingling and toe colours are darker then good foot.  Is this all natural?  what should I be expecting /time frames? I know everyone is different  but I thought by now I should be starting to feel improvements???  Your thoughts please??  My next appointment with the fracture clinic isn't for 4weeks when the cast comes off and xrays will be taken. Thankyou. Sorry this was so long.\n\n",

All I can say is give it time and be patient, it could be MANY months before you could be considered 'pain free'.  The doctors are going to tell you that pain is normal, and that you're simply going to have to live with it. They can't/won't prescribe enough to make you 'pain free'. You are expected to tolerate as MUCH pain as possible and with the lowest possible doses and strengths of pain medication.\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for replying Pentagon.  Well I wasn't expecting to be totally pain free - I did have multi breaks etc but I was hoping to have been given some kind an idea of what \"Pattern of events\" I could expect in the process of healing.  Needless to say my concerns were not in vain. Pain fluctuated but mostly increased not decreased each week and my foot colour was still always horrible, yet I still got no results/or given much of a second thought to.  Finally 16 weeks of geing mucked about,  I was booked in to  remove the pin and at pre-admission I again told the doctor what I had been experiencing - hoping to fall on an ear who might listen.    They sent me for an ultrasound and we discovered x4 DVTS - of course this meant surgery was now cancelled as well.  The discovery was the Wednesday.  On the Sunday morning I had a Pulmonary Embolism - went into the lungs.  Doctor said I am lucky to be here today - if it had been a little bigger it may have been a different story..  That was mid October.  I am now scheduled to have the pin removed in two weeks time under local anaesthetic because the anaethetist won't give a general for at least 6 months because of the PE.  So my concerns weren't all in vain.  Unfortunately they kept getting discarded mostly because there was no evidence of swelling of the calf.  Earlier scanning / detection on their part would not have hurt though and may have prevented the worsening condition or  the PE.  Hopefully there is light at the tunnel now and with no further complications - ambulation in sight.  No more hopping on one leg...Yay!!!\n\n",

It does get better but it takes time. Give it a while longer and see how you are doing. As for the 'round bone' seeming to be different than the other wrist, it may very well be something that you have always had and never had reason to notice before or dependent on the type of fracture and how and if the bones had to be 'set' it may be new.

    "content": "Hi,  I accidentally slammed my pinky finger in a door a few weeks ago- it slipped between the hinges of a swinging door and slammed on the bone between my middle and bottom knuckes.  It was very swollen and bruised for a few days afterwards, but because it was not at askew or incredibly painful to move, I did not seek medical help.  I iced it and tried to keep from putting pressure on it.  After a few days, the swelling went down a bit and the bruising subsided.  However about two weeks later, it began to hurt again and swelled up all over again. Bruising appeared and then disappeared in the course of three days.    Now I have a hard mass on my bone, it appears that the swelling has not gone away, but rather massed into some sort of scar tissue (?).  It is a hard bump that lays on my bone and will not go down.  I can move my finger without pain, though if I strain it it definately still hurts.  Bruising seems to appear and disappear almost daily.  I am concerned about this bump- could it be tat I am growing some sort of scar tissue or that it is seriously damaged and getting worse?  I am content to let it go away on its own, but if it is getting worse I should certainly seek help.  Please advise, thank you so much for your help!\n\n",

    "content": "My rib feels bruised to the touch at the center right  middle front side. It hurts to breathe,at the end of a deep inhale, not so much anymore(been a week). I had done some serious drilling where I had used my chest to press down repeatedly for a total of 6 hours over 3 days. I noticed the pain the day after my last 3 hour stint.  The 2nd day after finishing I didn't feel any pain. My concern that it wasn't just muscle soreness started the 3rd day when I had pain breathing after deep breathes all day. Thinking it was just muscle pain, I played volleyball(serious/real volleyball) at the end of the 3rd day. The pain became more severe throughout the playing time. I couldn't stop, because i'm a freak. That night I had difficulty laying flat on my back, because the right side hurt when I laid down. I also noticed the breathing pain at the end of every bigger, full breath. The pain subsided a little more each day, came back a little more day 6, played vball 7th night, played again 10th night (today), and here I am. The pain is still there at the end of deep breathes, dull though. Sneezes still mess me up the worst. Painful to the touch, tender bruised feeling, no discoloring on my rib, just below right nipple. Really difficult to spike ball tonight, had to swing at 20-35% with right arm. Oh yeah, I'm between jobs and refuse to see a doc, due to insurance. Oddly enough I'm against universal healthcare.

The pain seems mechanical, (movement hurts), and related to your chest wall (you can find a tender spot which is giving you trouble).  Where you seem to localise the pain is related to the intercostal muscles and moves with breathing, and particaularly violently when sneezing.  Several of the muscles that move your shoulder (Pecs, lats) attach to you chest wall, hence you difficulty spiking the ball...  It is possibly muscular, traumatic costochondritis, might even be a cracked rib... treatment is the same.  Painkillers and rest.   If playing basket ball hurts... stop for a while, if sneezing hurts avoid pepper, and if breathing hurts... hmmm... that might be tricky...  Saif\n\n",

I happened because I was overzealous with the intentions to get back into an exercise routine, as I had fallen out of the habit for the last few years.  I decided to work hard and do my old routine I used to do some years back regularly.  Part of what I did was 300 sit-ups. (Three types, 100 each.) The last ones were the upper abdomen type where you twist to touch the opposite knee. The next day I woke up with intense pain and could hardly sit up. Bending or moving in anyway was extremely painful. Walking even hurt, just from the movement.  Reaching for anything with my arm is excruiciating. Breathing hurt. I couldn't get a deep breath. I could only sleep on my back and had to have my back on higher pillows because breathing was harder.  Any other position was impossible.  Coughing or sneezing very painful.  Sharp pains in my left chest side and even felt sounded like popping noise when I moved slightly.  After  4 days, on the 5th day I went to a doctor.  (Concerned I may have a rib out.)  X-rays were done and I was told there was no fracture or rib out. That it was intercostsal muscle strain.  That was Monday.  It is now Saturday morning and I am still in pain, though it has slightly decreased. Also, I am now able to turn a little and not sleep flat on my back. Before, that was impossible.  I still am having continual pain in my left chest.  Front and side.  How long will this take to go away?  How long should I wait before I attempt exercising again? Particularly sit-ups?\n\n",

    "content": "I am glad I found this place. This morning I woke up and felt like I had bruised my chest. There was no mark so I figured I slept weird. Throughout the day at work it hurt real bad. Sneezes were the worst. If I take a halfway deep breath it hurts....if I move certain ways it hurts, and it hurts to touch, right around my right nipple. I saw the post similar to this and it was suggested to be muscle strain or even a bruised rib.... but I did nothing yesterday or this morning to bring this on. I did just move but that was 2 weeks ago now. I literally woke up this morning hurting this bad. Could I have done it sleeping? I switched beds at 6am (girlfriend up for work) and was woken up anhour early by my phone going off. I don't remember straining or doing anything odd. Any help?\n\n",

I think I am just now ready to do that.  It has improved greatly, especially recently.  Through the summer, when I started trying sit-ups again, the pain would start back.  It seems to be much better, though I feel soreness if I strain there at all.  I know it can only get better as long as I don't overdo it.  I will take it easy for awhile and go gradually.  Just wanted to bring an update, since you asked.   By the way, glad you figured out what caused your pain. I will say that soaking in a tub of warm water with Epsom salts is wonderfully soothing.\n\n",

    "content": "I was diagnosed with a broken foot a few years ago but treatment was not performed because it did not bother me at the time.  Now my foot throbs constantly and is quite painful.  The injury occured while I was playing baseball.  I was a pitcher and had a ball hit back at me right off the outer part of my right foot.  The pain is in the middle part of the outer portion of my foot if you are looking down at it.  Also, you can see the bone in this area sticking out a little bit as compared to my other foot--kinda in a triangular shape.    My question is, now that I have walked around and exercised, etc., with this injury for several years, have I done permanent damage to my foot?  Will surgery be required to fix this?  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "I have a fractured 5th finger ( lower part of finger towards hand)- hairline/crack fracture.  The doctor put a metal type splint, soft padding on the inside. Splint is bendable, goes underneath and overtop of finge, extends approximately inch and half below knuckle.. Buddy taped to next finger and taped around bottom half of hand. Splint is holding finger straight.  I go back in about 10 days for followup. Splint has been on for about 5 days. Doctor estimated about 3 weeks to heal. Anyways I have heard that sometimes your finger can go quite stiff after a fracture. Last night I had a bath and took the splint off, know how to put it back on. I noticed it felt quite stiff and let it soak in the warm water, but did not move it around.  Is it normal to be this stiff? I am assuming from the splint keeping it straight, is the reason why?\n\n",

Not aware of the fracture yet, even though this isn't in the area where I had surgery. One more question... when the doctor asked me to make a full fist, pinky finger would not bend all the way down and seemed to turn inward  towards ring finger, rotation.? Even though I have a crack/hairline fracture, is it normal for your finger to rotate slightly inwards? I figured if I had a complete break or worse it would do this.\n\n",

    "content": "Forgot to add...  I think why I waited to see medical help is because of what happened to me.  Someone told me that many 5th finger fractures are called boxer fractures. Boxer fracture can be caused by punching someone or a wall? I know the doctor at the clinic asked if I punched a wall, told him no, and briefly  said what my ex did.  The assault happened so fast and I tried to fight back, most of it is a blur. the fully story is that he punched me and knocked me out briefly. Out for a short time, came to and he was hitting at my arm with hammer. I may have punched back in defense or the hammer hit my finger..  So part of me feels sort of stupid, if I did hit back with my left hand where I had surgery, but at the time I wasn't thinking that way. I was trying to prevent him from hurting me more.  Maybe I am worried about being blamed for my injury.  I see the surgeon in 8-9 days. I guess I will tell him the above.\n\n",

A med student? came into the room shortly after I told the surgeon what happened to my finger. I had some other concernsphysically and about some of the abuse on paper, and didn't really want a total stranger listenening in. I looked at him a couple of times, and I guess he sensed something, mumbled to surgeon and left the room.

Now, my heel is all right, but the ball of my foot is swollen and quite painful to walk on. The pain isn't quite on the bone, but at the joint beneath the ball'ish bone beneath my large toe (don't know the name for it, maybe sesamoid?). Could this possibly be a stress fracture or just a terribly sore joint? I've never broken or fractured a bone and am unsure how it feels.   I've been keeping ice on it, taking ibuprophen, and am unsure if I should see a doctor.  Thank you in advance.\n\n",

    "content": "Hullo there, Downsbs,  Sorry to hear about you plight, hope that the steel door is ok .  It is impossible to say from your description whether there is a bony injury or not for definite.  It is certainly very difficult to determine this without examining you clinically.  You have some pain at a time by which most injuries will have healed, but you do suggest you get this with reasonably strenuous activity.  It is not uncommon to break something with a punch. Usualy it is the 5th Metacarpal, the bone in your hand that is connected to your pinky, but other injuries are possible. Most (but not all) boy injuries heal by about 4-6 weeks.   You describe the pain being in your wrist rather than your hand. the location is important, as is the triggering factor for the pain.    BONY INJURIES Pain at the part of your wrist near the base of your thumb metacarpal (the bone in your hand connected to your thumb, can be associated with injuries to the scaphoid, or radial styloid. Both may take some time to heal, and sometimes do not heal.  If there is is tenderness in the the little pit at the back of your hand near the thumb (called the \"anatomical snuffbox\") it suggests that one of these injuries are possible, and one should be investigated for this.  If the pain is more toward the \"ulnar\" side of the hand (the side of the hand one might give a karate chop with), then a punching action may cause  a fracture of the 5th metacarpal.  seeing as you describe the pain being at your wrist, the possiblitility of fracturing this at the base exists.  You may notice a discrepancy in the shape of your hand, even after 6 weeks, and a prominence and pain  here at this late stage may possibly indicate a fracture. A fracture of the radius can occur, but usually this is so painful that you attend the ER early. These usually heal well by six weeks.  A type of fracture that is sometimes missed, the die punch fracture, where only a small part of the end of the radius is broken,  as it usually involves the joint surface, you may get pain even if the fracture unites. Minor bony injuris can occur elsewherein the wrist...but tese hopefully will cover most possibilities.  SOFT TISSUE INJURIES These are also common.  the pain seemes to be often more diffuse, and difficult tonpin point.  Pain is usually aggravate by pulling or stretching, as opposed to bony injuries where compression increases pain.  Unusual causes of sustained pain are damage to to the triangular fibrocartilage...soemtimes associated with a clicking in your wrsit with twisting maneouvres.  The possibilities are endless...the way I would manage this in your case (6 weeks from the injury) is be guided by the overall trend rather than disocomfort at a particular point.  if things are not improving then seek clinical advice; that isbthe only way to really distinguish the various possibilities...even then things are not always clear cut....

    "content": "Hi there KK1,  Intersting little lump there.  it is difficult to give a definitive diagnosis based on what you have said, but it is unlikley to be related to a \"broken knuckle\".  It seems too mobile to be the case, and although you mention an injury, it appears perhaps from what you say, something you noticed without directly relating it to the injury.  A hard mobile lump may represent a ganglion.  One that moves when make a fist may represent a nodule on one of the tendons in this area.  This probably is the most likely diagnosis, although as I say it is tricky to be definite on-line.  I would suggest though that if it remains tender it would be a good idea to have it examined by a surgeon.  More that likely, nothing needs to be done. If the lump is in the palm, then there is a potentia for triggering to develop...when your finger appears to get stuck.  this would require a simple surgical procedure.  Saif.\n\n",

The fact that you are improving and have no breathing difficulties implies no lung injury. However, even if a rib is fractured, you would still be able to walk around because the other ribs in the rib cage act as support.  A gross swelling at the point of impact implies a fracture, but radiological survey is necessary for confirmation and reassurance. Basic treatment involves managing the pain, just as your doctor has prescribed.   Dr Anthony Solomon Consultant Physician, Tropical & Genitourinary Medicine\n\n",

I am concerned about the intense coughing, you need to see a doctor, and also ask him if you can take antiinflammatories for your rib pain.  You probably have slightly damaged some cartiledge between the ribs, (costochondritis)  it will heal in time.  Either way, have a doctor look at you for both problems, don't let a cough like that go, especially with your history of pneumonia.\n\n",

    "content": "I was running barefoot up my stairs 1.5 months ago when I slipped and my toe slammed into the steps.  Since it has swollen up and has lost feeling in part of it.  I have also lost movement in it.  I cannot bend it downward, but I can bend it upward with a little pain.  It is very painfull.  I need to work and can't afford days off, but it is very difficult and painfull to walk on.   On the X-ray, it doesn't look broken.  I have had three different sets of X-rays taken since this happened a month and a half ago.  The doctors can't make any sense of it.  They have ordered an MRI to be done next week.  It hasn't healed at all in all this time.  I am extremely worried about it.  It feels rough and dry where the swelling has occured.  The swelling is directly under my joint closest to the toe nail of my right big (great) toe.  That is where the pain is coming from also.  The numbness also starts right there and continues to be numb to the end of my toe and on the left side by my toe nail on top, but not on the right side.  I have tried to bend this toe downward with my hand also, but it is stiff and doesn't want to bend.  This causes pain and only moves it about 30-40 percent.  What is wrong with it.  Please help me.  I want it to be normal again!  Thank you.[/b]\n\n",

Sincerely, Rntdj  Thank you for your help.  It is really appreciated!  But I have been going to the orthapedic specialist every week for almost two months now and they haven't found anything.  I have three different sets of X-rays at different angles, all taken on different dates, starting when the accident happened two months ago  to just a week ago and none show a fracture.  Also, where it is swelled up, that is where it starts to go numb.  This is directly under the knuckle that is closest to the toe nail.  I cannot bend it downward, and it's extremely sore.  It is very difficult to walk on and I cannot put any weight on the toe.  It is extremely weak if I try to bend it down using my toe muscles.  Also, when I try to bend it down using my toe muscles, I can only get a little wiggle out of it, about a centimeter or two, but no real movement downward other than that.  Do you have any other ideas what it could be?  The upper tendon seems to have tightened up a great deal and pulling up on the toe a little, but it doesn't look raised as if I completely tore the lower tendon or anything.  I have been bending the toe downward a little to stretch the upper tendon a little.  Should I continue to do this?  Should I tape it down at night when I sleep,  so the lower tendon is not being stretched more to alow it to heal if it's ripped.  Also, I am taking IBU 800 for pain and swelling, but swelling doesn't seem to be going down any.  Thanks for all your help so far.\n\n",

    "content": "To add to the last post I just left above...  I was wondering how many tendons are on the bottom of the big toe.  The reason I am wondering is because even though my bottom tendon that holds the sesamoid bone is supposedly broken, my toe is still not rising up in the air. (being pulled up by the upper one) and I can still wiggle it just a little with very little strength.   Are there more than one tendon that could be holding my toe down, or is this doctor crazy and my tendon is still somewhat intact?  I was also wondering just how this sesamoid bone is attached to the tendon, and if it is attached to the tendon still, wouldn't that bone be keeping the tendon from drawing back up into my foot, or would it just pull through the sesamoid bone?  I am so confused.  I need a human great toe anatomy lesson!   Maybe I should quit my job as an electronics technician/programmer and spend the rest of my life going to school to become a doctor.  LOL  JK  But seriously, why in the world with as much as they make (doctors) and all the schooling they have, can't they figure this out?  Where is our technology really at?  My doc is trying to impress me with the fact he knows the scientific names of all my body parts, but I want to be impressed with a proper diagnosis and to see some technology put to use to fix a simple problem like a stubbed toe.  C'mon, it's been how many months now and I am just where I started, maybe even worse since my tendon may have pulled up into my foot and now I may be stuck like this forever!  If they cannot fix a tendon in a toe, can I trust them with a vital organ such as my heart?   Guess at that point I wouldn't have much choice really anyway.  Can you understand my frustration?  I need some really professional advice!\n\n",

If they failed to diagnose...then you should go to an expert in Hand/foot surgery ...not to any regular ortho doctor ...he should open it up and explore it with a small incision...that's why i advice you to go to a hand/foot ortho surgeon because he'd be knowing EXACTLY what he's doing and the effect of every incision on your toe's mobility after the operation.

While playing with my toe, I realized that I still cannot physically bend my toe using my hand.  While trying to bend it, I feel a catch, like bones catching and grinding, and it just will not bend down at that lower joint nearest my toenail.  Even though the x-rays look good, could this be a mechanical problem with my joint or something, and not the tendon at all?  But why all the swelling and numbness?  I really hope this doctor that I am seeing is wrong and this isn't a tendon problem at all since the MRI said it was negative as well.  I am trusting in God to help me with this one.  It's really out of my hands.  I know there is a doctor or nurse on this forum that can give me some sound advice.  Like I said, this consumes me and I have to get past this one way or another.

I don't undertsnad why the doctor hasn't seen anything positive or that leads to a diagnosis. Well, may be there are a lot of adhesions and oedema(swelling)that are blocking the view?  You can search on google for orthopaedics doctors specialized in foot/hand surgery.....and since they can't figure out the exact defect by clinical examination and MRI...then the second choice would be explorational surgery to see the exact defect and probable repair.

The foot had healed fine but I was still experiencing a little pain. I think that was  because of my bones still trying to heal and develop better. Two years ago I was walking from my class to my car and my foot hurt so bad I could barely walk. The only way I could walk was on my heel. I had seen my doctor about it and he prescribed me some anti-inflammatory medicine. The x-ray showed no signs of arthritis. I was told later to change my shoes. I have done that and it improved but whenever I have the shoes for a while my foot hurts. I know I need to change shoes. But I am only twenty-two years old. Is there any possibilities that I could develop arthritis or something else in my foot as I get older.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Amanda,  Foot pains are fairly complicated I guess, and really need a thorough clinical examintaion to be sure of the diagnosis and management.  But I will try to help if I can.  I do not think your problem is due to \"arthritis\", although it is a coomon condition and if I said \"oh yes you will probably get arthritis in the future\", i would be right in most cases, whoever I spoke to.  You say that you have to walk on your heel.  Presumabaly it is the fore-foot that hurts in this case.  Sometimes such discomfort may arise fro having \"flat feet\", but a more common problem is metatarsalgia, though to be due to a weakened transverse arch.   The arches in you foot create a spring effect as you foot strikes the ground and absorb some of the shock of walking...at least that is the theory.  If the arches are flattened then the forces are less efficiently transferred.  Metatarsalgia sometimes makes you feel like you are \"walking on marbles\" and often there is a hardness of the skin over the balls of your feet.  This can be heped with a transverse arch support.  Morton's Neuroma is another cause of painful foot.  This causes shooting pain in the foot and a pair of toes.  The underlying problem is an irriation of a nerve in between two metatarsals.  This too may be helped with metatarsal arch supports.  Surgery may also help.  There are other causes, of course, but these will be something you can work on for now.  Finding the right pair of shoes seem to be the right thing to do, although these may not the ones that a fashioanble 22 year old lady would  be keen to wear all the time!  Regards  Saif\n\n",

    "content": "Dear ActressAngela,  Your rib pain could be due to: 1-Scar tissue like the doctor said....(muscular pain) 2-Scar tissue in the pleural membrane that covers the lung (very sensitive and rich with nerve supply)...so it can hurt whenever you take a deep breath..(unlikely to be your case) 3-Nerve injury pain...because nerves passing in the ribs cavity from the inside could have been injured (most probably) and it'll take a long time for them to heal.  As long as the pain is in the same area and is not shooting else where unusual than the pain you had after the fracture...then we shouldn't be worried ...it will just take a very long time to heal...  Just make sure that the X-rays shows your ribs have healed more or less in line...and not very much distorted.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "title": "Broken Tibia question?",
    "content": "21 days ago I was out in the desert approximately 3 hours away from the closest hospital. I broke my R Tibia approximately 2 inches below the joint.  It broke about 1/2 way through the bone then split vertically up to the top of the bone. I was able to find an old camera tripod in the back of my truck and made a splint out of the tripod legs securing it with duck tape.  When I finally got to a hospital, about 4 hours later the Dr; put my leg in a cast from my toes to my rear end.  After approximately 5 days I started getting \"Charlie Horses\" muscle pain in my calf. Being unable to move my knee or my foot this pain continued for about 6 hours until I couldn't take it anymore. I went to the E.R. and they promply cut the cast off.  Next day they put a new cast on. After 2 days the same thing happened and after about 8 hours I was in tears, and I DON'T CRY, EVER.  at 0300 I was back at the E.R. where they cut the second cast off telling me that the Cast Tech. was putting them on too tight.  I have not gone back to the Orthopedic Dr. since. I suspect they will just put another cast on and I'll end up back in the E.R. with that extreem pain.  I'm wondering what type of knee brace I should buy to support my leg while it heals?  I have been keeping it elevated and have never put any pressure on the leg.  That said, I feel I should have something on it as it's not completely healed. Can someone tell me what type of knee brace I should be looking for? Thanks in advance, ChiefBDT@earthlink.net\n\n",

The bruise went away and everything seemed fine, except when I clenched my hand into a fist there was some minor discomfort.  Anyway over the last two days, over my ring finger knuckle there seems to be a bluish round bubble (its blue and round-ish in shape)  and whenever I close my hand into a fist it feels uncomfortable, there is also some dull discomforting pain around the area when I pick up objects of even minor weight.  The blue round thing moves with the knuckle and its sensitive to the touch, and is definitly visible to the eye.  This may not be the best descripiton, but do u think I might have dislodged something (vein, bone, dislocated the knuckle)?  There is also pain in the metacarpal area on the back of my hand when pressure is applied.  Anyway help or suggestions would be nice.  I don't have insurance at the moment but whereever you point me to go I will do it.  Thanks.  --Dustin\n\n",

In the case of my index finger the break has gone right into the joint. My hand ballooned and I was therefore put in a cast which was only hard underneath. A week later this was removed and a new smaller (hand size instead of full arm) fully solid cast. I was given painkillers (co-dydramol) and anti inflammatories (diclofenac) which made me feel awful and 5 days after starting to take them I had a bad reaction (racing pulse, dizziness,dry mouth, blurred vision, swollen face and stomach pain) I therefore stopped taking them. My concern is that the swelling hasn't reduced at all. It's still very painful and my fingers are lke fat sausages. Is this normal and what cann I do to reduce the swelling? I've virtually not left my house since it happened and I've been sitting with my arm constantly raised.Help!! Incidentally could the reaction to the drugs have caused the severe pain in my kidney region that I have now?!\n\n",

It will take longer time for you this way and you'll never know if it was more than a bruise. it shouldn't be a fracture ofcourse or else you couldn't touch the floor from pain.  anyway,if you won't go to check it out...make sure to use local anti-inflammatory...use repeated and alternate warm and cold foments to increase the circulation in the injured area.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Hello everyone.  I was wondering if someone could help me.  The other day I looked at my abdomen and noticed that my ribcage on the right side of my body doesn't look exactly like my ribcage on the left side.  You can only notice it if I suck in my stomach, and then you see that on the left side, the bottom rib sticks out about half an inch on the left portion of my abdomen, where on the right side that portion of the complimentary rib tapers off around my body, and looks normal.  I don't remember ever having any trauma to my ribs, or ever experiencing any pain in that area.  I don't know what is going on, and whether or not this is serious, because it has never hurt.  When I was little I was always banged up somewhere on my body, but even then I don't remember my ribcage ever hurting.  I can recount the reason for every piece of visable scar tissue on my arms and legs - all from falling down playing street hockey and football, but not this.   I can really feel that left bottom rib's outgrowth, where the bottom rib on the right side is smooth and tapered to my body.  Thanks in advance for your time, Jas\n\n",

    "title": "\"Black Skin\" rot after a leg cast removal?",
    "content": "Hello, I would not like to name any places or names of people, but I have a question.  Someone close to me had a small spiral fracture in the leg bone just under the knee a year ago.  He has been in a plaster cast for over a year now, and it has not healed. They are just now deciding to pin it.  He was in a 3/4 cast for over 2 months, and the last time when he went in for a check up and they decided to pin the leg, they removed the cast and the entire back side of his leg is black from skin rotting away.  The staff simply cleaned the leg and gave him an antiseptic cream to administer to the black rotting portions of the leg.  Im assuming this is from not seeing to the patient or cast regularly.  Is this a case of negligence on part of the hospital and the doctors not scheduling enough care, or does this occur frequently?  Please help, Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there,  It is difficult to say from here.  If the skin is necrotic...i.e that the dermis and epidermis has died, then clearly it is a serious condition.  It is unusual after a year from the injury, and more likely to occur a few days to weeks after the trauma.  It is a result of the continued swelling of the leg, in a constraining full  cast.  Sometimes a DVT may cause the leg to swell in a tight cast and compromise the circulation to the skin, and this may lead to skin necrosis, but this too is rare.  After this long an interval and in an incomplete cast (your 3/4 cast, perhaps you mean that the cast goes three quarters of the way around the leg, and is open in the front?), this is extremely unlikely.   The purpose of such a cast is so that the patient can remove the cast from time to time to bathethe legt and bend the knee, but still periodically support the leg.  I presume though, as you seem to suggest that the leg hasn't been looked at for 2 months, it is not this kind of cast.  It is not unusual to have intervals of a couple of months between cast changes.  Skin necrosis is painful and normally the cast wearer is able to inform the staff that something  is not right.  It is more likely the \"black skin\"  is the result of collected squames, that has been shed by the skin, but because these had nowhere to go, they formed a layer of crust over the real skin under neath, and will come of with bathing and antiseptic lotions.  \"Rotten skin\" would require debridement and plastic surgery, and by the sounds of things, te situation is not so grave...  Regards  Saif\n\n",

    "content": "Hello again, Moomom,  Lots of causes for this mobile lump, after an injury.  It could be \"retention dermoid\".  This is an island of skin that gets embedded when there is an injury.  It forms a tense lump, as the skin continues to shed squames (flakes of skin cells), but these squames are trapped buried undeer the surface.  It is rare, and usually takes a few years to appear.  It could be a bit of foreign matter trapped under the skin, embedded during the injury.  This is perhaps more likely.  It could be a feck of boneor osteophyte  that was chipped off during the injury, and that has failed to get reattached.  This is more likely within a joint, as there is space for the fragment to move around.  In front of the knee however, it is conceivable that the fragment is now freely mobile within the \"prepatellar bursa\", a bag of fluid in front of the knee. Loose bodies can also develop spontaneously I gues, but rarely in the prepatellar bursa.  Regards  Saif\n\n",

    "content": "I hurt my finger nail assembling Ikea furniture over a year ago. At that point a nail slipped under my finger nail and split a small bit of nail creating a \"split end\" like sliver of nail on my index finger. I tried to pull off the little piece of nail but instead of coming off, it stayed attached and ended up pulling or seperating it down towards the root of my nail, to my great pain.  So, since then I've tried to leave it alone hoping it would grow out and heal. So, if I keep it bandaged and don't touch it the splinter hemorrhage goes away, but a nail sliver still keeps growing out split. Invariably, the little sliver snags on something and causes a splinter hemorrhage again. One dermatologist thought that it might have been a wart under my nail and had me user carasil cream for a month. It made the sliver of nail soft and easy to snip off as it grew. However, as soon as I stopped using the cream, the sliver hardened again.  Will split nail sliver ever fuse back together and stop causing splinter hemorrhages?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Yoyo,  Most likely what you have done is damaged the \"germinal matrix\".  This is a little bit of tissue from which the nail actually develops, and is just under your nail fold.  What sometimes happens is that this tissue  is damaged after some accidental trauma (or in toes, after surgical attempt to remove the matrix  for ingrowing toenails), and one is left with an island of matrix that is separate from the rest. This island continues to produce the nail, and is the reason your nail keeps coming back.  If this is troubling you sufficiently, you may consider surgical removal of this matrix, for a more permanent (hopefully) solution...  Regards  Saif\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 46 yr old female with a hx of SLE (lupus), chronic UTIs, osteoporosis, hypothyrodism, severe arthritis and, now, osteomyelitis of the R foot. I am a physican's assistant and a medical technologist, although I am currently at home with an eight yr old and major health issues. I have had at least 50 surgeries, many because of ortho problems.  What I am concerned about now is my R leg.  In 1992 I had a knee fusion, done exterior fixation.  This was done because of multiple  failed procedures, questionable infection, severe pain, etc with the hope of taking it down in five years and doing a total knee.  However, in Dec 1994 I tripped and my femur broke with major displacement.  After 10 weeks in a hip spica cast and no signs of any healing, a rod was placed through my femur and tibia.  The ortho said it was most likely to remain there.    Now, in Aug 2002, i stepped on a child's toy and ended i[ woth a very tiny fx. refered to as a jones fx.   it was aced and i was put in a post op shoe.  This, too, did not heal (at 2 weeks after injury it broke through and through).  March, 2003 an intramedularly screw was placed. The screw pulled out and in Sept.,2003 a larger intramedulary screw was placed. In Aug 2004 I  jumped in the pool (!?) and refractured the bone because the screw broke through.  Was told my only option was 5 screws and plate.  This procedure was extremely painful, but more painful was shin pain.  After being blown off 3 times by this \"foot Specialist\" (my original ortho was out of the country) my original ortho was back.  I told him about this extremely shin pain.  He promptly removed the cast and found an abcess through to the tibia.  Subsequently 2 surgeries were performed to i and d it.  Positive staph was tracked to the femural-tibia rod.  Surgery was preformed in Dec 2004 to clean out sight and removal (permanent ?) rod.  After this a hickman cath was placed-2 mo. IV antibiotics.  Fusion refractured slightly in Jan 2004 and was placed in straight knee splint.  And I wish that was ithe end. Things remained stable until Oct 2004 when foot itself became painful and swollen.  An I and D was done. Dx-staph auerus.  this was in Oct.  Two hospitalizations, I was very sick and really wondered if I would make it home,  Since the middle of Oct I have been on IV Ancef 1 gr q8hr.  Also cipro 500mg for pyelo Foot is better, but not great.  Still red.  ESR has come down and C-reactive protein is now neg.  I am also on meds for c diff and oral yeast.  Still unbelievable foot bone pain and fatigue.  What next?  Any suggestions?  I've talked with multiple ortho, ID, rheum, and the works.   I'm still in short leg walking boot and I use a cane.  Wound has healed nicely and fully.  Very sensitive-I cannot get a shoe on.  On Duragesic for pain.  Also have C3 herniation and need a total hip and knee on same leg (says primary ortho)  I've had to use Actiq for severe breakthrough bone pain.  It is very expensive, but fentynal seems to be the only thing that works.  Pump isn't an option pain-wise because of infection and small body size (5'3\" and 108 lbs) Any and all help would be so greatfully accepted. Thank You for taking the time to read and listen.   I want my life back! Lisa\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Lisa,  All I can say is \"wow\".  Well perhaps a little more than that...but seems like you have been through enough injuries, procedures and complications  to become an expert by yourself!   Starting from the top of your letter... Osteoporosis makes you more likely to have fractures, and less likely for the fracture stabilistaion procedures to be successful.  SLE and hypothyroidism, I suppose can reduce your healing rate.  If your SLE was treated with steroids, you become more likely to get osteoporosis and also have further compromise to your healing rate.  Steroids and recurrent UTIs may make you vulnerable to infections elsewhere, for exaample in operative sites.  Infection slows down healing to some extent.  Pheww...so my for the 1st sentence in your post...at this rate we are in for the long haul...  But I will really not drag it on that long.  Suffice it to say that you had a common fracture of the foot, that in the UK at least is in the vast majority of situation dealt with without surgery.  The fact that it was \"through nad through\" again doesn't often mean that it definitely needs surgery...we are slightly more slower to react, I think than our colleagues in the US.  In any case the fixation, as in your previous bone surgery is complicated by implant failure and infection.  You are, as you have seen vulnerable.  The same process is what happened to your knee problems, the \"temporary fusion\". The problem leads to surgery, that leads to complication and further surgery.  Lisa, i can see why you want your life back.  The trouble is that you have a lot of factors that make you vulnerable to complications.  Infection in bone often never completely goes away, despite modern antibiotics.  Further surgery, may just stir it up and bring it up again.   I hate to think what I would do in your shoes, but personally I would think that you should try and steer clear of surgery unless it is to deal with acute flare ups of infection, hard as that sounds when you are such discomfort.  Of course the docs looking after you are THE best judges.  I would try seeing what they think about referral to a pain consultant, and if something like a nerve block gives you periods when the pain is not so bad, and lets you have some breather between surgerical procedures so much the better...  Once things look better, AND you feel psychologically prepared to go through surgery again, AND your doc recommends it, it may be worth visiting the OR.   I am really sorry about your discomfort, and I do hope there is light at the end of the tunnel soon for you.  Regards  Saif\n\n",

It's now Monday and I was unable to put on a shoe this morning and ended up wearing flip flops to work. It is still just throbbing, especially if I walk around or sit for an extended time. and the flip flop seems to be getting tighter. My big toe and second toe seem to move normally, but the other 3 need a bit more coaxing to curl. The foot also seems to be a little colder than the other one. My question is, if I go to the doctor and they find it is broken, can they do anything for it besides tell me to take some Tylenol and stay off it? Because I'm already doing that and hate to pay money when they can't really help anyway.....\n\n",

But although this is the likely outcome, i would suggest a visist to a doc may give you more reassurance than a post in this forum.  Coldness of the foot, loss of sensation may indicate other issues that may need attention (e.g. circulatory compromise).  Clinical evaluation and perhpas an X-ray would be the best next step, and without these, one could be just taking a chance...the odds may be in your favor, but the favorite doesn't always win...

The spot where I hit my hand if I press it just right sends a tingling up my hand to the end of my little finger.  My hand never swole up or did I have any bruising. The thing that worries me the worst is the numbness in my finger.  Do you think I could have broken my hand or just caused some nerve damage?  If you think nerve damage how long should I expect my finger to be numb? Thanks\n\n",

But mosty I am worried about my pelvis. Last monht I got infection due to one steel plate which i had on my pelvis, so it had to be taken out. I still have one more in my back which I can feel since operation.and it gives me strong back pain  Is it natural that You feel these steel plates? I was told that it is recommended to take it out but it need s to be at least one year since operation. Is it possible to take it out before one year time? does it bring any risk, If yes what kind of risk? In general i fell ok now I just have pain in my pelvis and instability in my ancle. Does anyone know what is average time of recovery after such a injuries? another thing which worries me is that after operation i lost sensation in my foot, actually i can fell just big toe and inside part of my foot. What can be a reason of that?  If any there is anyone who can answer my questions I would really appreciate it.If there is anyone who would like to share their experiences from recovery with me please send me an email. Kind Regards Ola\n\n",

    "content": "Dzien dobry Ola,  Sorry to hear about your predicament...you seem to have had a pretty nasty injury.  It is difficult to give an absolute answer...but here goes...  Implanted Plates can become infected...but if there is no infection and the fracture heals well and the plates are not causing any disturbance, then they can certainly be left alone.  Pain after fractures and fixation can be caused by 1) residual movement in the fracture site, 2) Infection,  3) Disruption to adjacent structures eg the joint surfaces 4) Nerve Inury  Becuase the Spinal fractures were unstable they were stabilised with some metalwork.  An unstable spine can compromise the nerves that leave the canal and cause a lot of pain, and also lead to weakness, numbness, and even loos of bladder and bowel control.  The fact that you have numbness and also presumably a \"foot drop\" means that it is likley that the nerve is damaged.  The recovery of this can take upto a year.   It is important to clarify whether the nerve injury happenned before, after or during the operation.   Any of these are possible, and I would suggest you get clarification from your surgeon.  Removing the metal work before the spinal fractures have healed may lead to more instabilty and more pain and possibly more nerve damage.  If there is infection howver, there is no choice...while there is metal there, the infection will not go away.  Rregards  saif\n\n",

    "title": "Possible SCFE???",
    "content": "Hey!  I promise I've been to the doctor, but he's being extremely optimistic and perhaps a little oblivious.  I'm glad to have found this site, though.  Now for my problem to see if anyone has an idea!  These details are relevant:  I'm a 16 year old girl, I weigh about 120 pounds, I'm 5'7\" or 5'8\", eight inches of that height was acquired over the course of three years (12/00 to 12/03), and I still have open growth plates.  Anyway, in mid-October, I was walking around in school and suddenly an excruciating pain made itself known in the side of my left hip.  For the rest of that day I was forced to use crutches because it hurt too much to use that leg.  The pain was gone the next day, and started to disappear and reappear on an every-other-day basis for the next two weeks.  I saw my orthopedic doctor (who also happens to be a hip specialist) after about 5 days of it because it was rather painful and annoying.  He did ROM tests and found nothing wrong.  About six weeks later I convinced my mom to take me in for another appointment.  This time he took X-rays that he interpreted as \"perfectly normal,\" told me it was probably inflammation, and diagnosed snapping hip syndrome.  I was sent to physical therapy for the next two weeks to try to work out my issues via strengthening and the ASTYM system.  Since about the 16th of November, I have been moving around outside my home on crutches.  When I don't use them I get a \"catching\" feeling in my hip joints.  My PT diagnosed me as having iliotibial band syndrome (almost \"textbook\", according to her), which accounted for the recent pain on the sides of my thighs that had developed in the last day or so, but on my second appointment, I puzzled her by expressing the fact that certain movements caused pain when I guess they shouldn't have (squeezing a partially inflated ball between my knees caused groin pain).  On my follow-up appointment with my doctor, I relayed to him all the different movements that cause pain.  Hugging my thighs with knees bent up to my chest, hopping on one foot, and lying supine and making a \"4\" with my legs all hurt.  The pain is bilateral, too.  He sent me to have an MRI done the next day, and I have an appointment with him tomorrow to look at the results.  The funny thing about the MRI (it took about 45 minutes) is that when it was done, and I tried to get up, my hips were so stiff that I had trouble moving them without pain for a couple minutes.  Also, the same cycle of symptoms (sharp pain, on-off catching, two or three days of muscular soreness, and finally daily pain) began in my right hip in late November.  Now I just hop around on my crutches.  The pain that I feel is rather nondescript and hard to pinpoint.  It moves up and down the front of my thighs and sometimes goes to my knees, I have groin pain, and sometimes it's just a very annoying ache that is just \"in my hips.\"  It's only a burning pain on the outside of my hips because I have bursitis there since my PT got a little overzealous with the ASTYM.  Because I have been slow to mature, I'm wondering if, even at my age, I have developed an early stage of Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis.  All my symptoms seem to match according to what I can find online, and the only areas that I don't fit the profile in are the facts that I'm not a boy, I'm older than most girls who develop that problem and have begun menstruating, and I'm about the furthest thing from obese.  Obviously, though, I also had my growth spurt later than most girls do.  I ride horseback, and over the summer I did have a bit of an accident.  The horse reared and threw itself down onto the ground while I was still mounted.  The girl who was watching said that for an instant he was lying on my leg; I was focusing on my head as it hit the ground and didn't notice that part of it! :lol  My question is this: is there anyone here who could tell me if what I'm feeling sounds right for SCFE?  Another thing, too.  I looked up info about the possibility of iliopsoas/iliopectineal bursitis as a possible cause of my groin pain, and some sources said that Thomas' test was always positive in that case.  I did it, and my knees were nice and flat.   Thanks for your time,                                     Erin-Michelle\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Erin-Michelle, The hip is a ball and socket joint. The ball is connected to the femur (thigh bone) by a growth plate. As the growth of the femur slows down, the ball can slip. If this occurs it can cause the leg to turn outwards by changing the shape of the top of the femur. SCFE causes severe pain. It affects both boys and girls. There may be a link between increased weight,(of course not in your case),  the shape and position of the femur(thigh bone) (called retroversion) and the hormones of puberty. Have anomolies in the shape/structure been ruled out? Without treatment, SCFE worsens and may cause arthritis in the hip. Keep in mind that sudden growth spurts may also cause severe upper leg and hip pain. Also a condition called  iliopsoas syndrome may make one have pain in the hip and thigh region, as well as hip stiffness and in some cases a clicking or snapping hip. A physiotherapist should be able to diagnose the condition through manual tests, but it can be confirmed by an ultrasound or MRI scan. Treatment for this syndrome is to allow the condition to settle down and pain to decrease through rest, electrotherapy and anti-inflammatory medications. Once achieved, a 6 week program of flexibility and strengthening exercises for muscles around the hip can begin. In my opinion taking into consideration your injury, I would give more consideration to iliopsoas syndrome. I'm certainly glad to hear that your condition is being evaluated with testing and I hope all turns out well.  Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "content": "This is exceedingly frustrating.  The MRI came back completely normal--indicating that I do not have bursitis in any form around any area of my hips.  The only finding was that of some excess fluid around the hip joints which was ruled to be normal.  Unfortunately, my physical therapist has informed me that by now they should be seeing results (after 5+ sessions), and if after the two sessions that I have this week there aren't any results, we should discontinue therapy because it will not help.  My older sister suggested the shoes I wear on occasion as the cause of my misery, and I will admit that I do wear boots with 3-inch heels.  So lately I have refrained from wearing the boots and have either walked around barefoot or in flat-soled shoes.  Yesterday I took a \"test drive\" on my legs with flat shoes in several stores.  Within 10 minutes of walking I was in pain, and about a half hour later my left hip developed the \"catching\" sensation that I know only too well.  It is painful and causes me to straighten the leg that feels that way and walk with it turned out.  Since last night, I have been experiencing intense pain around the left iliac crest upon flexion and walking--and it kills!!!!.  I'm not sure what is going on, and as my doctor does not know either, and my mother has decided to \"let it go for several months\", I am willing to look elsewhere for advice.  The next medical step that we have set up is to obtain a third opinion from my orthopedic doctor's colleague.  Any other ideas?  Erin-Michelle\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Erin,  Sorry to hear of your discomfort...I take it from the signature, that you are a keen rider?  I have daughters who are mad on the critters themselves, and have been driven to poverty by the animals.  Judging by your story, I reckon SCFE is probably unlikley.  SCFE pain is typically in the groin, although occasionally it is referred to the knee.  It may on the late stages make you wake with your leg turned outwards, as you describe, but by this time it is usually obvious on X-rays.   Diffuse pain is possible with this as well, and the pain up and down the thigh is again atypical.  Certainly and MRI would be diagnostic, a bone scan, although less specific would certainly be able to identify the actual site of the problem.    Problems such as labral tears (damage to the lip of the socket of the hip joint), can cause clicking in the hip joint, and an MRI can sometimes pick this up. It is also rare.  Personally I guess the problem most likely is as your specialist and your PT (AKA physio-terrorists) suspects.  Both the Ilio-tibial band syndrome and the \"snapping hip syndrome\" are similar conditions. This is more common in females (wider hips, you see). The Iliotibial band is a strong tissue, like a ligament, extending from your Iliac Crest to just below you knee.  The snapping is induced by a thickened part part of this band flicking over the greater trochanter (GT), the prominence of your femur at your hip.  This thickening can be natural, but the flicking that occurs over the GT causes more fibrosis, and more thickening, exaggerating the symptoms.  PT helps by stertching the tissues, and also local interferential treatment may reduce the local inflammatory thickening.  If this and other conservative measures fail we can always operate...the procedure is a Z-plasty of the IT band which reduces the tightness of the tissue.  The procedure works in about 80% of the patients who have it and there is a chance of recurrence despite surgery, so I would think your orthopaedic surgeon is quite right not to jump to it straight away.    You are right that all the features are not entirely consistent with this diagnosis, but most of what you say seems to point in this direction.  Hope this helps, Erin, and good luck!  Saif\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks, Dr. Saif, for your concern  , and, yes, I am horse crazy.  I'm going to keep posting even if you all become bored in reading it so that maybe if anyone else comes along with my same symptoms then there will be an answer (or a possible rebuttal to accusations of hypochondria!  ).  My physical therapy is almost over but not because I'm graduating; rather, I am being \"kicked out\" because there has been no improvement in my symptoms besides removing the fibrosis in my thighs with the ASTYM.  I guess that after this coming Thursday, I will be immediately referred to the pediatric orthopedic specialist of whom I spoke  earlier.  Looking back, I was a little scatterbrained in describing my symptoms; those weren't all of them.  Most of the pain that I do have is in my hips, mainly along the junction of my hips and legs (groin, I think?  ), and sometimes higher.  The thigh thing was probably what I was feeling at the time.  There is a definite, without-a-doubt connection between walking and the symptoms. Oh dear, I''m repeating myself; sorry.  The tendon that causes the snapping is not the ilio-tibial band; it's one that's on the inside of my hips around the inferior pubic ramus (i'll pretend I know what I'm talking about).  It makes racket or moves around when I abduct my hips, and that same area hurts when I adduct them. It feels like something is being squished in my groin when I flex my hips.   My physio-terrorist   tested the psoas muscle today to see if it is too tight; it isn't...yay!!  Everyone who is working with me says that I don't really have any issues with the ilio-tibial band besides tightness (no syndrome), so, besides that, is there any possible explanation except hypochondria?    Later,            Erin\n\n",

    "content": "Dera Erin,  It is fair to say that by the end of your research into your condition you may well be qualified to give instructions to me about peculiar hip pains...  As before, a bit tricky to daignose without you in front of me...but if the pain is on the inner side of the thigh, then clearly ITS and SHS are unlikely.  Groin pains can be due to adductor tendinitis, once we have decided that there is no joint pathology (which we seem to have done). This would make it difficult to squeeze a ball between your legs.  It is aggravated by moving the legs away from the center, and resisted adduction, (e.g. squeezing something between your legs) would increase pain.  The cause is an inflammation of the tendon of the muscles that normally bring your legs together, the adductors.  This tendon attaches itself roughly to the area you seem to be describing.  Adductor tendinitis  can be picked up on MRI, but the scans need to be directed with this in mind.  It may respond to interferential treatment to this area, by your physiotherapist, but sadly it appears that he/she is about to give up on you...oh well.  Intervention in the way of a local injection of steroids may also help.  Regards  Saif\n\n",

She had a appt. with her primary yesterday to get her refills, the Dr. office called her on monday and said they would no longer see her and not to come in. She is on a lot of meds for all her problems, she went to the er and they gave her some of her meds but did not give her anything for her pain. She had been taking oxy 40's and roxy 5 for BT. Is it dangerous for her to stop cold? The Dr. gave no reason why he dropped her. Is it legal to stop treating someone with on-going medical problems with no warning?\n\n",

In this case i think it is because this patient is on Ocycontin 40 twice a day and Oxy IR. Alot of doctors are uncomfortable about prescribing regular narcotics to a patient. This patient should see a pain specialist who would be more comfortable with narcotics.\n\n",

    "content": "I agree with AWT, your friend's MD probably is not comfortable prescribing so many narcotics.  I believe the MD has every right to \"fire\"  their patient, in fact, as a RN in a level I trauma center, I have seen this happen.  Typically, when I have seen this happen, it is because the patient will not follow their MD's advice, refusing diagnostic tests/treatments etc. to find a sources of what is possibly causing pain, but they still want their pain medications.  It sounds like your friend has been through a lot, but maybe he/she is not telling you the full reason he/she was dropped by their doctor.  If this is truly the case for him/her, then it is better for them to find another doctor, I mean, why would he/she want to see someone who is longer interested in treating them?  Also, maybe your friend needs to see a pain management physician who is very familiar with treating chronic pain and can help your friend achieve pain relief in the safest and most effective way.  Hope this helps, Kady\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I thought I had posted a message up but can't find it.  Hope I haven't posted twice   About 3 to 4 years I cracked or broke a rib due to coughing - caught a severe flu bug.  I had xrays which showed it up.  Can't remember now if it was broken or cracked.  However, that cleared up.  A few months ago I had a child jump on me on my chest and had severe pain and soreness in that same right rib area... which did clear up. However a few nights ago on having a cuddle with my hubby (don't laugh please), I felt something in my left rib cage go ping and it hurt intensely for a moment.  Since then it has got worse and worse - muscle spasms in my back etc.  It feels a bit better today but is this Costochondritis please?  I'm a gardener and have been fairly active but I'm getting too scared to move of late.  Any help would be appreciated.  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Gill, Costochondritis is a benign condition, cause is unknown, 2/3 of patients are females. It sometimes occurs after vigorous coughing or muscular strain but a direct blow is not usually a preceeding event. Treatment for this condition is by using anti-inflammatory drugs and by applying heat. I would suggest that you make an appointment with your family doctor to rule out another cause for your symptoms. A chest xray at the very least is in order. Hope this helps at least a little  Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Gill,  Have to agree with Rntdj 100%.  Costochondritis is a largely benign condition.  It may not necessarily follow trauma, although it can do.  Often actually the cause is unknown, possibly viral. The treatment is rest and antinflammatories, altough other interferential treatment may be tried.   While the condition is self limiting, it may last several weeks, and it is said it usually gets worse for a couple days before it gets better.  The fact that it seemed to come with minimal trauma (and I am presuming your hubby wasn't giving you a traumatic hug  ) , is I guess why rntjd quite correctly recommends a visit to a doctor... normally a chest X-ray would not be done in the UK, at least not unless it has been going for a while... costochondritis usually involves an area that is invisible to X-rays.  But it is true that if one is not sure of the diagnosis of chest pain, then X-rays can help exclude some pathologies.  Regards  Saif\n\n",

The doctor who saw him said that it would not heal on it's own. He also said that he was bleeding internally because the rib punctured something. (he said the bleeding is very slow) He said that it could not be fixed. I do not understand why he would say this. I am sure that it could be repaired or removed. Am I right? I do not want to lose my friend because the doctor was incompetant or prejudce (we live in the prejudce capital of the world. I have seen it many times while i have been here) He coughs up blood sometimes and has even vomited blood. He is in a lot of pain especially when he moves the wrong way or lifts things. I have seen the tears in his eyes. It is very tender to the touch and when I touched it I felt an indention there. My friend has resigned to the fact that he is going to die. I will not give up. I can not lose him. If you can tell me anything I would most appreciate it and would be forever in your debt. If you can't could you please tell me where to start looking or who to ask.

    "content": "Dear jlboothe,   As any other fracture, the bone might be displaced. And this is usually evident on exam. Also, you have to be followed if you really have a fracture versus just  a bad bruise.  The treatment usually consists of bed rest, stool softeners, pain relievers and muscle spasm relievers. As you increase your activity an inflatable rubber donut cushion may be used, alternate sitting on the side of each buttock, slouching to displace body weight away from the coccyx and sitting on a hard chair (as sinking into a soft chair may distribute weight onto the coccyx). Healing is slow and discomfort may be prolonged. In the case of persistent severe disability, an orthopedic consultation is indicated for considerations of local steroid injection or possible removal of the coccyx.

    "content": "I recently took a hard fall while playing some recreational football.  It was 10 days ago now.  When I woke up the next morning my hip (I believe would be my hip, or side of lower back) hurt like crazy.  It was so bad I could not lift my leg to put pants on I would have to sit down and put that leg on and thenn the other.  I also couldnt take big steps or put much weight on that side.  the pain went down some the next day but has remained about the same since.  I can walk better and odnt have the constant pain but if I take big steps or put much weight on it or even roll over a certain way while sleeping i still feel a pain that makes me cringe a little.  Is this something seriious enough that I should have it examined?  Or is this just a bruise that will need more time ot go away?  My only real concern since the pain is bearable and not constant is just that I worried that it could possibly be related somehow to my previous surgery since that hip is where the bone was grafted from and also my lower back is where my vertebrae fracture was.  So i want ot be careful with that as well.  Anyone have a suggestion? I assume it to be a bruise but thought it would be gone after 10 days if that was all it was.\n\n",

    "content": "I got hit with a softball 5/2. I got hit in the shin.  I still have a large bruise. And it hurts to stand on. I am wondering if I could have cracked, or chipped the bone. I would think it would have healed by now. It has been almost 3 weeks. There is still a huge bruise, and the pain has intesified. It is swellon too. But my mom said that the whole leg would be swellon is this true?   My doctor just looked at it and said it was just a large bruise. No x-ray. Told me to put heat on the bruise, to help it reabsorb it self.   I did make an appointment to go see an orthopedic.  What do you think?[/code]\n\n",

    "title": "broken elbow?",
    "content": "Today i fell off my bike and banged up my arm. At first it hurt but was fairly movable although I didnt try and straighten the arm completely.  I bandaged myself up, then sat down to watch a movie. The arm still hurts but not badly, however now the elbow is less flexible.skin color is normal, swelling very mild (hard to notice at all) How can I tell if my elbow is broken or sprained? If i suspect it may be broken, how immediate must I be to visit a doctor/hospital? What would happen if I waited 24-48 hours before seeing a doctor?\n\n",

    "content": "HI. I just need to find out more information on how a broken pelvic bone will affect future planning of pregnancy. Almost 2 years ago I was struck by a vehicle that broke my pelvic bone in atleast 2 places.   I was told that this could affect the possibility is me being able to carry a child, that if my pelvic bone was strong enough I would only be able to give birth by C-section & that there is a strong possibility of being bed ridden/ mostly off my feet through out the pregnancy. I would like some opinions please & if possible be directed to some medical sites that could give me hard information.  Thank You\n\n",
