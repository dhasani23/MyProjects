    "content": "The penis is made up of three tube shaped chambers of \"spongy\" tissue; two tubes on top (the corpora cavernosa) which extend well into the body to anchor the penis, and one underneath (the corpus spongiousm) which becomes the glans or head of the penis.  The three tubes are surrounded by a sheath of skin which is stretchable, to a limit.  The arteries which feed blood to the spongy tubes are surrounded by smooth muscles fibers which are normally contracted, limiting the amount of blood entering the penis.  When a sight, touch, or thought cause sexual stimulation, the brain signals the muscles to relax, greatly increasing the blood flow.  The spongy bodies fill up, making the penis enlarge.  Because the veins which drain the spongy bodies pass between the bodies and the sheath of skin, erection causes the vessels to be compressed, reducing the amount of blood that can leave the penis. When the growth of the penis reaches the limit of the stretchable sheath of skin, the penis becomes very firm.   Its possible that the corpus spongiosum (the spongy tissue tube that becomes the head of the penis) does not get filled up with blood during an erection. This is only a possibility. I would advise you to go and discuss this with your doctor, get a physical examination and possibly an ultrasound.\n\n",

    "title": "16 mnths testicular pain following excessive sexual activity",
    "content": "Hello, I am 24 years old and I have been experiencing periodic, severe testicular pain for about 16 months. It started when I was involved in an extremely active sexual relationship. Myself and my girlfriend would engage in sexual intercourse several times a day. Significantly, we would often be involved in sexual activity for prolonged periods of time (e.g. 2hours) before I actually ejaculated. I started to get pain in my testicles, and the cord attached to my testicles, which would dissipate after a day or so, after which I would we would resume sexual relations. However, eventually, this pain  became chronic and would take weeks to subside.   In the past 16 months I have had roughly 5 periods (lasting 2 -5 weeks) of chronic pain and have only experienced perhaps 2-3 weeks where I have had no pain whatsoever. In the same time period I have not had any sexual partners, I have had to refrain from sexual activity and sexual arousal of any description as much as possible, I have had to stop smoking (which is a good thing), avoid excessive laughter or coughing, avoid sleeping/sitting in particular positions, all for fear of provoking the pain.  I have had a full health check for STD's 6 months ago and nothing was found.  Around two weeks ago I started to get extreme testicular pain, again. This hasn't subsided yet and I have made an appointment with my doctor (something I regret not doing earlier). Unfortunately due to waiting lists and work commitments I have to wait a further two weeks to see the doctor.  The pain is unbelievable, especially at night, and I am panicking when I think about having to live with this for the rest of my life. Furthermore I have been taking allot of painkillers (400mg ibuprofen twice during the day and 400mg ibuprofen + 1000mg paracetemol + 30-60mg codeine at night) this is playing havoc with my stomach and is a further source of anxiety. The painkillers don\u2019t really mask the pain however when I try to lay off them for a period, to give my stomach a rest, the pain becomes so severe that I can barely function and consider going to A&E!  I feel extremely anxious and regretful about my situation and would greatly appreciate it if somebody could shed some light as to what my problem might be/ the potentiality of even a partial recovery and what possible treatment I might expect. Also, any advice as to managing the pain and the side-effects of the painkillers would also be much appreciated.  Many thanks in advance, \tCal.\n\n",

You may have some inflammation or infection but this should be correctable with diagnosis and treatment so seeing your doctor is the right thing to do.  Ongoing pain killers is not a good option but likely will not be necessary once the cause is determined.  A twisted testicle can be extremely painful and you should be able to get an earlier appointment with that concern.    Try using an athletic supporter in the meantime.    Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, First of all try to keep things in perspective.  You are still young and the chances of something like this being permanent is extremely low.  In addition to normal maturing that continues throughout your life and the emotional factors that go into committed relationships you are very likely to find a natural improvement in sexual function.  This is definitely not something to prompt suicide and if you are having such feelings you should seek counseling or a suicide helpline immediately.  Sex is not the whole reason for one's existence and if it feels this way for you some therapy is definitely in order and perhaps the cannabis use has created other psychological problems.  In addition to natural improvements that are likely to occur, there are ongoing technological advances so you should not despair.  Meanwhile, focus your attention on other pursuits and the sexual aspect may improve naturally.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Well, now it's been 5 years I've suffered from a porn and masturbation addiction. It's began to be twice a day again. For the past month, I've noticed that I have no erections, it's just limp, even while mb. Even while viewing p. Which I do try to avoid. And when I do orgasm, it's just as enjoyable as pissing...not enjoyable at all. I do not have an orgasm and my erections are weak. I feel I've permanently destroyed my sex life. This is traumatizing to me and my self esteem. I never feel sexually excited anymore, and when I mb it doesn't even feel good. My orgasms are non-existant, and my erections are so weak it's practically limp. I've tried laying off for like 2 weeks...(the longest I've stayed away was a month once), and have noticed no improvement in my erection nor in my orgasm (not that I tried it out purposely, I just had a relapse). I want to know if my sexual health will ever come back again. Will I ever have another orgasm thats strong? Will I ever get a hard erection? I wonder if I just leave it alone but for a longer period of time, like a month or 2 with no stimulation, if it'll go back to normal? I sure hope so. Please help and advise me. I don't want to lose my sex life forever. Please respond to this and if you've ever dealt with this problem and solved it or know the solution, let me know. I'm willing to try just about everything to fix it. I'm 18 years old.  Thank you in advance for your response.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Over-stimulation to impotency?",
    "content": "Hello, I think you are on the right track in trying to stop the self-stimulation in an effort to return to a more normal state.  It is entirely possible that the missing link is a meaningful relationship.  If sex is only associated with porn and self-stimulation it can be difficult to get the same from a normal relationship.  I would consider counseling to help you get over the addiction and then wait for a normal relationship to be the cause of your arousal.  You could find yourself feeling once again more \"normal\" and your satisfaction much better than it ever was through self-stimulation.    Sometimes we worry too much over the mechanics while neglecting the emotional element.  If you can give yourself some time and focus on things aside from sex, the interest will likely come back in a more natural way.  I know this is easier said than done but at your age you will most likely be able to enjoy a long and fulfilling sex life.  Once you are in a committed relationship, if you find you have trouble with erections there are medications to help but I suspect it will not reach that point.    I would concentrate on your own self-esteem, being successful in other areas of your life, health and body building, intellectual development and other self improvement efforts.  The normal evolution of maturity usually results in normal sexual activity but it's important to put this in its proper perspective and priority.  Being the best you can be will result in improved self-image, acceptance by others and well-rounded emotional health.  Any time addictions enter your life, they take on an improper importance and they control you.  Good luck and best wishes.\n\n",

I'm 26 years old unmarried male and have been masturbating for last 12/13 years.. my desire for sex/masturbation  was quite moderate up until lately, when suddenly I started feeling very excited, quite regurlarly, to the extent that even if I'm walking down the street and see an attractive female.. I suddenly feel something is secreted from my penis. Earlier I thought I was mistaking Urine as Pre-Cum / Semen but later I confirmed it was something jelly.. best part is I don't have any control over it.  Condition got worse when I started getting this jelly thing secreted from my penis everytime I pee.. and this generally happens for 2/3 days after I masturbate.  This thing is really taking toll on me and I'm suffering from OCD because of this... that I keep changing clothes, taking shower at odd hours, washing hands all the time.  Please help me, resolve this sudden secretion and Retrograde Ejaculation.   Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, It is obvious that the frenulum has been severed due to traction.Now the priority is to avoid infection and to allow it to heal fully. I do not know if you have consulted any doctor.If you have not done so already, you should do so at least now.Ideally, your tetanus immunization history must be looked into and updated if necessary. It may be better to apply an antibiotic creme locally (your doctor will be able to decide on this), as it will help in preventing the prepuce getting stuck and increasing the potential for injury. It is very important to avoid further injury till the healing is complete. A small tag of attached frenulum may remain for a while but, with healing (remodeling) it should reduce in size considerably(or even disappear). Best wishes!\n\n",

It grew it around the base of my penis.  and about two inches around the base and quite thick, but in the five years since then i have had no penis growth, under 6 cm long and no testicle growth around 3 cm long.  I have just a bit of armpit hair and just a bit of scrotum hair, it seems i hit puberty at a young age yet then it just stoped,   i want to know if what i am going threough is delayed puberty and if their is anything i can take to fix it or if i am just and early starte and a late finisher.  I asked my family if they were late bloomers and my father said that he was normal so no family history, and my older brother went through puberty when he was 14 and was finished by my age.  I feel extremely umcomfortable during showers in gym class and i get picked on constantly.  i will give you my timeline of growth so that maybe you can help me and give me a prediction on maybe when my penis will enlarge and other things that happend druing puberty  10 years old- public hairs develp around penis 11-14--- nothing except a little thickining of pubic hair 15  years old-  Short ball sack hairs and small short armpit haris penis is about 2.75 to 3 inches long and testicles are around 1.5 inches long  IF you can please tell me what i should expect in the near future and what is the problem with my develpment and what i can do to help  I am very confused and i need alot of help right now thanks you\n\n",

Odds are I have no diseases, and suffer only from delayed puberty without any other \"diseases.\"  However, I simply do not care anymore.  How does someone go about getting hormone treatment to kickstart the process so that when I go off to college, I'll look like a normal 19 year old, and not a 13 year old prepubescant kid?  I am getting a bone age done in a few days, but I really have lost interest even in my height, and I am only 5'5.

I hadn't inserted my penis in her, but it was rubbing between her legs from behind.  It felt like my penis was double-jointed when it make the \"cracking\" noise. I tried to put a condom on so that we could have sex, but we didn't end up having sex due to the discomfort.  The following day we had sex, but it was strange for me because it was a little bit sore and I didn't think anything of it.  Now today, 3 days after the incident, I noticed that my penis has a very sizable bruise on the top side of my penis along the length (bruise measuring about 2 in x 1 in).  I can get an erection, but it is quite sore.   Is this something i should be concerned about?  What kind of damage could I have done, if any?  Many thanks, John.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,Erectile dysfunction ED as it is called is quite common in the population.There are many causes more related to age,diseases of blood vessels and nerves,abuse of drugs,alcohol,smoking and medications. Perhaps the most common in your age group relates to psychologic factors.Guilt complex about masturbation is one single cause of performance anxiety. Also fear of losing manliness due to loss of sperm is known as Dhat syndrome quite common in India. Anxiety,depression are other contributing conditions. More than any medication you may need counselling but then few tests may be needed to rule out physical problems. A doppler test would rule out blood vessel relatd problems,and an endocrine workup to rule out testosterone based endocrine problems. NPT test otherwise known as Nocturnal Penile Tumiscence Test rules out organic problems. Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I was just wondering at what age the penis stops growing. I'm 18 nearly 19 and like every bloke am unsatisfied with the length of my penis. I have read through countless web sites regarding penis enlargement and am still too sceptical on that aspect to part with money for \"miracle cures\". According to sites i've seen and peoples general assumtions the average penis size is close to 5.5/6 inches where as I currently have a 4 inch penis. Is this normal for my age and at what age will it stop growing?\n\n",

    "title": "penis length",
    "content": "Sexual satisfaction is due to a number of things and size Is only one aspect. Big is not the same as, or equal to, satisfaction. The vaginal muscles move and tighten to accept an erect penis from about 3\" and longer  Penis size is determined by genetics. The size of the penis changes during puberty. Penis growth starts between the ages of about 10 to 14 years of age, although some boys are younger, some older. The testicles begin to enlarge first and hair grows in the pubic region. The penis grows in length first and girth slightly later. Teenagers have to wait one or two years after they have stopped growing in height before they will be able to know their final penis size.   When the penis is in a non-erect condition, the male organ usually measures between 8.5cm (just over 3\") and 10.5cm (just over 4\") from tip to base. The average figure is about 9.5cm (or 3 \u00be\" ), but this kind of precise measurement is really rather valueless because so many factors (for instance, cold weather or going swimming) can temporarily cause a shrinkage of an inch or more. So you needn't be worried if you happen to fall short of the average figure. The distinguished American researchers Masters and Johnson measured the penile lengths of over 300 men. The largest organ (measuring 14 cm, or 5 \u00bd\" in the flaccid state) belonged to a slim man who was only 5' 7\" tall; the smallest (measuring 6cm, or 2 \u00bc\" ) belonged to a fairly heavily built man of 5' 11\". majority of men measure between 15cm (6\") and 18cm (7\") in the erect position, with the average figure being about 16.5cm (6 \u00bd\").  Over the past few years the market for penis enlargement has developed into a multi-million dollar industry. Most aren't aproved medicines, relatively little is actually reported about the effectiveness of such programs or whether any health implications occur as a result of consuming the products on the market. Embarrassment is probably a significant issue here and men aren't reporting the fraud. In a recent poll = 91% out of 1785 men said it was a waste taking the pills & 84% out of 1237 men said it was a waste trying combined methods\n\n",

How do the other men in your family measure up (literally)? The length of the penis is hereditary so you have somebody to thank, which brings up a good point, you got here so that means theirs worked! Yours will work to! Have you ever taken steroids for muscle building? Have you taken any medications that could have caused a delay in growth of your organs? If you give me ideas and answers to my question, I will help you find possibilities to look at and research for you.\n\n",

Its probably at its normal size by the time you are in your early 20's but i bet its bigger when you are like 60.  Personally i was a VERY late bloomer so my voice didnt break and i didnt stop growing (in height) until i was around 21. And my peinis seemed to grow until around then too.\n\n",

I'm quite aware it works. just had a convo with sum mates and jokingly mentioned mine was round about the 5 inch region before nearly all of my mates who were awake started laughing and said theirs was about that size when flacid. I do feel on a proportion to my size and what time in comparison I seem to grow is usually slightly later than my friends. also in a post on a different thread someone mentioned a \"mushroom\" shaped head. does that happen to everyone? cuz mine has quite alot of foreskin at the end and i'd always assumed that was the effect of circumsicion\n\n",

Im quit sure its not gonna get any bigger, its 3 inches flaccid, 5.5 erect, but slim. don't let these stupid forums fool you, cause every time i have ever gone to the urinals the other guys next to me have always been bigger. I can tell you life sucks, im kinda evaluating it right now. I could get so many girls, but i have to turn them down due to my issue. Im very depressed, i would never even think about surgery because thats just stupid. So yeah i can expect a long life without woman. Wow does it suck. Im just now understanding that i better get use to it. Whats even worse is i come from a rich family who can send me to college but yet im not gonna go because theres no point of living my life if i cant get a girl then raise a family. So yeah don't feel bad for me cause it doesnt matter. I understand what most of you small guys are feeling out there, I can relate. You know again i admit im depressed but at least im admitting the hard truth  for most of the men like me. I only have one other thing to say to you guys, why us? does god hate us our something?

Some of them i ask why don't they believe me and they say because i don't look like the type of guy who would have a small penis.  This sounds gay but i have seen my dads penis a couple of times when i was younger and it is defenitly not small.

    "content": "Hey Guys am Faisel  it's wonderful to join to this medical forum and the reason maybe i joined is what i might think many men are sharing with me which is the size of my penis that it's 10cm when erect at the age of 28 so i was wondering whethere it's normal or no, i was also wondering wheather i can go and consult with urologist at my earliest, cuz what i seem to worry about is my girlfriend who i didn't tell her but would like things go sexually well between us.......pls anyone who can advice i will be much grateful Acrobat wrote:im no doctor but from what i can tell, it grows for the rest of your life. It gets bigger during your teens and puberty etc.. and then sorta steadies out. Its probably at its normal size by the time you are in your early 20's but i bet its bigger when you are like 60.   Personally i was a VERY late bloomer so my voice didnt break and i didnt stop growing (in height) until i was around 21. And my peinis seemed to grow until around then too.Rhonda P, CEP wrote:Sexual satisfaction is due to a number of things and size Is only one aspect. Big is not the same as, or equal to, satisfaction. The vaginal muscles move and tighten to accept an erect penis from about 3\" and longer  Penis size is determined by genetics. The size of the penis changes during puberty. Penis growth starts between the ages of about 10 to 14 years of age, although some boys are younger, some older. The testicles begin to enlarge first and hair grows in the pubic region. The penis grows in length first and girth slightly later. Teenagers have to wait one or two years after they have stopped growing in height before they will be able to know their final penis size.   When the penis is in a non-erect condition, the male organ usually measures between 8.5cm (just over 3\") and 10.5cm (just over 4\") from tip to base. The average figure is about 9.5cm (or 3 \u00be\" ), but this kind of precise measurement is really rather valueless because so many factors (for instance, cold weather or going swimming) can temporarily cause a shrinkage of an inch or more. So you needn't be worried if you happen to fall short of the average figure. The distinguished American researchers Masters and Johnson measured the penile lengths of over 300 men. The largest organ (measuring 14 cm, or 5 \u00bd\" in the flaccid state) belonged to a slim man who was only 5' 7\" tall; the smallest (measuring 6cm, or 2 \u00bc\" ) belonged to a fairly heavily built man of 5' 11\". majority of men measure between 15cm (6\") and 18cm (7\") in the erect position, with the average figure being about 16.5cm (6 \u00bd\").  Over the past few years the market for penis enlargement has developed into a multi-million dollar industry. Most aren't aproved medicines, relatively little is actually reported about the effectiveness of such programs or whether any health implications occur as a result of consuming the products on the market. Embarrassment is probably a significant issue here and men aren't reporting the fraud. In a recent poll = 91% out of 1785 men said it was a waste taking the pills & 84% out of 1237 men said it was a waste trying combined methods\n\n",

From a womans point of view let me clairify......... Yes women tend to want a man with a \"BIG\" one, but when it is all said & done most of us complain about the pain and discomfort from it. For the guy who is wanting to give it all up over the size of your \"SMALL\" one, let me tell you one thing, ANY woman on this earth would rather have a man who treats her great because once the sex is over you still have 23 hours & 55 mins of the day left to spend together and size just isn't that important the rest of the time!!!! You should date & spend time with a woman & THEN have sex. Besides for a woman sex is 95% emotional & 5% physical. Not to mention the whole aspect of \"fellatio\" ;-}  So keep all this in mind next time you fell like you are falling short. GOOD LUCK!!!!\n\n",

To get an acurate measument of you penis meausre it about 3-4 differant times and find the average. This is because you penis can very by how aroused you are at that moment. hopefully this does ansewer aome of your questions.\n\n",

He says that his penis is not done growing yet and it will get even more bigger in the next few years at like 25? I don't think thats true bc hes 6'2 and done with pubirity and pretty sure hes done growing. Do you think it will get bigger and do you think he has a nice size penis? I know its kind of a out there question but were both really curious? And another question....   I say that if a girl has been with alot of partners they will just look at a penis as a penis and if its small, its small and if its big, its big. I think girl judge a guy tremendously on his penis size and if its big or not- if a girl has sex with a guy one night who has an 8 in a half in penis and thinks its amazing..she could have sex a few days later with a guy who has a 7 in a half inch penis and think its not that great because of the guy she was with the few nights before..even though 7 is a good size! right??\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,ED or erectile dysfunction has to be looked at from different angles to rule out possible causes.It is possible that this may be due to other causes. Blood vessels can get occluded eg too much smoking,Endocrine ie hormonal,Neurogenic,Drug related,etc. A comlete physical examination after a proper history,pyschological assessment and tests like Nocturnal Penile Tumescence(NPT),RigiScan,Colour Doppler testing are the few tests done. Do get your self examined.Surely much can be done to get you back in shape to live a good satisfied and gratifying sexual life.Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I am 20yrs old, i have been having problems trying to have sex for 4 or 5 years now. It has ruined relationships, and going out to meet new people, my current gf does know and understands. And to be on the safe side to satisfy her needs i told my doctor and he gave me a few samples of Viagra. They worked great.  What i would like to know is what if i still have this problem again? My gf is long distance and i used these samples when i saw her. I don't want to be having to go, hey sorry hun you know me gotta pop the blue one or this show will get axed, i want to be spontaneous and able to have sex when and were ever without having to get worried that i may not perform. Until i had the blue tablet all my sexual encounters have been flops, but i'm fine when i'm on my own thought, the other day i couldn't stay soft it was rather frustrating.  I was thinking of having hypnotherapy to see if taking the feeling from the other day and applying it to all my sexual encounters. Or if there are other solutions. I want to kow your thoughts because this issue has gone on long enough and i don't want to go back to it, my gf and i have not had sex again since then and i feel that some of the time we were together was me not the blue pill, i don't know how long it lasts for but i think 8 or 9 hours it would have worn off by then.  if you can offer some advice that would be great cheers\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Name20,  I suspect that your difficulties may actually be psychological (not that I think you are crazy).  Physically, it appears that your sexual response is intact since you are able to  maintain an erection.  The brain is very powerful, so if there is some stress or concern over the issue it can be enough to keep you from maintaining an erection.  The Viagra likely would overcome this problem.  It may be that your mind is so concerned and stressed about the possibility of not being able to maintain an erection that it ends up becoming a self-fulfilling thought.  The stress from a previous past difficulty can easily become a focal point that ends up causing repeated difficulties.  You may want to discuss this with a psychologist (or other professionally trained counselor) who can help identify any of these issues that may be going on.  Often, once these are identified they can be addressed and the issue resolves.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I'm an 19 year old male, at 5'8\", weighing around 140 lbs. And for as long as I can remember having an erection, I've had a curved penis along with it. I went to my physician and after poking around for a few seconds, indicated that nothing was wrong. I've read online that to see whats wrong with a curved penis during erection, it would have to be errected.  He diagnosed me while well, I'm \"soft.\"  Plus he looks like he should be retired and originally got his degree in Vietnam, so I doubt his knowledge a bit. Other than having to get a new physician, there are no symptoms associated with the curvature I don't think. But sometimes after intercourse, there is a bit of soreness. Not sure if thats related. I want to give you an idea of the curvature so you can let me know if its severe or \"not normal\". Lets say a straight penis is at a 90 degree angle, mine would be around 80 degrees.(downward) So can you tell me what you think? Or suggest a certain type of physician?\n\n",

    "content": "It sounds alot like Peyronie's Disease    Peyronie's Disease is acquired in adult life rather than at birth (like hypospadias). It is caused by the formation of hard plaque on one on the upper or lower side of the penis in layers containing erectile tissue. The local inflammation eventually develops into a full scar. This scar tissue is hard and inflexible, and causes the penis to bend when erect. The effects of this bend are far less noticeable when the penis is in a flaccid state.  This affliction leaves the penis bent distinctly in some direction. and can result in pain during erection and  intercourse.  There is no need to worry about a curved penis unless the curve suddenly appeared and/or you're penis has experienced some sort of trauma.   I highly recommend that you see your health care provider who may refer you to a urologist.   Take Care  Dr. Anderson\n\n",

Penis curvature is not considered to be abnormal, with regards to your sex health, intercourse is a private and personal encounter between you and your partner and if you both are being satisfied then penis curvature is not to be  problematic to your performance.  If you have any questions I suggest that you seek a physcian who specializes in Urology.  Good Luck\n\n",

Many supplements, touted as \"natural\" are of questionable value and the contents are not regulated as other drugs are so they are not extensively tested as other drugs are for safety, efficacy, content (are they what they say they are and if so, is it the formulation they claim, the purity they claim,etc.)  These things may be safe but may also be of little or no value, yet they cost a lot of money.  Sex sells well!    There are some excellent products on the market for erectile disfunction such as Levitra, Viagra, and Cialis, available by prescription.  It's best to have a doctor evaluate your overall health to determine if you are a candidate, if this is truly the problem, and if you have any health conditions that might make them unsafe for you.  Thanks for your inquiry.  I'm sure there are many people who are also wondering about this.\n\n",

    "content": "I am 30 year old vergin(because of relegious reasons) male. A month before, I found that I have phimosis. After regulery streching my foreskin, I now can move my forskin comfirtably on my shaft.I am really happy about that. But since I can move my foresking over my shaft,now I can see that the there are few white pimples just behind the glans on my shaft under the foreskin. These pimples do not move, or do not change in size or there is no pain. The size of the biggest pimple is around 4 mm.I am really scared of this, could it be a cancer or STD ? Please advice.\n\n",

It was quite early when I responded to the post but thank you for bringing it to my attention. Hi rpatil1974, You are quite welcome for the response. If you would care to view this it may answer your questions. Pearly penile papules, some with a sebaceous prominence are quite normal in male genitalia. Click here   I hope this is helpful.

    "content": "Im 17 years old.   I noticed, a few monthes back, a couple small hard white spots on my shaft. They were located underneath, a few inches below the head. They werent really obstructing my day to day routine, so I decided to ignore them. I have forgotten all about them when suddenly, to my horror, I felt a lump on my penis. This lump was located exactly where one of the two spots had been. On  closer inspection, It appeared to be a pimple, and just a little prodding  forced it to ooze out a white substance. There was quite a bit of it, more then I had found in any of the few pimples I had gotten in other regions over the years. it actually reaccured once, but it again oozed out the substance, and since then its been lieing low. I thought I was in the clear. A few days ago the second white spot formed a similar, slightly larger, lump. I stopped myself this time, and checked online to see what it could be. Sebaceous cyst seems to fit the bill, but considering the location of the cyst(s), I don't know if im happy with the idea of surgery. But thats assuming that this is in fact a cyst. A part of me really doesnt want to know...but what else could it be? Benign I hope...I need advice. Im considering going to my parents, and then on to the doctor.   This lump sounds like what the other posters have described. I can only hope that my lump, as well as theirs, is benign, and will be an easy fix.   Thanks in advance.  -Teen In Need\n\n",

Also I have had oral sex and fooled around with a few more then five and still noone seemed to notice. Yes, white stuff will come out if squeezed but that is natural. These bumps have no cure and are completely normal. Like most I always worried something was wrong with me maybe an std or something but now I realized that it is not. At first there may not appear to be as many but as you get older you develope more and they also do but they will stop coming up around 17-21 years of age. So for everyone out there worrying it will be ok its natural.\n\n",

But what worries me is, next to the frenulum, on each side I have two bigger ones, the 4 look symmetrical and each have slightly less than 1 mm, they are hard like the others and they never change in size or anything. I hope I was specific enough, i'm a bit ashamed of showing it to a doctor, since it doesn't hurt or anything it might not be serious. Thank you.\n\n",

    "title": "White spots (not raised) on head of penis",
    "content": "(I do plan on going to a doctor soon)  Short Story:      I am worried about some spots that appear on the head of my penis. They are white, if not off skin colored, and they are not raised above the skin, so they are not bumps, they are spots. They cause a little bit of irritation and haven't gone away for what I think is a month, or longer. There is no puss, ulcers or open sores. What is wrong and how can I get rid of it?  Long Story: (figured it might help to know a lot more)      So, I'm 19 years old, and have had a little over 10 sexual partners in my life thus far. Currently, I am experiencing these white spots on the head my penis that are not raised, so I can't feel them, they are only visible. Also, it comes with a tiny amount of irritation that is not enough to bother me very much.      Also a few months ago, at the beginning of this school year, so September, I experienced what I am pretty sure was poison ivy on my penis shaft. See, my friends and I were having a fire and he was putting random weeds on it, and I believe that the smoke is what infected me. Anyways, it looked like poison ivy, felt/itched like poison ivy and I avoided scratching it as much as possible and it went away within a couple weeks.      Initially, I was afraid that the poison ivy was herpes (mostly because I had sex with a girl that people say she gets around right before I left for college), but I researched about it and it sounds like herpes involves puss and painful sores, etc. Also followed by ulcers, which I don't and didn't have. Also, I read somewhere that one can actually get posion ivy through the smoke from it burning.      Finally, about what? 9 months later... I'm experiencing the irritation and the visible, but not raised, white/off-colored spots that have been there for a good month I suppose. I do not know if these two instances are connected, but I mentioned it just in case. I'm just worried about it because I don't want a future sexual partner to see and say something, or if it is infectious I don't want to spread it to them. I guess I should mention also, that I thought the irritation might have been from masterbating while pretty dry.  So what is the diagnosis of these little white spots that aren't raised and don't cause any trouble except for a tiny amount of irritation? Any help is appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,Poison ivy dermatitis is predominently fluidfilled ie bullous in nature.Fordycee spots are normal but raised glands located mainly at the rim of penis but you have flat macular. The likely diagnosis with your sexual history points out to a fungal cause ie yeast based monilial balanitis which presents woth the mentioned features.Mild irritation is common. Antifungal external remedies like canesten creme are generally prescribed. Since there is no recurrence herpes is unlikely.Early vitiligo can present like this too. It is best to get examined but it is likely to be monilial. Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,Normally one would be able to hold ejaculations for about 2 minutes from the beginning of a penetration.A persistent problem of ejaculation with minimal stimulation would fall under premature ejaculation.An occasional premature ejaculation is ok and can be tackled with out professional help. This can happen as a part of erectile dysfunction when one would hurry up to finish it off before the erection would wane off. Psychological factors like anxiety,stress,and relationship problems could play a major role. Hormonal,reflex problems at the genital tract,infections,and some times inherited traits,medications are other known factors. Treatment would include counselling,squeeze technique in which at the point of coming the partner sqeezes the head of penis till the sensation passes away and restart the foreplay and redo the procedure. Local anesthetic cremes do help so do antidepressants in some.When using the extenal applications do bear in mind of allergic reactions. Best wishes.\n\n",

Now, it seems like I can no longer keep an erection anywhere near as long as before while sexually intimate. Also, it seems what will happen (instead of congested prostate) is a type of \"internal ejaculation\" where it seems like it happens in there somewhere and I'll end up urinating it out. If I do masturbate it out it doesn't really seem to want to come out either, comes out in a slow and weird way AND never really feels like it fully releases.  The only thing that has happened to me that I can immediately think of that might be related was getting hit in the penis/testicles while playing dodgeball the past 2 months. Is there anything else that can cause this? What can I do?\n\n",

    "content": "My boyfriend and I have had sex every day for the last several days.  Normally he ejaculates a lot of semen. But today and yesterday his ejaculate was little to none. There is at least a twelve hour period between us having sex. He has also complained of a lack of breath during sex. Is it safe to have sex more than once a day in his condition? Could he potentially hurt himself with continued sex and even lower amounts of ejaculate?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,The sperms are produced by the testis but the semen as it comes out is not just the sperms, but the fluids from the seminal vesicle and the prostate along with the sperms. The ejaculate would be about 1tsp full.Frequent discharge, while not harmful could lead to lesser ejaculate.The bulk of the volume is from the seminal vesicles and rest from the prostate and sperms. While it may not apply in your boyfriend's case some times a block along the tract could lead to lesser secretions.Retrograde ejaculation is where the ejaculate gets diverted back. You need not worry about this transient episode, in this case of your friend. Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hey,  Been curious for sometime now, i see these products saying bigger ejaculations and some stories of them working but with side effects of pain in the balls. But what i want to know is if there are any medical ways to improve or increase how much you can ejaculate? Such as Foods, supplements, exercises (ie PC), abstaining.  I have had moments were i have had sex, blown was still hard and ready to go so i went again and had blown again sometimes more, but both were impressive amounts both by my partners and my standards. What gets me is i can sometimes blow large amounts and then sometimes it might be an average text book amount.  I would like to consistently have larger amounts, i guess mainly for my own gratification i am pleased with what i can do now but i would also like to know how i can improve myself if i wanted too.  I have heard, zinc, magnesium, Vitamin B, and fish oil help.  And what are your opinions on the products that claim to increase the volume? Is it even remotely possible to do that? i sorta figure if they can make a tablet to make you go hard then why can't they make one to increase the volume?  But i would really like your help with how i can increase the amount of ejaculate I know its a really weird question but its something i would really like to increase.  Cheers\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Name20,  There are many substances that make the claims of increasing ejaculate volume.  However, when really objectively evaluated, most of them fall far short of actually being able to do what they claim.  Keep in mind that most of these substances fall in the category of a supplement and as such are not regulated by the FDA so their claims do not have to be backed up or proven.  Semen production is based on several factors, including overall health.  Probably the best thing you can do is be sure you are in the best health you can.  Beyond this there really isn't a medicine that will accomplish what you would like.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I recently began noticing that my orgasms were becoming less pleasurable and of a shorter duration. Having turned 40 last fall I was determined not to let my sex life slide into oblivion. I noticed that when I masturbated the volume of my semen was much less than when I was younger. It also had a yellowish color and would dribble out rather than shoot out like it used to.   The Internet is full of advertisements for expensive miracle semen boosters. I was skeptical and decided to seek my own, less expensive remedy and found it. Within a week of following these three steps I noticed a marked improvement in my semen volume, \"shooting ability\" and the physical pleasure derived at climax. Here is my secret recipe for FREE:  1. I began taking Vitamin C, Zinc, Selenium and Vitamin E on a daily basis. I consistently found these vitamins referred to on various reputable sites as being essential to the production of semen. I also increased the protein in my diet.  2. I stopped drinking sodas and began drinking a lot of water daily. I drink at least 8 large glasses of water throughout the day. The first few days will increase your trips to the bathroom but eventually your body will find a new water equilibrium.  3. Kegel exercises. Look these up on the Internet, they really do work. I am doing these exercises at least five times daily. Each time, I generally do two sets of 12 contractions holding each contraction for 5 seconds and resting for 5 seconds between each contraction. Then I do two sets where I contract and hold for 20 seconds. I try to do more of these if I have time. I found that traffic lights are a good time to get in a quick set of 10 to 12 reps and no one is the wiser. Do as many of these exercises as you can but be careful not to overdo it at first. Like any other muscle, I found that you can make yourself sore again. I am continuing to build on these adding more and longer reps.  After following this routine for a week, I decided to test the results. My ejaculation was both strong and had regained some distance. My semen volume practically doubled and the normal mixture of milk-like color and clarity had returned. I noticed a marked improvement in the duration and pleasurable sensation of my orgasm. And I saved myself a ton of money on so-called Semen booster pills.   Does this method seem reasonable? Is there anything I should do different?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Mhii,  Thank you for your input.  The things you recommend are keeping in line with the idea of maintaining optimal health.  Mild vitamin deficiencies are actually quite common so taking a daily multivitamin is a good idea.  Using specific vitamins can be good but be sure not to overdo any one particular vitamin since overdoses of vitamins can occur and carry their own problems with this.  Kegel exercises can be very helpful in strengthening the pelvic floor muscles that are important to sexual health.  These exercises essentially involve contracting and relaxing the muscles used as if one were going to stop the flow of urine.  Daily exercises can help strengthen these muscles but don't overdo these either or a muscle can be pulled in this area similar to pulling a leg muscle when overdoing leg strenthening exercises.  You are absolutely right about saving a lot of money, and this method is much more healthy for you.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Dr., apart from what you said, reasonable, it all depends on our body, health, age, etc. I\u00b4ve seen some videos of men with large sperm volumes but notice they had a big scrotum, or balls. Not sure if big balls, but rather a swallen, inflated scrotum.  I heard the scrotum can expand or contract with cold or hot water, for example. Is that important when looking for volume? applaying hot-cold? I wonder if these people use artificial ways to swallen their scrotum. Cause to me that explains it. I don't believe a single bit in any pill or medicine for this purpose. Thats all commercialism trying to sell you something. If it costs $$$ in their website, its spam, doesnt work.   I wonder if there are any natural home ways of getting a swallen scrotum, like filled with fluid, that will eventual be released in ejaculation. Thanks LuisK\n\n",

    "title": "Never had penile pleasure, low libido, psychol. v urological",
    "content": "I'm 26 years old. Male. I fancied girls in school, but began to wonder if I was gay around 14. Depression set in. Suicidal. I obsessed 24/7 over finding out if I really had \"turned\" gay, or was my past hetero feelings phase or mistake. I thought coming out my help, so I did. It didn't help. I started to notice girls more again around 16, but avoided relationships while still unsure. I watched hetero porn and noticed that women seemed to get more pleasure than guys (clitoris, multiple orgasms, no pressure to perform/pleasure, G spot, moan more = more enjoymen, etc) and this saddened me. I wanted equality.  I first (sorry) masturbated at 23, not out of pent up sexual frustration, but to get pleasure. But I didn't get any. Only the orgasm. Penile stimulation felt like rubbing my arm. I hoped sex would be better.   I admit to jelqing for about 5 months, around this time, but would have notice pleasure fading (not NEVER being there) if this were the cause.  Age 25: I promised myself to avoid relationships - but foolishly got involved with a girl who became my girlfriend. After performance anxiety (which I wondered if it was sexuality-based = anxious vicious cycle) for a long time, I started having sex, and that too was devoid of pleasure until the orgasm.  For a while I blamed my girlfriend who had not long had a child by her ex (widened vagina). But came to terms with it being me. And sunk into more depression. Only this time, I was able to give but not get pleasure. Any libido I have (which is terribly low) when I am around my gf is killed once I realize during sex that I'm getting no pleasure. I've become jealous of my girlfiend who loves sex, and women for whom it seems sex is one big Orgasm with bigger O's on top. Men have less pleasure (no moaning til the O). Then at the bottom of the chain, is me.  I've tried focusing on my pleasure, on hers, on my glans, on my frenulum, on relaxing, watching all kinds of porn including one with guys, attempted prostate stimulation [alone w/ Aneros massager (aneros.com)]...nothing.  I went to the doctor for a testosterone test: it came back average. He said: \"Some people just aren't sexual. It could be psychological\". Women who have this type of issue are offered advice/resorts: \"maybe it's your guy, focus on the clitoris, see your gyn\". I don't see guys who have ALWAYS had my problem.  I can't accept this. This week at work I was so anxious and depressed I cried and called a psychiatrist (apmt in 1 months time. Too long!) It has affected me as badly as the sexuality OCDlike depression. If I got pleasure from masturbation, I would say: \"YES! Def psychological\", but it seems I have no penile pleasure and a low libido (there has to be a relation?).  And my low libido is being further killed coz now I think \"why bother?\". I really feel this is more urological.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  Hopefully by now you've had your encounter with the psychiatrist, as this part of the puzzle does need to be addressed, although I am inclined to believe your depression is not the cause but rather a side effect of your concern with the problem. I further tend to think you're probably right, that this is either genitourinary or perhaps endocrinological, even if your testosterone levels are within normal limits. Other body chemistry can affect our sexual interest and abilities, and sometimes the cause can arise from overlapping areas both psychological and physical. A good psychiatrist should be able to at least help you deal with the stress of having had to live with this situation and the resultant  depression.  Please follow up with us as needed here,  and update us as  to anything new you learn.Best of luck to you.\n\n",

Afterwards I tried laying back down when i layed down I had a swimming feeling in my head everytime I closed my eyes,I started to get a weird sensation in my chest almost like it was really heavy.I got up because I couldnt sleep like that,and now I have this really terrible nagging feeling in my chest,thats feels Like I have to yawn,but I cannot yawn,and everytime I do happen to yawn my heart starts beating like it did whenever I woke up. Now I know i have this kidney infection but these symptoms feel so terrible,I feel so terrible ill almost like my entire body is shutting down,I don't know if I should take this seriously or if it is just caused by my sleep deprevation,also I have barely drank anything in the past 2 days and the same gos for eating. I just want to know if this could possibily be caused by my kidney infection or sleep deprevation. Should I take these symptoms seriously?Could they mean something more serious such as kidney failure,blood poisoning or heart problems?\n\n",

    "title": "Fiancee experiencing penile pain after intercourse.",
    "content": "For the past 2 years my fiancee (18) and I (19) have been intimate, we were both virgins and never had any other sex partners. We've been using a contraceptive film with spermicide because condoms always irritated me as well as him. We've been using the spermicide films for the longest with no irritations or problems at all (reactions and etc).   Just recently we were having vigorous intercourse like we usually do from time to time. He ejaculated and persisted to have me continue for him and myself to get the full enjoyment and possibly achieve another orgasm, well while I was on top of him \"grinding\" against him I should say, he told me he felt a pinching or a pain like sensation, we were fully lubricated and there was no friction. After I continued for a while he went flaccid. I dismounted and he went to the restroom to urinate and wash up, he then called me over and said he was in alot of pain, that it hurt to the touch. I asked if it was a burning, or a bruising pain and he couldn't really tell me anything except \"It's too painful to really tell.\" and that it felt like something made its way down inside the urethra, even the opening looked red around the edge.   Could it be that when I was still mounted on him after he ejaculaed that the spermide dried up in the urethra from not dismounting right away as well as dried semen that didn't escape during ejacuation? It was painful for him to even walk, and he mentiond pain towards the middle of his penis as well as if something was stuck.   When I mounted him that day his penis felt more erect and longer than it normally does, maybe cause he was aroused more than usual, could it be that he was overly erect and it stretched something?  Note: This is the first time something like this has ever happened.  Sorry, I'm full of questions, I'm just curious and worried that its something I may have done, or if its something really serious. Any information would be helpful and appreciated.   Thank you for your time.\n\n",

My boyfriend and I had never talk abaut when we were to become intimate and never really rush to it, then he got send away due to his legal status, so we did not see eachother often when we finally concrete to spend five days together we were very exited to see each other and thing got normally when becoming intimate (kissing, hugging and getting nude) but when it was time for him to penetrate, first of all could not fine my entrance, and when finally did he lost his erection he said because I took to long that were he comes from they just go ahead and do it, he try to bring his erection back by stroking and moving his member but nothing happend. I was left unsatisfy and humilated at that moment he didn't try to touch me until two day later and the same happend, he lost his erection I try then to strok his member and rub it to but did not work, I had only had one partner before him and I never had this problem.  Am I not sexually enough for him? or He is the problem? P.S My previous partner was older and was more sexually active, we had intercurse twice in a day when we meet for four days and three nights. My actual boyfriend is currently 33 and the only medical problem that he had was his tiroid\n\n",

Good luck  Im sorry but its nearly impossible for me accommodate to anything that has to do with my sex drive, I have tried to accommodate to it for years, but its groing stronger, If I beat off alot it Im still horny, if I don't beat off Im equally horny still and the hardons keep on picking fights with me, so i have to jerk for a long time and then Im in the circle again off excessive masturbation. I have never got any sex with a human being, Im not currently gettin any and I never will and thats a FACT.   There must be something to solve this problem, I know you say its normal, but I don't care about being normal, I just wanna stop being horny and stop jerking off all the time. I'll tell ye, Im diening over here!   This may sound like a joke to an average individual with ups and downs in there life,but my life is all about downs. I must say this is NOT a joke. I want my sex drive surgically removed, I don't belive so much in medecine, thats why I would be happy with surgical removing and thats lasting.  I just want it gone, the damn sex lust has ruined me completely, its the only thing I think about, I though it would go away with age, I'll tell ye, its just growing stronger!  I need it to be gone forever. I just wanna be able to live without sex, is that so wrong?? I must live without it, becuase I am one of those who don't get to share other peoples joy. And I can accept that, but I need my body to help me accept it as well, I think I will cut off my penis soon if it don't  PLEASE there must be something?     Im sorry Im weird\n\n",

    "content": "In my case it interferes with normal non-sex relationships. For all of those religious nuts out there, I've already tried not thinking about it and I do not nor ever have felt any guilt associated with my overactive sex drive. I was married at one time and was getting sex everyday and wasn't bothered by it. She left me for a more compliant partner. I have seen in drug adds about some substances having negative sexual side effects.   Give me bad side effect drugs any day! I have tried to overmasturbate to effectively disable the drive but I can still get it up and ejaculate after about an hour. ahem...when I was married it took 3 hours for me to reach the point of orgasm, but then it felt like someone was jamming a steel-bristle pipe cleaner in-and-out of my penis and another side effect was a small pain just above the base of my penis but below my navel. Some background: I have Klinefelter's Syndrome, and at birth my testicles  did not drop in time to stop them from being sterylized by my body heat. Any woman whom answers this will be concidered to be just seeking to remain in control through sex, coersion, ans public humiliation of a slightly disturbed man. BTW I'm 37.\n\n",

    "content": "Mr. Too Horny,  I am also sympathy with you about the problem of being too horny all the time. It is a good thing, I guess. Who can do things like we do? I am telling ya', women love the fact that we have such a strange sex drive. Don't be so bothered with it. Enjoy it. And if  you think it is ruining you .. then there is a solution: Get involved with more activities including some that will make money. Get a second job or take more classes.   From my own experience - I get less horny whenever I have too many things to do. After 2 or 3 days .. I realized that I have not masturbated for that long (I am away from my wife - she's overseas right now, waiting on the petition to be completed) ... then I start masturbating again .. and IT FEELS GOOD.    Conclusion: Don't feel bad, if you want to stop the drive .. don't cut your balls off .. Just find other things to do that will take up most of your time. You'll have a wholesome life. Life is a sh*t without SEX, I am telling ya!  Masturbators Society Copyrighted 2006.  Good luck!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Small Penis Size Rectification",
    "content": "Hello, I know it won't probably help to tell you that you are within the normal range.  An erect penis less than four inches might be considered small, but a woman's vagina is typically between three and four inches in length, and stretches to accommodate the particular penis, so what you have is what is needed and has little to do with performance, virility, etc.    Every man alive has probably worried about this and compared to others.  Yes, there is a great deal of variability with size but in function, larger is not better.    Treatments are limited in effectiveness and the risk in surgery or other lengthening techniques such as stretching includes the possibility of adversely affecting function.  In this case, function trumps appearance so it would be a risk I wouldn't recommend.  Results are minimal at best and there are quacks out there too so if you do see a doctor, see a board-certified urologist.  Most of the size improvements claimed only affect the length in the flaccid state for appearance.  Also, keep in mind from your view, it will look smaller than it will to the other person.    You don't say if you are in a sexual relationship but I would not recommend you do anything until you at least see how things go.  If you are able to perform well, why mess with success.  Try not to compare to other men.  In a relationship, she is not going to line you up and compare side by side or take measurements.  Also, a woman's most sensitive sexual organ is the clitoris which is at the distal end of the vagina (near the outside).  Length will not affect this at all.  Being a gentle, caring, and considerate lover will mean more to her than size.  If not, she has some problems of her own to deal with.    Pills, patches, creams, exercises, suction, stretchers and other treatments you can get over the internet are not effective but will waste a lot of your money.  Some treatments add girth by injecting some of your own fat, but this is of limited use.  Other surgical treatment cuts through the supporting ligament, causing the penis to be a bit longer when it hangs loose, but what's the point there?  It would not be worth the risk of possibly causing irreversible damage.  Any treatments do come with complications, have minimal, if any, results and will cost a lot of money.  So, before embarking on anything, make sure you see a good urologist and only undergo treatment if he feels it is needed.  Good luck.\n\n",

This past time, I put smooth carrot up there. But, it may have been too large. I used a lot of lubrication, and I didn't force it in. But, since then, 10 days ago, I have had discomfort and slightly irregular bowel habits (although no severe diarrhea), with increased burping and the feeling and of air 'moving around' in my abdomen. However, I HAVE NOT had a fever, severe pain, or any bleeding in my stool, I also haven't had a distended belly. Also, there is definitely NOTHING still up there. So, I don't think I perforated anything. Should I go see a physician, or wait out some of the abdominal irritation? And, if I did go, what would they do to me with that information? Some of this I think may be from worry, and depression. Sorry again, and thanks very much for answering!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, There could be a number of reasons for this, including psychological concerns, but the hernia surgery would not be the problem.  He can relax about that and try not to feel pressure to perform, but let things come naturally.  If he continues to have trouble he could consult a therapist or urologist.  I suspect with time the problem will correct itself.  Sometimes masturbation results in a particular style of arousal that is not the same with a partner.  While many men have no problem doing both; others do so he may want to try avoiding the masturbation for a while to see if he is able to perform better in the relationship.  Most important is to be understanding about it and aware that almost all men experience this at times.  It is very rarely any kind of serious concern.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I am suffering from dry oragsm i.e. no semen or very less semen that too sometimes is ejected after masturbation. I am 25 yrs old. I am not very much clear on which doctor to consult for it. After reading certain posts on internet, I found that I should consult a urologist. Is this correct, should i go for urologist.? Around 8-9 yrs back I had met with an accident, wherein I was hurt in kidney, for 2 days there was red urine until the bladder was cleaned with distilled water. Since then only I seem to have this problem. Please advise.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,The first thing here is to rule out a dry orgasm and differentiate it from retrograde ejaculation.If after a maturbation urine is collected and examined,shows sperm cells it is retrograde.If there are none it is dry.There is no problem here for sex but the problem here is for fertility.Dry orgasm needs to be investigated further because there may be problem of production or conduction.Retrograde ejaculation means the sperms are produced and instead of coming out gets diverted to the bladder.Medications,surgeries relating to the genitourinary tract,spine inuries all can cause retrograde problems.The best person to contact is a urologist.Ok?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Retrograde ejaculation - whom to consult",
    "content": "Hi,  Retrograde ejaculation can be defined as the 'total' or occasionally  'partial' absence of a normal antegrade ejaculation because semen passes backwards through the bladder neck into the bladder.  As your urinalysis (pre and post ejacualation) & history suggests that there is a strong possibility of a partial retrograde ejaculation and the USG has shown a significant residual volume (post-void residue).  Urinary bladder out-flow obstruction is a known cause of retrograde ejaculation.One is led to think of this in the abscence of neurologic causes and pharmacologic causes.  Some of the causes of urethral obstruction are...  - Urethral stricture,  - Urethral obstruction  - Urethral valves or verumontanum hyperplasia and - Ectopic ureterocele.   your doctor was right in suggesting an endoscopy to exclude/treat one of these causes. Best wishes!\n\n",

He says that it feels like no blood is flowing to his penis.  We tried having sex and had to stop it was causing so much pain, at that point the bump/lump was bleeding.

    "title": "Variation in my erect size.",
    "content": "I have kind of a strange question here.  I have noticed extreme variations in my own penis' erect size.  Just last night, I had sex with this girl for the first time and my  penis was only around 5.5 inches and maybe smaller.  I've actually measured my penis on separate occasions and gotten a bit over 7 and around 5.5 inches.  The thickness is usually thicker when I'm longer, but its just as hard either way.  One thing I've noticed is that it takes a lot longer for me to ejaculate when I'm shorter, and I'll have to usually go hard and fast to even come at all.  Girls have noticed this too.  My last girlfriend was shocked at the size of my penis the first time she saw it because it had to have been 7.5 inches and it was really thick too, but then after we got comfortable together I went back down to a bit over 6.  She would always say, \"It's not as big as that one night.\"  I work out a lot, and I've taken testosterone boosters, but they don't really seem to have any effect on the size.  I'll get more erections when I'm on these supplements, but they range just like normal and are actually usually smaller.   The one thing I think it could be is that I'm a type one diabetic.  I was wondering if high/low blood sugar could have an effect and what effect that would be.  I'm 20 years old and almost 21.  This problem has messed with my head a little bit.  For instance, last night I could tell in the girl's face that she was unimpressed.  I know this variation isn't normal and want to always get the most out of my erection.  I feel like I have low virility or something because when its not all the way hard (but it actually is hard) I'm not really enjoying the sex and am just waiting for it to get longer but it never does.\n\n",

    "content": "Oh, and another thing.  I'm not saying that 5.5 is small because I know it's normal.  I just don't get the same satisfaction when it's this way because I'm not fully stimulated.  The girl the other night may not have been 'unimpressed'.  More like I was just disappointed and could have just thought that.  I'm really more concerned for my own personal satisfaction and would be more than willing to respond with more details if they would help anyone to respond with a reason behind this fluctuation.\n\n",

If these problems started after starting this medication then the Lexapro could be causing some of your problems. Are you stressed out or have other things on your mind. That can also make it hard to achieve an orgasm during intercourse or masturbation. Please discuss this with your physician, there are anti-depressant medications that may have fewer sexual side effects. They can't be fixed if your physician doesn't know about them. I hope this helps.  Adrianne G, RN\n\n",

    "content": "Hello bspit8, The fact that the problem with climax from masturbation is a new development is actually encouraging and likely temporary.  You can see a doctor to be sure there is no physical cause such as illness, diabetes, hormonal deficiencies, etc.  If you take medication, consider that as a potential problem.  Side effects of some medications can cause sexual problems.    I wonder if this has some psychological basis.  Perhaps something is going on in your life that is disruptive, but you are not consciously aware of it.  You could talk to a therapist.  Also, some people perform best only in a committed relationship.    If you don't find any physical or emotional cause, it might help to relax about the sex and see if a break might result in a better outcome after a while.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "good day kandc, i have read your message pertaining to your husband's dillema of being incapable of reaching orgasm for 10 years? there are different factors that may have affected your husband's sex life. ONE is LIFESTYLE... (1) Does he smoke? how long? (2) does he drink? how long? Smoking and drinking habits are one of the lifestyle factors that could affect your husband's reaching the orgasm he wanted.  SECOND is illness... (1) Does he have diabetes? Hypothyroidism? Hypogonadism? Stroke? If he has any of these illnesses then this could be the factor why he is having difficulties in sex. Therefore, consult a physician for further management.  THIRD is INJURIES... (1) Did he have any car accidents? falls or any incidents that he has been injures? This factor are also common to men having difficulties on achieving there orgasm. Then on, see a specialist for further examination.  FOURTH is PHYSCHOLOGICAL FACTORS... (1) Was he recently been depressed? or anxious? or having any panid disorders?  These factors could may easily affect the urge of your husband during sex thus having the inability to have orgasm.   FIFTH is MEDICATION intakes... (1) Does your husband take any medications? such as anti depressants? anti anxiety? Because there are some medications that really affects the men's libido or sexual urge.  SIXTH is FOREPLAY... (1) They say the longer you play your sensitive organs of the body, the more kisses, and touch, the better and best way of achieving orgasm. Foreplay is considered to be the most essential part in doing sex, especially that according to studies, men are mostly capable of achieving great climax on the first round of mating while we women could achieve several orgasms. So, if you do good foreplay for your husband, the better. Take time, enjoy the part of foreplay, give sparks and chemistry and art in sex. Besides, SEX IS AN ART.\n\n",

    "content": "Regarding the young man who cannot climax with sex and the husband who is also having touble.  The responses here deal with primary and secondary anorgasmia very well and bring to light most of the major points concerning these diagnoses. The young man's problem, assuming that he has climaxed at one point or anther in the past, is likely due to the SSRI medication Lexapro. This slows down nerve conduction and dulls sensation and is commonly used to treat early or premature ejaculators.   The husband's issue may be more complex and involve all of the issues raised in the responses and also one of idiosyncratic masterbatory behavior, in which techniques of sexual self stimulation deviates enough from intercourse with the partner that one or the other is getting more difficult to do routinely. An experienced sex therapist can help enormously here in helping the individual change their sexual practices to align the two forms of sexual stimulation more closely.\n\n",

    "content": "I tried posting my own topic on this, because my problem is pretty different. I have never been able to orgasm during sex, oral or coital, but can during masturbation, but not when my partner does it. I think it's either due to my weight, or because I masturbate too often, though there have been periods of depression where an erection has been difficult to maintain, and orgasm just as difficult to obtain.  I think it largely has to do with the fact that when I masturbate, I pump harder on the shaft. If I work the head of my penis, a clear liquid comes out that is watery in texture, but doesn't look or smell like urine. At first, I thought it was precum, but now I'm not so sure, as someone told me that precum doesn't squirt, it drips.  This has me further worried that my insides are weird, and I might never be able to conceive a child. I don't have a partner at present, but it's a dream I have, down the line. I've been able to ejaculate if I masturbate, and insert as I reach climax. Nevertheless, the squirting has me concerned, as it's definitely not pee. I can squirt, and then go pee, without a hiccup, so it doesn't make sense.\n\n",

    "content": "I have had a good search through your site and can't find anything relating to a problem relevant to my situation, So maybe you can help ease my mind before I bite the bullet and go down the doctors with it.  I have a lump which appears beneath the foreskin of my penis and it seems to be situated over an artery, when my penis is in its Flaccid state this lump isn't noticeable, I can't even feel anything present when I venture the area of its origin, when I become erect this lump is clearly visible and causes minor discomfort, it has not increased in size over the time I have been aware of it. I am concerned that this is a weak spot like you would find on a worn ballon and any aggressive sexual activity will weaken it further.  I am especially embarrassed about going to the doctors for this due to the reason that it is only visible when I am erect.  Please put my mind at rest here and tell me you have an idea what his may be.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi problemguy, I do not understand what you mean by testicle hernia. Masturbation should not usually produce a reduction in size of the testicle. One has to seek other explanations. As far as erections and ejaculations are concerned,lay off and get some well deserved rest for sometime.Concentrate on other activities. This will give time for your genitourinary system to cope and get back to normalcy.Good luck!\n\n",

    "title": "Bump on penis. Hurts!!",
    "content": "2 days ago after i had sex i found a pimple like bump on my penis. I thought it was a pimple except for underneath the skin in the area around it, its feel hard and hurts to touch.I did what you would do with any other pimple and popped it. It popped like a normal pimple, a little bit of puss then it was good. The next day i checked it again and it was still there. So i tried popping it again and it did the same as the first time, a little more puss than last time but that was probably because i squeezed it a bit harder trying to get it all out. Now finally today im here because it is still in the same spot in the same condition. I tried popping it again today but only blood came out and its now more irritated and hurts from simply grazing my boxers. The skin underneath is still hard and the head is red and kind of shiny looking.  Im almost positive its not an STD because i had sex with the same partner who ive been having sex with for over 3 years and just recently had a military medical screening. Some people say it could have been the friction and just wait it out but im really concerned. So before i spend the money for a trip to the doctors i figured id ask here. If any doctors on here need a picture or any more information id be more than happy to oblige.  Thank you\n\n",

    "content": "Hi straight, Have you found the answer by now?  I am a recent member of 'Doctors Lounge'. Firstly, what do you mean exactly by celibate? Do you mean 'choosing to remain unmarried' ( the old meaning) or do you perhaps mean 'refraining from sex' ( 20th century interpretation)?? It has everything to do with self control. If a person is dedicated to achieving 'celibacy' (either of the two meanings alluded to)... 'controlling the mind' is perhaps the answer. If you feel that 'you can not control your mind', then the options are fairly obvious...Only you have to choose.You may not find a true expert in these matters that easily. Good luck!\n\n",

(although you are 20 years old). The pain you are describing is likely due to prostatitis. An ultrasound may give a clue to this and occasionally a prostatic massage and examination of the prostatic fluid thus obtained may be useful in diagnosis. Another condition to be excluded of course is a UTI. Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "I have recently noticed a loss of sensation in the skin on my penis, scrotum, and nipples. Most of the skin feels like it has been numbed with novacaine. There are a few areas of skin that have retained their sensitivity, in fact some areas are overly sensitive. I am still able to have an erection and ejaculate--I believe I reach ejaculation too quickly. I am 25. I am not taking any medication. The most severe medical condition I have is that I was diagnosed with gout five years ago. Through a more balanced diet I have not had any issues with my gout. I have never had sex and I have even abstained from masturbation for over the last three months, with no improvement in sensitivity. When I masturbated before, I never exceeded once per day.  What could be the cause of this lack of sensitivity? Could it be from being too rough during masturbation? What can I do to fix this?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi dataha259, If the sensations in these so called 'erogenous zones' has to blunt all at once, anatomically speaking, the following nerves have to be affected simulteneously.... - the 5th and 6th intercostal nerves (spinal cord segments D5 & D6) which supply the    nipples, - the dorsal nerves of the penis(segments S 2,3 & 4), - the perineal nerves(S2,3 & 4) which supply most of the scrotum and - ilio-inguinal nerves (segment L1) which supply root of the scrotum. It is far-fetched to think of an organic disease which selectively affects these spinal segments. There are however, some diseases that can affect the penile skin, scrotal skin or the nipple-areola complex (but, mostly not affecting simulteneously)... - eczemas - sebeceous cysts - pilonidal sinuses etc.  I fully agree with the advice of Dr.Jagesh kamath.

It doesn't really itch at all, but when I masturbate it gets painful and it gets worse. It even bled at one point.  I have been putting antibiotic cream on it, and also anti-fungal cream, but this doesn't seem to work. Any diagnoses as to what this could possibly be? I've been reading a lot on the interent and now I'm wondering if it's a male yeast infection. like I said, I haven't had sex on over 7 years, but I do masturbate a lot.

I had sex about 2 weeks before, and got a BJ without a condom.   Should I be concern about this? What can I do to get rid of the irritation? could this be something more serious or just the result of shaving?  Thanks for your help!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Does masturbation produce varicoceles?...  There are very many conflicting views.But the fact is that there is as yet no conclusive proof to prove or disprove this association.Also,there is no conclusive proof that stopping masturbation improves varicoceles. Long- standing varicoceles do affect spermatogenesis. Semen mixed with urine sometimes occurs due to failure of the internal sphincter to close during ejaculation.Whether this is related to masturbation...no studies that i know of, prove this.Prostatomegaly at your age is rather unusual.These need to be investigated by a urologist. Cheers!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there,  Ive just stumbled across your site after endless research into the subject of phimosis. I would be hugely grateful of any advice/suggestions.  I'm 22, uncircumcised, and fairly inexperienced in the world of sex. It's only recently that Ive become aware that the foreskin is actually meant to retract. It's been forward my whole life, even hanging over a bit. I've never had any problems with masturbation or urination so I thought nothing of it. Anyway, recently I've attempted to have sex 3 times, each time resulting in paraphimosis, which was hugely unpleasant. The first time it happened I went to the doctor and he just 're-arranged' the foreskin and sent me on my way. The second time I went to the doctor again (a different doctor) and he did nothing, just said that when the swelling goes down the foreskin should return to normal. That didn't happen. The swelling got worse and the blood was clearly being cut off. So I got on the phone to the NHS direct and they sent me to an ER where they returned my foreskin to normal by just pulling and pushing alot. I was advised to either 'use more lube' or to get circumcised. Not a massive fan of the whole circumcision idea and I don't really want to carry a bottle of lube in my pocket for the rest of my life. So i googled and found out about stretching. I am able to retract the foreskin very slightly when flacid (to reveal a pea-sized amount of the glans). When I do this the ring of open skin at the end of the foreskin looks quite red and disgusting. I was concerned about Phimosis related infections, is this a sign? Or is it possible the redness around the end of the foreskin is caused from tearing during my paraphimosis episodes? Also, I have (and have always had, since I can remember) a dark red line on the underside of my penis from the bottom of the shaft to the tip of the head. Is this a sign of infection? I really want to try the stretching technique but am worried about infection preventing it as I don't want to waste months to find out that circumcision really is the only option.  I am currently overseas so it's difficult to see a doctor and I would really like to avoid surgery... I heard that the stretching technique doesn't work with severe cases of phimosis, or cases which have been caused by infection (I should probably mention that I've never had unprotected sex). I would be hugely grateful of a quick reply as the whole thing is frankly driving me mad! Thanks so much\n\n",

There are still lots of \"snake oil\" sales people out there and many of the claims made are not substantiated.  Since I don't know which ones you refer to I can't say for certain, but if I were you, I would seek the  help of your family doctor or specialist such as a urologist who would know of any effective treatments, including anything available over-the-counter. Usually the condition is treated with medication, sexual therapy and psychotherapy, often incorporating some exercises such as the squeeze technique that can help you learn to delay the ejaculation.    Most of the remedies you come upon likely contain some form of local anesthesia to decrease the sensation that lead to the premature ejaculation.  This may turn out to be an outrageously expensive way to get this treatment.  Alone it would not be as effective as it would be as part of a treatment plan, but it is possible it could help to some degree if that is the active ingredient.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I have noticed that whenever I am aroused or my penis is stimulated, I start to develop lumps on my inner thighs right below the bottom of both of my testicles (lumps are on my legs). After ejaculation, these lumps become bigger and harder (painful) and sometimes a brownish puss will come out of one of them (left side). The left side one showed up first and after a couple of weeks the one on the right side showed up. The lumps will start to get smaller after ejaculation but will never totally go away. I was wondering if this is normal in any way, and if I should get this checked out soon or not. I am kind of embarrassed about this so I don't want to have to get this checked out unless it is vital.\n\n",

    "content": "When i was about 8-10 or so, i used to play hockey and we won a championship game and i tired to jump over the boards with excitement. I miscalculated and landed on my left testicule. It immediatly felt soft and hot and then after a couple of seconds, i felt tremendous pain. Ever since, my testicule has had an odd shape and when i look at the side of my scrotum it looks like there are a bunch of misplaced tubes. It hasn't really caused me problems until recently when itt changed shape and i felt a dull pain. Worried of what i was seeing, i moved it around a bit and it slipped into it's regular shape. Ever since then, when ever i stimulate it, i get this pain. I also get the pain sometimes just out of the blue. During the pain, i get a pulling sensation in my stomach. I was wondering if this is dangerous in anyway, if it cause potential problems or just any thoughts you have on this subject.\n\n",

They seem red with a whitish core that cannot be squeezed to expell purulent. The blisters do not itch and are not painful.   Incidentally, I received oral sex a week ago. I am scared it's an STD of some sort, except that my body seems to have been battling other minor illnesses recently (e.g. strep throat treated by IM antibiotic injection) and I'm not sure if it's because my immune system has been run down. Also, I spent a month out of the country as recent as a week ago.   I know STD clinics commonly check for chlamydia, gonorrhea, etc., but I don't think I have those things. I have oral herpes and this looks nothing like it (most distinguishing is that the blisters are not even in close proximity to one another).   What do you think?\n\n",

    "title": "Both Testicles, Ruptured Veins, Testicular and Abdomen Pain.",
    "content": "About 5 years ago, as a teen I was horse-playing with a friend. There was no direct trauma anywhere in my abdomen/groin area, but my scrotum swelled with blood and became pressure-sensitive. I did not seek medical attention until the next day. The mass in its entirety was about the size of a soft ball, with particular discomfort in my left testicle, with pain extending to my hip. I was given a sonogram, but the results were inconclusive on account of the blood.  The pain decreased as the swelling subsided, but the discomfort ensued, often for weeks at a time. I have the symptoms of what is often described as a 'bag of worms' or vericocele. The pressure seemed to be temporarily relieved through ejaculation. Feels like a vein is pulling on my testicle from my intestine.  A year later, I had another sonogram done and found no abnormalities, short of a cyst on my right testicle.  One week ago, I began to wake up in the morning with testicle pain, only this time in my right. I attributed the discomfort to my diet of recent, which has consisted of sweet tea, bread, cheese and soup. Yesterday I was in agonizing pain which started as a discomfort in my testicles but spread to my hip area. My right testicle is seemingly going through the same issues my left had years ago. The vein has tightened and ruptured, pulling the testicle and somewhat twisted, into my abdomen. There is also bruising on my scrotum, to the inside of my leg.  I am somewhat under the suspicion there could be a constipation issue at work. I gave myself enemas and laxatives, which has seemed to relieve some of the pain. I can't afford to go to the emergency room on account of severe constipation. Any suggestions? I would have imagined being diagnosed with an ingeial hernia at my prior sonograms, correct? Could an STD such as Chlamydia be to blame? I have had blood work done within the last 2 years when checking for unrelated, undiagnosed problems. Would such a test have been done?  I would be very grateful for any suggestions that may be offered. Thank you.\n\n",

    "title": "Desensitised penis",
    "content": "Hello,  I am in my early 30s and very recently noticed that my penis lacks the sensitivity it usually has, which has resulted in difficulty getting and maintaining erections. Erections usually come by easily and quickly for me and the fact that recent oral sex and masturbation whilst stimulating my other erogenous zones (esp nipples) fail to properly get me an erection and maintain it is deeply worrying. Normally, even solely stimulating my nipples would be sufficient to give me an erection...  Up to just before the problem started, I had been using this new mastubatory toy that I recently acquired, which was a fantastic product and resulted in my using it 3-4 times a night sometimes, with successful ejaculations. Could this have been the reason for my current problem - using the toy too much? Also, to guarantee that I get a full erection and hence satisfaction every time I ejaculate in any one evening, I have been known to take a fifth/quarter of the blue pill, which was enough of a dose for it to be effective on me. Could it be that I've taken too many portions of the pill over the past few months?  Now, when I get to ejaculate (and I seem to be able to eventually do so even without a full, proper erection), my penis feels a little bit \"battered\" afterwards. I cant see any signs of damage on the skin, but then again I'm not a medic. I have been applying moisturiser on my penis every day over the past couple of weeks.  Really hope someone can help me with this.\n\n",

The nerve ending connected to the left testicle are kind of bulged and seem to be swollen. If i do not masturbate for few days they are good but else it is painful. The scrotum becomes loose soon after masturbation and touching those nerves near the left testicle gives me pain.   I consulted doctor a year ago about the problem and he gave me a medicine but did not complete the course of it.  I need help cause i cannot consult this with any doctor over here in USA. Please try to provide me medicine so that i have regular sex life in the future.  Thanking You  Rahul\n\n",

    "content": "Hi rahulverma2008, If you feel comfortable with masturbation then there is certainly nothing wrong with this activity. There are several structure located in the scrotum, the spermatic cord, prostate, epididymis just to name a few. The epididymis is the storage area for sperm. Inflammation or an underlying infection of any of these structures may cause considerable pain or discomfort. If you were previously evaluated by a physician and a medication was prescribed, as a guess on my part, it sounds like you were experiencing an underlying infection. I would suggest that you have an evaluation by a physician to identify the underlying problem and if a medication/antibiotic is prescribed be sure to finish it completely as directed. Unfinished antibiotics do not completely clear infections and repeated episodes of this practice may cause a resistence to develop to that particular drug. Best wishes.

I do however understand what you are saying. Thinking and worrying about it only makes it worse, so focus on her and just enjoy everything and keep trying.  But I was wondering if you know if there are any vitamins or something that I could take that might help? Or if this Kegel exercise actually works?   Once again thank you for taking the time to respond.\n\n",

    "title": "Lack of sensitivity on penis skin",
    "content": "Hi,  I am 39 years old, male. I am a regular masturbator since years. Lately (a few months) I have noticed that I don't have any sensation on the skin of my penis (I have some on the top and head part, but none elsewhere). Can this be a skin damage caused by masturbation? Or what else can it be? How can it be treated.  Before going to a doctor I must know first what is normal. What is the sensation status of the penis skin normally, when it is erected and while it is not erected. How can I test myself the sensitivity, normally, before going to a doctor?  Since I haven't had any sexual intercourse with a woman since about 2 years I cannot give any such experience information, I don't know if it would turn to be sensitive in such a situation.  Also my left testicule is much smaller than the right one and it goes inside and comes outside occasionally, especially during masturbation, sometimes i have to press over it to get it outside. I don't know if this is a serious problem and if it has any connection with above mentioned issue.  Would using a cream like a regular one, like Nivea, provide any help?  Thanks in advance for any lightening response.  Best regards\n\n",

    "content": "I am in my early 20s and cant remember if I don't think my penis was every really straight.  However, I have a curve of maybe around 45 degrees or so half way up my penis which faced upwards. It is rather prominent but give me no trouble in penetration.  I was concerned a little about Peyronnie's disease so I had an ultra sound on it around 2 years ago but they found no plaque and therefore said it was not Peyronnie's.  I don't really have any pain although if I tense my kegal muscles (in a way that makes my penis move without touching it) then it can hurt a little on the top where the bent begins, but im not in severe pain when have erections or anything.  Also I believe the area around the curvature is thinner in a kind of hour glass shape (although not as drastic of course and I would say this is most evident in stage between flacid and erect) and perhaps shorter (like its sucked in/eaten away). I suppose you could call this a kind of indentation (which I heard is a symptom). But my curve is also evident when the penis is flacid - for example if I pull the foreskin back from the base of the shaft - if this has any bearing on whether its natural or not.  In its current condition of curvature I am not too fussed however, would be concerned if the thinning was a result of Peyronnie's rather than natural curvature and I would hate to think that it is eating away at my penis so to speak.  Any input would be appreciated.   Thank you in advance.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Actually there are several possibilities to this.  Balanitis is inflammation of the glans penis commonly seen in uncircumscribed men. It usually causes redness and/or a blotchy rash on the glans, sometimes with a discharge.  Balanitis may have any of multiple bacterial and fungal origins.  Another condition known as balanitis xerotica obliterans is the term given to lichen sclerosus et atrophicus when it involves the glans or prepuce.   The cause of this benign disorder remains unknown, but is possibly autoimmune. The condition is observed in uncircumcised males.  The onset of this disease is usually incidious. It is associated with scarring and fissure formation. Clinically it presents as a well-defined, flattened, pale gray-to-white/ivory patch that looks like wrinkled cigarette paper.  On the other hand, minor trauma to the meatus or shaft of the penis can result from allergens, mechanical trauma, intercourse, oral sex, or chemical irritants. These mechanically induced lesions\u2014as well as those mediated by chemical substances\u2014are often seen in young men who masturbate.  Given the limitations of the internet as a diagnostic tool, you are advised to seek a direct clinical examination to reach the proper diagnosis.  Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "I have a curve in my penis. Although in my early 20s I cant really remember if it is worse than before. It bends upwards, around half to two thirds of the way up my penis. The curve is rather extreme (maybe 45 degress I cant really tell) but hasn't hampered intercourse thus far.  I can't feel any bump and 2 years ago I had a urologist do an ultra scan on the area of the curve and they found no plague.  The area around the curve when in a semi erect state particularly (and to a lesser state when flacid) is thinner and feels somewhat sucked in a bit like it has been eaten away long ways to (almost like an hour glass effect) and when I peel the foreskin back the curve/indentation is present when flacid to an extent.  I feel no real pain other than if I stress the kegal muscles in a way that the penis moves when erect it can be slightly tender around the curve however nothing drastic otherwise (unless the penis has had continous vigorous/repeated action over a small space of time) the it mignt be a little tender.  Does this sounds like Peyronie's - Should I be worried about this eating the tissue or anything?   Perhaps I maybe had a bout in the past and this is what it has left?

    "content": "hi snuck,          peyronie's though found in only 1-4% of male population can commonly be confused with cogenital normal curvature of penis which is found in much higher percentage of males and is perfectly normal . though in both conditions penis can crossly be described as slightly curved but the curve in congenital deviation is not that marked in shaft and there is only a a deveation of penis from diraction thats directly forward. this cure also gets a bit masked when erection is achieved while in peyrinie's the things move other way around.           as far as i understand a fibrous plaque in the shaft that may feel like a hard cord or an elongated small lump is a must for diagnnosis of peyronie's. In addition, narrowing and or shortening of the penis may occur. Pain felt in the early stages of the disease often resolves in twelve to eighteen months. Erectile dysfunction, in varying degrees, often accompanies these symptoms in the later stages of the disease process. The condition may also make sexual intercourse painful and/or difficult, though many men report satisfactory intercourse in spite of the disease.          the best thing that i can advise u is to seek out a urologist who specializes in Peyronie's Disease, as the disease and its current treatments are not well understood by general practitioners or family doctors.          don't take it lightly as in about one third of the patients can develop fibrosis in other elastic tissues of the body, such as on the hand or foot causing various contractures of hands or feet and if u r a caucasion the incidence is even higher.          once u get it properly diagnosed medical science does offer various management orients of this disease and about one tenth of cases can even improve sponateously . as last resort however surgery can be performed to cure the curvature .\n\n",

In the case of penile trauma resulting in a rupture of the lining of the cylinder (corpus cavernosum) you would have a cracking sound but it would also be quite painful and most likely result in bruising due to blood escaping.  That would require immediate attention from a doctor.    It is possible you suffered a small tear; not enough to do serious damage requiring repair but possibly enough to refrain from sex for a few weeks to allow for complet healing.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Orgasm before Erection",
    "content": "Hello, This condition is called premature ejaculation, a common sexual complaint by as many as one in three men at some time in their life.  The cause can be either psychological or biological (or a combination).  It is both common and treatable with medication, psychological counseling and education in techniques.  You should talk to a doctor - family practice or urologist - who can instruct you in techniques and treatment.    Sometimes antidepressants help since a common side effect is the negative impact it can have on sexual activity.  So, in this case it is used for the side effects, a common practice with medications.  Topical anesthetic creams like lidocaine or prilocaine can sometimes help too. In some cases the partners have also had a decrease in sensation so it's not perfect.    Psychotherapy often includes both partners and possibly a sex therapist who sometimes can assist with psychological issues surrounding the relationship.   There is also a \"squeeze\" technique that may help.  In this, your partner sqeezes the end of your penis, where the glans joins the shaft.  Maintain until the urge to ejaculate passes. After the squeeze is released, wait for about 30 seconds, then go back to your usual foreplay and sexual activity.  The erection usually returns once activity is resumed.  This can be repeated if necessary and eventually you can learn to delay the ejaculation.  I hope this helps.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I would recommend a consult with a board-certified urologist for a medically proven treatment plan which may include medications (oral vitamin E or meds to decrease swelling, or meds injected directly into the plaque).  Surgery is a good option but only after all other methods have been explored because it is a complex operation and in some cases men have phases of improvement.  Undergoing a surgical procedure, which always comes with some risk, would be done during an active phase of the condition.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Sometimes undescended testicles result in fertility problems, but not necessarily.  For this reason, telling your partner might not hurt,  If childbearing is a significant goal for your partner this may make a difference or affect the relationship.  Sometimes surgery reveals that one testicle is missing so it is possible that this is what occurred in your case rather than one being removed.  This is not serious as one can function just fine.  There is a slightly higher risk of testicular cancer in men who have had this condition.  You would want to be in touch with your doctor about the advisability of screening for this.     Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, These are serious relationship issues that may require a marriage therapist to resolve.  If your husband is not considering your needs or assuming that his erection problems mean he has no responsibility there, we are dealing with some serious concerns and selfishness issues.  This can eventually doom a relationship so should not be taken lightly.  There are ways for your husband to express love to you and give you sexual satisfaction even if he is unable to climax through intercourse himself.  He needs to learn how to do this and a therapist might be helpful.  There are also books available that may help him to learn alternative techniques.    One of the problems with porn use is that many men (note I did not say ALL) become addicted to this \"fantasy\" life that aggravates their real sex problems.  I would encourage him to get help for a possible porn addiction while working on the problems in your relationship.  This type of \"release\" is so self-focused and self-aborbed - all about how HE feels - that it robs you and keeps him from being compassionate toward you.  He is focused on himself and giving no thought or attention to your needs.  This is a problem that must be addressed.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "As a male who just confessed to his wife about a porn addiction, I understand where your husband is. The RN above covered all the major points. As I was, your husband is being selfish (but may not fully realize/accept it) and is probably worried that if he stops its going to be the end of the world.   Being clean for 2 months I can say its possible but not easy. The first week I couldn't look at a female or TV because my mind would go nuts. My wife was very helpful in two ways. She showed me how much it hurt her and was very honest with me about her anger. She also said that she would help me work through it. If she had just said it was OK, I would probably keep on doing it. If she had totally condemned me I would have gotten angry and said it wasn't worth giving up. Intentional or not, she hit the right balance of holding me accountable and supporting me.  She has also been more proactive with sex lately. Being the initiator more then she had been in the past. I think this was a big step seeing how hurt she was. I've also tried to fulfill her needs (massages etc) first. The 30 minute of massaging / foreplay has made sex a 100 times better.  I hope this helps, feel free to follow up with any questions.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 20 year old male with occasional testicular pain. This pain usually occurs after extended periods of arousal without orgasm. Lately I've grown concerned because the pain, usually relieved some time after orgasm, has become persistent. The pain seems to be coming from behind the right testicle, in a bundled tube-like structure. This structure is best described as 'free floating' in the scrotum rather then tightly bound to the testicle. Applying even light pressure to this structure during episodes of testicular pain is uncomfortable.  What could be causing the pain? Thank you! Guy\n\n",

If they are causing problems varicoceles can be repaired.    I would recommend you see your doctor for an evaluation.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Each person responds to medications in their own way and we can't predict exactly the effect it will have on you.  I would not expect this to be the cause of increasing blood pressure.    There is a stated caution that there could be interaction with  blood pressure medication (lowering) and patients are advised to avoid excessive alcohol consumption while taking it.  Caffeine use, as in energy drinks should also be used with caution since it can interact with medication and is, in fact, a drug.  The medication has been shown to be very effective and safe when prescribed and in coordination with other health conditions and drugs.  People with heart conditions, liver or kidney and other underlying medical problems should discuss these with the doctor before taking this medication.  Side effects do not necessarily always occur whenever you take a particular drug and your body can adjust to the medication, resulting in fewer side effects over time.  I hope this answers your concerns.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I try to hold back my reflexive laughter, but I eventually give in and give up.  I have no idea what is wrong.  A theory I have is that I am unable to feel normal sensations in my penis, but I am able to imagine them in dreams.  Maybe that's why I can orgasm in dreams and not in real life.  Of course, I am completely clueless despite hours and hours of research.  Nobody else seems to have quite the same problem I do.  Any help is tremendously appreciated!  * * A side note to consider is that I have a fetish.  My girlfriend plays into it, but I still do not orgasm.  Using my fetish to encourage orgasm doesn't help, although many of my wet dreams are associated with the fetish. * *\n\n",

    "content": "I am 23 years old and still a virgin, this is because of various problems that I have with my penis. I have known about these problems for a long time, but have not really taken control. I have seen a doctor on two previous occasions, but didn\u2019t get a result \u2013 probably out of my lack of communication \u2013 hence this letter to you. 1. Until the age of about 14, I didn\u2019t know that I could and should be able to completely retract my foreskin, and when I did my penis felt extremely tender and sharply painful to touch \u2013 but it didn\u2019t hurt when the foreskin was covering it. My foreskin was also tight, so I went to see a doctor about that, and he said it was fine and just needed to be \u2018stretched\u2019 or loosened by me in the bath etc, and that my penis would also desensitise if I kept handling it. I could not handle it as he suggested because it hurts \u2013 it cant even touch clothing material without the foreskin covering it, again because of the sharp pain. On the second review of this appointment a month later, the doctor seemed baffled. 2. I didn\u2019t do anything for two years, and nearly lost my virginity, only to find that my foreskin definitely wasn\u2019t going to retract when erect. When erect, there is a clear \u2018tight\u2019 band that restricts me from retracting it. 3. It hurts particularly in one area of the head of my penis when I ejaculate. (South-west top region). 4. My penis seems to bend to the right when erect \u2013 although this could be the tight foreskin or just a natural thing? 5. I have been told that the white puss filled pimples on the foreskin are natural hair follicles, but mine are very noticeable and three have grown and burst before \u2013 at different times. The latest one was about a month ago and was what prompted this letter \u2013 it was the largest spot I\u2019d had \u2013 about 5mm in diameter. So my questions are; a. Why is the skin on my penis so tender and painful to touch and as a result very hard to clean? b. Why does it hurt in a certain area when I ejaculate? c. If I had a circumcision, would it wipe out the \u2018tender\u2019 problem and the other problems as well as curing the tightness problem? I don\u2019t want to have a circumcision if the other problems remained \u2013 because it would be unbearably painful. d. Is circumcision avoidable?  e. Should I see a specialist? And what would be the title of this specialist?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi!  A tight foreskin could be your problem, but a proper clinical examination should be done. Since small cysts ('pimples') seem to be affecting your penile skin, such hidden cysts could be cause for the pain, but proper examination alone may tell. Circumcision is usually done for tight foreskins, and usually ends the problem. The procedure of circumcision per se is not unbearably painful, since it's done under anesthesia. But if you worry regarding a sensitive glans being unbearably painful, know that millions of males are circumcized and have overcome the sensitivity. A specialist that you may consult should be a urologist.  Hope this helps.  bill\n\n",

    "content": "I also have a similar problem to that in the previous post. I do not have puss, or pimples on the penis but I do have the same discomfort and pain. I have tried the creams, anesthetics, and seen some of the best urologists in the country. I am uncircumcised, and it's almost like the glans are \"sun burned.\" It hurts when there is any friction or irritation. When erect, it tilts to the left. this could be natural. The shaft is tight when erect, but the pain is from the glans. I have not had sex before because of this reason. When the surface is rubbed, it hurts. I wanted to have a circumcision but the urologists said that the resulting exposure of the glans won't necessarily assuage the pain and discomfort.   This problem seems to be very common.\n\n",

    "content": "For a week now I've had pain in my testicles... it usually appears when I'm lying down (on my back). If I'm sitting or standing I feel nothing. The pain isn't VERY bad, it feels like I just got kicked there 5 minutes before (guys, you know the feeling). It's more severe in my left testicle than my right one (the majority of the time, though it *does* \"move\" around a bit).   Rather constant too, after I've been lying down for a while it stays for a while regardless of my posture.There's a tiny bit of pain in my lower scrotum sometimes but not too bad. It's mostly my left testicle (and a bit in my right). No swelling at all visible, or redness. Don't feel any lumps. Urine is normal coloring. My penis doesn't hurt at all. Only medicine I'm on is Glucosamine Chondroitin pills (for my tendonitis-affected wrists... from too much guitar playing) and Nasonex (for my allergies).  I'm going to the doctor tommorow but I'm really worried and I wonder if I should go to the ER. I'd rather die than become a eunuch. I'm 17.  Thank you in advance. I'm extremely worried, please answer back soon!\n\n",

Its kinda bad and good news for ya, but hopefully its nothing in ur case  P.S. Sorry to hear that u can actually have a condition from playing too much guitar, but Rock on dude, hopefully thats how I'll go when im older.....from playing too much guitar\n\n",

You run the risk of increased side effects if the medication is not taken as recommended by the manufacturer and your doctor.  Your husband may do fine with this; but he may not.  Nobody can actually predict who will have negative side effects so it is at his own risk that he does this.  I hope he is discussing this with his doctor so any monitoring of blood pressure or visual risks may be done.  Especially in cases where there are other underlying conditions, Viagra can decrease blood flow to the optic nerve of the eye, causing sudden vision loss.   Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Prasad,  There are various different techniques.  The only manual technique I am aware of that has shown results is a squeeze technique where the penis is squeezed just below the head when the sensation of ejaculation is felt.  This is repeated three to four times before ejaculation.  It takes several months of this to develop increased control.  Medications can be used as well.  In particular, SSRI antidepressants are sometimes used because they have a notable side effect of delaying ejaculation.  You may want to speak to a urologist for an evaluation and to discuss treatment options.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Possible Klinefelter's?",
    "content": "I'm a 20 year old male and recently learned about Klinefelter's syndrome. While reading the list of symptoms, I was shocked at how many applied to me. Here they are:  I am quite a late bloomer. My voice didn't drop until my junior year of high school, which is when I assume I hit puberty. I was always skinny and short growing up, but became a little bit plump at fifteen and acquired some chest fat. Then my junior year I shot up to 6'1. I was surprised (and delighted) because I was always one of the shorter kids in my year, and my dad is only 5'10 (my mom's 5'6). I think I have a longer legs, though I've never really confirmed that. Today, I still have a very youthful face, do not have much facial hair (though I think it's starting to come in), and still have some chest fat, which I've had for about four years. My voice is pretty deep (I'm a bass singer) I believe my penis is about average length (about 6 inches). I have one (abnormal) testicle that is small and round, but the other is normal. A doctor did notice this, but said that there should be no problems. I have normal pubic hair, little on my chest, and some arm pit. I have no mental incapacity or learning disability, and was always a quick learner. In fact, I have an IQ close to 160 and now attend an Ivy league school, not to boast. I am, however, pretty shy and lack confidence, am also awkward physically and not very athletic. I don't think I have any psychological issues though. If I could get any feedback on whether I should get a diagnosis, that would be great.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Isn't it interesting how you can learn about a condition, read symptoms and notice they seem apply to you?  When I attended nursing school, it seemed every condition we studied applied to me or someone in my family!  I would be sure I had it nailed only to go back to class the following week to find the symptoms also applied to a new disease.    This is because so many of the same symptoms occur in normal individuals as well as in many different disorders.  The symptoms are one clue to the diagnosis, but you have described nothing here that could not also occur in chromosome normal men.  The fact that you have above average intelligence and have not had other worrisome symptoms leads me to think there's a good chance this is not your problem.  Latent puberty is within the normal developmental milestones.  In Klinefelter's or XXY Syndrome a man has at least two X chromosomes and at least one Y chromosome.  It is the most common sex chromosome disorder, affecting one in 500 live male births.  Often young men with Klinefelter's notice that testical development was not normal; others learn of it only after they have fertility issues when trying to father a child.  If you are concerned, having a chromosome test might ease your mind but is not actually necessary since treatment mostly consists of help dealing with the psychological issues including social anxiety or depression.  If you do not have these issues and are not worried about your fertility at this point you may choose to delay any testing.  Men with this syndrome who desire an enhanced masculine appearance may benefit from testosterone therapy.   So, if a firm diagnosis will help you, go for it.  Hopefully you will maintain a healthy self-esteem regardless of the outcome.  This is just one more variation in the human race that make us all unique.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks so much for your reply.  I guess I'm not that worried about fertility at this point, though I'm sure I will be down the line. What I'm most concerned about is the gynecomastia that I've had for close to five years that won't seem to go away, even after I grew six inches or so. Even after becoming more physically fit, I still have noticeable chest fat and stomach fat. I was extremely skinny my entire life before 15, and both of my parents are svelte as well. I keep expecting that at some point I will just wake up and have returned to normal, but it just doesn't seem to happen.  Perhaps this has something to do with the one testicle that I have that is small and circular. Because my other testicle is perfectly fine, maybe this means that I'm a half-Klinefelter's case or something, though I'm sure this probably doesn't exist. Maybe I have an extra half X chromosome, which is why I have a regular testicle and also a smaller one. Does this mean I'm experiencing diminished effects of Klinefelter's? Hopefully, I won't be completely infertile if this is the case...  Whatever the case, I'm really wondering if you think my gynecomastia will ever go away on its own, even after five years. Or will I have to resort to cosmetic surgery to finally get rid of it?  I realize this is a bit of a loaded reply, but appreciate your answers.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  I feel fairly certain this is related to your surgery and the loss of a testicle. While generally well tolerated, this can reduce the available level of testosterone, which could have such an effect. Another possibility is that there has been some interference with blood flow, but since as I understand you the weakness is at the root of the shaft, this seems less likely. Still, both should be explored. If it's testosterone, this can be supplemented. If it's because of surgical interference with blood flow (probably due to unusual scar tissue developing), this could be addressed via very minor surgery. These would seem to be the two most likely causes.   Hope this is helpful. Good luck to you. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Suspensory ligament reattach?",
    "content": "Hello --  First, was this tearing of the suspensory ligament due to a physical trauma? The reason I ask is that this muscle is often cut surgically to allow more of the penis to hang outside of the body (an \"enlargement\" surgery). Once it heals things should work again. If it's already healed and was due to trauma, it likely can be reattached, and probably with resorbable sutures. Even if the sutures had, for some  reason,to be the non-resorbable type, I  would think the apparatus would adjust with a little time, and wouldn't cause a tearing apart of the penis but might cause it to temporarily angle toward the affected side.   Please  follow up with us on this, with additonal information, and also have you consulted with a surgeon already? Have you been told this is hopeless by an actual doctor? If so I think you need a consult with someone who specializes in these sorts of repairs.  Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  i am 29 year old young man. my problem is that i am addicted to masturbation, since puberty. That is about 19 years now  !!! I tried to quite a million times, but never managed. Afterall i became careless about it's dangers because everybody keeps saying masturbation is harmless. So i was satisfied to masturbate once a week or slightly longer ( once every 10-14 days). That is of total of about 2500 times with a loss of 10 millions of sperm cells per year of masturbation on this rate.  To my surprise, i did a spemen analysis few moths ago, and it says that i have 12millions/mm (out of 200 millions), i mean it says that i have oligospermia.  The lap technitian told me that i have to avoid all causes to ejaculation for about 8 months or more, so that my sperm count to improve.  My questions are;  1- Is it true that my oligospermia is reversible? according to what the lap technitian said. i.e. by avoiding ejaculation for some time?  2- does masturbation on long term practice cause oligospermia? IS there any study about the long term of masturbation. Any study that proves that masturbation is not related as possible cause?  3- is it possible to father a child when i am with oligospermia? what are my chances?  I hope to get my answers from a specialist, as i need to read articles about this. Thank you for reading.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  To get directly to your three questions, here we go:  1) Oligospermia is generally reversible if caused by a simple expenditure of sperm, for instance due to masturbation.   2) Masturbation will cause oligospermia in direct proportion to the duration and frequency of masturbation, but if the practice is suspended most often the condition will correct itself. Masturbation, in and of itself, will only cause temporary oligospermia.  3) Yes,  it is possible to father a child  when afflicted with oligospermia. It make take more trying than usual,  but the whole process is rather random anyway, and again, your particular case is probably just a temporary problem (if it can be seen as a problem at all).   I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  From most of the sexual health sites I have been to, I have read that there is NO SPERM in a males' precum, which makes sense, because it is clear and cum is a cloudy white color, which is the color of the sperm.  Those sites said there is NO SPERM in the precum, and that it is just meant to clean out the tube for sperm to later travel through.  And that the ONLY way there could be a small chance of sperm being in precum is that if a male has already ejaculated and has not urinated since then.  Can somone please tell me if this is true.  thanks\n\n",

I have had unprotected sex on 2 occasions about May last year with 2 different partners, but I had no immediate problems affterwards, it first flared up about 2 months later.  I have a tight foreskin, an after masturbation I often find the head of my penis itches. When I retract my fore skin (unerect) I find there is a white/green ish type of discharge underneath, near behind the head of the penis.  I clean it up an thats ok but it seems to come back when the day after I masturbate etc.  I have had a chlamidia test and it came back negative.  I occasionally feel a slight burn when peeing, but not always. I also notice if I don't ejaculate for a week the symptoms go away?   Also after the discharge appears, masturbation feels more pleasurable then normal possibly due to the discharge, not sure if this helps?  I just wanted to know if it could be yeast infection,and what is that? or what I can do/ask for to clear this problem up.  I too would prefer not to see a doctor as I am nervous about doing so.  Any advice would be gratefully received.  Thanks.\n\n",

However, once into it, there isn't any more discomfort.  However, after having intercourse for 10 minutes or so, we noticed a lot of blood!  There was enough to soak through the sheets!  Anyway, we don't think it was me since I had gotten my period two weeks ago, and then we noticed that there was a slight tear in his frenulum. The blood was bright red, and sticky, not at all like menstrual blood.  Anyway, we were wondering if it could be from the tear?  It seemed like an awful lot of blood for a little tear, but then again his penis was erect, so we were wondering if it was the blood flow that made it gush like that.  Thank you in advance.\n\n",

It is very possible that a tear here could cause a significant amount of bleeding, though bleeding to a dangerous amount would be very unlikely.  The blood may also have appeared to be more due to mixing with vaginal and seminal fluid.  These tears do heal well as a typical tear or cut would.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Adult circumcision is rarely performed unless there is a specific need or belief about it.  There is some suggestion that transmission of some STDs may be reduced in a circumcised male but the problems you are experiencing are not likely to be related to being intact.  I would consult with a doctor to rule out phimosis, if your foreskin cannot be retracted behind the glans.  There may be some other problem so having this evaluated before deployment would be wise.    On the con side, some men claim they have increased sensitivity when intact but this is not a scientific-based fact.  There is also risk associated with the surgery, especially in an adult.  Bleeding, errors, anesthesia risks, blood clots and other standard surgical risks.  Most people do fine.    Good luck.\n\n",

There shouldn't be a problem concerning masturbation. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

I was wondering if that was the normal size for my age. Is it bigger or smaller than most? Most girls at my school say that they want 8 inches or bigger, even the slutty ones. I am afraid that if I start to do anything with a girl she will see my length and laugh, then tell people at school. Also, what is the average girth of an erect penis?   Thanks for everything....\n\n",

    "title": "Re: cant pull foreskin back",
    "content": "Hi Clubuk,  This condition is known as phimosis.  In itself it is not particularly a problem; however, we generally recommend it be treated because the skin, if pulled back, could become trapped cutting off blood supply to the tip of the penis.  In addition, the inability to retract the foreskin does not allow for proper hygiene of the area increasing the risk of infections.  The surgical cure for this is circumcision.  There is a medical treatment that I have used for some of my patients with success.  It involves using a very high potency steroid cream applied to the tip of the foreskin twice a day for about 4 weeks.  This takes advantage of one of the side effects of steroid creams, which is thinning of the skin.  While doing this, the foreskin is gently pulled back while cleaning to give some pressure and encourage stretching of the skin.  It is important not to pull the skin all the way behind the head of the penis while doing this to avoid it becoming trapped.  This process can often be successful and prevent the need for circumcision.  The creams are available by prescription and I would recommend this process be supervised by a physician so I would recommend discussing the options with your primary care doctor.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I purposely don't give out a name because some may try to purchase the cream on their own and use it without medical supervision.  This can be dangerous so please don't be offended that I am not directly answering your question.  I would recommend you see your doctor for an evaluation and to discuss if this type of treatment may be appropriate for your particular situation.  Andypooh2007, often there is debris that forms under the foreskin between it and the glans (the head of the penis).  This debris is normal.  The area should be gently cleaned routinely to help prevent irritation.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello!  Sorry for the delay. A thrombosed hemorrhoid can take any length of time to recover completely depending on several factors (whether this is a recurrent attack or a new presentation, whether there are risk factors that caused the hemorrhoid, continued trauma).  Usually if you stick to conservative therapy and this is a new attack, the condition can be resolved within a week. Trauma such as anal sex will prevent complete healing from taking place and can predispose you to recurrent attacks.  I think you should avoid trauma to this area until you are sure that your symptoms and your condition has completely resolved.\n\n",

    "content": "Pimples do occur on the penis, as well as practically anywhere on the skin.  Whether it was a pimple is hard to say for sure.  Did it resemble other pimples you have had?  Do you get pimples in areas other than your face sometimes?  It could be an STD; but you might decide the odds are very low.  You say your partners were virgins ... or so they say.  Still they may have gotten a STD from another means.  Read an article on all the risk factors for STDs.  For example, reused hypodermic needles.  It just takes one contact with someone who took an inappropriate risk.  Perhaps a friend says she is a virgin, but she has engaged in oral sex.   All things considered, you might feel safer with some tests for STD's.  If you think STD's are very unlikely, another way of being tested is to donate blood... but answer their questions truthfully when you are screened for a donation.\n\n",

    "content": "I am 24 year old male with no outstanding medical diagnosis or condition and am on no medication.  I have a couple of small (`1/3 cm and ~ 3 mm respectively), hard, white, dry spots right where the head (circumcised) meets the shaft of the penis. It is right where my thumb is when I hold it with my left hand to urinate. It started many years ago (perhaps before initiating sexual activity, though not 100% sure of this) as one tiny (few millimeters) dry scale that I would always pick (sometimes causing bleeding when nearby skin was torn). Over the last year or two, it has gotten a little bigger (very slow growth, likely due to me picking at it). It gets dry and forms a scale when I leave it alone and don't pick at it for a week or so. However, I always pick it off, it bleeds, and it returns. It is solid and slightly raised (almost like scar tissue), and is deeper than the epidermis.  Because it is on an area that is softer skin (where foreskin would have been) is this likely to be scarring from years of picking at it? Keratosis? A wart (it doesn't look like a textbook genital wart, but I hear they can be sneaky little guys)? For some reason, not doctor has taken notice of this during checkups.  I have no unrealistic expectation that you can deliver an exact diagnosis over a forum without seeing it, but a most likely explanation would be appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  It actually does sound  like it could be a keratosis, but that's fairly unusual. The chronic picking at it has no doubt caused some scarring and chonic irritation, but this still needs to be looked at, probably by a dermatologist, to make certain it isn't a skin cancer (this actually can  happen on the penis). Even if it's something completely benign it still sounds like something that needs a look, and if your doctor pays no attention to it, either point it out directly (I know, this is easier said than done,  but trust me, the doctor isn't interested, which is probably why he hasn't noticed it).  I wouldn't let it just go on like this.   I hope this  is helpful. Please let us know how things turn out. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello again -  The bottom line here is whether or not circumcision might reduce the risk of cancer (and other problems). While this has been a controversial issue over the years, the last time I checked the preponderance of agreement lay with it not being a big factor. I personally find that a little hard to believe, but I have no scientific basis for my notions about it. It certainly would make the area more easily maintained, kept clean and probably less prone to irritation and certain problems, which seems to me would only help reduce the risk of at least certain cancers that occur secondary to chronic irritation. If it were me I'd probably have it done. However, again, that's just an opinion, and not one held by a majority lately.   Hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

At any rate it's not something you want or need going on, and for that reason alone, plus the small but discrete risk of a skin cancer, it would defintely be wise to have this looked at by an MD, preferably a dermatologist.

She advised me to stop picking at it.  She offered to refer me to a dermatologist if I wished, but said that it was up to me. The dermatologist would possibly cut it out and run tests, however she said that he/she would likely just repeat the same advice and tell me to stop picking at it. I could also return early next year when her boss (internal medicine) is in and he may perform the same procedure (or maybe not).  Being the nature of the skin under the head of the penis is a soft sensitive type skin (what would have been covered by foreskin if I wasn't circumcised). What is the likelihood that a doctor would remove it? Would the risk of scarring and making it worse be high enough that they wouldn't touch it?\n\n",

    "content": "The bottom line here seems to be a concern as to the advisability of having anything done surgically. I would suggest you see the dermatologist, first of all, and second that you trust his (or her) judgement about the advisability of removing the affected tissue. Dermatologists are acutely aware of the cosmetic and practical aspects of what they do, so there's not much chance you would be scarred unecessarily. Besides, if removal is suggested, you will still have the final say as to whether or not to go ahead with it.   I'd say go for the consult, listen, and if removal of the tissue is suggested, discuss your concerns, then make a decision based on that.   Best of luck to you, and please keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  While  what you describe is undoubtedly annoying, it is only an extreme example of the degree of sensitivity which can occur with males in your age group. Of course that doesn't solve the immediate problem, and I'm not sure why you're  as sensitive as you are, or what, exactly can be done to blunt it a little, but I think a frank discussion with an internist or a urologist might well be the way to get this  under control.  As for the more watery quality of your semen, that actually is not unusual at all, and can be affected by many things including the amount of fluid taken in. The real concern is how to minimize the extreme genital sensitivity, and I think a urologist is  probably your best way to get this managed. I'm sure it won't come as a surprise to him, and he'll probably have some helpful suggestions and some sort of strategy to help resolve this.  Best of luck to you. Hope this is helpful.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  Whatever is going on, please don't count on it to correct itself. While it may not be anything serious, it certainly does warrant an exam by a physician (preferably a urologist). And  while undescended testicle does carry a slightly greater statistical risk of cancer later in life, this is a pretty small likelihood. However, there are also other risks associated with this (things that occur in the general population as well, but not as often), including testicular torsion, where the testicle becomes turned, which kinks  the epididymis. This can be quite painful and the pain often can be referred up into the lower abdomen. Torsion problems can sometimes be corrected by manual manipulation, but often eventually have to be corrected via very minor surgery. The alternative is potential sterility on the affected side and, on occasion, interruption of the blood supply,  with more serious complications to the testicle.  All in all, not worth waiting for it to just go away. By all means bring this to the attention of a doctor ASAP, and follow up with us here as well.\n\n",

Here: http://www.doctorslounge.com/forums/vie ... 80&t=24401  It is almost humorous when I keep posting these things after methods to increase the enjoyment of sex between me and my dear girlfriend. -_-;  Anyway... I just read elsewhere what may be the cause to the bleeding, and considering that the first time that this happened, my cum was much more brownish than reddish (my last post in the other thread was about the second time the cum was bloody), it is probably due to damage to the prostate gland, rather than the glans, and the truth is that I have been feeling that my prostate feels weird, since a few weeks back... it doesn't really hurt but it feels stressed. At least I assume it is the prostate; this feeling is between the scrotum and anus. I guess this means my glans is healing up, but now I have something else to worry about, although I do feel calmer, now, although maybe this is even worse than a bleeding glans. :/ By the way, I'm only 25, so any prostate gland problems have nothing to do with my age. Also, last time it bled it was pretty moderate amounts of blood... it was quite red but it wasn't overwhelmingly red; no indication of excessive bleeding, at all.  I think I know how the damage to my prostate gland has happened...  since several months back I have kept doing a stamina exercise that, when performed for some time, helps keeping you from coming too early. The way this exercise is performed is by training the muscle that you use to stop yourself from peeing, by simply \"flexing\" it twenty plus times, once or twice a day. Has this exercise caused any damage of significance to the prostate gland, or should it all heal up as long as I take a break from this exercise for a couple weeks, and if I, after some rest, reduce the exercises to ten flexes a day instead of around twenty once or twice a day? I wouldn't want to stop with it, completely, as I really want the added stamina it gives me during sex. Should it be safe to continue with this exercise as long as I listen to my body?  Thank you for your help... I really appreciate the time you put down to help me... for free and all. Yet again, by the way.... under absolutely no circumstances can I go to a doctor about this, due to the intimacy of it.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello-  I've read your previous post now, and this  one as well, and first I would  hold  off on performing this \"stamina\" exercise for the  time being. Second, I would make an appointment at once to be seen by a medical professional, preferably a urologist but at least a doctor to start with. It would seem you've managed to injure the prostate or at least its blood supply (or possibly some vessel in the general area) and you may well continue to increase the injury or even do some permanent damage if you continue the exercise, at least until you've been evaluated by a doctor. These symptoms could be indicative of something very serious, although it is probably fully reversible if you are able  to come  to terms with your doctor/intimacy issues. Almost all areas of medicine are relatively \"intimate\" in one way or another, and the doctor is impassive about these matters, unlike most patients. It's important.  Try to mentally prepare yourself and make an appointment. The risk of permanent damage is too  great to allow modesty to get in the way of proper medical treatment.  I hope you'll be able to bring yourself to be seen and treated. At the very least please stop the exercise, and please let us know if that makes any difference in the symptoms. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

I literally would rather die. :/ I just hope I won't get any sexual dysfunction from this... but last time I came my cum was much less bloody than the time before... if it keeps being less blood in the cum, should that pretty much tell that whatever is bleeding is healing up as it should? May I end up with any complications, despite that less blood keeps coming? For instance, may I end up with a lesser force when the cum is released?

    "content": "Wow, 2340 views. o_o Seems that this happening to me has given a warning to quite a few, in regards to performing this exercise.  Anyway, I think it's started to feel less stressed in that area, and this isn't because I've decided to self-medicate with ibuprofen to prevent inflammation; when the effect of it should be gone it feels the same. I take 400 mg three times over a whole day... at times I only take 200 mg, one of the times (usually before I sleep). I will take it for at least a total of five days but more if I may need to, to definitely prevent any inflammation risks. I also take a multivitamin drink, twice a day, that provides all vitamins and such since that may help rebuild whatever has ruptured, and I take extra protein in the form of soy protein, once or twice a day. I also read elsewhere that it's not good for the prostate to be filled up, so my girlfriend and I have quick sex about once a day, now, to take care of that. I don't think there have been problems with the glans bleeding, again, yet... hope that's okay, now. :/ Blood still is mixed in the cum, but it keeps being brown, now, which indicates old blood... is that a sign of that it's healing up?  I'll report back, again, when I have anything new to add.\n\n",

    "content": "I think it will  heal, but you must take into consideration the amount of vigor you've directed at this one, rather sensitive area of your anatomy. You may have a small bleed going on somewhere that collects some blood and by the time it shows up, it's turned brown from age. This may or may not be serious -- although it seems to not be adversely affecting the operation overall. I think it just calls for some patience.   Regarding suicide as an alternative to not being able to have sex five times a day, you must realize the theoretical physical limits of your body. I'm sure it's a grand ideal, but not a very realistic one for long periods of time. If this is a goal you feel you must meet, you really need to find someone you can discuss this with face to face, since suicidal thoughts immediately broadens the scope of the problem a good deal. You're demanding more of your body that is reasonable to expect it can possibly deliver consistently. I don't mean to make light of your situation (not in the least), but there are people who would consider suicide if they knew they'd be required to perform sexually 5 times a day. So if you have determined direct medical attention is out of the question, you might at least consider finding someone you could talk with about this, as the constant workout is almost certain to cause some sort of injury from time to time. It's really more than most people could possibly maintain.   Please do stay in touch with us here, as well. It sounds like things are starting to heal, but it may be a slow process and you may, as I said earlier, have a tiny, slow bleed somewhere in the affected area. This may account for small amounts of old blood turning up from time to time.   Keep us updated, please.\n\n",

    "content": "I guess I should have posted back about this to inform about the situation, a long time ago, but I will do it now, at least... the prostate has healed up perfectly. That old blood stopped appearing in my cum over a month ago. No complications. I guess I should be far more careful with the stamina exercise, from now on. I know what it feels like, now, if you've done it too much; the stressed feeling, that is. I will definitely always have that feeling in concern, from now on. Maybe I shouldn't do it more than once a day, now? I did it really excessively, before. A bit foolish considering that any overtrained muscle may rupture.  However, the glans has not yet fully healed. Three months afterwards and it still has not fully healed. :/ May it truly be so that it is damaged for life? After just doing the engorgement method ONCE for the glans and just for maybe three seconds. I can't believe that three seconds have damaged the glans for the rest of my life. However, very little blood comes when it does come, although we're still being careful and don't have sex more than every second or third day. This is very stressful for us. We are both sex addicts and we NEED to do it several times a day. Thoughts of suicide have started to enter my head, again.... if you're pretty much certain that the glans will heal, with time, I would be so thankful to know. Please don't talk about therapy; therapy doesn't work for all and all I'd want it to help for is for my glans to fully heal and that is pretty unlikely, to say the least. Both me and her WANT to be sex addicts, after all.... sex under true love is the only reason to live. Is there any ointment that may help? I have a vitamin E ointment that also includes aloe vera, how about putting that on it? Vitamin E helps to make scars go away, after all, so maybe it can help for the healing of the glans, as well? And isn't aloe vera a disinfectant? That'd be good when it starts to bleed.  Can three mere seconds of that enlargement method really have damaged my glans for life? Or will it heal in time? In about how long do you think that may be, approximately? It's much better than before, now, at least. If not five-plus times a day, do you think that we will be able to have sex at least three or four times a day, again, soon? Sex under true love is everything to the two of us...... sex makes the souls connect on such an incomparable level..... nothing comes even close.  Thank you for your continued assistance... it is wholeheartedly appreciated by both me and my girlfriend.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Zim,  I'm not sure that we have the answers to your problem; once again, allowing a physician to evaluate it would be the ideal.  In the meantime, as with any health diagnosis, balancing your desires with what you can actually accomplish is up to you.  No one can do that for you; you are responsible for taking care of your body. If sex too often causes irritation, you're the only one who can change it.  Unfortunatey, that would entail fewer sexual experiences per day.  It does not seem logical that such an injury would be for life.  The unhealed or irritated spot has not had a chance to heal completely. The time it takes to heal is a very individual thing, so it may take a longer period of abstinence to heal.  Have you tried using a condom until the irritation is healed?  Have you avoided your stamina/engorgement exercise?  Are you sure there is sufficient lubrication?  Have you tried one of the herbal excitement gels?  I am very interested in your comment that it is almost humorous for you and you girlfriend in posting all the symptoms and problems.  I would like to know more about what makes it humorous to you and if there is an element of playing a game with us.  I am also concerned about your statements that you'd rather die than see a doctor or do without as much sex.  You reject treatment from any resource, but still seem to want medical guidance.  Have you ever received psychological treatment?  What happened if you did, and what was your diagnosis?  Dr. Kenyon has previously covered all of this information several times, but you apparently have not chosen to take his advice to seek appropriate treatment.  I am not sure exactly what you want from this forum and what we could actually help you do.  Please do respond and help us to understand more clearly.  Meanwhile, we will hope for the best and that your injury has healed.  Faye, RN, MSW\n\n",

    "content": "I am 20 and for the past three days have been experiencing a slight nagging pain - more like a feeling of discomfort - just above my left testicle. Upon having a feel around to see if I could discern any difference between the left and right side of the contents of my scrotum, I found that the sort of.. sinuous \"connections\" (I don't know what they are) seem to be more pronnounced on the left hand side (where the pain is) however, there doesn't seem to be any sensation in it. I can squeeze the swelling and not feel any pain in it. Sometimes the pain feels like it resides more in the flesh just above the testicle. where the scrotum meets the rest of the body. The left testicle also seems to be hanging slightly higher that usual - it has always been ever so slightly higher than the right, but it's much more pronnounced now. I have been turning over the idea of going to see a GP, but the thought of someone poking and peering around down there purely because I am a hypochondriac is offputting. Obviously if someone suggests it needs urgent attention I'll put my issues aside and bite the bullet but... No sure how to end this sentence. Please could I have some advice? Thanks very much.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Slight pan and swelling above left testicle",
    "content": "Hello -  What you describe could be epididymitis, testicular torsion or even an inguinal hernia. The  hernia is less likely than the other two, and  the former two, normally,  would be more painful, but they are serious enough -- all three -- that they should be ruled out. You're not being hypochondriacal because of your concern over this: the area is somewhat vulnerable to odd problems (torsion is a really odd one, but happens fairly often and is easy to correct); epididymitis is usually easily treated as well, and inguinal hernias are fairly simple to repair. It may be none of these, but it's perfectly reasonable to want to take care of the equipment, and failure to do so can have unpleasant results. Because of the relatively low pain level you may be able to wait a few days before having this looked at, and if it resolves on its own, great. But if it doesn't in a few days, I'd strongly suggest having it checked. If it's nothing, remember that's a good thing, and if it's not nothing, it''ll be a good thing you found out.   I hope this is helpful to you. Best of luck.\n\n",

    "content": "OK, I've got the idea now. Thanks for the clarification. This is unusual, that it should show up later in adulthood, although it's quite often a problem in younger men. There are definitely techniques and therapies for this sort of thing, although I don't feel qualified to advise you directly on this for a variety of reasons, including the fact that first one needs to determine whether there is a physical cause (sometimes it is associated with erectile dysfunction or other physical issues, although that doesn't sound like you). I can provide you with a link to another site which has covered this issue fairly well and is a respected one as well. Maybe from this you can either find a path to self-help or determine if you require some medical attention to the problem -- or, perhaps, that it isn't really a problem so much as a perception. At any rate, the Mayo Clinic covers it very well here: http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/premat ... on/DS00578   While I don't normally refer to other medical sites, the Mayo one is a very  highly regarded, general information site, so I think this may be of help to you.

    "title": "Re: Whole body numbness during oral sex",
    "content": "Hello -  The only reason I can think of that one might experience overall numbness and lightheadedness during any sort of sex, and especially during oral sex this might be so, would be an increase in overall bodily tension causing such a posture (possibly along with holding of the breath) might cause the subject to unwittingly perform what is known as a Valsalva maneuver. The way one might normally do this (intentionally) would be by stretching and holding one's breath, or by straining while trying to lift something heavy (again, with unwitting holding of breath, which often happens). This slows the heart rate, causes blood pressure to drop, with subsequent lightheadedness and sometimes a spreading numbness or weakness spreading from the shoulders on downward.   This explanation is a stretch, but something clearly is happening during these episodes, and it would be well to learn just what's causing it. Since there is some sense of pleasure derived from the lightheadedness (not unlike what is described during autoerotic asphyxia), the experience may not seem too unpleasant, but you're wise to look for an answer. If you find yourself arching or holding your breath during these episodes, this may be the cause. It could be difficult to avoid this happening, and it may actually be a benign thing, so long as there is nothing else physiologically wrong. It could be an idiosyncratic response to extreme sexual pleasure. However, it would be helpful to know if there is any sort of involuntary or unwitting arching, stretching, or breath-holding, which would explain the response you describe. Otherwise it may be helpful to have a cardiological checkup.  I hope this is helpful to you. Best of luck. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Cause of hard veins on penis?",
    "content": "Starting around 6 months ago, I found that I had a small, relatively short (1/2 to 1 inch) vein on my penis.  I masturbate without lubrication, and read in many places online that this can be caused by sexual trauma.  It went away in a day or two, and so I went on without thinking about it.  It recurred a few times between then and now, but each time I would simply be more careful in my habits and it would go away.  3-4 weeks ago, the issue occurred, but it seems like multiple veins, and it never goes away.  It is present whether erect or flaccid.  It is not painful (nor has it ever been), although I believe the sheer size of it is causing me some discomfort.  It is very disconcerting.  It seems as though the veins are curled or knotted.  There are hard \"ball\"-like areas that feel like the knotted areas, then there are hard vein(s) connecting them.  It is, and has been, primarily located just beneath the glans, on the shaft of my penis.  Initially it was on the side of my penis facing my stomach, but it is now wrapping around to the side and the front (it is probably 1 1/2 to 2 inches long now, and definitely comprised of more than 1 solitary \"tube\").  I appreciate any help you have to offer, thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  Since the veins on your penis have worsened over the past 6 months, your best action is to see your doctor or a Urologist and don't delay any longer.  The symptoms could be related to a sexually transmitted disease, trauma as you described, or even varicose veins, as well as other possibilities.  If there is something wrong, delaying a visit to your doctor will only allow it to get worse.  Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, This is nothing to be worried about except to the extent that it bothers you.  It just means that when you are in REM sleep (rapid eye movement) you have dreams that are erotic.  It's not unusual to NOT remember the dream.  Nevertheless the arousal results in a nocturnal emission (wet dream) and it sometimes acts as a stress or tension reliever.  It is not related to your thyroid and it will not have any adverse effect on you.    Best wishes\n\n",

    "content": "I have been seeing a guy for about 6 months, and everytime we have intimate contact...he gets sick. We have both been tested for STD's and AIDs, and are both clean...and neither of us has any other sexual partners at this time.  His symptoms are similar to that of an allergic reaction.....blocked sinuses, itchy watery eyes, headache, and he sometimes complains of a burning or ringing sensation in his ears.  I have changed all of my soaps, make up, laundry detergent, etc. to hypoallergenic types....and have quit wearing perfume of any kind.  We are both frustrated and upset....and are begining to wonder if it's more serious.  Could he be allergic to my bodily fluids?  I know a woman can have a semen allergy....could a man be allergic to vaginal fluid or to my saliva?  What about medications....I take Zoloft.  Could he be allergic to that?   Again, this only happens when we have intimate contact....HELP! What can we do???\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I agree with Cynthia that this would be a good place to start in identifying the sensitivity if, in fact, you are using latex condoms.  If so, I would just add a little caution as you try alternative condom types.  Other plastics (polyurethane) are good protection against virus but do break more often than latex (approximately 7 times as frequently) so be careful.  The skin varieties offer good birth control but have pores large enough to allow viruses through so are not helpful in reducing the transmission of disease.  Since you report that you are both \"clean\" this should not be a big concern - just something to be aware of.  I have never known anyone to react to the other person's medication such as Zoloft and seriously doubt this is a concern.    If after trying eliminating possible offenders like soaps, perfumes and other external contaminants he still has this reaction, he might want to be checked by an allergist who could test for specific allergens.  And, as a last resort, perhaps counseling in case there is some psychogenic cause.  The mind can be very powerful and deep-seated emotions can manifest in physical symptoms.  Best wishes to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Trying2GetBye,  I am moving your other post to this one because it is related and the forum rules indicate that you must keep related posts together; not start a new thread.  While there are slight differences, it is basically the same concern. I am a 25 year old female, straight, no STD's or other health problems.  I've been seeing a guy for about 6 months....he is also straight with no STD's or other health issues....and we have been sexually exclusive during our relationship.   However, from the very first time we even kissed, he has been having what appears to be an allergic reaction to me.  His sinus close up, he sounds congested, his eyes get red and he complains that they itch and hurt.  He also complains of ear pain or ringing.  These symptoms occur within minutes of having physical contact with me.  Touch alone does not seem to set it off, but any kind of oral or genital contact definitely causes a problem.   Neither of us have ever had this problem before, and I fear it will be the end of our relationship if it can't be fixed.  I've asked my doctor, who was less than helpful - he literally laughed at me and told me it was probably all in his/our head. But we both know it's a real physical response. We've ruled out latex allergy, and I have changed all of my soaps, detergent, perfumes, make-up, etc. and it seems to have helped, but the issue hasn't gone away.  What could be causing this type of reaction, and what can we do about it?  I will add this:  Some people are allergic to all soaps, perfumes, additives so just changing may not help.  Switching to bland, non-perfumed products might if that is his problem.  I also agree with Tim that changing to a neutral location to see if it makes a difference is certainly a possibility in case it is an environmental allergen causing the problem.  What can it hurt?  Animal allergies definitely cause this type of reaction.    Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi. -_- The day before yesterday, while I was masturbating, I performed a penis enlargement method for the head of my penis by \"strangling\" the penis just below the head, so blood gets trapped into it, which, with time, leads to enlargement. It was a long time ago that I did this but it's lead to any problems before, except last time I did it, probably three years ago or so, when it lead to bruising on part of the side of it, which is why I stopped doing it. Well, this time it not only lead to bruising on the side (different side than last time), but I also got these tiny wounds that started bleeding just a little when I got more erect. Something like this has never happened to me, before. :/ Anyway... I masturbated a while ago, again, and again, when I got the most erect, it started bleeding, except this time it was at least twice as bad, and the head still was bruised on the one side. I can't possibly go to a doctor about this, due to the intimacy of it - it really is out of the question, no matter what - so if there is something I should know for it to properly heal, please tell me. That is, if it WILL heal. Will it heal all up and be fine, afterwards, if I don't masturbate or have sex for maybe two weeks? By the way, I absolutely do not have any STD's; the only one I've ever had sex with, or done anything sexual with, is my one and only girlfriend and I'm the only only one she's ever had sex with or done anything sexual with, as well. I'm terrified that I've damaged my penis for life and I will have problems having sex, from now on. :/ Please say it isn't so. -_-; One thing is for sure; I'm never performing that penis enlargement method ever again... I don't even need it so doing that really was stupid of me, considering it caused me to get bruising, those years ago.\n\n",

    "content": "Maybe five days ago I also posted this, since I thought my old thread wouldn't get posted. It has some additional information. My girlfriend and I haven't had sex, since then, nor have I masturbated. Here it is:   A bit over three weeks ago I performed a penis enlargement method by \"strangling\" the penis, right below its head, for a short while, in order for the head to become larger, with time. This isn't something I regularly use to do; before that it was at least two years ago. Anyway, I masturbated, afterwards, and the head started bleeding, a little, from really tiny wounds. The day after I masturbated, again, but this time the bleeding was many times worse. I decided not to masturbate or do anything sexual with my girlfriend for three weeks, so it'd have time to heal. Well, me and my girlfriend just couldn't keep ourselves from having sex, so we had sex after five days, instead. The head didn't start to bleed, so maybe three days later we had sex again, followed by about every two days, for a while, and now, since a few days, once a day, but the day before yesterday it started bleeding, just a little, again, and yesterday it was a little worse, and today it actually bled quite a lot. Is it ever going to heal up, properly, like if we go a month without sex and such, or have I damaged the head of my penis for a long time, because of that exercise? Other than the bleeding, the head looks completely normal, by the way. Me and my girlfriend used to have sex more than five times a day, before this.... it's really mentally draining to do it so little.... but if we go without it, for a month, or rather, if I only please her, will it heal all up, then, so we can have things as we use to, again...? Is there maybe some ointment I should use? Needless to say, by the way, I'm never doing that penis enlargement method, ever again... :/  I *really* appreciate any help... I cannot, under any circumstances, go to a doctor about this, due to the intimate nature of it. So thanks in advance...\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It looks like there has not been a urologist available to answer you question.    Most cases of fractured penis caused by sexual activity and most other minor penile injuries will heal without problems.  You are on the right course by resting the organ and allowing healing.  It would be ideal for you to have this evaluated by a urologist to be sure there has been no damage to the urethra or a blockage to the nerve or blood supply but time is on your side and I would guess a couple of weeks would give you a pretty good idea if healing is going well.    Many men are able to go without sexual activity - erection and release - for long periods of time without any adverse affects.  It is a matter of self-control.  In order to avoid possible infection or further trauma of an already fragile body part it would be worth the sacrifice.  If after the member appears to be healed, normal in color, and without hematoma or bruising it would be safe to try again but be gentle and stop if there is pain.  If you have any erectile dysfunction or ongoing pain you must break down and see a doctor.  Trust me, a urologist is very familiar with such trauma.   You're right though - this strangulation of the penis head is a dangerous activity that should be avoided in the future.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for the reply. I first, yet again, need to stress that under no circumstances could I go to a doctor, about this, due to the intimacy of it. No one else than my girlfriend may see and touch me, down there, and the same goes for the intimate parts of my girlfriend. This basically is a religion to us, so it just cannot happen.  Having said that, I cannot possibly think there has become any damage to the urethra as there was no blood, any of the times, when I peed, nor did it hurt even though I peed right after it had started bleeding, every time. Also, it only hurt a bit right after I had performed that enlargement method, but the day after it didn't really hurt anymore. The other two times when it started bleeding when I was masturbating/having sex the pain was very moderate and barely felt at all. Also, there only was bruising at the time right after I had done the enlargement method, but the bruising almost completely disappeared at most two days afterwards.  Again, it just hasn't hurt much and barely even felt when it's started bleeding. Sure, the pain will feel much less during masturbation and sex but even after I've gone soft, again, it just hasn't hurt, except some slighter pain after I had done the enlargement method, as I said. It also kept hurting when I had gone soft, again, that time... actually, it hurt much more, then, even though it still wasn't much. I also am not having any erectile dysfunction.  I'd really appreciate some finalizing comments on this... now that I have given more details, is there any risk that me and my girlfriend won't be able to have sex five times or more a day, now? By the way, the night leading to Friday it has been two weeks since we had sex, since she gave me oral, etc., or since I masturbated... is it safe to have sex, soon? I don't want to take any risks, but my mind is just screaming for sex and I know hers does, too. By the way, whenever I get a normal wound it heals up quite quickly... I'd bet this makes a big difference on my chances to fully recover.  I'm extremely thankful for all help... so again, thanks.\n\n",

It was only a quickie, though... wouldn't want to risk anything, yet. :/ However, when we were done I checked how the head looked and as I kept getting softer there was some bruising that was visible on about an 8x8 millimetre area, at the place where it most was bleeding, two weeks ago. It could be seen clearer the softer I went, but it was just barely visible, anyway. When I was hard, however, it almost could not be seen at all and the head looked completely normal, otherwise. Also, I experienced no pain at all and there was no bleeding, and the head didn't look \"raw,\" at any area, at all, so it didn't seem as if it ever was close to start bleeding.  Do you think it will be safe to have sex tomorrow (Saturday), again, and should it be safe to keep going for much longer, like half an hour? I don't feel very happy with myself when she didn't have time to come during the sex, today, because I let myself go so early. By the way, the method I use to keep myself from coming is to try to pee while I'm hard. Of course, it doesn't cause me to pee, but it does stop me from coming. However, when I do this I become MUCH harder and bigger than normal, so do you think it may be unwise to make use of this stamina method, already? If you do think it'd be unwise, in how long do you think it will be safe to make use of it?  Thanks for all your further help.... I will appreciate it immensely.\n\n",

Inside the urethra... :/ my cum gets red, now...! ###### this is so horrible!! My life is over if we no longer can have sex. :( Why didn't this happen before I met her; when I was still suicidally depressed? I could've just killed myself, then. But now I have her to think about... if I no longer can live then neither can she. I know this sounds like the ramblings of a crazy person but I wouldn't exactly force her to die... we already agreed, almost before getting together, that we would die together, by our own hands, in the future. She used to be suicidal before meeting me, as well... well, we are still suicidal, it's just that after finding each other we didn't need to do it before after some years, instead... but if we no longer can have sex... then it's no use living anymore. I can't believe this is happening.... I only did that enlargement method ONCE, REALLY shortly, and before that it had been about three years that I did it, last time...! It's almost like it has to be a nightmare.... but I know it isn't. :(  Despite the situation, I still won't go to a doctor about it... I really would rather just literally die. What can they do, anyway...? There are no miracle healing pills, anyway. :( Please, if there is anything you can suggest, other than that I avoid getting hard for as long as possible, PLEASE help me!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  After reviewing all the information you have presented, I would like to know a little more about the suicidal ideation that you described.  Are you in any treatment for mental health issues?  Is your girlfriend?  Do you have a suicide plan? It's important to remember that sexual activity is a powerful need.  Since you have been having difficulty with no definite therapy to heal your penis, you may be getting overwhelmed and reactive, which leads to suicidal thinking.  I am asking you to take a few steps back and calm yourself, so we can gather more information to help you.  You mentioned having sex 5 times a day is normal for you and your girlfriend.  That would mean that you could have a lot of irritation to the head of your penis.  Do you add lubrication, like KY jelly, when you have sex? It would help reduce the irritation.  Less frequency until it is healed is also a good idea.   You mentioned that for you and your girlfriend, sex is almost a religion.  Is this just between the two of you, or are there other persons in this religion?  Is there someone you can ask for help in clarifying your situation and identifying what would be allowed in seeking treatment? If you would consider seeing a doctor, you could have your girlfriend in attendance, so that it would still have the level of intimacy that you want. I encourage you to see someone in your local Community Mental Health office for support and encouragement in dealing with your issues, and to help your monitor your very troubling suicidal thoughts. I'll look forward to your reply.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Zim,  I share the concerns expressed by my esteemed peers.  There are a couple issues that I would like to address/comment on: The original practice of deliberate engorgement has apparently been practiced by you in the past leading up to the incident 3 years ago with some complications.  Without requesting any details of your sexual self-perception, I cannot help but wonder if your Ego and Id are intertwined into a sexually based self-identity.   You do seem to emphasize a sexual relationship with your current girlfriend as the predominant relationship factor.   I do sincerely hope that your tie with your girlfriend is more encompassing that only through sex.  Your physical and emotional health may depend on that! Since the two of you have certain issues in your past that has led to you finding solace and comfort in each other, it would indeed, as my colleague suggested, be of value to seek a mental health professional to help you deal with your suicidality, and with your focus on sex as being the only thing of value in your life,( so much so that you would seriously explore mutual suicides if sex were no longer available to you both. ) On a clinical level I would like to address your previous practice of engorgement.  There are potential serious complications from strangulating the penis - and in truth, only a personal assessment by a urologist can provide enough information specific to your individual concerns. Continued bleeding anywhere from the glans needs to be evaluated in person.  This is the only reliable way to determine why the bleeding continues.  If any \"nerve\" damage has occurred it may cause you to have less enjoyment with your sexual encounters. This too can best be assessed by a specialist.  I can respect your view that you only wish your girlfriend to have any contact with your privates outside of yourself.  However, a urologist is a medical professional specifically trained to deal with problems with your privates.  There is no encroachment on your privacy, nor any reproach or chastisement toward the practice that may have led to the need for professional evaluation.  If you are reluctant to see a specialist for fear of \"scolding\", please do not feel that way.  Your overall health - physically and mentally is at stake. A urologist has only your best health and interest in mind.    I suggest that you contact your primary MD for a referral, or through your local health clinic.   Continue to keep open communication with your girlfriend also, you may find you two have come together to find each other and appreciate other aspects of each other way beyond sex.  And in so discovering - find that there are many more reasons to live for each other on a daily basis.\n\n",

My penis has grown very little if at all in width/length, I have no facial or armpit hair, yet I have grown over a foot in about a year, my voice has deepened significantly, I have coarse, thick pubic hair, and I can produce semen. I have been masturbating to orgasm for longer than I can remember (probably since I was about 9, by my guess). I was wondering if there's anything I can do that's been delaying it, or anything I can do to speed up my penile growth, as I am interested in women, but I cannot act upon my feelings besides masturbation, which I have been doing a lot.  Thanks, E\n\n",

But, it would not hurt to have a complete physical exam with a doctor - in fact it is recommended in adolescence.  Your pediatrician is still an excellent resource at your age because he or she is knowledgeable about human growth and developmental stages.  The doctor will evaluate and perhaps check hormone levels to see if there is anything amiss.  If it's just patience you need, at least you will know you have checked it out to be sure.

    "content": "Hello,  According to your description, this could be a varicocele. Varicocele is a dilatation of the veins within the scrotum. 15-20% of the normal fertile males may have varicocele.   The causes of varicoceles are not known, but probably due to abnormal valves inside the veins that impair the normal blood flow.  Varicoceles are commonly seen on the left side than in the right due to different anatomic factors.  Important considerations regarding varicoceles in adolescents are: - The varicocele is a progressive lesion - Early repair of the varicocele prevents the development of infertility.  Surgery is the primary form of treatment for varicoceles. However, not all varicoceles need surgical correction.    Clinical picture and physical examination are essential to determine the proper management approach.  I would advise you to seek direct medical consultation for proper examination. Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, You could see a urologist but it is possible that you will do fine once you are in a committed romantic relationship.  There is a very strong psychological component and you may be pleasantly surprised at the effect this has.  If you still have difficulty you could benefit from counseling to see if there is some subconscious cause.  Medications are sometimes implicated both positively and negatively.    I would not be overly concerned at this point, but focus on other aspects of your life that will help you to feel good about yourself.  Body building/weight lifting and other toning can help.  It's like a lot of things - the more you focus on it the harder it becomes but once you focus away from it, things work out better.    Best wishes.\n\n",

Compared to pictures I've seen, my penis is not the most severe case, but the curve is definitely noticable and very dissatisfying. There is never any pain in my penis but I still don't know the cause. I do not know how long it has been like this, since I only recently started noticing it. I hypothesize that maybe masturbating to the left side could have cause this. Is that possible? I do not think I was born with a curved penis but environmental stimuli is to blame.  My real question is how to fix it. I discovered a technique online called the \"curved jelq\". It is an exercise where the erect penis is bent back into place(straight) through repetitions. Does this method work?  Thanks, Brandon\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It is possible it could have been affected by the masturbation - at least some theorize that association.  Obviously though it does not affect everyone who masturbates so that would cause one to question this concept out of hand.  Other possible causes are normal variation and Peyronie's disease where scar tissue forms to prevent the normal even expansion.  In those cases the procedure may be helpful but I can't actually verify that beyond what you have probably learned on the internet as well.  You probably have nothing to lose but keep in mind, this deviation is not necessarily a liability.  Every body is different and imperfect.  Hopefully you don't expect physical perfection in your partner nor would she expect it of you.  If it is not causing discomfort you may learn to accept this as just part of the individual you are.  It is much more common than you probably realize.  Good luck\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Penile Dsyfunction due to diabetes",
    "content": "Hello -  This has to be a very frustrating problem for you both. Diabetes frequently can cause this sort of problem, and it can be due to either nerve damage, impaired circulation, or a combination of both. If it is due to nerve damage Viagra and similar drugs probably will loose effectiveness over time. If, however, it is due more to impaired circulation,  then Viagra might be useful. It sounds as though your husband does respond to it to some degree,  just not enough to successfullly maintain an erection. I would suggest he not increase the dose on his own, unless there is a range of doseage already included in the precription instructions, but instead to discuss this with his doctor, to see if the doctor feels it is appropriate and safe to increase it and by how much. I suspect an increase might help, but since Viagra is not without its side effects and risks (including dangerous drops in blood pressure) please be certain your husband only increases the dose with medical supervision -- or at least the doctor's OK.   There is  also the distinct possibility  that there is something else going on, perhaps some emotional complication, which needs to be addressed. We tend to focus on the first and most obvious cause, and the fact that your husband has been told he has erectile dysfunction secondary to diabetes doesn't mean he might not also suffer (at least by now) from some performance anxiety as well. All possibilities need to be explored.  I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you both. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I am a 15 year old male who for the past week has been experiencing mild pain and discomfort in both testicles. I can't keep track but it seems it alternates between each testicle, sometimes it is in both. This only occurs when I am sitting, or lying down, if I walk around for long/short periods of time, I feel no pain. There are times where I am sitting or lying down where there is no pain as well. I gave my self a self examination and I found what I believe to be hydroceles around both testicles, the right one appears to be a little larger. The scrotum does not feel swollen at all nor do the testicles. I have no other problems as of yet, no blood in semen or any feel-able bumps in the scrotum area. Both testicles seem to be both the same size. I read on another medical forum that this is normal in teenage boys, however I want a second opinion to be on the safe side.   I am a virgin, and I am not on any medication, nor have I had any operations.  If any other information is needed, please post.\n\n",

Some of the causes may include injury, infection, accumilation of testicular fluid (hydrocele) as you mention, varicocele (enlargement of veins) often described as a feeling of a \"bag of worms\", etc. Again, regardless of the causative factor I would encourage you to have a physical evaluation by your physician. Best wishes. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -   From your description this does sounds like it is probably phimosis, which could,  in fact, interfere with your sex life in the future. I don't know what the cheapest way to fix it is, but I do know the only reliable way would be  circumcision, which is pretty simple and probably not too costly. The anesthetics used vary from a sprayed-on local to light sedation (which would be my preference, as there is no risk of possible loss of sensitivity, although that risk is very small).   The sensitivity you experience now will  probably translate into a healthy sensitivity without the  discomfort,  once the situation is corrected. Any post-surgical soreness should dissipate within a week or so.   I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello wasley81 -  While it's easy to understand your concern about this new problem, given your history, this  needs attention. It isn't likely to get better on its own, and would likely improve quickly with proper treatment.   How are you certain you have a cyst, by the way? Has this already been confirmed by a doctor? People do get these sometimes, and they are either successfully treated most times or sometimes removed. Without knowing what exactly is going on it's impossible to calculate the odds of any predisposition to cancer, but there is also no reason to assume there is any risk if you find out what this thing actually is and have it treated or removed. Of course removal could well mean loss of the epidiymis as well, which with your situation could possible render you sterile.  As for the ability to ejaculate with no testicles (and please don't assume you'll wind up that way, you just need to have the immediate problem treated), yes, it is still  possible so long as the prostate is intact, as that gland is the source of semen. You would, however, need testosterone supplements if  you lost the remaining testicle (and again, this is just a hypothetical situation, since there's no reason to think that will happen).  Get yourself examined soon before the problem gets worse. Hopefully by now you have. Let us know how things turn out. Good luck to you.\n\n",

When I 1st got the pain, every time I went to the doctors I was just given antibiotics as they just thought I has a infection of the epididymus.  I had a scan about a year after i got this pain, it was confirmed to be a cyst.  I have been back to my GPs every time I have had unbearable pain, i even went to the hospital and was just give another lot of antibiotics.  Some time its fine...it has been fine since my last mail, but it just keeps flaring up every now and again.  Its so sensitive if it gets knocked at all i'll have pain for about a week after. I know the pain will go away but i now know the pain will always come back.  One GP said to me i should just leave it alone and put up with the pain. I could just about put up with it...if there was no risks at leaving it there. But i have read a few stories and i'm pretty worried about having cancer in later life..or the fact that it might get infected and cause me to loose this one tooo.  if i did get a cancer lump i'll probably not know about till its too late.  What are my options from here and do you suggest coz i don't seem to get much help from my GPs  thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  The consensus among urologists and genitourinary specialists is that this sort of thing is best left alone if possible. I've gotten that answer from several rather prominent specialists now. They'd rather allow it to run its course and get better on its own. Of course if the pain becomes severe and constant (instead of transient) it may require treatment and there are things that can be done, including, of course, removal or destruction of the cyst, but there is then a great risk of loss of function of the epididymis. If this is not a concern for you (the risk of sterility), then it would be an option to consider in the future. The risk of cancer with this problem is statistically non-existent, apparently, so the main concerns are dealing with the pain and the concerns regarding sterility.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello again -  A second scan might be in order, since the problem does seem to not be getting better on its own. While most of them do, I guess \"most\" is not the same as all. The frequent severe pain and discomfort for so long really does deserve some sort of intervention. I don't know why this is happening, but the area is so sensitive and innervated that anything out of bounds there is bound to cause a good deal of pain, and the most likely cause would be an increase in the size of the cyst. If, indeed, it has grown instead of shrinking, then surgery would probably be your best option. There's not much else you can do to ease the pain, as far as I know, unless your doctor were to choose to prescribe opioid pain meds, but this would only be putting a band-aid on the problem.  A new scan seems your best bet at this point. Let us know, please, how this goes.\n\n",

    "content": "I have noticed that when i get an erection, my penis head seems to stay roughly the same size as it does when its not erect. If i strain it seems to look like it inflates, and becomes bigger. As soon as I stop it shrinks back down. There also are two blue bumps 2-3 cm below the head on the front. If you pull the skin tight, it looks like two small veins that become blue. I don't know if that has anything to do with it but it couldnt hurt to tell. Thank you for your time\n\n",

However recently, meaning the past 2 attempts, I just haven't felt quite.. up to it?  I would get an erection but soon after getting started, I would feel drained, like maybe I didn't have it in me after all, and my erection would subside. There must be some psychological problem that I am having, but I can't put my finger on it.  I know without a doubt that I love this girl completely, and she absolutely turns me on; I don't think I am burnt out on sex, is that possible?  We have sex once a night about 3 nights a week.  I'm not really stressed out, I'm actually at a pretty good place right now in my life... I don't smoke and rarely drink... I'm stumped. =( This is my first sexual relationship, but I have experienced times in the past where I don't have any sex drive for a couple weeks, meaning I would go that whole time without masturbating or really even thinking about sex.  This is very rare though, and it seemed to only happen when I was under heavy \"girl\" pressure, like early stages of relationships, or when a girl plays with my emotions and leads me on (evil thing to do, by the way). I don't know, maybe I'm crazy!\n\n",

When I go to the bathroom, I notice that I leak a little bit of semen after I am done. I am having a very hard time explaining it. I know that I strain harder than I used to because I feel not being finished quickly, could that be a reason? Hearing a lot about prostate cancer, I am worried. Can it be a sign of prostate cancer or other major disorder? If not, what is it? Less frequent sexual activity, bad diet, lack of enough exercise? I am waiting for the right time to get checked out, but in the mean time, I would greatly appreciate any feedback. Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Jupi -   First we must be certain what you're seeing is semen. It may look like it (and it may well be semen) but how do we know this for certain? This is a fairly unusual symptom, and could be due to an enlarged prostate or prostatitis, but if it were the latter you would certainly have other complaints as well and feel quite ill.  I'm wondering if this might not be something else, perhaps the product of a urinary tract infection. It's difficult to say, and I'm not sure what you mean about \"the right time\" to get it checked, but it would seem now is the right time, since you have something odd going on and it shouldn't be left to chance.  This is the best I can do with the limited information, but see a doctor soon to be sure you don't have an infection somewhere in the genitourinary system. You don't want that to continue to get worse and cause irreversible damage.  Hope by now you've found out what the problem is (if there is one) and have it managed. Please let us know what you learn.\n\n",

I have read online ( \"The Plain Facts About Varicocele\" ) that it may be healed by doing the following three things. 1) Do not get an erection 2) Do alot of excersize, especially for the lower stomach, back, upper thighs and butt 3) Apply cold water twice a day (the colder the better).  I have controlled my erection for a week now which is very very difficult for me.  But my question is about applying cold water .  I have done that for a few days but I want to know if that is harmful in any way.   If this doesnt work and my wife doesn't get pregnant within a few months, my urologist said that surgery would be an option. If this process of applying cold water works, i would rather suffer through that. Its not painful at all, just uncomfortable to have cold water down there. I really appreciate you help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi James,  There are a few possibilities for this.  First, any time a blister is seen on the penis, one must consider herpes.  Herpes can remain dormant for some time then emerge with blisters.    It is also possible that what you are seeing is due to a clogged pore or gland that has subsequently become enlarged due to a build up of fluid behind the obstruction.  These can subsequently become infected as well.  If this is not improving I would recommend you see your doctor for an evaluation.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi banjo_minoy, A varicocele is essentially enlarged veins in the testes which disrupts blood flow and prevents adequate cooling. This also contributes to decreased sperm counts. Although a percentage of testosterone is produced in the testes the initial process is triggered in the brain. Symptoms of low testosterone levels may exhibit additional symptoms for example, underdeveloped genitalia, breast enlargement, etc. You may want to discuss testosterone level evaluation with your physician but keep in mind that although there are guidelines for development during puberty, that's exactly what they are, guidelines. It doesn't mean that every single male experiences the exact same changes at the exact same age. Best wishes. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

The normal penis can seem abnormal at times with various lumps, bumps, vein engorgement, etc.  Of course if it bothers you, seeing a doctor can be wise if only for peace of mind.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Apparently there is the possibility of trauma to the penis, which could even be caused by masturbation, that might result in a buildup of plaque.  You may want to discuss this with your urologist to see if this is the case for you since the particular site in question is related to the spot you have repeatedly grabbed with masturbation.  In this case I don't know if it will resolve on its own or even if it is of any long-term consequence.    Make an appointment with a specialist to be sure.  Best to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Welshman123,  Phimosis, itself, is not a particularly concerning issue.  The worry with phimosis is actually the risk that because of the tightening of the foreskin it may become trapped behind the glans cutting off circulation to it.  If this happens it becomes a surgical emergency if the foreskin cannot be brought forward again.  This requires an emergent circumcision.  Obviously, an emergency surgery is never a desired outcome.  There are a few options if you truly have a phimosis.  1st, circumcision can be done.  At 19, this is not necessarily the most comfortable procedure but if desired it can certainly be done (typically by a urologist).  2nd, there is a newer treatment where a high potency topical steroid cream is applied to the tip of the foreskin twice a day for about 2-4 weeks with daily gentle traction (pulling) on the foreskin without pulling it back beyond the glans.  This takes advantage of one of the side effects of topical steroids-skin thinning.  The steroid helps thin and loosen the foreskin resolving the phimosis and preventing the need for a circumcision.  I have used this in several of my patients with very good success.  First, however, you should see your doctor for an evaluation to see if any of this is even needed.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, In studies, all men who reported sexual side effects with diminished libido, ejaculation problems, erectile dysfunction said they had complete resolution when interviewed five years later.  At one year some reported continued effects (less than 2% of users).  So, we can't say at what point exactly they felt their function was \"normal\" for them again since they weren't interviewed during that four year interval.      There can be a psychological effect also.  Some people are very susceptible to the power of suggestion.  Knowing this could be a problem alone causes side effects.  This is why they are also reported in the control group studied who did not get the drug at all.   There are other reasons for sexual problems and it could be merely coincidental.  30% of men in their 30s report some sexual dysfunction (even without medications).  Men's sexual peak occurs at a very young age as opposed to women.  You might talk with a therapist about this.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hey Doc!  I'm a normal 23 year old guy. I enjoy sex with my Girlfriend and masturbating. Around 5 months ago, I had unprotected sex with a girl. Was a very stupid mistake. I am recently having some concerns with my penis head. I'm generally a very clean person, I wash my penis every morning in the shower. During the day I\u2019m fine but later on sometimes I get a slight itch, or twitching just under my foreskin. When I pull back my foreskin, the head of my penis usually appears to be moist. Could this be dis-charge? It doesn't smell too appealing. I've not noticed any other signs that it could be. It also appears to be slightly red on the underside once the foreskin has been pulled back, is this whats causing the itching? The head of my penis, around the edge appears to be a deep bluey-purple colour, now I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s common or anything to do with my problem. 1 more thing, if I either forget, or leave my penis and don't clean it for over a day, I seem to get a white tissue like substance behind my foreskin, I have recently discovered this is smegma. I'm always a bit cautious with my new girlfriend now when she goes down to give me a blowjob, I don't want her getting a mouthful of that!  Any advice given to what this is will be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!\n\n",

This can cause itching, increased white discharge and soreness.    Of course we always must be concerned about sexually transmitted infections when having sex with someone whose history we don't know so having yourself screened for such potential problems would be wise.  Some of these infections are rampant so don't be too quick to rule out the possibility.    If it is just the normal smegma that you are noticing, daily cleaning is the solution.   Just basic washing with the foreskin pulled back is all that is needed.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, This is common enough there is a name for it:  sex headaches and men are three times as likely to get them as women.  Usually they are nothing to worry about, but some can be a sign of something serious, such as problems with blood vessels to your brain.  For this reason it's wise to have it checked out.  It is also possible this could be triggered by low blood sugar, drug use, sinus infection, or other conditions.  Some people have these in clusters, where they occur several times in a short timespan, then disappear for a while, recurring later with another cluster.    If the doctor discovers no underlying problem, he/she might be able to prescribe medication that could help such as anti-inflammatories, beta-blockers, or migraine relief medications.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Lab values are important in relationship to their specific, provided range stated on the report, and normal is a broad range (likely somewhere between 300 and 1100 ng/dl).  It will also vary with the time of day the specimen was collected (higher in the early morning hours; lower as they day goes on).    This does not sound like a low level to me and definitely in the acceptable range .  If the lab indicated his testosterone was in the normal range, I would not worry about it too much unless he has other symptoms.  Lab determination is a complex process and hopefully his doctor can better explain the relationships between the free and bound testosterone.  This is outside my area of expertise.  In addition to low sex drive, other symptoms of low testosterone levels include lowered sperm count, hot flashes, fatigue, trouble concentrating and depression.    There are many factors that make up libido and medications, depression, relationships, etc. can affect it.  I hope he doesn't judge himself by the media representation of sex drive.  This can be grossly misrepresented.  Best wishes to you both.\n\n",

    "content": "During the past 6 weeks I have been unable to orgasm during intercourse with my wife, but am able to, very quickly, when she masturbates me after I withdraw. I have no sensation of wanting to orgasm during intercourse, despite being fully aroused and spending up to two hours with foreplay and sex. I was put on Citalopram 20mg for depression nine weeks ago, and have discussed the problem with my GP three weeks ago. He suggested I reduce the dose to 10mg, and wait and see! He also offerd me Viagra. My wife is being very patient, and is not putting any pressure on me to 'perform', but I feel she is becoming frustrated with this, as am I. Can you help?\n\n",

    "content": "jenihar,  Your concern about not being to ejaculated during vaginal intercourse sounds frustrating and given that you have recently began Citalopram 20mg for depression a few weeks ago it is likely attributable to that medication. That said, I am not a medical doctor. However, what you described is not so uncommon with persons who take antidepressants. The inability to ejaculate during vaginal can also be contributed to over lubrication or lack of friction. Nonetheless,.....  At this point, you might want to consider engaging in talk therapy with a qualified professional to explore the causes of your depression. Once addressed I am reasonably confident your degree sexual functionality will return.  Good luck and keep us posted.  Tim\n\n",

    "content": "It sounds like you are being treated for depression by your GP, depending on the severity of your depression you may wish to consult with a psychiatrist who specializes in medical management of depression. He/She then could most likely identify a medication that may produce less desireable side effects.  In response to your question should you stop the medication, that depends on your answer to the question; Are the benefits to taking the medication out weighed by the negative side effects? If the answer to that question is yes, you may want to consider an in office consultation with a psychiatrist who can suggest other medications.

    "content": "Hello, The first and easiest thing to try is to not try too hard.  What I mean is, enjoy each other with no plan to actually progress to intercourse.  See if this kind of physical intimacy results in a better response.  It often does.  There is tremendous psychological pressure to perform and if you can plan to just take it easy and let things progress however they may, you are likely to have improvement.  Try concentrating on her, with other stimulation besides intercourse.    If this exercise (and I don't mean just try it once) does not help, you should consult a doctor to see if there is some underlying problem.  Drugs can contribute to this problem and this includes smoking and smokeless tobacco use as well as alcohol and mind-altering drugs.  If you take any other medications, this should be considered as well.    About 5% of young men suffer from this disorder but it is often very treatable so don't despair.  If I were you I would get rid of the tobacco for more reasons than this.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I'm 22 years old, male. A while back I entered a relationship with a great lady. We recently tried to consummate it but I was unable to achieve an erection despite pretty vigorous stimulation. I assumed at the time it was because I had been drinking earlier that evening, but on one occasion since then I was sober and still could not get erect enough for penetration. I get aroused (my penis swells a good deal and I release plenty of pre-ejaculate) but it's not enough to actually do anything with it.  I'm otherwise in great health -- haven't been sick in years, I eat reasonably well and get a good-ish amount of exercise (maybe not as much as I should). The only thing I can think of is that I don't really wait to get erect when I masturbate, either, so maybe I've sort of conditioned my body to anticipate orgasm without an erection. I dunno, but I'd like to figure this out; it's very distressing.  Best,  RB\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, First you should have a physical exam but if nothing is evident there, you may do well to have some therapy with a competent sex therapist.  Much sexual dysfunction arises from psychological and relationship causes.  While many men masturbate without it affecting their sex life otherwise, there are some who find it is disruptive, particularly if you use pornography in the process.  Real relationships are very different than what the media portrays.  You may also benefit from medications like Viagra, Cymbalta or Levitra.  Good luck.\n\n",

However, it did not. Right afterwards, I begin to feel a strong pain in my testicles. And I had just noticed unusual \"lumps\" in them too... I'm seriously fearing that I will never be able to perform intercourse or even produce offspring (not that I'm considering just yet).

This is true in my case, but I do not believe it is the cause of my problem. Also, I am more than concerned of the reason that my testicles are in pain and why they have lumps on them... Please tell me there is a cure to my condition...  Thank you.\n\n",

This particular condition is essentially enlargement of veins in the testical and has been often described as a feeling of a \"bag or worms\" so to speak. If you have not had a physical evaluation I would strongly suggest that you do so to identify the underlying factor. Diagnostic studies, i.e., an ultrasound can identify if this or another condition is responsible for your symptoms. Best wishes. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

There are various non-emergency conditions that can result in such a ridge, including cysts, thrombosed veins, and benign tumors.

    "content": "Thanks for the reply Dr. Lowe.  I wonder if this connection has been studied at all?  How would you even go about testing it?  I suppose the best way would be to simply do a survey of individuals in set age ranges both of men with and without ED.  I guess the simple questions would be to ask them two things.  How often do/did you masturbate and how often do/did you view porn.  Simple answers to start out would be Very often, occasionally, rarely and never.  Then if the survey points one way or the other it might warrant doing a more controlled study.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I have also seen many examples of men who found they did have to have a bigger and better porn fix to get the same stimulation.   I have also seen men whose marriages were damaged due to the fact the real thing could never match up to the fake stuff in the porn.  On the other hand, I have seen no \"scientific\" studies to confirm the connection, though it would be a difficult thing to test since it is very subjective. Also, who wants to volunteer to find out if they will achieve erectile dysfunction?    I am sure it is a very individualized thing, but, porn can be addictive and like every other addiction, there is risk involved.  In this case it may be your relationship you put on the line.  The psyche is a very delicate thing and it is hard to predict how it will affect you.  I do know the damage it would do to my relationship.  I would not be interested in competing with a porn model or to even be classified with her so I would likely end the relationship over it - call me a prude.  This is another side of the coin you may want to consider.  Only you can decide if it is a risk you want to take.    Best wishes.\n\n",

On the second day I looked and just below the head of my penis on the shaft, I had some redness and a small cluster of pimples or blisters.  I had soaked in the bath tub earlier and after noticing the small cluster I applied some Neosporin cream.  Within the next day the small cluster was gone, however it seems the left side of my penis under my head is swollen.    Now, I am circumsized and I have a yearly physical each year and my most recent was in Dec of 06.  I have always had myself tested for HIV and Herpes and have never had an issue.    My girlfriend and I have a lot of sex.  Usually 2-3 times a day 5 out of 7 days a week.  She is a nurse and has not had any weird symptoms.  I have not had any buring, itching, pain in urinating.  The small bumps are gone after a couple of days, but I can't understand the swelling on the left side, just under where the head and the shaft of the penis meets.  Any thoughts?\n\n",

If it was an infection it may have spread into the surrounding area some causing the swelling you are noticing.  If there is no pain and the redness is gone it is unlikely that the infection is continuing but it may take a few days for the swelling to resolve.  If it persists I would suggest you see your doctor to be sure everything is OK.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I wonder if you have tried other activities in a prone position to see if it is actually JUST during sex or if it is more a gravity effect on your sinus drainage.  Perhaps trying some other physical activity such as pushups might help to deterimine if it is mostly positional.  If so, it might warrant a visit to a doctor to find out if there is an underlying cause of the drainage itself which seems to be out of control.  Perhaps there is an allergy or nasal polyps.    If you find it is only during sex (absolutely), you may have to alter your position or explore possible allergies.  Does your partner use cologne or other perfumed products that may be affecting your sinuses?  Do you only have sex at a particular place that is different than where you sleep?    If it is allergy, perhaps seeing a specialist to determine what the offender might be would be in order.  Good luck.\n\n",

It doesn't hurt in anyway at all, it feels really soft and looks as though liquid is underneath. I've waited about 20 minutes for it to go backdown but am getting worried. My penis was fine about 3 hours ago. Is this anything to worry about?  Many thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hello CChild,  If everything is fine now, it is likely nothing to worry about.  In the future, if your foreskin becomes trapped behind the head of your penis and you cannot bring if forward you need to see your doctor right away because this can cause poor circulation, which leads to swelling and subsequently cutting off more circulation.  This process spirals on itself and can do major damage if not corrected quickly.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Dizzy after sex in the shower.  What's wrong?",
    "content": "Hello Furious3,  I suspect that what is happening is your blood pressure is dropping causing your dizziness.  Warm showers tend to cause the blood vessels to dilate.  Then, following ejaculation the body begins to come down from the stimulated state it was in.  As a result, blood pressure drops even more.  Probably, the combination of the dilated veins from the warmth with the relaxation following ejaculation your blood pressure is probably getting a bit too low.  This is not particularly dangerous since the blood pressure will restore to normal in a few moments; however, it is possible to actually pass out from this.  This is the body's way of restoring proper blood flow to the brain since upon passing out, one falls to the ground and is flat allowing easier blood flow to the brain.  There are a few things you can try to help this.  First, stay very well hydrated.  The goal of this is to have urine that is clear (no yellow color).  If this is not sufficient there are a few other things you can try with the guidance of your doctor, including increasing salt intake and some medicines that can help increase venous tone.  These things have some side effects (including the salt) so it is important to be under the care of your doctor when starting these treatments.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello PEsufferer,  To my knowledge, hypospadias and its repair are not linked to premature ejaculation.  There are a few PE treatments that may be helpful for you.  The \"squeeze technique\" is one of the more effective methods.  This method is basically retraining your body to gain control.  With this method, just before ejaculation the penis is squeezed just below the corona (the rim of the head of the penis) until the urge subsides.  This is repeated 3-4 times before allowing ejaculation.  This is a slow process but over several months, most men gain better control.  If this is ineffective, there are some medications that can be used.  These are prescription medicines so you'll need to see your doctor to discuss these if you would like them.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Much more likely than this are conditions that cause mucous formation in the GI tract.  The mucous may look like semen.  This can occur from inflammatory type conditions of the GI tract ranging from infections to an inflammatory bowel disease.  If this condition continues, seeing a GI specialist would be appropriate.  A colonoscopy may be helpful to look for evidence of any of connections or other inflammatory problems.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, This is something most people don't know for sure until they attempt pregnancy.  This goes for men as well as women.  While a small variety are infertile, most young men are able to impregnate a woman who is also fertile unless they have been treated for cancer or some other disease that may have left them sterile.  Typically it takes less than a year of active trying without using contraception.  Most people don't have sperm analysis done until they find they are not successful after a period of time.  That is the only way to know for sure, but I would not worry; chances are you are fertile and it sounds like you function just fine.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I think you are referring to ejaculation.   You did not mention if you are on any medications.  This is a common cause for ejaculatory disorders.  Smoking, drugs and other underlying medications, such as diabetes, can also contribute negatively.  Most often, however, these things are psychological in origin and may be caused by deep-seated anxieties.  A counselor might be helpful.    It is also possible that when the time is right in a good relationship, you will perform fine.  Masturbation is a poor prognosticator of future performance, as is a superficial sexual relationship without the emotional stability of a solid, caring relationship.    You should see a doctor if you are concerned that there may be a medical condition, so a general physical exam would be a good place to start, but I would not worry too much.  Chances are with time, the problem can be resolved.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "i just noticed a similiar white \"pimple\" type yesterday, and never having had ANYTHING remotely like this still has me nervous.  it is a small delicate pimple-like thing on the VERY VERY tip of my penis ever so slightly on the inside part of the tip. When I first saw it, I touched it and it popped quite easily. Immediately around the\"pimple\", the area is dark reddish. It is ONLY in this immediate area,,,the rest of the tip of my penis is unaffected. This \"pimple\" continually gets popped because it seems very delicate and in a very exposed part of my penis. When i bathe and dry, it'll pop. Therefore I don't know if the healing will be inhibited by this.  There is no pain at all when i urinate. No nothing out of the ordinary except for the existence of the pimple. However I CAN feel something down there probably because but it seems it's because it is an exposed delicate tissue...but the think itself, the area itself does not cause pain.   i haven't had sex in 3 weeks to a month.  What should I do...see a doctor immediately, monitor it? Should I look for changes? The issue is, of course, I have to keep this confidential and see an std service center if it came down to that.  thx\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Valleyman,  I would agree with Tim's recommendations.  I would add, though that if there is nothing wrong physically and there is nothing wrong psychologically that basically eliminates the two areas that are involved in this process.  So I would submit that there is either a problem physically (physiologically) or there is an issue psychologically.  Given that you are able to ejaculate, the nervous system connections necessary are present and functioning.    I am wondering if there may actually be some unrecognized psychological pressures that are changing your perceptions of the sensations of orgasm.  It may also be that your body is now recognizing the sensations of orgasm differently such that you are not perceiving the sensation as an orgasm.  Often, these changes find their root in some psychological issues as well.    Follow up with your urologist may be helpful.  Also, seeing a therapist may actually be of some benefit.  As Tim said, sometimes seeming unrelated things can have significant impact on sexual health.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I'd like to add to the fine replies of both Dr. Chan and Tim. As both have clearly stated organic causes are to be excluded first, although psychogenic causes are most common (90% of causes).   Its good to know that your testosterone level is normal.   Alcohol in addition to some medications such as SSRI antidepressants e.g. fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft) and paroxetine (Paxil).  A list of other conditions that should be considered are neurological diseases such as spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, and diabetetic neuropathy.   Its good that you are coming forward with this, since most men don't as Dr. Chan mentioned on the Private Forum when discussing your question. The fact that you are losing interest will only aggrevate the condition.  So the way this is handled is as follows: First exclude all the organic causes mentioned above even the very rare causes. Once that has been done you're left with only one pretty common possibility --> psychological. The problem with psychological causes is they may co-exist with organic causes worsening the condition. The other problem is its hard even for a experienced doctor to make the diagnosis of a psychogenic cause for a condition since its usually done by exclusion. I wouldn't rule it out if I were you. In addition the difficult marriage relationship as well as the divorce are all risk factors for psychological problems. It's tempting to jump right at it.  I hope we have helped to shed some light on your condition. It isn't easy, I know we all researched it and discussed it on the Private Forum.  Please keep us updated and feel free to add to this thread!  Good luck!\n\n",

Consider seeing a neurologist to rule-out a neurologic condition that can interfere with sexual function (as was mentioned by Dr. Fouad). 2. Many medications, over-the-counter, herbs, prescription drugs, and drugs of abuse can cause sexual dysfunction.  3. Since this seems to be confusing, you may want to consult a psychiatrist to rule-out a psychiatric condition that may be a factor in this.

You didn't mention how long you worked with the sex therapist but a disorder like this can take quite a while to overcome but with a good therapist and following instructions for the graduated assignments, success rates are actually quite good.  But, it is not a quick fix.  Communication and trust in the partner are key factors.  If you are not currently in a relationship due to divorce, the techniques will likely not fix the problem since it is interactive.  It is more rare for men to have this disorder (about 8% vs 24% for women) but obviously that means many men suffer this way and you are not alone.  It doesn't fix the problem, but can be nice to know when it may feel like you are alone in this.    Hypnosis and electrovibrators are alternative treatment that might be helpful in performance anxiety or inability to orgasm.   Your therpaist should be able to guide you in this.    Patience is the one piece of mind I can recommend now.  Goodluck.\n\n",

    "content": "I would agree that all possible medical causes for your problem need to be explored, and it seems that many of them have.  Still, the urologist consult sounds like a good next step.  Also, you must be vigilant about considering the effect of all medicines and vitamin/herbal preparations you are taking.        You did mention that your inability to achieve orgasm began during your previous marriage and played a role in its demise.  So, I am inclined to suspect that this began with a psychological issue (perhaps your self esteem was negatively impacted in the marriage) and is now compounded by the tension of continued failure to overcome the problem.      Please consider finding a therapist with whom you feel comfortable and commit to exploration of your feelings about relationships and sexuality. I have heard that some physicians are willing to prescribe a short course of Viagra or Cialis which sometimes \"jumpstarts\" the sexual response but that may not be as effective in the long term as good therapy.      Try to stay positive.  Beverly H.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Valleyman,  I sympathize with your current dismay.  I also appreciate your efforts to find a definable cause for the anorgasmia.  Dr. Fouad mentioned an aspect that I believe is worth your pursuing further.  You mentioned you have an endocrinologist. Since many people have diabetes that is managed by their primary doctor, the fact that you have your own endocrinologist suggests you have an ongoing pervasive problem - possibly with diabetes?  While many people are aware that diabetic neuropathy can affect the sensorium in regards to hands, feet and pain in the extremeties, not as many people are aware that diabetic neuropathy can be:  peripheral, autonomic, proximal, and/or focal. Our bodies are marvelously complicated, and each of these nervous systems work on different areas.  The autonomic nervous system is the one responsible for sexual response.  While the \"plumbing\" may be intact, it is still possible that the nervous pathway may be compromised.  Have you explored this with your endocrinologist? I do not know what options there are if indeed this is the basis for your problem, but at the very least, to identify the source may enable you to make decisions for your life that will enhance and protect it. In any event, I heartily recommend you continue your therapies regarding your relationship concerns.  There are wonderful relationships that can be built without the need for sexual activity to be a cement.  And sexual fulfillment in a loving communication is still possible, with a partner that appreciates ALL of you - not just your appendage!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear ValleyMan:  Wow!  The whole team is trying to help you with this.  In reviewing the answers, I see a couple of other possibilities, medical and psychological.  Has anyone done a complete battery of lab work--not just testosterone levels?  If not, I would suggest, in particular, the following:  Lipid panel Thyroid panel Corticosteroid levels  If you have a vascular problem (evaluated by lipid panel and blood pressure), it could show up as a sexual function problem in general, although this is less likely since you are able to achieve an erection.  A thyroid panel would be useful also.  Steroid levels are important, because the sympathetic nervous system is responsible for ejaculation.  If you have an adrenal gland problem it could affect this function, because steroids are produced in the adrenal gland.  Since you have seen a urologist, I am assuming that your prostate gland has been evaluated and is normal.  If not, that will need attention.  It would be unusual, though, for someone of your age to have a prostate gland problem.  How long ago did you see a sex therapist?  It could be that the initial problem was not psychological, but that it is now.  If you have not seen a sex therapist recently, and all the somatic possibilities have been ruled out, you should consider going back.  There is one other possibility:  Conversion disorder.  This is a problem that is psychological in nature but that presents as a somatic condition for which no physiologic cause can be found.  You really need a psychiatrist with experience in consultation-liaison psychiatry to look at this possibility, as it is very difficult to diagnose.  Good luck, and please come back and let us know how things are going.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello all  Thanks for your responses. I did see a neurologist who suggested that everything was normal after he took a few quick physical tests. I met with a sex therapist for about 3 sessions who said that my problems weren't pshycological and suggested me to check with an endocrinologist or followup with my urologist.  I don't have diabetes and I was able to go to an endocrinologist without a referral. I told him about my condition and he verified from the blood tests that I wasn't suffering from any pituitary or hypothalmic tumors. He suggested I consult a urologist. My urologist mentioned that he couldn't identify any obvious reasons for my problems and asked me to see a therapist.   Earlier I had been to an urologist regarding some pain in my groin area which occurs just after masturbation and about low quantity of semen. He said that he couldn't relate to any of my issues and nothing seemed obviously wrong.  He conducted a cystoscopy and he couldn't find anything wrong except for some inflammation. I do recall that my problems started about two months after this incident. I'm not sure if it's related, the same urologist mentioned that it isn't.  So I have been literally running in circles from one doctor to the other.\n\n",

    "content": "Valleyman,  Let's take a look at what sex therapy is:  Sex therapy is a short-term solution-focused intervention, let's say 6-12, possibily 15 sessions in rare or complicated situations. Solution focused is simply that, in your case it will be to have you reach an unretarded/normal ejaculation/orgasim.  It is necessary to evaluate relationship issues as a part of sex therapy but they are not the primary issue. Sex therapists treat the sexual problem directly as compared to the supposition that that other relationship issues must be resolved prior to reaching an accetable degree of sexual satification with your partner. However research and my professional experiences has shown that couples who share an intimate intellectual conection tend to have few performance issues.  You have two options here to accept, those being:  it is not psychological ..therefore it must be physiological---so you need medical treatment or if it is not physiological it must be psychological--so you psychological care... or a combination of both...then you need to start over at square one. Given that you have already ruled both out. Consider it psychological at this point.  I have reviewed ther thread thus far and recommend that you pursue working with a sex therapist to explore satisfying your sexual desires through means other than vaginal sex or masturbation. I believe at this point you have nothing to loose by consulting with your previous sex therapist and asking him/her for referral to someone who uses a differing approach.   You may even want to try an SSRI or SNRI as a paradoxical attempt to experience an orgasim. What is the worst that could come of it?  you may experience an orgasim, there is nothing wrong with prescription medication as long as it is prescribed for a specific purpose and is being used for said purpose. You can do it....Let us know how the evaluation goes and the results. Wishing you the bext.  Tim\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Some bumps and skin variations are quite normal.  I would advise first leaving it alone (no squeezing or picking) to see if it goes away.  Even if it doesn't that does not mean it is a problem, but it can be analyzed better if it has not been irritated by you.  Squeezing can lead to infection.  Not knowing the sexual history of your past partner of course leaves you somewhat vulnerable to STI so it doesn't hurt to be tested to be sure anyway.  Good luck.\n\n",

On the commercial they just say it actually makes you bigger.  However, the results of the study I saw said that only a percentage of those who took it experienced any real size increase.  I believe it was a half inch to an inch in length increase and a moderate increase in girth.  However other positive effects were also reported such as increased vigor with regards to erections, stuff like that.  I would be interested in seeing what a university study finds out about this stuff.  My feeling is that if it really worked, like Viagra, it would be far too expensive for most people to buy.\n\n",

    "content": "I believe your gut feeling here is correct.  If a large study had proven effectiveness of this product, not only might it be expensive, it would be in all the newspapers, not just promoted by the manufacturer.    Most actual results of these products are very modest length increase, mostly in the flaccid state.  The more important factor here is performance and size has little to do with sexual satisfaction for either the man or the woman.  Try not to dwell on this or compare but work on other areas that will increase your abilities and contentment as a lover.  Also, don't get your information from the media of what is desirable by your partner.  Most of this is artificial.  Communicate and develop a close relationship.  This will do more to ensure a good sexual relationship.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, This is called pre-ejaculate fluid and it is perfectly normal, especially in the situation you describe. It is almost reflexive so it's not likely you can control it and prevent it from happening. It can contain sperm so pregnancy is possible if there is penetration of the penis in the vagina, but not through clothes.  It is not as likely to result in pregnancy as with regular ejaculate fluid, but care should be taken because of the slight possibility if you have intercourse.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Emergency contraception is a powerful dose of hormones and so can affect the period cycles for a few months even.  It doesn't necessarily do this but it is normal if it happens too.  At any rate, after manipulating hormones this way, one cannot expect periods to just resume in the usual fashion.  A period of irregular menses is certainly within the normal range for most women and is not harmful in any way.   This disruption of a woman's cycle is one reason EC is not recommended as a regular from of birth control.  Women like the reassurance that a period gives that they are not pregnant.  The term emergency contraception says exactly how it should be used.      Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Most people agree that masturbation itself is not usually physically harmful.  There are cases when tissue damage occurs due to overagressive techniques and efforts.  But, on the pyschological end, there are varying opinions and each person may respond differently.  It has been documented to be damaging to marriage if it interferes with intimacy with your wife.  Some men find they can only ejaculate through self-pleasuring or they may require porn in order to perform and this is often detrimental to the marriage - partly because it is so fake!  It is not real, but it sets men's minds to expecting that as real.  This can put a definite damper on normal sexual relations in marriage.  I know of no prostate problems or hormonal changes that have been related to masturbation. The clear fluid you describe on arousal is perfectly normal and varies throughout your life and experiences.  It doesn't matter that you didn't have this before.  It does not signify a problem.    The reason you get conflicting reports on the internet is because each individual has differing responses to this activity.  It has huge psychological implications for some people and this can definitely affect sex drive and performance.  Another negative that can occur is the amount of time used for this activity. If it keeps you from being productive in other ways in your life and is somehow interfering with your daily routine and needs such as work and relationships, it would be worth weaning yourself.  If porn is used, you have nothing to lose by stopping that and much to gain.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Well, its all in the subject name really, I was just curious because I am 17, nearly 18 and I was with my girlfriend watching a film and Viagra was used for a prank but it got us thinking. Sildenafil citrate is for men with problems with erectile dysfunction but I was wondering what would happen if I took it, I'm a sporty young man that doesn't smoke and I just wanted to know if anything bad could happen if I take it. I haven't got an erectile problem or sexual stimulus problem, we simply are curious to see if it has the desired effect of longer sex because I could stay harder for longer, even after I ejaculate! I just feel like I let her down when I ejaculate before she orgasms, which is a real psychological thorn in my brain! Please could somebody help! Many thanks, Chillo\n\n",

There is also no requirement for testing to show that what they say is in the supplement actually is.  Add to this that many aphrodisiacs don't actually function the way the claim.

    "content": "There is one that did work, I know, I used it.  I discovered it while training for the Navy SEALS.  It was sold in health food stores at the time and it was suggested for increasing circulation.  My feeling is this supplement was the victim of greed.  The name is Yohimbe.  I am sure there are lists of supposed negative side effects but I know a great number of men who used it and not one of them had a single side effect from it.  My feeling is that the reason it was banned is Viagra.  Ah yes, that highly overpriced drug.  The cost is high because who wouldn't pay to be able to have sex again.  Yophimbe was used for many years by myself and others and has been used for eons by the natives who discovered its aphrodisiac qualities when the chewed on the bark of the Yohimbe trees.  It did work giving a boost in sexual energy and increased the vibrancy of your erections.  In short it made you sexually excited and able to perform with a lot of vigor.  I have used Viagra and the effects are identical.  It doesn't make you get a spontaneous erection, it just made you respond much more positively to sexual stimuli.  However, a few years after Viagra came out, Yohimbe was suddenly pulled from the market.  While it was not cheap, it was far less expensive than Viagra is.  Viagra is nothing more than price gouging those who need it such that the majority of insurance companies will not cover them.  It's the only thing I have ever gotten a prescription for that Tricare would not cover.\n\n",

Basically, they're like small paper cuts that are reopened everytime you pull your foreskin back and cause the skin to tighten up.    Occasionally, the irritation can be due to excess moisture or even some contact irritation from a new soap, etc.  These tend to heal if the  inciting irritation is relieved.  Also, using a moisturizer may help some.  If this does not begin to improve I would recommend you see your doctor.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "This is probably the most common sexual problem in men your age, affecting possibly one in three men and yes, it does get better in time, typically.  There are treatments consisting of a combination of medication and counseling.  Causes are unknown but may have a psychological basis, especially if you have been rushed in the past to avoid being discovered.  Anxiety can also contribute to the problem - even anxiety over this particular problem.    Drugs and hormones can also aggravate this condition.  Our own bodies produce neurotransmitters which sometimes don't work as they are supposed to.  There may be techniques that a sex therapist could help with.  One thing you can do yourself is try having sex twice.  With one time that becomes a \"quickie\" you can sometimes wait an hour or so for a second that takes longer for climax.  Some men masturbate first for the same reason.  Talk with your partner about this to be sure you are both OK with what you decide because there is more to physical intimacy than the bit \"O.\"   Topical anesthetic creams applied to the penis can sometimes delay the response as well.  These are wiped off prior to intercourse but sometimes delay the response.  Not without side effects, it is something you could experiment with.  Antidepressants are also known to cause sexual difficulty of the opposite extreme so these care sometimes prescribed for that side effect in cases of premature ejaculation.  When drugs are used for their side effects, rather than their intended purpose it is called using them \"off label\" and sometimes insurance covers; sometimes not.      There are other techniques a sexual therapist could suggest and a mental health counselor can talk through relationship issues that sometimes play a role in the function.    Keep in mind that male and female sexual function differs greatly and care must be used to learn to satisfy each partner.  Orgasm does not necessarily result from penile penetration for the woman but she may appreciate clitoral stimulation in addition to intercourse.  Don't be disillusioned by the fantasy of mutual orgasm - it is very rare.    Eve if it feels a bit awkward, these are concerns you could discuss with your doctor.  But, you can also benefit from talking with your partner.  Avoid blaming but try to understand each others' needs and find ways to meet them that are pleasing to you both.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "It's hard to describe specifically where this bump was found. Pimple sized, roughly. As you feel the penis where it connects to the pubis, and follow its structure beneath the skin until it slopes down with the pelvice, that's around where it is, looking at it, I'd estimate it to be maybe half an inch below where you'd see my penis.  The bump does not appear on the testicals. It is not visible. And does not cause any notable pain or discomfort.  There's only 1 bump, on the left side, it feels as if it may be slightly firmer than the tissue around it, however it's difficult to determine as the tissue around it seems to move as I touch it, or the lump itself is something bendable.  I don't urinate or ejaculate blood, however ejaculate has been notably thick and globy at a reasonably consistant rate.  Mild testicular discomfort in the left side has been noted on rare occasion (ie. during a shower when being handled and hit by water) although never great enough to cause discomfort, and mild aches have been noticed in the left side of the pelvice on 'off' days. While rare, when it does occur, the pain worsens by things such as walking which might press up or irritate something in there, I've accounted it to muscle pain.  My body is functioning normally in all respects that I'm aware of, and it was only by chance that I found this. It's painless to handle, and mild pressure only causes a very minor, if any irritation to it which doesn't seem to radiate significantly.  Is it normal to have the odd lump within your internal body like that? Is this just a piece of my anatomy I'm proding at here, or should I begin seeking the help of a family doctor?  I take no medications. I have no history of genital related medical problems, and I can assure you that I'm clean of STD's (or STI's). Thank you for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Yuka,  What you are feeling may be a lymph node.  There are several lymph nodes in the area you are describing.  It may have become enlarged due to an infection at some point and simply remained slightly enlarged.  When lymph nodes don't shrink back down to unnoticeable sizes, they still work properly, are generally painless and are generally mobile (i.e. you can move them around some).  I would suggest you have your doctor take a look at this the next time you are in.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Rzkhan87,  I doubt that this darkening is related to masturbation.  There are a few possible things that can cause hyperpigmentation (darkening) of the scrotum/penis.  If there was something causing inflammation, such as a contact dermatitis or irritation from excess moisture, darkening can follow inflammation.    Another possibility would be a fungal infection causing darkening.  There are a few other more severe issues that I would expect to be less likely at your age.  I would recommend you have your doctor evaluate this to find out for sure what is going on.  There may be a treatment needed to help the color return to normal.  Best wishes.\n\n",

You might consider a reputable sex therapist, but he should also have an evaluation by a medical doctor to rule out any physical causes.  There may be some lack of testosterone that might be treated with medication.  It is possible there are some self-punishing issues going on but the therapist can be helpful here too.    The best way you can support him is to assure him of your love and concern, show respect and appreciation to him and be patient.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm an 18 year old male, i am physically active, i masturbate 5-7 times a week, and have a healthy social life including a girlfriend of about 10 months. I am my girlfriends first boyfriend, she is not my first girlfriend, so the physical relationship is extremely limited-- i have fingered her 3 times, she has tried to give me a hand job once (i will get to that later). I'm very attracted to her as she is to me, she is just very shy about physically progressing, but now that we are starting to speed up i have a concern.  For some reason when we just make out (open mouth kiss), whether only for a minute, i get an erection. It is not always rock hard but pretty substantial most of the time. I have tried to mentally block this but the best i can do usually is keep it down a little bit and only for a while. Usually when we hang out we play games and sometimes just looking at her (as i am very attracted) i can slightly get a boner but that is no big deal. However we usually find time right before she has to go home to make out for a while, and then i get up and walk her out. When we make out though,  even if i'm not thinking about sex or feeling her or her even rubbing up against my penis, i get an erection which i cant mentally subdue until we are done kissing, and when she leaves i check my pants and there are always semen spots, sometimes leaking all the way through jeans. This happens without exception if we make out for 5-10 minutes straight or more, and is highly embarassing. I get no feeling of orgasm, and cant feel it coming out at the time. The one time she tried to give me a hand job i had already came a little bit from making out, and i was hard enough for her to work with but not as hard as possible, and she treid for 35 minutes and i didnt reach climax, and barely felt close (though this was her first try, she sucked at it, maybe if she was better it would've worked but idk for sure).  This is horrifying to me because if i cum (with no orgasm) after just making out for 10 minutes, how am i ever supposed to cum when she is helping me? I think that i still have enough erectile strength to have intercourse, but I have a feeling i would not be able to climax, and I know if she only uses her hand and this problem persists, i wont be able to at all. This is embarassing, and i basically would liek to know what may have caused this and how i could control it.  If it is of any consequence, my first gf played alot of mind games with me and kind of gave me trust issues (i trust girls until we get extremely intimate and then i always have suspicions for sometimes the stupidest reasons). I don't remember having this problem with her or a few other girls, but the girl i was involved with immediately before my gf i remember getting large erections from making out but can't remember if it resulted in the same sort of ejaculation.\n\n",

    "content": "Everything you have described sounds perfectly normal.  Experienced as you are in masturbation, you know how to stimulate yourself.  It will take time, patience and a good relationship to achieve what you seek in a satisfying sex life with her.  Most couples require time to get this going.  The closeness you feel is the most important thing and the rest will likely come naturally.  I certainly would not be distressed over this now or make it into something big.  Leaking with stimulation (mental or physical) is also very normal at your age.  Of course this is why the withdrawal method of birth control is not reliable.  Your trust issues will also likely improve as you grow closer.  And if you don't, then it will likely improve with another relationship.    Best wishes.\n\n",

I would recommend you see a urologist for further evaluation.  I am not aware of any over-the-counter medicines for sexual dysfunction.  The urologist will be able to help you find an appropriate treatment for you.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I am quite certain its not any kind of disease, just over stimulation.   The skin part is healing fine but the tip is having trouble. I am trying to figure out how to dress it so that it doesn't rub up on things and get worse. I can't use gauss because as soon as it starts healing it heals into the gauss and taking it off is one of the most painful experiences I have had, and would prefer never to go through with ever again. I am not sure what the best way to go about this is. Its really sensitive and feels like its bruised pretty badly.   Should I just leave it open and wait for it to heal? Maybe use some ointment (neosporin)?  Thanks for your help.\n\n",

The come in the same types of pads as gauze pads (2X2, 4X4, etc.).  These won't stick to the wound as it heals and allows it to continue to heal when changing the dressing rather than tearing off the area that has healed.  Generally, ointments such as neosporin are not needed.  Sometimes these can actually cause a contact irritation so I generally recommend against them for most cases.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  A flaccid penis is normally at least 1.6 inches long, or 2.7 inches when stretched.[1]  If the penis does measure less than 4 cm, especially if other findings are present, further evaluation may be indicated.  Micropenis is best recognized and evaluated in the immediate newborn period.  Micropenis can occur as an isolated idiopathic anomaly or in association with other anomalies.  Most cases of micropenis are due to fetal testosterone deficiency as in Klinefelter syndrome, defects in testosterone steroidogenesis and luteinizing hormone receptor defects. Defective androgen receptors as well as growth hormone deficiency can also manifest as micropenis.  Other causes include conditions associated with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism such as Kallmann syndrome, Laurence-Moon-Biedl syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, Rud syndrome and Septo-optic dysplasia.  You need to be evaluated. Your evaluation may include hormone level assays as well as genetic testing.  References ======= 1. Shamloul, R. Urology, June 2005; vol 65: pp 1183-1185.\n\n",

Current Medications - None, but at the time I was on Cymbalta 40mg/day and Limictal 200mg/day  Hello, my name is D.J. I'm a 21 year old male. I was recently taking the medican Trazodone as a sleep aid. I was told to take 50mg the first night 100mg the next night if 50 didn't work and 150mg the next day if it didn't help. I did that like the doctor told me to. I found that 150mg was working great. Less than a week into the treatment, I awoke with a erection I didn't think anything of it because I just woke up. After about an hour I relized that when I stood up or was walking around it was very painful. I called my mother and ask what I should do and she said to go to the ER. While I was in the ER they ask how long I had it for, well I'm still unsure how long I had it, I fell asleep with an erection at 1 AM was told by my ex that when she left for school I had one and I didn't wake up untill 11 AM. I went to the ER at 3:30 PM 4 hours after I had the erection that I knew about for sure. This all happend back in October around the 22nd or 23rd. I don't have erections like I used to on average it used to be 3 to 4 times a day and now when or if i get one it's not as hard or long lasting . I sometimes wake up to an errection but not every day (right after I am fully awake it subsides). I have also tried masterbaiting since then, the first time it took a very long time to get an erection and even longer to ejaculate, after I had finished I noticed my erection had not subsided, It stayed fully erect for almost 20 min and after slowy subsided after 20 more min. The 2nd time was the same way, but it didn't take as long to subside only 20 min this time. Since then I have stoped taking all medication because of the fear of side effects. On top of that the family doctor didn't want to give me viagra or anything like it because he thinks that I may be sensitive to them. Also, I smoke Cannabis and cigarettes daily and have for the past 4 to 5 years and have never had any problems like this.  The questions I have are:  1. When I get an apointment with a urologist what kind of test can I expect to be given. (I have a very bad anixity problem)  2. If I am sensitive to Viagra and pills like it, is there anything else I could try?  3. Is the slow draining of the blood from the penis somthing to be worried about?  4. Could the erection I had at 1 AM really lasted untill I went to the ER?   Thanks D.J.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi D.J.,  Priapism (prolonged erection) is a known side effect of trazodone.  It may be that you had the initial problem because of the trazodone.    The concern with priapisms is that the spongy tissue in the penis that engorges with blood to create the erect can become damaged if pressure is maintained for too long.  This can lead to difficulty with erections, etc.  Seeing the urologist is a good idea.  I am not familiar with the types of tests that will be needed to help determine what the cause of your symptoms are.  I would recommend that you avoid using viagra or other medication until being evaluated by the urologist.  These medications may not help or may be contraindicated depending on the cause of your difficulties.  The urologist will be able to go over everything and recommend any treatments if needed.  It may be that your symptoms will resolve over time without treatment.  Unfortunately, it is not really possible to determine how long your initial erection lasted.  Erections lasting more than four hours are concerning for the possibility of penile damage so seeing a urologist is important.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "This can be one of the signs of depression since you are also showing lack of interest and energy in other aspects of your life so an evaluation would be in order.  You should see your doctor or mental health clinic about this.  As far as your libido goes, independent of the other concerns, this can be very normal.  As human beings we tend to ebb and flow with this.  It's a good thing because if the desire never waned we would never get anything else done (smile).  The kind of intimate relationship you have with one special person can also make a huge difference in your desire and drive.  It is often said that most of your sex drive or problems is in your head (emotional issues).   Don't worry excessively but do pay attention to the signs that something is not quite right emotionally so you can get treatment.  There are many good medications that can help once you get a proper diagnosis.  Good luck\n\n",

I think I would know if I were depressed because I've been depressed before. The things that got me feel emotions then just doesn't quite do it anymore. Small things like I want to look good for someone today or listening to music. It's like I've taken Prozac but I haven't been taking any medication at all.\n\n",

    "content": "Hey, I am currently taking Phentermine for weight loss under doctor supervision. I'm on my fifth day. Since I've taken it my penis has become smaller when flaccid, my strotum is shiveled and raised up (as if I were cold), and my penis is so far it sometimes that the foreskin covers it (I am circumsized).  Also my sexual drive seems to have lessened, to get an erection it takes quite a bit of time compared to before.  I've taken Phentermine almost two years ago with the same doctor and experienced a little loss in sex drive but I was also on pain medication for a herniated disc.  However I don't recall my penis being as small and as in under the foreskin as now.  Is it the Phentermine that is causing this? Also is it harmful and show I discontinue use? The Phentermine is working for my diet and I can live with the loss of sex drive since it is temporary but if I continue the use of the drug will I experience permanent sex drive loss and a smaller penis?\n\n",

Yes, phentermine has been associated with sexual side effects but they should be transient so it is worth it to put up with it while losing weight.  That will improve your health significantly.  No permanent effects would be associated with this if it is the cause of your troubles.    Good luck on your efforts to lose weight.  It is a hard thing to do but can add a great deal of quality to your life.\n\n",

I also do not produce very much semen plus whenever I cum it comes out yellow, I also have some pimples not on the penis but where the pubic hair is (it doesn\u2019t hurt btw) I had a pimple right on the penis once about a year ago, it was bigger than the others it also hurts a little bit, another problem I have is that whenever I'm about to ejaculate my testicles goes inside my body\u2026is that normal? I've had oral sex a few times back when I was 16 with only one person and she was a virgin and so am I,  I started masturbating when I was 13 and I've been doing it on a daily basis  but I stopped both masturbating and having oral sex at 17 because of these problems, I thought if I stopped for long enough maybe it will get better, it's been a year now and I decided to do it again, but nothings changed, I never had a real relationship with someone because of this, it's affecting my confidence and self esteem, please help me, I don't know what to do, I'm really scared.  I also forgot to mention that I have burning feeling on the head of the penis after ejaculation (it's only for a minute or two)\n\n",

He talks ALL the time about not gaining weight, not wanting to be fat, how he's so fat (he's 6'1 and 140lbs), he refuses to eat and when he does eat, everything comes back up within 1 to 2 hours.  I have never heard of this before, food coming up without him forcing it up, but his doctor says he is so mentally programmed to not want food, that it rejects anything he puts in his mouth.  He gave him something that is supposed to increase his appetite and help him hold food down.  I'm not sure what it's called.    All that being said, if the vomiting continues what else could it be?  Is your opinion the same as his doctors or what?  He has had many health problems this year, including an episode of extreme pain in his eyes, to the point of almost going blinde.  He could only see blue & everything else was 'bright white' as he said.  I have read that this could be a sign of MS, as could the vomiting.  He did go to the ER but I was out of town at the time, & he would never tell me what they said.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Scerab,  There are a few things you may want to talk with your doctor about.  If you are not interested in having children it may not be necessary to correct your varicoceles.  If you decide to have the surgery it is generally done laparoscopically (with a camera and small incisions rather than one large incision).  The procedure is very similar to having a hernia repaired.  It will probably take you several days to get back up and going but recovery times from laparoscopically done surgeries are much shorter than the open type surgeries.    It isn't a particularly complicated procedure; however, it is a surgery so the risks of anesthesia, etc. still apply.  Your doctor can give you all the risks/benefits regarding this so you can make an informed decision.  Best wishes.\n\n",

As for my chief complaint I suffer from a small penis its less then 3.5 inches fully erect. The girth is also below normal. I also have two testicles different in size.  As for my past history: I have done two surgeries in my life, one was tonsillectomy when I was 12, the other was pilonidal abscess and I had it removed.   My medical history; I have umbilical abscess but didn\u2019t want to go through with the operation I do use ointment for it how ever . No history of asthma, DM or HTN.  As for my family history there are many diseases such as DM, HTN, breast cancer lymphoma and ischemic heart disease.   Currently I don\u2019t take any medications, only vitamins and minerals. I have been taking Prozac for a year in 2006.     As for my problem I have a smaller then normal penis I have done a few blood tests including testosterone and the hormone was at the lowest end of the normal range.  I would appreciate any advice on the matter: Should I try hormonal replacement therapy? And if it didn\u2019t work  Should I consider penile augmentation surgery?  What are the chances of success for the penile transplantation surgery?  Thanks in advance\n\n",

For people that have testosterone deficiency and do not enter puberty properly, testosterone replacement can cause growth of the penis.  In your case, you may not be deficient enough for supplementation to be of any help.  Regarding penile augmentation you may need to talk with a urologist or plastic surgeon about this.  I am not familiar enough with the process to give you any information about it.  To my knowledge, penile transplantation is not currently available.

WHEN I PULL THE SKIN BACK AND MASTURBATE.....THE SKIN DOES NOT MOVE SO I LITERALLY HAVE  NO COMFORT AND  NO FEELING  AND I CANNOT MASTURBATE. THIS PROBLEM IS BECAUSE THE LITTLE SKIN THAT CONNECTS THE FORESKIN AND THE TIP OF THE PENIS IS REALLY VERY THICK AND TIGHT AND DOES NOT ALLOW ANY MOVEMENT OF THE FORESKIN. SO BECAUSE OF THIS THE PENIS DOES NOT ERRECT COMPLETELY....I CAN FEEL IT ... I CAN FEEL THAT THE SKIN JOINT IS  STOPPING THE FULL ERRECTION. 3. WHEN I TRY TO HAVE SEX .. I PULL THE  FORESKIN  BACK TILL THE END OF THE GLANS PENIS  WHERE IT GETS FIXED AND DOES NOT MOVE AT ALL AND THEN I WEAR THE CONDOM .  WHEN I  PENETRATE INTO THE VAGINA OF MY GIRL I DONOT FEEL THE EXCITEMENT BECAUSE THE SKIN IS NOT MOVING AT ALL.. I JUST MOVE IN AND OUT  OF THE VAGINA FOR ALMOST ONE HOUR  BUT STILL I AM NOT EXCITED BECAUSE THE SKIN DOES NOT MOVE.  SO I TRIED OUT VIAGRA ......  DUE TO THIS I JUST COULD HOLD THE ERRECTION FOR ABOUT ONE HOUR BUT THERE WAS NO EXCITEMENT AND I COULD NOT DO ANY THING WITH SUCH AN ERRECTION. AND  NORMALLY WHILE I MASTURBATE  BECAUSE  MY PENIS DOES NOT ERRECT FULLY DUE TO THE  SKIN .....THE ERRECTION DOES NOT LAST LONG.....AFTER 4 - 5 MINUTES I EJACULATE  ALMOST  ON A FLACID PENIS.

WHAT SHOULD I DO ABOUT  THE LITTLE SKIN THAT JOINS THE FORE SKIN TO THE  TIP OF THE PENIS....SHOULD I CONSULT A DOCOR FOR SURGERY  OR CAN I CUT IT OFF MY SELF  OR CAN I DO SOME STRETCHING  FOR IT  TO BECOME MORE ELASTIC........I THINK THIS IS THE  REAL PROBLEM.....?????????  3 .

    "content": "Hi James,  I have quoted your most recent question here to keep this topic all in one thread.  It helps keep the forum tidy and allows our readers an easier time following the progression if they are needing the same information. hi guys I am james . I am the one who posted the topis \" can a normal man live normally with such problems\". please first read that topicand then come to this one. well my micro penis is no big problem.....because when it errects it is good enough for me to go into the vagina of my girl. the problem arises during errection......the skin that attatches the fore skin to the glans penis is not at all elastic and is very rigid and small. so during errection the foreskin comes down till the base of the glans and gets fixed in the groove there and there no more movement for teh skin becoz the small skin that connects the penis and the fore skin stops it from moving and it also prevent my penis from errecting completely. I can feel it. so please advice me. there is no problem with the fore skin...the problem is with the little skin connecting the fore skin to the penis. so while intercourse I am not getting excited becoz the foreskin does not move at alla nd there is no sensation for me so I cannot hav a orgasm or come .  please help me out I need detailed advice and help thank you one and alll for further information please contact me ... I want all the help I cann get I am really frustrated... so I will be waiting for your replies.  So, regarding your question, I agree with Debbie.  You likely need to see a urologist for this.  The area of skin you are referring to that is tight is called the frenulum of the penis.  In severe cases it can be clipped to allow a normal erection.  A urologist will be best able to evaluate and recommend any needed treatment to help solve your issue.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello.Im 23 years old and im male. Recently after a vigorous session of masturbation (6-7) in 2 days, i decided to stop. While i was sitting down i felt my right testicle twitch and feelings of slight sharpness. This i can feel only at the top of my right testicle and makes the whole testicle feel sore. The chord that attaches my testicle to the above part of the body feels like someone is pulling it. I have a little lump at the top and checked it with the doctor who said its nothing but a part of your testicle. It isnt swollen no burning sensation no other lumps no bleeding nothing wrong with my urine, well basically nothing else apart from that slight pain. I can run skip hop and jump and doesnt conflict. The pain does come and go. Pls can you help me with any information. Thanx.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi World2k,  There are a few possibilities for this pain.  It may be that you have some mild inflammation of the epididymus (the collection of tubes on the top of the testis that acts as a collecting duct for the sperm).  The epididymus is probably the lump you are feeling on the top of the testis.    Your pain may also be from a hernia that comes and goes.  Another possibility would be that you had some trauma to the area.  If your pain is not improving I would recommend that you see your doctor and possibly see a urologist for further examination.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Before I begin, I should just say that it's not possible for it to be related to any sort of STD as I'm a virgin, and the only sexual activity taken place was between me and my long term girlfriend (who also has no sexual history). (ie. We've engaged in handjobs, mutual masturbation, etc.)  I am a 21 year old male. A few months ago, my girlfriend and I been feeling a little more silly than normal, and ended up getting off 3 times consecutively. (masturbation) The third time I felt a pain and since have had the following problem :  I randomly feel a sharp pain from the head to the base of my penis, and also often have a constant dull pain in the head as well. This normally occurs more often after ejaculating.  We figured at first that we'd overdone it, and so I abstained from getting off for about two weeks, but it didn't help. It's since been months, as I said above, and it hasn't gone away.   Any ideas what this could be, or how to fix the problem? Thank you in advance!\n\n",

This might be especially true if you use pornography for stimulation and excitement.  This false sense of sexuality can sometimes leave you feeling like something is missing in a real woman.  This may not be conscious, but it could be having an effect.    I think you are wise to discontinue the masturbation in an effort to get into a more normal sexual arousal and gratification cycle.  If this does the trick I think you have your answer.  If not, I would talk to a doctor.  You may be a candidate for Viagra, Cialis or Levitra.    Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Masturbation can certainly become addictive and often require increasingly intense visual or other stimulation. This can have a definite negative effect on relationships.  Pornography, often used in conjunction with masturbation, is also very addictive but even more harmful in a committed relationship such as marriage.  This is because it is not real but gives the illusion of real, creating false expectations in a real relationship.  It is extremely addictive, very difficult to quit, and serves no useful purpose.  It can also take an inordinate amount of time from the real relationship.  Physically, there could be trauma if instruments are used or risky behavior employed as a way to stimulate oneself.   Other side effects of the addiction would include creating a \"need\" for daily (or even more frequent) orgasms with frustration if that need isn't met.  This can also adversely affect a relationship where sex is then expected or demanded in order to keep the pace going.  Sexual relations are best when both parties are in agreement about the amount and quality of the encounter.  Excessive masturbation can cause a feeling of coercion or can even make the partner feel \"left out\" or unneeded.  You may find your sex life is much better without masturbation, including your ability to be aroused.  But, as for actual physical harm, I am not aware of any studies showing this, though chafing or other irritation could occur.  But, don't be misled thinking if there is nothing physically damaging, there will be no damage.  Psychological problems cause a myriad of ills and can even make you physically sick.    Irritability is frequently cited by regular participants who try to stop or even who miss a day.  This can also lead to relationship difficulties.  Some men have reported difficulty maintaining an erection with their partners after becoming accustomed to masturbation as a means to sexual satisfaction.  Like most things, moderation is best and the \"need\" to do it is created psychologically and through habit.   A person who has guilt feelings about this will probably also experience negative effects.  So, weighing the risks and benefits would be wise.\n\n",

    "content": "Low sperm count is not related to sex drive.  People can be sterile and still have a strong drive and vice versa.  You can be very fertile and have no sex drive.  It is a very individual thing for each person.    Having sex is a very complex thing and the relationship itself has a lot of bearing on it, including fear of pregnancy, disease, performance anxiety, etc.    I would not worry about it too much and try doing other things to enhance your relationship.  I hope you do not feel pressured to have sex in order to have a meaningful relationship.  There is a good chance that the sex drive will evolve naturally over time.  If not you could see a doctor to see if you could benefit from some treatment but it seems very early to be overly concerned about this.    Good luck\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 30 yr old male. After I masturbate my body smells very strongly of fishy semen & I can't get rid of the smell by washing. It smells even worse the day after. The smell also is strong in the room I wank in. I sometimes use lube, sometimes my own spit, or no lube at all. Varying degrees of friction make no difference. I'm vegetarian, exercise regularly and drink lots of water. I've had this problem for at least 12 years. I'm a very fussy clean person, so it's not a lack of washing, I shower once daily. 2 or even 3 showers will not help the smell go away. I've tried soap/no soap & antibacterial soap. I'm in a relationship & the stange thing is that when I have sex (as opposed to masturbating) the smell is not strong or unpleasant at all. I've been tested for STDs and diabetes & got the all clear. I don't know why it smells bad after wanking and not after sex. Could it be bacteria on my hands? I took a lot of antibiotics for acne in my teens. Any ideas?? Thanks.\n\n",

My problem is as follows: After long periods of arousal (approx. 4 hours of fairly constant stimulation) I feel a pain coming from my scrotum, and though the pain spreads throughout the sack and into the abdomen I believe it to be centered above the right testicle. I can feel an unusual swelling in the tubes and also slightly see slight bumps through the skin above the testicle - I believed that this was a varicocele (though it was located above the right testicle). I went in to the doctor and was informed that nothing felt odd and that occasional testicle pain is considered normal. I'm still very concerned because it hurts and just feels so strange. The tubes are free-floating rather then attached to the back of the testicle so I don't believe it to be epedidimitis - What could it be? What can I do?\n\n",

If you are noticing this \"tube\" feeling more when standing or when bearing down than you do when you are lying flat  this would be very consistent with a varicocele.  You may want to see a urologist for further evaluation of this.  Best wishes.\n\n",

In July he and I spent a week apart. After which we went on a trip away together. We had pretty passionate sex and the next day he noticed a cut on his penis just underneath his foreskin. We had to abstain and after about a week it healed.   It has reoccurred since then. It just appears and it's like sex reopens the wound. Then it is sore when he pulls back his foreskin and he can't have sex.  The only thing that makes it go away is abstinence. We use condoms as our contraception.  What could this possibly be? Could it be herpes? He says he has looked on the net and it appears to be a cut frenulum. He won't go to the doctor despite my nagging :).\n\n",

The mark looked to me like a little papercut, it looks like a pinkie fingernail could have caused it. I noticed this around the same time that I received vigorous oral sex. I applied polysporin to it at night, and upon waking noticed it had healed quite well. I applied polysporin again, and the next time I checked it was just barely a little red mark, very unnoticable. Just a half hour ago I recieved oral sex again, and It looks although it has reopened, and has the same appearance as when I first got it. I have no other symptoms whatsoever, the glands in my groin are fine, and there is no burning when I urinate. I have been tested for every STD possible, except for herpes. That is my concern. Would herpes show up as a little papercut, and respond to polysporin very well, and be acting like this mark ? I'm getting paranoid, as its in my nature.\n\n",

As many youths have encountered, i too am one of those boys who engaged in masturbation as early as around 8 or so...where i used to use magazines and used it for lust, and actually havig to do weird hings with the magazines....and yes im embarrased and guilty of it all, and feel ashamed at such a thing i have done...  But anyway..coming to the point, from the age of 15-16, i have had many weird feelings, including being very tired...fatigue, for no reason, my heart would beat so fast for no reason, even for little things, and i would usually get cramps...I have experienced weird situations as a teenager, such as blushing very often, and being nervous everytime i was about to perform something. I would literally cry inside, thinking that i have to prepare myself for the next roleplay or so...  During the ages of 16-19, i have felt very weird...my legs would feel wobbly whenever i walk..i cant walk straight..and sometimes i feel as if i cant even feel my legs...and i would wobble abit, feeling as if one leg is taller then the other leg. I have had some inside feelings of emptiness...and that led me to be depressed...confused...for every little thing was a big challenge for me...having to make decisions from little things was so hard for me..such as gelling my hair or not, taking cool shower orr continue with warm shower...i have recently become confused and some anxiety had crept inside of me...making me shiver..shake..and feel so sick..that i cant describe how evil this experience is...  All this i think is due to over masturbation...and now i feel as if im facing the consequences...coould you please suggest what i should do?\n\n",

If you have not had a complete physical exam lately, that would be a good place to start to rule out any underlying medical problem.  But, if everything physical checks out OK the mental health evaluation might reveal some clues.    Be totally honest with your doctors in order to get the best care.  Good luck\n\n",

We have both been tested for STD's and both have nothing.  But whenever we have sex, every time without a doubt,  my foreskin seems to get swollen and go red. It doesn't hurt, but after its been swollen for a day or three, it starts to get itchy. I think i have a really sensitive foreskin. Just wondering what i can do. It affects me because i can only have sex once a week or so because its swollen for days or a week after. Please help  Are there operations for men my age or whatever to have their foreskin removed? or is that mainly in children(at birth)?  Any help would be appreciated Brett\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Brett,  Trauma from intercourse may be causing your symptoms.  Also, if your foreskin is tight causing it to be stretched when retracted it could cause pain and swelling.  An infection with yeast could cause these symptoms but it would be very unusual to develop so quickly.  I doubt an infection is related to the issue.  An allergy is possible; however, I would not expect this to be localized solely to the foreskin.  I would recommend you see a urologist for an evaluation.  Circumcision can be done for adults, although it is much more commonly done on infants.  Having persistent problems such as you are describing may be an indication for adult circumcision.  The urologist will be able to discuss treatment options and circumcision with you in detail so you can make an informed decision.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Mcdan,  Premature ejaculation is defined as ejaculation before the person desires to.  It's a bit of a vague definition.  Ejaculation within 15-20 seconds is very likely to qualify.    There are some treatments that can help.  Some medications (in particular beta-blockers) can take advantage of their side effect of delaying ejaculation to treat this problem.  There are some physical therapies that can help.  The most commonly used method is to squeeze the penis just under the head when the feeling of ejaculation begins to appear.  This area should be squeezed tightly.  This generally will cause the sensation to subside.  This can be done 3-4 times before allowing ejaculation.  Repeated use of this technique has been shown to improve ability to delay ejaculation.  This technique often can take several months to really see dramatic effects but has been shown to be effective.  Regarding your question about satisfying your partner, this is a person dependent issue and I cannot comment.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Although I have never recalled a 6+ hour long erection, i did experience some pain and prolonged semi-erection. Since then, drugs that have worked - CIALIS - are no longer working and I have slight dull pain in my penis.  I've had Doppler Ultrasound done, which came back normal. It's quite frustrating because doctors seem to tell me its all mental, but I don't think it is.   I would like you to know what sorts of tests can CONCLUSIVELY rule out physical damage, i.e. microscopic tissue damage.   What are the tests available and can they conclusively/definatively rule out damage? If not, to what extent can they rule it out?  Cheers,   Rich\n\n",

    "title": "Erectile Dysfunction/soft glans - after use of rec drugs",
    "content": "I come to you as someone who is in desperate need of some advice. I am having erectile difficulties that have been caused by psycogenic and I now suspect physical factors. I have seen several urologists who have told me they can not tell me the reason for my problems. I had a doppler ultrasound under prostglandin e1 that came back normal.   The key symptoms are that i am experiencing slight firmness in the shaft whilst flaccid - it is comparable to 'hard rubber', and feels turgid or a little tough (but not fibrous); that the glans of my penis is quite soft (Even a little `mushy`) during erections; i lose my erection without direct manual stimulation; and will lose an erection almost instantaneosly when standing up. These symptoms occured from about a month ago, when I masturbated quite forcefully under the influence of ecstasy and marijuana. Since then, I noticed immediately the firmness in the flaccid shaft. I don't think I had a priapism because i've never had a rock hard, painful erection for > 4 hours. Although, on that day, and since I sometimes experience semi-erections that last a couple of hours.   I am hoping you can help make a diagnosis as I have read hundreds of forum and articles and when it comes to these questions, experts usually say they can`t answer.   In fact my symptoms are near identical to a forum member of another forum/ The expert could not respond. I am hoping you can and have listed his case directly below:  Starting about 3 years ago, my erections became less firm. This phenomenon occured during a 1-yearish episode of depression, which I immediately linked to this symptom. It is now 3 years later, however, and I am not depressed at all anymore and I have not been for about 2.5 years. The problem has continued and even gotten worse. I do not often experience morning erections. They do occur occasionally, but quite infrequently. Whereas I used to get spontaneous erections and be able to achieve erection just by visual stimuli, this is no longer the case. I almost always need direct stimulation for a chance to achieve erection. When I masturbate, I almost always achieve erection and maintain it with continued stimulation. However, the glans often does not become hard although the shaft is. If I discontinue stimulation, the erection disappears quite quickly. Often, if I stand up, even with continued stimulation, the erection disappears. During intercourse, there are rare times when I can maintain an erection for a longer period of time (15-30 minutes). But as said, these times are rare. Sometimes (about 1 time out of every 5 sessions) I lose my erection during intercourse. Sometimes I am able to get it back. I am not experiencing performance anxiety and I have spoken with my partner about the problem. I do not think that any (conscious) psychological difficulty is affecting this. The soft glans during erection as well as the quick drainage after the cessation of stimulation (and standing up) leads me to suspect the problem might be related to venous leakage. However, does this theory clash with the occasional secure erection? What do you think the likely cause of this is? I have done all the reading on drugs, etc. What treatment options are available, if any, that are more permanent? Thank you very much.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Richc,  I cannot say for sure but it does sound as if you are having a problem with the venous drainage of your penis.  It may be that the \"tubes\" in the penis that normally fill with blood are not able to fill properly due to an inappropriately relaxed vein that should be constricted more to prevent blood drainage and allow erection.  I am not aware of a direct way to test this.  My best advice is to continue to follow up with the urologist.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 28 year old male, been married 4 years or so, and I have a relatively healthy sex life with my wife.  We normally have intercourse at least 3 times a week maybe more some weeks.  I used to masterbate daily when we wouldn't have intercourse, but now I have tried to completely stop masterbation as it conflicts with my religious convictions, and I know it takes away from sexual pleasure with your significant other.  I don't look at pornography or anything of that nature to induce sexual desires at all.  Long story made short... I desire sex so passionately at least daily or maybe twice a day, but my wife on the other hand does not.  At bed time I almost feel like I am demanding it, I always am the one to make a move, I annoy her when I know she doesn't want to, I push the envelope sometimes to the point of angering her, and I myself get mad because I don't get satisfied.  Well I can't complain because I know I am getting enough, but I was wondering if there is a way to reduce my sexual drive so I don't bother my wife soooo much.  I looked online but it is filled with nothing but sexual drive increase meds, and methods to increase desire, where the heck are all the ways to reduce drives?  Is everyone in the world a 24-7 perve?  How can I bring my sex drive down to a more stable level instead of wanting sex every single day???  If that is possible it would be great, that way my wife and I are on a more level playing field for intimacy.\n\n",

    "content": "It is a difficult problem when you and your wife have such different needs, but it certainly is not uncommon.  A woman's sexual peak is typically in her 30s and 40s, while a man's peak is in his 20s.  Who knows why it is this way.    As for suggestions, the one thing that comes to mind is that there are medications, such as antidepressants which can decrease a person's libido (a side effect).  Sometimes drugs are prescribed for their wide effects rather than for their primary purpose.  You might talk to your doctor about this possibility to see if that is something you might benefit from.    The other suggestions I would make would be to actively work on your marriage in ways outside the bedroom.  This can work wonders to improve your wife's interest.  Women typically thrive on romance and someone who willingly shares in the housework, the childcare responsibilities.  Showing her you adore her may help increase her desire.  Also, be sure you know what she really wants from you sexually so you can try to help her enjoy it more and perhaps more frequently.    The other thing I would do is pursue some activity, perhaps together, that will allow you closeness in ways that are not necessarily sexual.  If you develop a hobby or do service for those people around you, it may help you to find fulfillment in other ways too.  You may be able to achieve more balance in your life generally.    The good news is by the time you reach your forties, your desire is apt to wane a bit, while your wife's may peak, possibly resulting in a closer match for the two of you.  Keep trying to meet in the middle and find ways to make each other happy.    Good luck.\n\n",

It was think and red from irritation with a white head. I began to squeeze and white puss began to come out (only little at a time came out). I began do to do the same for next couple weeks and the size of the infection decreased but became hard. About two weeks ago, I had pulled out that might have been the white head. It was hard and shaped like a grain of rice\u2026today, I know there is something still their\u2026it feels like there is a lump under the skin, its hard. There is no pain, itchiness with the lump.  I have been having unprotected sex with my girlfriend.  Is this herpes? boil, pimple? do I need surgery?  doctor: chan lowes response  From your description it sounds as if a skin pore became clogged and possibly infected.  If the area is not red and tender I would recommend you continue to observe it. I would not suggest continuing to try to drain it. If it does become red and painful or if it is not going away I would recommend that you see your doctor for an evaluation.  It does not sound like herpes and it is unlikely that you will need surgery.  Best wishes.  My response: Hey Doc, Its been about three weeks sense the visit with my local doctor. he had given me two Antibiotics (doxycyclin , and sulfmeth/trimeth) taken for two weeks twice a day. He assured me that is was not herpes. today, the lump under the skin is still there. it seems nothing has happened. I pressed it, white puss excaped. is this Skin Protein? the lump under the skin is hard and does not hurt or nor tender.  does syphilis create these types of symptoms? what do you recommend that I do? should I continue taking the medication?\n\n",

It also does not sound like syphilis based on your description.  It still sounds as if you have a pore that has become clogged and is accruing inflammatory material beneath it.  This material is likely a mixture of white blood cells and skin proteins.    You may have a pore that is chronically inflamed and is not improving.  If the antibiotics don't help I would recommend that you see a dermatologist to see if there are other treatments that help.  Rarely, things such as this need to be drained by making a very small incision and cleaning out the inside.  This would typically be an office procedure if needed.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Ely2333,  There are a few things that can be done for PE.  A technique in which the penis is squeezed just below the head when the sensation of ejaculation is felt can be helpful.  However, it should be done 3-4 times before allowing ejaculation if possible.  If this is consistently done, over the course of several months, most men gain significant control back over ejaculation.  If this fails, there are some medications for PE.  In particular, SSRI antidepressants are often used to take advantage of their side effect of delayed ejaculation.  These are prescription medications so you will need to see your doctor for an evaluation to discuss your symptoms if you wish to try something like this.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "You could consult with a urologist to check out any physical concerns, but I suspect this is emotional in nature.  I believe this excessive masturbation can have a negative effect on your sexual relationship.  It can become an addiction so I would recommend trying to break yourself of this habit.  You may try addiction recovery support groups as stopping could be difficult but the characteristics and steps needed are quite similar in any addiction.  If pornography is part of your experience, that can also negatively affect your sex life with a woman.  Porn is truly fiction - it is fake, false and meaningless, but very addictive and it requires more and more to be arousing to you.  This can make it difficult to function in a real and less-than perfect relationship.    I think you already know what you can do to help this but are reluctant to give up something that feels good to you.  Again, this is indicative of an addiction.  Good luck with this herculean effort.  It is possible and it just might make the difference.\n\n",

    "content": "I would not expect this to be anything that would require immediate consultation.  Sexual arousal is such a complex thing, including emotional, hormonal, physical and mental conditions that vary.  When you are not having a loving relationship with someone it is difficult to ascertain whether or not this is a real concern.    I understand your anxiety when looking down the road a bit but chances are when conditions are right and you are in a loving and committed relationship that feels safe and right to you, your desires will be what you would want and expect.  I would discourage pornography as this tends to be a false illusion of women, sex and desire, is addictive, and does not help the natural responses in a real relationship.  In fact, it can hurt since reality is not what you see on the screen.  If in the future you have problems in a real relationship, you could seek help but at your age I doubt this will be a problem.  Even abstaining from sexual activity in the meantime will in no way harm your future sex life.  You cannot compare future performance to masturbation - they are entirely different.  Lack of arousal now can actually help you to focus on other things in your life that will be productive and you can let things happen naturally at the right time and with the right person.    Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Mossy,  Your description doesn't particularly sound like an STD, with the exception of possible a syphilis sore or a genital wart.    I would recommend you be tested for STD's if there is any possibility since they do not always cause symptoms and can have some long term complications if not treated.  In addition, they are transmittable.    The area may also be simply an area of irritated skin.  I would recommend you see your doctor for testing and an evaluation to see what this lump may be.  As a note, if the lump goes away this does not mean that it is not an STD.  Testing is still recommended.  Best wishes.\n\n",

As such, it does not carry the increased risk of cancer, etc. that a true undescended testis does.  It is likely that this is normal.  If you would like to have it evaluated to be sure, either your primary care doctor or a urologist would be a good place to start.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "The jury is still out on this one I'm afraid.  There does not appear to be a correlation between infertility and masturbation according to some reliable sources.  There is no evidence that it affects a man's erections, fertility, or sperm count.   But, at such a high frequency, it could affect your relationship with your wife and if you are not having frequent sexual intercourse it is unlikely she will become pregnant.  Others have expressed the concept that repeated ejaculations at intervals of 24 hours or less may result in sperm depletion and a drop in numbers of 30 percent or more. Muscular contractions usually diminish with subsequent orgasms, which also contributes to lower sperm volumes and counts.  For this reason, fertility clinics often recommend daily intercourse during fertile days and every other day or 3-4 times weekly during the other days (or for men with a low sperm count).  The belief is that sperm production will be temporarily reduced with frequent ejaculations.  In my opinion it makes sense to not waste the sperm through masturbation if you want conception to occur.\n\n",

    "title": "Red bump on the skin of my penis",
    "content": "Hi.  I am an 18 year old male.  I am uncircumcised and have never had sex before (although i do enjoy the occasional masturbation). About a week ago I noticed a red bump (a little smaller than a pea) ON the skin of the penis (it is on the underside of the penis, by that i mean that when i am flaccid it is the part of the penis that is against my scrotum).  Well, it is actually close to where the skin of the penis and the scrotum come together.  Like I said, I am uncircumcised so it is hard to tell exactly where it is because the skin moves around, but when I get erect, the bump is on the shaft of the penis.  Anyway, I know the bump is on the skin and not on the penis, itself, or a testicle, because it is at the part of my genitals where i can lift the skin away from my testicles and penis.  When i lift the skin away, i see that the bump is on the skin.  The bump is a little smaller than pea sized and it is red. It is not really scaly or anything like that either.  I cannot figure out what it is.  I was hoping that you can explain to me what you think it might be and any possible remedies (like creams, rubbing alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, etc.).  Thanks a lot because I really do not feel comfortable showing it to my dad and then going to a doctor unless that is absolutely necessary.  Any and all feedback is appreciated.  By the way, I do have Fordyce spots, but this is bigger and redder than all of those spots. And I did shave my scrotum (just my scrotum, not all of my genital area) about a month and a half ago.  In case i haven't answered these, 1. Age--18 2.Sex--Male 3. Past diagnoses--None (i diagnosed my own Fordyce spots using pictures on the internet and doctorslounge forums) 4. Past surgeries--None 5. Family history--no problems except my parents have high blood pressure 6. Current medications--None  Thanks again!\n\n",

They can get infected, in which case the redness spreads and the area typically becomes fairly painful.  Often these will resolve spontaneously unless they become infected.  I would recommend that if the area is not improving in the next few days or if it begins to get worse, the redness spreads or it becomes painful that you have it evaluated by your doctor.

    "content": "Hello,  I am a 33 yo heterosexual male. In December, I had a series of sexual encounters with a women with questionalbe sexual past. I was working in Afghanistan and she was also(She was American and turned out to be a complete fraud). I had unprotected vaginal intercourse with her approximately 5 times. During the last encounter, she was incredibly dry and I was quite forceful and continued. I heard a popping sound but did not feel any pain. Roughly 7 days later, I noticed three small bright red dots in a triangle on the top part of the shaft and a small red patch. I went to a clinic in Kabul(German doctor) and was told it was herpes. Took a urine test and they said I had chlamydia. Took antibiotics for the chlamydia. The red spots and patches started to spread. They were not painful. About two weeks after the exposure, a cut or painless ulcer opened up at the site of the red patch which healed about three days later, leaving a scar. One week later, I had a clear discharge which had a strong odor; lasted for 4 days. Urine test was clear. Went to a hospital in Dubai. Tested for every STD and subsequently treated, as a precaution for syphillis, ghonnorea, chlamydia, trich although I did not have anything-including herpes. The redness persisted in the original areas but dulled and spread out. There was never any open painful ulcers.  5 months later- The redness is very faint in the upper shaft but the top 1/3 of my shaft is significantly smaller and has excessive amounts of foreskin when flaccid. Been to urologists and they say there is nothing wrong. However, they did not see my penis prior to \"this injury\". Can barely keep an erection; when I do, the top of my penis is bright red where the bottom is normal color.   I beleived that I have traumatized the cells in the top part of my penis during the rough intercourse that I had or there is some type of stubborn skin infection that is causing the change in size and pigmentation of the area. I need to find closure on this. My sex life is ruined and I have not been with a woman since this incident. It is destroying my confidence and self esteem. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I am a 20 year old male, healthy and without sexual complications. However, I do have a certain degree of tilt to my penis and wonder if this is normal.  This tilt is present both when erect and when flaccid. The tilt is present at the base of the penis, the penis does not 'twist' along its length. I would best describe the axis of tilt as holding out an arm in front of you and rotating the shoulder so the palm faces down. The tilt is roughly 35 degrees.  Is there anything I can do to correct this tilt? While it does not cause pain or impede my sexual functioning I'm quite self conscious over the issue.  Thanks so much for your time! Guy.\n\n",

However, in general, as long as functioning is not impaired it is usually safest not to try to correct penile curvature.  The surgeries can result in complications including loss of functioning.

Since as long as I can remember my semen has been strange - its a heterogeneous mixture of a clear-ish, thin fluid and opaque white-ish \"chunks\". My ejaculate consistency is very consistant, and the amount if what should be expected, maybe a touch more. Is this normal? Healthy? A potential symptom of a complication, dietary deficiency, or impotence?  Thanks for your time and help. ~G.\n\n",

Being on amoxicillin covers some of the likely bacteria but it does not cover staph that well.  Staph is a well known cause of skin infections.  Becuase of the possibility of an infection I would recommend you see your doctor for an evaluation.  You may need to change antibiotics to one that covers a few more bacteria.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Several months ago I noticed a small dark spot that perfectly resembles a bruise on the glans. Its dark gray, and about the size of a dime. Its painless and I've experienced no negative symptoms of any kind.   However, it has not changed (not better or worse) in the months since I noticed it, so I highly doubt its a bruise of any sort. I am sexually active but I've read that no STD resembles a bruise. My partner has recently been tested for STD's and it came back negative. She's my first, so unless I got it some other way, I should be STD free as well.  I'm hoping its just pigmentation but I'm scared to death that it could be penile cancer since the research I've been doing seems to point in that direction.  I've made a doctor's appointment but its a week or so away. Anyone have any insight into this?\n\n",

Regarding your question about the insurance, if the insurance statements/policies are sent to your parents it is quite likely that they will get a statement showing that the insurance has covered the costs of a medical procedure.  Depending on the insurance company, it is unlikely to say exactly what the procedure was but will likely say who the doctor was.  There really isn't any way around this that I am aware of.  Also, if your curvature is determined to not be impacting functioning the insurance may not cover the procedure.  It is best to talk with your insurance company before having any surgery done to be sure it will be covered as expected.  Sorry I can't be much help regarding the technical side of the surgery.  I'm not familiar enough with it.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 28 year old Male who is in athletic shape and who has had no issues with his penis or masturbating in the past.  On Monday I learned that my girlfriend cheated on me (while in Vegas...believe the hype) and the days that followed I was extremely upset and angry.  I am a very laid back person and acting this way isn't close to normal.  I have been filled with all types of emotions but constantly angry and stressed.  I haven't been to the gym in a week or done anything physical since I learned what happened so I haven't had any stress release.  Last night I spoke to her and we had a \"good talk\" that left me feeling 100 times better.  When I left I felt relaxed and in control of myself.  As I was driving home my testicles started to ache like they would if I had \"blue balls\".  I wasn't close to being sexually aroused but when I got home I had to relieve the \"pressure\".  It took longer than usual for me to become erect and to ejaculate but when I did it was one of the most extreme ejaculations I have ever had.  I came very hard and it was the most I have ever seen.  Could this be because of the high levels of testosterone I was experiencing the last couple days with no release?  That is the only explanation I can come up with.  I wasn't sexually aroused nor have I been in the position to generate the \"blue balls\" sensation.  Any information would be great.  Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I am 15 years old and I am male. One night when I was going to the bathroom I felt a sharp sting and I noticed that by the opening of my penis was a bump, not hard but more of an irritation. I told my parents and we went to see a doctor who said it was a rash and to use Penaten or Vaseline to get rid of it. Bad news is it didn't work and my doctor took medical leave because of his heart. He has been gone for a year and a bit and my family finally got a new doctor who I'm not comfortable with. I have had this irritation for 2 and a half years and it never got any worse. I have only started using Penaten and skin creams these past 2 weeks to no effect. The Penaten seems to make the irritation go down but then it returns to normal later. I do in fact masturbate. The only problem was that when I started I masturbated with soap. Thus I have irritations on my penis that will heal with time since I moved to hand lotion. I know the irritation wasn't caused by  masturbation because I wasn't masturbating much when it appeared. The reason why I am not consulting my parents is because:  1: I have healing irritations from masturbation I don't want to show.  2: They'll get horribly mad at me if they know I still have this problem.  I've prayed and done anything I can by myself. Please, can anyone help me? This is causing such distress.\n\n",

He said he only masterbates when I don't have sex with him.......and after a three hour session I cannot do it for a week because it is so uncomfortable.  My mother suggested going to a doctor but he will not because he said nothing is wrong with him...he is just a manly man. I did speak to his mother about this problem and she told me his father was the same way and now they are in their late 40's and it takes him an hour.

He feels the urge  to do it (very often) but he has to touch the penis some particular way otherwise it doesn't work.

    "content": "Hello, I'm grateful that this forum exist and appreciate anyone's advice.  I'm a 20 years old male, virgin (never had sex, in any form) and was a bit overweight. The only thing I remember doing in the past 2 weeks was doing a lot of fitness exercises to get rid of my fat (and I lost overall 5 kg). Most of what I did was simply push-ups, walking and running a lot, and eating very very little.  A few days ago, when I tried to pull down my foreskin and wash my penis there was some white stuff on the inside of the foreskin. I washed it away. When I pulled further down, the penis itself seemed to have a whiter color (usually it's pink, \"fleshy\"). I washed it but the color stayed. I thought it would go away after a while.  Today I tried to wash again after my exercises.  I pulled the foreskin... it seemed even whiter (or pus? I don't know) and the foreskin didn't let itself pull down much. It's as if the inside of the foreskin has \"merged\" with the penis! I was scared when I saw that... but I came here to ask.  I don't feel any pain or itch in the area.  P.S. I didn't masturbate since I started doing the fitness exercises (2 weeks ago).  Thank you\n\n",

    "content": "My boyfriend and I have been sexually active for about 8 months, and in this time he has never been able to orgasm more than once in a day...sometimes not even every other day. We are both in our early 20's, and when he was born premature he had cryptorchidism with one testicle. I find his inability to not orgasm sometimes very odd, for a previous boyfriend of mine had no problem orgasming 2 to 3 times a day. Could his cryptorchidism as a newborn be to blame or what is the deal?!\n\n",

    "content": "Many women have trouble with orgasm, particularly through penile penetration only.  It is not something that just matures or \"corrects itself\" naturally.  But, as you mature sexually with your partner and explore your bodies together, you may be able to find ways that work for you, either through direct clitoral stimulation or with the help of toys designed for that purpose.  With practice, time, and emotional preparation that sets the mood for you, you may learn to achieve orgasm in time.  A large percentage of women never do achieve orgasm in the \"conventional\" way but they have satisfying and enjoyable sexual experiences, so don't worry about being abnormal - it's just a difference in individuals.  But, again, it is not necessarily a lifelong problem.  You may be able to reach the point where you are successful.  Try not to dwell too much on it so that you can enjoy the sexual experience without feeling pressure to orgasm.  This is part of the psychological element I refer to.  Good luck.\n\n",

Basically, it would be taking advantage of the side effect of delayed ejaculation with these types of medications.  There are several \"training\" techniques that can be used as well.  A common, generally effective technique is to nearly reach ejaculation and then squeeze the penis tightly just below the edge of the glans.  This will subside the urge to ejaculate.  This should be repeated 3-4 times before ejaculation is allowed.  It's a long process, but after about 5-6 months many men find they are able to prevent ejaculation too soon without needing the squeeze.  Best wishes.\n\n",

According to almost every symptoms list I could find for my condition, painful erections were no where to be found.  Does anyone know if this is a typical symptom of my condition?

Hair follicles and sebaceous (sweat) glands are normally found on the penile shaft, particularly on the ventral surface (underside). They may be visible as small nodules or might only be felt as small lumps in the skin.  They are usually in the form of yellow/black or red nodules on the hair shafts or any other parts of the inguinal region. They may contain pus in them.   Other causes of skin swellings due to dermatitis or acne (although not common in this area) etc should be considered.  Direct clinical examination is essential for diagnosis.  I advise you to follow with your Doctor.   Keep us updated.  Best regards.\n\n",

Exposure to other skin irritants (certain soaps, creams you may be allergic to) may result in a similar picture.    This is an inflammation (dermatitis) that usually subsides spontaneously, but avoiding exposure to any irritant is important.

    "content": "hi im a 23 year old male. When i was around 19-20 i had sex with a girl that i later found out to have HPV. about two months later i grew a huge lump ( about an inch thick and and inch protruding outwards)under the skin on the top of my penis shaft. It was very red and swollen and i kinda lied to myself thinking it would go away. well for the most part it did, yet now i have a small lump(about 1/8 inch thick) under the skin that is very hard and attached to my penis and not the above skin. There is no scar on the outside and the lump has never broke the service. I have no plaque and no curving in my penis and am a circumsized male. I know that HPV can cause sores in the throat also, and within this past year i seem to be getting those as well. My question is how likely is this HPV (ive never been tested) and is this lump going to need to be removed? it hasnt grown larger since it shrank. oh and lately ive noticed frequent urination at night, the inability to drain all the urine out when im done peeing, i put it back and its like i pee my pants a little. the most recent symptom is that now after i ejaculate i have some painfull swelling at the very base of the penis, closest to the anus. could it be the HPV has given me cancer at such a young age? please don't just tell me just to go to the docter, without giving me any kind of opinion. The reason i havent gone to the doctors already is ive got social anxiety disorder and am deathly afraid of needles. If im gonna brave this and go in i need some kinda opinion. thanks for your understanding\n\n",

HPV may have caused your lump.  I would also be suspicious of syphilis.  Syphilis initially causes a large, painless lump that subsequently resolves.  I would recommend testing for all STD's as a precaution.  If your symptoms persist and the STD's are negative you may need to see a urologist to see if you have a constriction of your urethra somewhere.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Im wondering if its possible at all that I caused any damage by the stinging reaction I had.   My sex drive and erections seem to be a lot weaker which is why I ask.

Always the left testi. it starts hurting when I sit. sitting in different positions helps somewhat. standing removes all pain.( after a few seconds). it is the most painful on my motorcycle but my wifes SUV seat is bad, and folding chairs are bad. I can sit for about a half hour before it starts. now it is getting more frequent and painful.  The pain. it feels like my left testi is in a vise, the pain stats as a 1 then a 2 all the way to 10++++ when it is at the most painful it is UNBEARABLE!!!!!!!!! I have a bullet hole in my foot and had my appendix burst, and multiple broken bones. this pain when at 10++++++++++ is 100% worse than anything I have had. then I stand and it just melts away.  I went to the dr several times in the past. I thought it might be a hernia. ultra sound and Many hernia checks reveiled no hernia. finally I went today. the Dr. said it was a nerve? and there was nothing I could do about it. WHAT THE HE@%?  I am thinking testicular torsion or the cord is getting pinched and twisted while I sit. but I am not a DR.  CAN SOMEONE PLEASE HELP!!!\n\n",

It doesn't take long for torsion to begin causing death of the testis.  I would be suspicious of a compressed nerve.  An MRI may help determine the origin of your pain.  If it is a compressed nerve, physical therapy can sometimes be very helpful.  In some cases surgery can help as well.  You may want to see a urologist for an evaluation as well.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I've never heard of this before but theoretically if your laptop is heating up your scrotum it may be causing the sperm cells to die resulting in watery semen.  It may be worth a try to keep the laptop off your lap for a while and see if things change.  Keep in mind also that the normal constitution of semen can vary and at times may be watery.  If there is still concern I would recommend that you see a urologist.  Best wishes.\n\n",

The problem I have is with my penis....it isn't a direct problem with its size, when it is erect, I measure 15cm, 6 inches in length, (which I count as average) with a pretty good girth, however, the trouble is when my penis retracts and goes flaccid, it goes extremely small...embarrasingly small in fact, it shrinks to around 3-4 inches, but which appears very thin, with not much girth, also the head is a lot smaller than a lot of my friends....  It is an embarrasing problem, as in cubicles and showers, im extremely unwilling to strip naked, or reveal it, as it is embarrasing and dosent represent my erect size....is there some sort of way I could solve this problem? it is a big problem for me and causes me a lot of depression and anger, I don't know if surgery to improve its flaccid size is wise, im asking for help from proffesionals before proceeding with anything rash or over the top, I know that pills and pumps are not recommended, but is there some sort of way in which I can use Muscle relaxers or something to increase its flaccid size? a lot of time when I expose my penis to hot water it goes to quite a good flaccid size, to that of my friends, however other times, it shrinks, is there anyway you could help me? any replies would be greatly appreciated....

Obviously, I can't approach her with this as it will do irreversible damage to her and our relationship .

    "content": "Viagra will not cause an erection in absence of stimulation.  I'm sorry about your disappointment with your sexual life.  I would advise getting help with the relationship because it is most likely the psychological issues, as you suspect.  This doesn't imply you don't love her; just that you need some help in reviving a long-term relationship.    If you could explain to your wife that you are having difficulty with stimulation and that you would like to explore some things because it is important to you to have a satisfying intimate relationship, perhaps you could together find ways to improve the situation.  Maybe she would not be hurt if she knows you are wanting to make sex better for both of you because you love her.  While fantasies can sometimes help (as you found) it would be best if you could resolve the issues that are keeping you from being aroused with your wife.  There are therapists who deal with sexual difficulties.  Make sure you select a reputable therapist who specializes in this area using appropriate and board-certified techniques.  You may find that using Viagra or Cialis or Levitra could help compliment the psychological issues but I am quite confident you need to work on the relationship first and foremost and that the drugs alone will not do the trick.  Also, you may wish to read some articles that deal with this issue.   Sometimes you need to alter your environment, make the bedroom exclusive to sleep and love-making (get rid of the TV, books, computer, other clutter, etc. that may be psychologically interfering).  You may need to try some different techniques, such as finding ways to give your wife pleasure without actually penetrating her.  Variety can be the spice of life in this department.  As you become creative you may actually find your own level of arousal is improved.  Don't be afraid to tell her what you would like to try too.  Let her know you want to experiment with some techniques that might make you both enjoy each other more.  The other thing that can help is to try to do more courting.  Spend time going out alone with your wife and doing things you both enjoy.  Find other ways to laugh and have fun together to bring back the playfulness of your relationship.  It can be difficult, especially if you have children, to get into the role of  passionate lover.  Find a new, secluded place to make love (even if it doesn't actually involve the act itself).  Work on kissing, touching and other pleasurable activities without the pressure of needing to perform.  Agree in advance that you are going to enjoy each other without actually having intercourse.  There are some things you can try to get the spark going again.  You may also find there are some deep resentments that you are not even aware of consciously, but if you can uncover the problems and resolve them, the sexual issues may take care of themselves.    Good luck with this.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I am a 30 year old male and have been celebate for the last 3 years, where i had been sexually active before. I have recently resume my sex life. I have over the last 3 years undergone alot of physical changes, ie i've lost alot of fatty weight and have gained muscular mass and am now alot leaner then i used to be. i am 68kg. I am healthy with no medical history.  For some reason, i think that my penis has in these years grown bigger and upon erection my skin is alot tighter then it used to feel when i have an erection.  Now, whenever i masturbate or have sex, a strip of skin 1.5 cm wideround my penis, located one inch below the base of the penis head, gets 'rubbed' and 'burns', but there is no blood, it hurts terribly and will heal two days after.   this problem does not occur when i wear a condom. Pls advice on what is wrong with me and what i can do?  Many Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "i'm a fit 30 year old male. for the past 10 years or so i have had off and on testical pain. Always the left testi. it starts hurting when i sit. sitting in different positions helps somewhat. standing removes all pain.( after a few seconds). it is the most painful on my motorcycle but my wifes SUV seat is bad, and folding chairs are bad. i can sit for about a half hour before it starts. now it is getting more frequent and painful.   The pain. it feels like my left testi is in a vise, the pain stats as a 1 then a 2 all the way to 10++++ when it is at the most painful it is UNBEARABLE!!!!!!!!! i have a bullet hole in my foot and had my appendix burst, and multiple broken bones. this pain when at 10++++++++++ is 100% worse than anything i have had. then i stand and it just melts away.  i went to the dr several times in the past. i thought it might be a hernia. ultra sound and Many hernia checks reveiled no hernia.  finally i went today. the Dr. said it was a nerve? and there was nothing i could do about it.  WHAT THE HE@%?  i am thinking testicular torsion or the cord is getting pinched and twisted while i sit. but i am not a DR.  CAN SOMEONE PLEASE HELP!!!\n\n",

    "content": "I was circumcised earlier this week - I had had lichen sclerosis and while this was not particularly serious it was long term as as I had been told that there was a \"small but sinister\" risk of skin cancer, I agreed to the procedure.  I had expected the glans to be exposed - however this has not been done and there is now a pseudo foreskin that covers the glans - and looks ridiculous as it is very thick (being comprised of folded back skin from the shaft) and then ends with a little glans peeping out the end.  I realise the may be some bruising post operation but think that even allowing for this, there is excess skin.  I reckon the surgeon will tell me that this is to ensure that there is sufficient skin there for an erection to be comfortable - while there is (based on the one erection I have had) there is still excess skin and I feel that more careful measuring would have taken account of this.  I am tempted to seek further surgery - assuming the skin will stand the trauma, as the cut was made just below the glans - but the insurer is likely to say that this is not medically essential so I have to pay myself - which would be (for me) a huge expense that there would have been no reason for had the work been properly done.  I am not sure how best to approach the guy who did the work, I want to make my displeasure clear but do not want him to say he knows best and walk away.    I hope this is reasonably clear.\n\n",

It is possible that the area may still get better, although I'm not sure if it will get totally better.  Usually it takes around 2 weeks or so to really be fully healed.

    "content": "I agree that this must be a \"complication\" however it is one that presumbably can be managed.  I saw the urologist about a month ago and he indicated where the cut would be, I noted this by reference to a small spot on the fioreskin.  He also siad that he drew a line on the penis before making the operation.  However on the day he seemed very busy (although I was the only person being operated on) and had no time to do anything than get me to sign the consent form - I insisted on showing and referring to the position on the penis, he did not draw any line.  The actual cut leaves considerably more skin than had been envisaged.  Perhaps the circumcision is still medically valid but I do think that cosmetic considerations are also an issue - however I assume this will require a second opinion.  Would the skin be able to take a second cut (the top cut is very close to the glans so there is not spare skin there), if so how long would one have to wait ?  I assume too that I would have to arrange this separately as the first surgeon is unlikely to admit he was wrong so it will be a painful and expensive process ?\n\n",

Your primary care doctor can also make a referal for you.  The circumcision can be \"re-done\" to remove excess foreskin that remains.  There should be no \"ill effects\" from having a second circumcision done.  Regarding timing, the urologist will probably want to wait several weeks to be sure the first incision is well healed.

I masterbate the conventional way, however it is sometimes vigourous. I do feel somewhat anxious/nervous about climaxing for the first time with my girlfriend, and feel pressure to do so from her. We have been together off and on for about 1 year and have only recently engaged in any activity that would lead to my orgasm. In that 1 year our relationship has seen emotional ups and downs.  I occasionally view pornography while masterbating but it is not necessary for me to become aroused and achieve orgasm on my own.   When masterbating by myself I can usually acheive orgasm in around 15 minutes.  In the past, I was unable to achieve orgasm with a different girlfriend for quite some time. Eventually i did achieve orgasm and had no problems thereafter.  Is my inability to orgasm the result of my nerves/ pressure to achieve orgasm? or a result of regular masterbation? or something else entirely perhaps?   Any advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

My best advice is to talk openly with your partner and discuss ways to help remove the pressure and anxiety.  Often, once the pressure to climax is removed the issues resolve.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Negative Symptoms: These are my only symptoms. The red bumps are not red any more, and the itch is not as severe, but still there. As well, my girlfriend and I have been sexually exclusive for a year and a half. She is the only person I have had sex with ever. Herpes symptoms usually pop up within 2 weeks of infection right? She has no symptoms. No blisters...yet.  I figure that I just got in some chiggers (sp) and they bit me and then the sore throat is just from traveling so much over the holidays...

    "content": "Often the underlying cause of ED is that there is a problem filling the penis with blood to create an erection.  Often the issue is within the corpus cavernosum, a balloon-like structure that fills with blood.  If there is an obstruction in one of the arteries to the penis perhaps angioplasty would help.  Angioplasty is unlike to help with problems within the corpus cavernosum since at this point the vessels become microsized.  Interesting thought though.  I'd be interested to see studies done on this.  Best wishes.\n\n",

My guess is that it's the veins. It does not hurt when I urinate. I think it only hurts when I move it. I  've had a number of genital problems in the past few months where the foreskin was swollen and my uncle, a medical doctor in Indonesia prescribed me a Hydrocortisone cream. It healed eventually but after 3 weeks, the same thing returned and another medical doctor from Indonesia prescribed me a cream which I can't remember and Cefadroxil capsules.  Now after a 2-3 months, I'm having another genital problem. Like I said above, the left side internally is hurting and when I retract it, I've noticed small yellow bumps around the base of the penis. My family doctor said that it was normal and to wipe it off but I don't think this has anything to with the symptoms I'm experiencing now. The inside is a little bit inflamed.  My hypothesis is that I've been masturbating too much. Can anyone help me please?\n\n",

It may also be that you have a blockage in the ducts that carry the semen.  There are several other possibilities so I would recommend that you see a urologist for evaluation.  In regards to how to be able to do this, you generally need to see your primary care doctor first for a referral.  You should have a yearly physical exam so this is a good time to discuss your symptoms with your doctor to get the appropriate referrals.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Curved erections are usually normal. It has nothing to due with masturbation.  Sometimes, a curved penis can be the result of an injury to the penis  or Peyronie\u2019s Disease, which is a severe curvature or bending of the penis and can be very painful. Peyronie's disease is characterized by a hard lump of scar tissue, or plaque, that forms on the penis. The plaque develops on the upper or lower side of the penis in layers containing erectile tissue. Cases of Peyronie's disease range from mild to severe. Symptoms may develop slowly or appear overnight. It is unclear exactly what causes Peyronie\u2019s Disease. In severe cases, the hardened plaque reduces flexibility, causing pain and forcing the penis to bend or arc during erection. In many cases, the pain decreases over time, but the bend in the penis may remain a problem, making sexual intercourse difficult.  If you are experiencing pain, then I would suggest you make an appointment with your doctor, but otherwise, it is probably perfectly normal, and nothing to cause concern.\n\n",

If a lot of volume is being expressed, large volumes will be made.  It may be that  when you have increased periods of time between ejaculation you are producing larger volumes of semen that causes some pain during ejaculation.    If this is the cause, the pain should resolve after several days of decreased ejaculation since the body will respond by decreasing semen production.  If  your pain continues I would recommend you consider seeing a urologist.  Best wishes.\n\n",

My ejaculate started to come out clear (or a light milky color) and isnt sticky, like it use to be, nor does it smell like it use to.  Its more liquidy than it used to be to.  This is with masterbation and sex.  I notice after sex, i pull my condom off and and hold it up, and i can see little white drops in there, but still not fully white and not thick, and no smell.  Im hoping its not a sign of fertality.  Now, about 2 months ago, I went to the doctor because I thought i had a bladder infection, but it was a minor prostate infection.  I was given an antibiotic, I took it all, and i think it may be coming back.  Now would the prostate infection have anything to do with the way my ejaculate is coming out?  Or could it be something else?  Thanks in advance!\n\n",

Are there any long term risks involved by using ed meds ? Did I damage my self in anyway ? I will be seeing a urologist in the next week but this is weighing heavy on me. I heard ed meds totally ruin your ability to have sex after a few years of use, is this true ? I can function without the meds but should I stop using them or is it safe to continue use ?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I'm a male, 22. I've always had an issue achieving an erection 'in the heat of the moment' with potential sexual partners. This has occurred several times. I've never had an issue achieving an erection for the purpose of masturbation, and I used to masturbate on a daily basis. Thinking my daily masturbation could be a reason, I stopped and started waiting a up to a week between these sessions. Nevertheless I'm still having problems getting an erection with a partner.   I've never thought much of it or put a lot of pressure on myself during these moments until lately, when I found someone I'm really happy with. When we hold each other and kiss, I don't get anything out of it 'under the sheets,' so to say. I've always had the impression that a person should be completely turned on by then, and since I'm not, I try to get out of the situation so I don't take it to the next level and fail. I'm also not easily aroused at any given moment in the day when I become flirtatious with coworkers, etc. This occurs outside the bedroom as well.  Is it possible that I have a physical arousal issue? And if this is psychological issue what can I do about it? I'm only 22 and in the early stages of a relationship, talking about it would most likely hinder the situation than improve upon it.  Thanks for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi. I have a similar problem. I'm 18, a guy, on ritalin, and none of the other stuff on the list applies here.   I think I have a problem with my erections, but I don't know since I don't know what normal is. I used to jerk off alot until I started having lower back pains. I did some internet research on it, it said that that was a result of over masturbation, so I dropped it down to once every other day, and I've been doing that ever since. But I get this nagging suspicion that it's not good enough.  When I watch porn and don't use my hands I start to grow to about 4 inches or so, but I start hardening up there. It gets thick and dense. If I use my hands I can get a full erection, but the outer parts of it feel insubstantial, like I don't have enough muscle to go to the outer reigons of my dick. I'm also aware that there's a slight downward cuve to my erection, starting at an inch or two up from the base. Also, if I jerk off too quickly, the muscle doesn't spread out quickly enough and I get some parts weighing more than others, making it very irregular.  What do you suggest? I don't have the money for pills, nor do I want anyone knowing about this thing, so that means no doctors or expensive drugs.   Thank you.\n\n",

There may be a superficial skin infection causing your symptoms.  I would recommend you be evaluated by your doctor to look for any infections or other possible causes of your pain.

    "content": "It would not make any sense for there to be a direct connection between the climate at Antarctica, and impotence.  Your body core temperature and clothing should protect all except exposed parts like your face during the conditions you can expect.  However, prolonged lack of sex can diminish the amount of fluid the prostate is making, decreasing the amount of ejaculate.  This can be avoided by masturbation occasionally.  Also consider the psychological conditions of wintering over and the amount of socialization etc. you can expect, and ask whether there is a high incidence of psychological effects.  In Scandinavia long winters are associated with higher rates of depression and suicide.  If you consider yourself to have a hardy personality that can deal with unusual conditions and limited choices of who to socialize with then it is perhaps safe to guess that conditions there will not affect your sex drive in the long run.\n\n",

    "content": "I am only 19 and have had a problem for years now, which is extremely depressing.  Anyway, I have one huge vein that runs along the top of my penis. It is big, protrudes out from the skin, not a normal tiny blue one. It does not occlude properly, and drains blood at a massive rate from the head of my penis. This is a huge problem becaue the head does not engorge at all which severely effects my pleasure, and also the ability to have sex.  I had the vein embolized with a coil, but the coil was put in my pelvis area. This worked somewhat, but since the coil was far away from the actual site of the leak (the head), the blood still travelled to this point...and the head still deflated (especially when I lay on my back).  There must be some way to either completely kill this vein, or some way an interventional radiologist can place a coil or something much closer to the site of the leak, in my penis, so it keeps the head full??\n\n",

    "content": "22-yo, in good health, no meds, some family history of hypertension.   About a month and a half ago I noticed that I was having trouble reaching or maintaining a full erection, either for intercourse or masturbation...Not complete failure, but I wouldn't put it at anything better than 70 percent. I've never had an issue with it until this point, and I wasn't expriencing anything abnormally stressful at the time--absolutely zero recognition or worry until I actually noticed it happening.   It's persisted for several weeks. After the first 2 or 3 weeks I started occasionally noticing a bit of blood or whatever else mixed in with the semen--just enough to make either the whole load or, more generally, the last couple of gasps a bit red/brown in appearance.  Sometimes a little dribbling of the same color right after the act.  From time to time the ramp-up process will be accompanied by a bit of pain, or more so a twinge in the shaft of the penis as it's engorging. Seems to be localized to the left side, around the base or lower. A certain droopy tightness, if that makes sense.   I should mention that this entire issue has arisen (ha) during a more general drop in my sex drive...That's probably been going on for at least 2 or so months. Very little desire to look at porn, fantasize, etc. Anyhow, masturbation is more infrequent and very rarely fueled by any real horniness beforehand.  Spontaneous contact with my girlfriend can still get me going pretty well, but I always seem to fall short of full-on engorgement.  I know that erection issues can very frequently be attributed to psychology, but since I am well-adjusted, happy, and still not too freaked out about the whole thing, I'm thinking my case may be something more medical. An infection, or a problem with blood flow?  Something that might be helped with herbs/dietary supplements/etc.?\n\n",

The tight foreskin that does not retract can become dangerous if it were to be pulled back and not be able to be brought back forward.    Before circumcision, if you prefer, you may talk with your doctor about using a steroid cream on the tip of the penis to help loosen the skin.  At the same time, you can have your testes evaluated.  The \"bag of worms\" is generally a varicoceole.  These are often inconsequential but can occasionally be associated with infertility and need repair.  The white patch may be an area of hypopigmentation that is normal, or may be a fungal skin infection.  Your doctor can evaluate it and give you a treatment if needed.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "Your labs and developmental description are indicative of testosterone deficiency.  It is possible that obesity is contributing some to this as fat tissue converts testosterone into estrogen (loosely speaking); however, your estrogen levels are not elevated.  This makes me think you may have a primary testosterone deficiency rather than a secondary issue.    It is interesting that  your LH and FSH are normal.  This would seem to indicate that your pituitary gland is not recognizing that your testosterone levels are low.    I would suggest that you discuss this with an endocrinologist.  You should probably have your growth hormone tested as well.  The obesity may have masked a deficiency in growth.  (I don't know for sure if this can occur but obesity does lead to accelerated growth in those with normal growth hormone so I suspect it would do the same in growth hormone deficiency.)  Growth hormone deficiency is associated with reduce penis growth.  Pubic and axillary hair is not driven by testosterone.  This is likely the reason that you have had normal development of these without the associated other puberty changes.  Hope this helps.  Keep us updated.\n\n",

Some possibilities include balanitis (inflammation of the glans in uncircumcized men). It could also be a result of trauma. Most STDs would have a longer incubation period but that can't be ruled out since chancroid for example can develop in as little as 12 hours.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "You may have a fungal infection of the skin called tinea cruris, commonly known as jock itch.  THis is a fungal infection that can be treated with an antifungal cream.  Treatment can take a while, however, and stopping the cream too soon results in return of the fungus.  Generally, at least two weeks are needed for treatment.  The treatment are should extend beyond the affected skin by about an inch to be sure that the entire infected area is treated.  These infections can be quite itchy.  Additionally you may have a folliculitis that could require antibiotics to clear up.  It sounds less likely to be this but it is possible.  I would suggest talking with your doctor again and discussing your persisting symptoms.  Also, your doctor can recommend or prescribe the correct antifungal cream for you if you need it.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "What you are describing may be a condition called phimosis in which the foreskin does not open fully causing difficulty with retracting the foreskin.  This can be a serious condition if the foreskin does retract fully then gets caught behind the head of the penis.  This can cut off blood supply to the head of the penis and is considered an emergency.  A circumcision is currative.  Recently there have been some studies using a high potency steroid cream on the tip of the foreskin twice a day for a month.  This has been shown to sometimes cause the skin to loosen enough to resolve the problem.  This may be worth a try.  In the US, such steroid creams are by prescription only.  Also, high potency steroid creams can have side effects if too much is used.  As such I would recommend that you be evaluated by your doctor.  One note, if your foreskin is tight you should never force it behind the head of the penis as it can be come trapped and cut off blood flow.  If this does happen, seek medical attention right away.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "Of course I cannot make a specific diagnosis. But my guess is that you are irritating your urethra, either with direct physical trauma by vigorous masturbation; or that you are getting chemical irritation, perhaps due to whatever you might use for lubrication. In particular, if even the slightest amount of soap gets into the urethra, it would cause exactly the symptoms you describe. As an experiment, you could try masturbating with a condom, preventing any contamination of the urethra (but not a lubricated condom with the spermicide nonoxynol-9, which can cause the same symptoms!). If you still have the problem, it's probably just physical irritation, and you can learn to go easy.  In any case, if you're not otherwise sexually active, it obviously can't be an STD. So that's as far as I can go; I'm an STD specialist, not an expert in details of sexual function.  Dr. Anderson\n\n",

    "title": "Tiny lump on scrotum (sp?)",
    "content": "Hi, I'm 17 and really really don't want to go to the doctor unless it's a last resort.  Awhile ago I developed a tiny-smaller than a pea sized bump on my scrotum. It seems to be on the skin over the lower part of the right testicle. I saw a commercial about testicular cancer that scared the crap out of me when I thought about that bump. It's only been around for a week or possibly longer since it's painless and i didn't notice it.  Is this possibly cancer or a cyst or something else? Cancer I read was painless like this, but I think i read cyst is painful. As I have had neither, i'm not sure. I'd really appreciate a professional opinion. I'm a bit worried.   I know I'm going to be suggested to go to a doctor, but that is not a conversation I want to have if not neccessary.   Just noticed what i needed to include. Age - 17 Sex - Male Past diagnoses - nothing (I've been to check ups for sports and noone noticed a problem) Haven't seen a doctor in at least 6 months. Past surgeries - none Family History - Noone that i know with cancer or anything if thats what it means. Current Medications - Nothing  Thanks for your help.\n\n",

It isn't sexually transmitted, and needs no treatment.   I suggest that you show it to a doctor next time you go.  Hope this calms your fears, but please seek the guidance from your physcian if the bump changes in color or causes any pain so that the problem can get an accurate diagnosis.  Take Care  D.

I am currently a 16 year-old Caucasian male and have not been diagnosed with anything sexually-related.  I have not have had any surgeries in the past.  My question is regarding delayed puberty, however I'm not quite sure that's what it is because everything else has developed as-per-normal.  My penis has remained unchanged in size, and same with the scrotum area.  I have read the \"average\" size, but I'm convinced it's most definitely not the average from a general concensus.  When erect it is not much more than 6 inches and extremely skinny.  Like I said, I'm not sure if this is related to delayed puberty, but I am definitely looking to see if there is anything that can be prescribed for enlargement purposes.  Please help!\n\n",

You may also be experiencing some inflamed hair follicles or irritation dermatitis caused by friction with frequent intercourse.  Ensuring adequate lubrication may help if this is the cause.    Without direct examination I cannot say for sure that there is not an infection (STD or other) that may be causing the bumps.  Other infections may include fungal (yeast) infection though this is rare in immunocompetent men.  I would suggest an evaluation if the bumps do not resolve soon.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "title": "Sex Life after marijuana",
    "content": "I am a 30 year old male who has habitually smoked marijuana for the last 11 years. (Average a joint\\blunt 3 - 4 times a week). Prior to college no issues with erection problems. While in college I started having problems when I was not high. So whenever I would have sex I would be high or coming down from a high. But my libido was still high. Over the last 2 years, I have noticed significant decrease in libido(non existent) and have started having problems maintaing erection. In addition my morning erections are not firm and are few and far between.   I  just recently quit cold Turkey (3 months without it). I have seen my personal physcian and urologist and I am 100% healthy. In addition I work out 2 - 3 times a week, and have been seeing a therapist that has been helping me cope with the anxiety associated with it.    I know I cannot change 11 years worth of damage overnight. But I wanted to know if I am damaged for life??? Is there something that I can do to restore my libido and erection?? How long will it take to get back to normal and have my brain function as it is supposed too? I have been taken cialis every now and that has helped with the mental portiona,  but I do not want to be dependent. Any advice would be helpful.\n\n",

    "title": "Sex Life After Marijuana",
    "content": "antman0176:  First of all, congratulations!!!!  I am always happy to hear about people who are able to quit using substances.  Smoking tobacco is not the only kind of smoking that damages tissues.  I know that a lot of young people rationalize smoking marijuana by the false belief that marijuana is harmless.  As you have found out, it isn't harmless.  Okay, no more preaching.  There is a complex mixture of physical and psychological processes at work here.  Smoking marijuana and tobacco damage blood vessels and nerves, making the very sensitive erotic zones less sensitive and therefore, less easily aroused.  The arousal is not as easy to maintain as before this damage occurred.  The psychological processes themselves are complex.  First, you have the propensity of chronic marijuana use to cause depression and anxiety.  Both of these conditions are libido- and erection-killers in and of themselves.  Add into that the new anxiety and/or depression about the erectile dysfunction you are having, and the libido-killer just became stronger.  The human brain is a wonderful thing and a terrible thing at the same time.  On one hand, in the absence of severe mental illness, our brains are well-trained to keep us the least unhappy that we can be.  On the other hand, while the brain is so lovingly protecting us, a psychological problem can be created, de novo, without any conscious awareness at all.  When a man begins to have problems with erectile dysfunction for whatever reason, he may begin to feel as though he didn't particularly feel like, or even want to have, sex.  The wonderful-awful brain then begins to convince you that your problem poses no challenges for you at all--the performance wasn't there because you didn't want it to be there, or, maybe you are more inclined to think something such as, \"she/he was a dog anyway--I should probably be glad things didn't work right.\"  Do you see how easily this could become a vicious cycle?  Back to your other questions, though:  is this a permanent problem?  The simple answer is that we don't know for sure.  Theoretically, if Cialis or the other medications for ED can fix the problem, you have a chance for recovery and resolution of physical symptoms.  Success and even partial success of the medication can then help your libido by providing positive reinforcement for success, no matter what the obstacles are--physicl and/or mental.  Good luck to you!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Most penile papules do not have a serious cause, but some are infectious and may lead to more serious conditions.   They could be anything from sexually transmitted diseases such as Molluscum contagiousum to warts. Other conditions are not sexually transmitted, eg, an infected sweat gland or hair follicle, pearly penile papules, Fordyce spots, psoriasis or an early penile cancer.  Regarding your second question about penile size, a flaccid penis is normally at least 1.6 inches long, or 2.7 inches when stretched.[1] Erect penis size normally varies between 4 to 8 inches.  The third question is about a condition known as premature ejaculation. Premature ejaculation is best defined as persistent or recurrent ejaculation with minimal stimulation before, on or shortly after penetration, and before the sexual partner wishes it.   Premature ejaculation is thought to be the most common form of male sexual dysfunction, with an estimated prevalence of up to 40 percent.[2]  It is believed to be a psychological problem and does not represent any known organic disease involving the male reproductive tract or any known lesions in the brain or nervous system. Anxiety may play an important role especially in secondary premature ejaculation.  Treatment of ejaculatory dysfunction centers on relationship counseling, behavioral therapy and pharmacologic interventions.   Relationship counseling is of paramount importance because premature ejaculation can create discord and increase the tension surrounding sexual intercourse. An important objective is to relieve any form of performance anxiety on the male.  Behavioral therapy has been considered the gold standard of treatment, with reported success rates ranging from 60 to 95 percent.[2] Techniques include the Seman's pause maneuver, the Masters and Johnson pause-squeeze technique and the Kaplan stop-start method.   The methods can be self-applied, although with suboptimal outcomes; hence, involvement of the sexual partner is essential. Short-term gains can be substantial, but long-term outcomes are less favorable and depend on continued partner involvement.[2]  Because of the limitations of behavioral therapy, pharmacologic interventions are often used to treat premature ejaculation. Anorgasmia and delayed ejaculatory response are well-known side effects of tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (including drugs such as Zoloft).    Studies have shown that these drugs modify the ejaculatory response in men with premature ejaculation.[2,3] In one of these studies,[3] clomipramine (in a dosage of 50 mg per day) and sertraline (in a dosage of 100 mg per day) were found to increase ejaculatory latency from 46 seconds to 5.7 and 4.2 minutes, respectively. Sexual satisfaction was higher with clomipramine, but sertraline was better tolerated and had a better safety profile.  Given the limitations of the internet as a diagnostic tool, you are advised to seek a direct clinical examination to reach the proper diagnosis.  Consultation with a sex therapist, psychologist, or psychiatrist may prove helpful in order to explore psychological issues and to implement behavioral techniques (eg, squeeze-pause).

    "content": "I am a 20 yr old male. I generally have a tendency to think i am losing my sexual desire or never having felt it as strongly as others do.  1)Although most of my friends masturbate I have never done it. I occasionally do have wet dreams.  Although erection does happen and I like holding and rubbing it against the bed (if that qualifies as masturbation)  I have never achieved or felt the climax  i.e. ejaculation (except maybe in my dreams!!), neither have i felt the desire to go uptil that point. Even after having my penis erected for long by fantasizing about someone i generally go and take a pee instead.   2)The other thing that bothers me is earlier i used to have a lot of fantasies and had my penis erected every night(although done nothing with it!!). These days the fantasizing has reduced.  I also don't get stimulated by porn. However recently a girl came close and I did get it erected. So then I wonder y can't porn stimulate me.   3) This is one more thing. Does too much working, studying or practising concentration techniques, doing yoga, getting devotional about god and stuff make you lose your sexual desire?? This worry acts as a major hindrance because I really hold myself back in following my dreams towards success as I think I will lose completly any sexual desire that I have if I concentrate on studies or other things.  Is something wrong with me??? Please help me if anyone understands my nature of problem and do answer each of my query... Thanks, Shankar\n\n",

Physical causes include drug abuse, alcoholism, some medications such as some antidepressants, endocrine problems, obesity, chronic diseases such as renal failure, diabetes and liver failure.   On the other hand depression, anxiety, stress and overwork in addition to marital or relationship problems can all affect libido psychologically.  You need an evaluation to make sure you do not have any of the physical causes, including hormonal problems. If that is the case then psychological causes including overwork should be considered.  Many people work hard and achieve academic success without it affecting their sex drive.   Some people have strong religious, cultural or moral objections to the practice. For those who hold these values, choosing not to masturbate is normal, too. There is nothing weird, odd, or unhealthy about this choice.  Please call on your doctor for an appointment.  Best regards,\n\n",

Causes of high semen volume include: - prolonged periods of abstinence - varicocele  However the total count should be higher than 40 millions/ml.  Some medications, alchol, smoking , unhealthy diet may affect sperm counts.   Other tests to be investigated include: testosterone, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), or prolactin.  Follow up with your doctor is essential. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  The  frequency of a normal sexual activity is a very difficult question to be answered. There is a wide normal range for the  frequency of intercourse.  What is to be considered is the  pattern of sexual activity and the fact that each partner is comfortable with his sexual relationship.  If the two partners reach a satisfaction feeling after sexual activity, then there is a healthy relationship.   Do not forget that it is a relation that needs both partners to be relaxed, to be stimulated physically and mentally  to be aroused and able to focus in their relation. Any thing that would affect these factors would interfere with their sexual relation.  If you think that other than the change in the frequency of your sexual activity, there are no other changes , then you may try to better arrange your working schedules to have more time coinciding with his resting  hours.  Best regards.\n\n",

Now i believe that this defect is either congenital or, which might be more likely, originating from a surgery i had when i was about seven years old. The surgery i had was  to correct my tight foreskin, and i suppose its possible the doctor screwed up during surgery, thus injuring my penis.   At 20 years old i'm still a virgin because i am afraid this condition will make it impossible or at least very difficult to have intercourse. What do you think of my situation? And what should i do?

    "content": "Hello,  You may have a condition known as Peyronie's disease. Peyronie's disease is an abnormal curve or bend in the penis during an erection.   Although the cause of Peyronie's disease is not known. It is thought that microvascular injury plays an important role in the pathology of this disease. Repeated injury to the small vessels leads to microscopic bleeding which leads to coagulation and fibrin deposition. Repeated fibrin deposition ultimately leads to a plaque formation. This usually occurs near the midline of the shaft.  Symptoms of Peyronie's disease include painful erection, penile curvature to varying degrees and only during erection and a fibrotic plaque greater than 1.5cm is usually felt in the midline either on the front or the back of the shaft. The plaque is sometimes felt in the flaccid penis as well. Some cases complain of an hourglass deformity with flaccidity of the distal penis.  Please have your doctor look at it. He would be able to properly assess your condition and advise you on the best therapeutic options.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Hello there. :) Recently, my boyfriend (who is 24) has developed a lump about the size of a large marble on the left side of his penis at the base near his testicles. We have been in a long-tern exclusive relationship, we have unprotected sex, and both of us have recently checked clean for STDs.  The lump itself is sort of squishy, and the skin around it is not inflamed, itchy, or anything of the sort. Normal skin, with this lump just sort of \"there\". He can press on it with only mild pain, but it can't be freely moved around, it's pretty rooted to where it is. The pain extends into the groin area, up to around his kidneys and lower back. It's been keeping him from sleeping, it gets so bad. He has no pain in his testicles at all. His semen seems to smell much stronger than usual, as well.  We were thinking this could possibly be a kidney stone that's gotten stuck, but we aren't sure.  He's had a few ingrown hairs on his testicles, and had one recently that's just now starting to go away. Could this be a lymph node? Are there even lymph nodes in the penis? Any help would be greatly appreciated, he doesn't currently have medical insurance so we're left to our own devices. Thank you!\n\n",

Infection of sweat glands or hair follicles present mainly ventral surface of the shaft of the penis and inguinal region. They are yellow/black or red nodules on the hair shafts in the inguinal region. Nodules are often on the scrotum and occasionally on the base of the shaft of the penis. They may contain pus in them. The hallmark is that they will have a hair arising from them that reveals their true nature.  If he developed this condition after you were evaluated for STDs then he should be re-evaluated just in case.   Molluscum contagiosum (an STD) forms dome-shaped papules, often with a central depression or plug. The hallmark of central umbilication appears in a quarter of the lesions. These papules can have a pedunculated gross appearance, and milky-white curd like material can be squeezed from the central umbilication.  Another type of STD are warts which present as skin-colored, pink or brown, papillary cauliflower-like lesions with a moist surface. Flat lesions can also occur.  Best regards,\n\n",

Squeezing or prodding produces a yellow-white puss, and usually inflames the blemish. I have had this bump for just over a week now and it is beginning to cause some worry. I recently had a full STD test, including visual examination by a doctor, about 2 weeks ago, just before this bump occured.

    "content": "Hello,  Breaks in the skin of the penis (cracked fissures) commonly result from irritation as a result of vigorous sexual activity or if there is not enough lubrication.   Skin cracks can also result from several skin disorders.  Balanitis is an inflammation of the glans penis which usually results from an infection but can also be predisposed to by irritation. Usually the inflammation presents as distinct red spots or dots, red plaques and may affect the entire head of the penis/prepuce. At times the irritation can be so great as to include small breaks in the surface of the skin (fissures). These open wounds are often very sensitive to touch, particularly when soaps or detergents come into contact with affected skin.  Phimosis, a condition in which the patient is unable to retract the inflammed foreskin can be associated with edema and cracked fissures.  A skin disease known as lichen sclerosus et atrophicus (LSA) can also lead to cracked fissures in the penile skin. A special variant of this disorder on the penis known as balanitis xerotica obliterans (BXO) is localized to the glans penis and foreskin and presents as white scarlike areas. Not only painful at times, it may result in an inability to retract the foreskin (phimosis) and sometimes leads to meatal stenosis. Fissures, erosions, and ulcers result in secondary bacterial infection, and sexual intercourse becomes impossible because of pain induced by erections.   Should the problem persist, you should consult a dermatologist that has experience in these conditions.\n\n",

    "content": "im a 17yr old male and recently posted about a red swelling on the shaft of my penis.  well that was 4 days ago. today i have noticed a swollen looking lump which covers pretty much covers up a whole line of the top left of my penis.  it is very easily noticed and you can easily see that it lumps out, but it isnt hard its just soft skin which makes it appear swollen, however, there is no pain in the lump.  the only pain comes from the base of my shaft just below the pubic region which hurts when any pulling force occurs.  im just wondering, if i may have an infection. a littleswelling from hard sex which has jus lasted abit longer than expected, or whether the lump signifies a more serious problem. i.e cancer as i have no knowledge on how to tell cancerous lumps from any other lump. please help asap. thanks for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  The causes of this swelling may include :  - Inflammation  of the Hair follicles and sebaceous (sweat) glands.  Hair follicles and sebaceous (sweat) glands are normally found on the penile shaft, particularly on the ventral surface (underside). They may be infected, trichomycosis in the case of sweat glands and folliculitis in the case of hair follicles.   They may be visible as small nodules or might only be felt as small lumps in the skin. They are yellow/black or red nodules on the hair shafts in the inguinal region. Nodules are often on the scrotum and occasionally on the base of the shaft of the penis. They may contain pus in them.   -  Dermatitis  which is referred to different types of skin rashes that are caused by infections, allergies, and irritants.  There are many causes for contact dermatitis some involve irritants such as soaps, certain creams and some may be due to allergy.  Direct clinical examination is essential. Keep us updated, Best regards.   The hallmark is that they will have a hair arising from them that reveals their true nature. These lesions can be associated with erythema and itching. Superinfection with other dermatophytes has been noted.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Failure to ejaculate generally may occur as a result of (pelvic) nerve disease or damage. Nerve damage may result in retrograde ejaculate.  After orgasm, nerves that supply the bladder neck make them close to allow the semen to come out.   The most common causes of nerve damage include diabetes and a spinal chord injury.   Traumatic damage to the pelvic nerves e.g. after surgery is also very common, Did your husband undergo any surgical intervention in the pelvis? Or had extensive damage to pelvis? This could be the reason.  Try to reassure him since psychogenic causes are also common in such situations.  I advise you to inform his doctor about this issue.  Hope you find this information useful. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "hey, i am a 17 year old male and have a girlfriend who i have been seeing for close to year now.  only the other day we was having sexual intercourse and it got abit rough and hard. at first i felt no pain what so ever (as far as i can remember anyway) and just carried on with what i was doing.  around 2 hours later i went home and felt a pain on the shaft of my penis, i had a look and i had a patch of red skin which looked really irritated which lead from the base of my shaft just before my pubic region up to about half way up my shaft. when i touched it it was really quite sore and then after i had been inspecting it, it still remained sore. i thought that maybe it had been because i had been having abit of a prod at it so i just left it and thought i should wait tttill he morning and see if it had gone down.  the next day i still had a pain there so i looked again and this time it had gotten abit redder and had started swelling at the base of my shaft, although the pain was basically the same as the night before (if not less).  that leads me to tonight where i have just recently discovered some thin red markings running horizontally along the swelling.  i am having no problems getting erections and i can ejacualte normally. although whilst masterbating i had to stick to the head of the penis through pain on the shaft and also is irritating when drying off after i urinate.  do u have any idea what this could be? could it be a sign of an infection or is it just a common irritation or friction burn from hard sex? i hope for a reply soon as i am the highly paranoid type of guy and its really frustrating and scaring me.  thank you kindly.\n\n",

When erect, the penis, is more easily damaged, with one review noting that 50% of penile injuries occurred during sexual intercourse, while an additional 21% were characterized as sequelae of other erotic practices.  The fact that its swollen does suggest that it may have also become infected.  That said and given the limitations of the internet as a diagnostic tool, you are always advised to seek a direct clinical examination to reach the proper diagnosis.\n\n",

Over the course of 3 weeks, we had sexual relations at least 3 times a day. On 3 occassions, my penis was swollen, head and shaft and a film of an unknow type covered the penis. For a day or two the siliva type liquid covered my penis, in great amounts. The penis is sensitive to touch. in addition, after a few days, the \"film\" dried and flaked off like a sun burn. Can you tell me, is this just over use of the penis, like a burn or something? And how do I in the future help this to not happen? We used gels a few times, but, it happened even with that us. Will this hurt my penis? Thanks\n\n",

It causes severe irritation in most of cases.   It occurs also after infections or local  skin injury from chemicals or friction. There are a number of effective treatments available, such as steroid creams. It is not infectious by itself.

    "title": "Little Discharge",
    "content": "I am really worried about a condition that I am having during urination. Starting about 9 months ago, after I finish urinating, I do not just zip up and go like I used to. I don\u2019t feel like I am finished, quickly, and I stand there as if I am trying to push the last drop out of my bladder. Sometimes I don\u2019t stop until I feel like I had every drop out, and by the time I am done, about ten minutes has passed and I am sweating as if I did pushups.   One day (a few months ago) I swiped the tip of my penis after I was done and noticed a little white stuff that looked like semen (but I don\u2019t think it is) on my fingers; didn\u2019t think much of it at the time, but it started to happen again and again. I have noticed that this happens if I go without sex (or masturbation because I haven\u2019t had sex for a while now) for more than three days. Until recently, I had a very active sex life, and ejaculation occurred more or less every day. But my current job keeps me busy, so I sometimes go long even without thinking about sex. I have no STD or other diseases.   My question is: - Is it normal if some semen comes out while urinating if you go without sex for an extended period of time, or is it the bad habit that I have developed, or some kind of disorder (especially prostate) that led me to this condition?   Thanks.\n\n",

Straining to void, painful micturition can result on attempting to overcome a partial obstruction.  In males this usually results from disorders of the prostate. Other causes can be bladder tumors or bladder stones, tumors of the prostate, and tumors or other structures around the bladder neck or urethra. It can also be a result of strictures in any part of the urinary tract.  The fact that you are straining is cause for concern. You haven't mentioned your age, but I would recommend you tell your doctor about your condition.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Welcome to our forums brat_princess!  Orgasmic dysfunction is a term used that encompasses anorgasmia and delayed ejaculation. These are related disorders. Anorgasmia is defined as the inability to reach orgasm during sexual intercourse. This is a much more common condition in females than in males.  Psychological causes account for almost 90 per cent of anorgasmia. This includes performance anxiety as well as work stress. Other causes may include childhood or adult sexual abuse or rape. Marital problems, boredom within a relationship (monotonous sex life).   Sedatives as well as alcohol are known to impair the orgasmic response.  Chronic illness and pain affect orgasmic response.   Neurological diseases such as spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis cause anorgasmia.   Hormone conditions and diabetes are also known to impair orgasm.  Age is a contributing factor either through a reduced sexual drive or anxiety and depression.\n\n",

    "content": "I am actually posting this for my fiance. For the past two weeks he's been on 3 different medications for an enlarged/infected prostate. He's not good at talking to the doctor about his male stuff particularly bc he's 28 and feels that he shouldn't have had \"the finger up the butt\" exam. All three meds they put him on he was allergic too, the first contained sulfur which caused him to violently vomit for 4 hrs or more. The second just made his whole body ache and he felt like he had something else wrong with him that just his male problems. The last one cause his chest to ache and he couldn't take a full breath in without it hurting (this was Levaquin). Now for about 4-5 days he's been feeling a sense of depression and loss of interest in sex. He says he wants it he just can't bring himself up to it...basically he has to force it (I think he feels like he's neglecting my needs if he doesn' t but I assured him that's not the case and that he needed to tell the doctor). Now he just doesn't want to talk to the doctor anymore bc we don't have insurance and he can't afford a major medical bill plus the cost of prescriptions. He also has hypoglycemia and is not taking any current meds in the past 2 days. On his low sex drive....I was reading an article that mentioned Hypogonadism, could all those meds have put him in that state?? If so will we ever be able to have children? Thank you so much, I appreciate all answers.  ~Beckie~\n\n",

I haven't started my \"traditional family growth spurt\" that always comes around the eighteenth/seventeenth years of life.  It is very very hard for me, i don't feel like i can take much more of this.  I'm a legal adult but you'd never know it.  I stand about 5'7'' and 130 lbs.  Do i need to seek help, and press my doctor about growth hormones?  when i asked him about way to \"boost my growth\" he answered with i only need to lift weights and eat more protein.  I'm an athletic guy, that's not my biggest concern.  I have this feeling my testicular growth will not occur if i do not do something about it, but it's so awkward.  What should i do?

    "title": "Re: Varicocele",
    "content": "Hello to all,  This post is a follow up to my previous post about my testicular pain.  To confirm my suspicions, an ultrasound helped to diagnose bilateral varicoceles. I no longer have pain, but both testicles continue to be lower than before the testicular pain began.   I have researched studies that have analyzed effectivness of surgery and other treatment options for this condition.  My question to you is, being a 22 y/o who would definitely like to have kids one day, can varicoceles cause impotence?  Should I be considering invasive treatment options other than the conservative approach that the practioner has suggested?  If I do have the varicoceles removed what is to say that the veins that have picked up the collateral circulation will not end up with a varicocle as well?  Most importantly, let's get down to the root cause...why do varicocles happen?  Is this a circulatory problem that is a clue to a greater problem in my body.  This is truly concerning to me, and I appreciate any feedback.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  A varicocele is a dilatation of the veins within the scrotum  15-20% of the normal fertile males may have Varicoceles  while  it may be found in 40% of infertile males The mechanism by which varicocele induce infertility and (sperms are impaired)is not known but some researchers relate that to impaired testicular thermoregulation.  The causes of varicoceles are not known, but probably due to abnormal valves inside  the veins that impair the normal blood flow.  Varicoceles are commonly seen on the left side than in the right due to different  anatomic factors.  Important consideration regarding varicoceles in adolescents are: - the varicocele is a progressive lesion - early repair of the varicocele prevents the development of infertility.  Surgery is the primary form of treatment for varicoceles.However, not all varicoceles need surgical correction.  Indications for surgical correction include: To alleviate significant testicular discomfort not responsive to symptomatic treatment. Reducing testicular atrophy (with volume of <20 mL, length of <4 cm). Fear the possible contribution to testicular damage and infertility. Clinical picture and physical examination are essential to determine the proper management approach.  Follow up with your doctor is essential. Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I was wondering if anyone had any ideas on what my problem could be. I have a doctor''s appointment set up in two weeks, earliest I could get for a non-emergency, but it is driving me nuts wondering what this mass/lump is at this point. Any ideas would be appreciated. I am 24 and have no sexual history.  Around last summer or so it first appreared. I woke up and had a lump/mass right under the skin, around the location of my scar from being circumcised as a child. The lump was a little bigger than a tic tac and popped up making a large indentation from underneath the skin. I left it alone for a while and it eventually got much smaller The problem is that it has never gone away, so I finally gave in and made an appointment last week.   The mass itself is movable up to 1-2 cms in any direction. It also seems to change sizes on it's own. It has never gotten to the same size it was when it first appeared however. I would say it has lost 1/2 of it's size since it first appeared. It does not appear to be going away any further though. When my skin is clear enough, or the mass is prominant enough to view, it looks like it is white, or clear. I do not think it is a vein as it has no color? It also seems to get more prominant the more I poke at it. It also seems to be at it's largest size when I wake up in the morning.   Once again, thanks for any ideas anyone can provide.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear jma1111,  There is no replacement for direct clinical examination, But It sounds like Pearly penile papules:   These small papules are best described as embryological remnants. As you said they are usually located around the circumference of the crown of the glans penis. It can be a single lesion but usually They are multiple in number and small (about 1-3mm).  They usually appear as yellow-white, domelike papules arranged in a row of multiple-grouped lesions along the corona and sulcus of the glans in adolescent males. That is the typical presentation, but by no means the only one.  They typically develop in men aged 20 to 40, and around 10 per cent of all men are affected. Presentation may occur in males in their second to fifth decades. Rare cases in children as young as 11 years have been reported. They may be mistaken for warts, are not infectious (not an STD), and not related to personal hygiene.   They require no treatment. Some patients however, may request therapy to alleviate anxiety or for aesthetic reasons. Ablation using carbon dioxide laser, electrodesiccation with curettage, and excisional surgery reportedly have successfully eliminated lesions. Mixed results have been noted with cryotherapy.  I advised you  to seek a direct clinical examination to reach the proper diagnosis. Only by complete history and physical examination, the correct diagnosis can be reached.   Hope you find this information useful. Best regards,\n\n",

One of my lymph nodes is swollen now. 2 days ago it was not. Now the sides my scrotum (not the testicles-- perhaps the vas deferens?) are in pain, which is increasing by the day. I was planning to go to the doctor this weekend but I need to know if it's something more serious that would warrant going tomorrow or even tonight. The soreness is uncomfortable and is preventing me from sleeping tonight. Last night it was not as bad. Could this be some sort of infection?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  It is probably a lymph node it occurs in a lymph node region, however this must be confirmed by your physician The inguinal lymph nodes are situated in the crease between the leg and pelvis (more on the outside of that crease, ie, laterally).   They drain the penis, scrotum, vulva, vagina, perineum, gluteal region, lower abdominal wall, lower anal canal.   Common causes of enlargement include infections of the leg or foot, STDs (eg, herpes simplex virus, gonococcal infection, syphilis, chancroid, granuloma inguinale, lymphogranuloma venereum), lymphoma, pelvic malignancy, bubonic plague.  Nodes are generally considered to be normal if they are up to 1  cm in diameter; however, some authors suggest that inguinal  nodes larger than 1.5 cm should be considered abnormal If it is painful or tender this indicate infection or inflammation.   The pain you feel means that there is irritation of the peritoneum due to infection or inflammation in the genital organ.  You have to seek medical advise as soon as possible, It sounds to be of infectious cause. Only by complete history and physical examination, the correct diagnosis can be reached.

    "content": "Hi Flaemt,  Varicocele's much of the time are asymptomatic (causing no symptoms). However, when symptoms do arise there may be a feeling of heaviness and ache in the testicles. There may also be a feeling of a \"bag of worms\", so to speak. Mild symptoms may be alleviated by snug fitting undershorts or scrotal support. One of the complications of a varicocele aside from the obvious pain is a problem with fertility because the blood flow isn't properly cooled and may cause damage to sperm. When symptoms become more than mild and there are issues regarding fertility, varicoceles can be surgically treated. Diagnostics (accurate and painless) that identify if this condition is present is Ultrasonography. I would suggest that you notify your physician that the discomfort and other symptoms remain present and the cycle of Antibiotic therapy had no effect. A re-evaluation by your PCP may be recommended or referral to a Urologist to identify if any underlying abnormality is present.  Sincerely,  Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Doc1:  Before answering the question that you asked, let me address some that you did not.  Once a diagnosis of low testosterone has been made, it is very important to figure out why it has occurred.  I always check prolactin (a hormone produced by the pituitary gland), because prolactin secreting tumors (not cancers!) are very common, and because they may have no apparent effects, other than low testosterone or poor sexual functioning until they become quite large.  I also always do measurements of iron, to screen for a condition called \"hemachromatosis,\" which is just a form of iron poisoning (usually at least partially attributable to an abnormal gene) that can eventually cause serious damage throughout your body.  Both of these conditons are common and easily treated.  At your age, I would also consider measuring LH and FSH, which are pituitary hormones that control production of testosterone and sperm by the testes.  \"Normal\" LH and FSH levels with low testosterone is not \"normal,\" and warrants further investigation of the pituitary gland.  However, the fact that your testes shrank dramatically with testosterone therapy tells me that the pituitary was probably telling the testes to make testosterone and sperm.  Supplying testosterone by a shot apparently reduced the signal from the pituitary gland, so that the cells in the testes shrank, and so did your testes.  The fact that your testes size decreased so noticeably does raise some reservations about your diagnosis.  In younger men, there is a variation testosterone levels, with the levels declining through the day from their early morning peaks.  After about age forty, this is usually not significant, but you are right at that boundary.  Illness and caloric restriction (like a weight-loss diet) also tend to reduce the testosterone levels.  If there is any question about the diagnosis, I suggest stopping the testosterone for two-to-three months and repeating the tests.  Unless you want to father children, the reduction in sperm production that goes with shrinking testes is not important,.  In my opinion, the benefits of replacing testosterone in a man who does not have enough far outweigh the cosmetic disadvantage of smaller testes, especially since you are likely to be the only one who ever notices.  There is a lot of variability in \"normal\" size, and few people check their partners with orchiometers (which are beads used for estimating testes sizes).  If you still want to father children, you definitely need a more complete workup, and a specialist may consider treatment with chorionic gonadotropins (which act like LH and FSH from the pituitary gland).  If the problem is with your pituitary gland, instead of your testes, you could use chorionic gonadotropins anyway, if the shrinkage is too troublesome to you, but the expense would be phenomenal.  I think that there are far better ways of replacing testosterone than giving yourself injections once a week (and the ONLY excuse for the obsolete practice of giving monthly shots is that physicians make money when they give you the shots you could give yourself, but no one would keep coming in for a shot every week!).  Endocrinology is like Goldie Locks and the Three Bears, and testosterone injections are likely to have you waving at Baby Bear in passing, as you bounce between Pappa Bear and Mamma Bear!  Nonetheless, if you truly had a testosterone deficiency, I would advise against stopping the injections without some other form of replacement therapy.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Premature ejaculation is best defined as persistent or recurrent ejaculation with minimal stimulation before, on or shortly after penetration, and before the sexual partner wishes it.   Premature ejaculation is thought to be the most common form of male sexual dysfunction, with an estimated prevalence of up to 40 percent.[1]  It is believed to be a psychological problem and does not represent any known organic disease involving the male reproductive tract or any known lesions in the brain or nervous system. Anxiety may play an important role especially in secondary premature ejaculation.  So the answer to your question is yes worrying (anxiety) does affect how long you can maintain your erection.

    "content": "Hi Flaemt, Varicocele's much of the time are asymptomatic (causing no symptoms). However, when symptoms do arise there may be a feeling of heaviness and ache in the testicles. There may also be a feeling of a \"bag of worms\", so to speak.  Mild symptoms may be alleviated by snug fitting undershorts or scrotal support. One of the complications of a varicocele aside from the obvious pain is a problem with fertility because the blood flow isn't properly cooled and may cause damage to sperm. When symptoms become more than mild and there are issues regarding fertility, varicoceles can be surgically treated. Diagnostics (accurate and painless) that identify if this condition is present is Ultrasonography. I would suggest that you notify your physician that the discomfort and other symptoms remain present and the cycle of antibiotic therapy had no effect. A re-evaluation by your PCP may be recommended or referral to a Urologist to identify if any underlying abnormality is present. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Breaks in the skin of the penis (cracked fissures) commonly result from irritation as a result of vigorous sexual activity or if there is not enough lubrication.   Skin cracks can also result from several skin disorders.  Balanitis is an inflammation of the glans penis which usually results from an infection but can also be predisposed to by irritation. Usually the inflammation presents as distinct red spots or dots, red plaques and may affect the entire head of the penis/prepuce. At times the irritation can be so great as to include small breaks in the surface of the skin (fissures). These open wounds are often very sensitive to touch, particularly when soaps or detergents come into contact with affected skin.  Phimosis, a condition in which the patient is unable to retract the inflammed foreskin can be associated with edema and cracked fissures.  A skin disease known as lichen sclerosus et atrophicus (LSA) can also lead to cracked fissures in the penile skin. A special variant of this disorder on the penis known as balanitis xerotica obliterans (BXO) is localized to the glans penis and foreskin and presents as white scarlike areas. Not only painful at times, it may result in an inability to retract the foreskin (phimosis) and sometimes leads to meatal stenosis. Fissures, erosions, and ulcers result in secondary bacterial infection, and sexual intercourse becomes impossible because of pain induced by erections.   Should the problem persist, you should consult a dermatologist that has experience in these conditions.\n\n",

So to answer your question, yes it could be referred pain but if it hasn't cured by now then you should definitely get a second opinion.  Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "My problem is.... An irritation on my penis that has lingered off and on for around a month, but more so now than ever. It is almost like a blister from dry rubbing too much while  my gf was giving me hand, but I wouldn't think it would last this long. It has scabbed over a couple of times, but it almost didn't seem like a normal scab, kind of flakey. I sweat a lot and work outside and I don't think that my situation is giving my skin the chance to heal as it needs to. On top of that, the fact that the penis erects, then the majority of the time it is contracted... that kind of seems to me that it will never heal. If I masterbate it burns and is really uncomfortable. It got better this past week a good bit, but even before I woke up this morning when I was erect and I must have touched or rubbed while sleeping, I got the burning sensation as if I materbated (which I've only done 2 time since this whole thing started).  The situation #1.....  I have never had intercourse but been as close as possible by thrusting between the legs near the top of the legs meet the femail genitalia, where there is some natural lube. Is it possible to get an STD from that even if my gf doesn't have any STD and if intercourse didn't take place? I've read a lot of STD problems and almost all of them talk about having white bumps or white irritation of some sort, but I have Not experienced that.  The situation #2.... Could this just be a blister from dry masterbation that has gotten worse because of not having much of an opportunity to be in a good environment to heal properly?  This irritation is at the top of the shaft and just below the head. I've been cleaning and treating it with a q-tip of Hydrogen Peroxide to keep bacteria out and to keep it clean, along with neosporin. When I'm hope, since I live alone I've been wearing no shorts and trying to keep that area of my body dry.  I did read on another post where a doctor said in a similar situation to not put any cream on it except for what a doctor perscribes, is this true even with Neosporin?  I'm really not wanting to go to the doctor about this but I will if this is what is recomended. I am really worried about this, I've never had anything like this before... never any penis problems, especially ones that are painful and embarassing.   Any suggestions out there???\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Lack of sex drive (lack of libido) is extremely common in women \u2013 but quite rare in men. Even men with erectile dysfunction (ED) usually have a perfectly normal sex drive.  The causes can be either physical or psychological.  The possible physical causes include:  1. Alcoholism which commonly causes lack of libido in addition to abuse of drugs, such as cocaine.  2. Some medications are known to decrease libido e.g. finasteride, a tablet used for prostate problems as well as some antidepressants.  3. Obesity is a common cause.  4. Endocrine causes include hyperprolactinaemia and  low testosterone levels. These are rather rare causes.  5. Chronic diseases, such as diabetes, renal failure or liver failure.  6. Anaemia is an unusual cause.  Psychological causes  Psychological causes of male level of desire include:  1. Depression in addition to anxiety, stress and overwork.  2. Serious relationship problems with the wife/partner.  All the above causes of lack of libido can respond well to therapy.  The most difficult to treat are those that involve psychological and marital problems.  He certainly needs an evaluation by a specialist.  Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  The most common problems associated with undescended testicles are testicular neoplasm, subfertility, testicular torsion and inguinal hernia.  The incidence of testicular cancer among men with an undescended testicle is approximately one in 1,000 to one in 2,500.[1] Although significantly higher than the risk among the general population (1:100,000), this level of risk does not warrant radical therapy, such as removal of all intra-abdominal testes.  Treatment for the undescended testis is recommended as early as six months of age and should be completed before age two.  Although there is no proof that orchiopexy reduces the risk of testicular cancer, it is performed to ease detection through testicular self-examination.  Men who have had an undescended testicle have lower sperm counts, poorer quality sperm and lower fertility rates than men whose testicles descended normally.   The likelihood of subfertility increases with bilateral involvement and increasing age at the time of orchiopexy.   Impaired spermatogenesis may be partially caused by underlying genetic abnormalities that can increase the risk of germ cell neoplasia. For this reason, impairment may not be completely reversible through surgical intervention.  Unlike the risk of testicular cancer, however, there seems to be an advantage to early orchiopexy for protection of fertility. For this reason, treatment of the undescended testicle is recommended as early as six months of age and should be completed before age two.  Best regards.  References ======= 1.

    "content": "Hello,  Penile cancer is very rare in Western countries, representing no more than 0.3% of male malignancies. It is more common in other areas of the world.  HPV-16 has been implicated in the development of penile cancer as well as the number of sexual partners. The use of tobacco products is an independent prognostic factor.  Penile cancer is strongly associated with phimosis and poor local hygiene. Neonatal circumcision virtually illiminates the occurance of penile cancer. On the other hand it is certain that adult circumcision does not provide protection against penile cancer.  Your best strategies for prevention would be the illimination of tobacco use and maintenance of good hygiene.  Best regrds.\n\n",

    "content": "When i was 16 i was with a girl and i had an erection, she jumped on top of me, landing squarely on my penis, squishing it between her wieght and my leg.  About 15 minutes later i noticed a large lump right underneath of the head of my penis.  I immediatly went to see a doctor in the emergency room, and he said that the swelling would go down if i iced my penis and took some ibuprofen.  I did that and the swelling went down, but after that i coudnt get a normal erection.  So i continued about my life and about 6 months later i could get normal erections once again.  But everytime i was with a girl and she would lay on top of me and put her weight on my groin area the swelling would reoccure, and this problem is continuing.  But recently i was playing soccer and caught a knee right on the head of my penis.  And now I can get an erection but it will only stay up for about 5 seconds before it starts going down, and i do not get erections in the morning any more....Please Help im scared to death that i will never have a normaly funtioning penis again. Some help and advice on the reoccuring swelling and the erectile disfuntion would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Regarding the recurring swelling, you should have it looked at keeping in mind that the erect penis is more prone to injury than the flaccid one. Indeed one type of injury is sometimes referred to as 'fractured penis', even though there obviously is no bone in the penis.  Regarding your erectile dysfunction you need to be properly assessed.   A person complaining from erectile dysfunction needs to be assessed for the presence of endocrine disturbances, chronic diseases, cardiovascular disease, neurological disease and medications that cause ED all need to be excluded. Cigarette smoking and chronic alcoholism are major contributing factors.   Caution needs to be exercised when making the diagnosis of psychogenic ED, as both organic and psychogenic factors may co-exist.   Psychologic issues such as depression, anxiety are associated with erectile dysfunction in young males and manifest with an abrupt onset. The onset of ED maybe associated with an emotional event. Also in psychogenic ED other sexual functions are normal. If a man regularly experiences a firm morning erection yet also has ED then it is much more likely that psychological factors contribute to his problem. Sometimes patients report that they have experienced similar episodes with spontaneous resolution.  Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "I am 41 years old circumcized male. For many years now, during intercourse I regularly get cuts right below the glans on my shaft on the left side. A few nights ago and after my wife and I have not had sex for a couple of weeks I got a major cut in the same spot, I have never had one this big before. During the intercourse I felt the pain but I did not want to stop for her sake and because I was enjoying myself way too much. Eventualy the pain became unbearable and I was forced to stop after she was satisfied. Please note that she was very wet during most of the intercourse. I washed and dried it that night and thought it would be like any other cut I have had before. In the morning however it was hurting more than ever, I examined it and discovered how big the wound was and it was scary. Its been 4 days now and it is healing nicely.  Should I have had it stitched? Is this a common problem in men? What should I do to avoid this from happening, it has made sex very stressful for me and for my wife due to fear of those injuries. I would appreciate some kind of help and advise. I am at a point where I am willing to have surgery if needs be, take medication or whatever I just want this problem permenantly fixed.\n\n",

I am not sure if this is an allergy to something because the skin seems to thin in that area then dries then cracks so when I go to have intercourse I end up getting cut.

    "content": "Hello,  Balanitis is inflammation of the glans penis commonly seen in uncircumscribed men. It usually causes redness and/or a blotchy rash on the glans, sometimes with a discharge. Balanitis involving the foreskin or prepuce is termed balanoposthitis.  Balanoposthitis may have any of multiple bacterial and fungal origins. Complex infections also have been well documented. These often are due to a poorly retractile foreskin and poor hygiene that leads to colonization and overgrowth.   Treatment centers on antibiotics / antifungal treatment, improved hygiene and treatment of eczema if present. Circumcision may be needed in some cases.   Given the limitations of the internet as a diagnostic tool, you are advised to seek a direct clinical examination to reach the proper diagnosis.\n\n",

It could be a constitutional thing (variation of normal). However, there are some conditions that are similar to your description (although more severe) that are due to autoimmune disorders. One such disorder is known as balanitis xerotica obliterans.  Please discuss these issues with your doctor.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Anorgasmia, also known as orgasmic disorder, orgasmic dysfunction or orgasmic inhibition is the inability to reach orgasm during sexual intercourse. This condition is much more common in women and is considered rare in men.  There are several known causes for this condition, however, psychological causes account for approximately  90 per cent of anorgasmia.   Sedatives as well as alcohol are known to impair the orgasmic response.  Chronic illness and pain can have a general debilitating effect over many aspects of life including sexuality.  Neurological diseases such as spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, hormone conditions and diabetes can be implicated.  It is possible that your use of vigorous masterbation was traumatic to your penis and can lead to pain and anxiety. Hair can normally be present on the shaft of the penis.  My advice to you is to give your penis time to heal and not to worry about it to much. Should the pain go away and your condition not improve then you should consult your doctor and preferably a sex therapist.  Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Balanitis is inflammation of the glans penis commonly seen in uncircumscribed men. It usually causes redness and/or a blotchy rash on the glans, sometimes with a discharge. Balanitis involving the foreskin or prepuce is termed balanoposthitis. The most common complication of balanitis is phimosis, or inability to retract the foreskin from the glans penis.  Balanoposthitis may have any of multiple bacterial and fungal origins. Complex infections also have been well documented. These often are due to a poorly retractile foreskin and poor hygiene that leads to colonization and overgrowth.   Anaerobic organisms have been associated with the diagnosis, although in most cases, the patient is treated empirically and a specific organismal etiology is not obtained. Candidal infection appears to be the most common cause of disease. The condition in older adult men often has other etiologies, including intertrigo; irritant dermatitides; and candidal, viral, or fungal infections.   Its possible in your case the trauma made you more vulnerable to infection. Its also possible that the infection was transmitted during sexual intercourse.  Treatment centers on antibiotics / antifungal treatment, improved hygiene and treatment of eczema if present. Circumcision may be needed in some cases.   Given the limitations of the internet as a diagnostic tool, you are advised to seek a direct clinical examination to reach the proper diagnosis.  Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Erectile dysfunction is defined as the persistent inability to attain or maintain penile erection sufficient for sexual intercourse.  An estimated 10 to 20 million American men have some degree of erectile dysfunction.  Causes of erectile dysfunction include aging, although it should be noted that one study revealed that up to one third of men above the age of 70 reported no erectile problems. Cigarette smoking and chronic alcoholism are known risk factors.   Chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, lipid disorders, liver or kidney failure and vascular disease are also known causes.   Endocrine diseases such as hypogonadism, hyperprolactinemia, hypo or hyperthyroidism all can cause erectile dysfunction.  Neurogenic causes of erectile dysfunction include spinal injury, herniated disc and multiple sclerosis.  Medications cause up to 25% of cases and include antidepressants among other drugs.  Trauma, surgery or injury to the pelvis, radiation to the pelvis, injury to the penis as well as other diseases of the penis (priapism, Peyronie's disease, anatomic abnormalities) can all lead to erectile problems.  Psychologic issues such as depression, anxiety are associated with erectile dysfunction in young males and manifest with an abrupt onset. The onset of ED maybe associated with an emotional event. also in psychogenic ED other sexual functions are normal.

    "content": "Hi guys,  I have some erection troubles that I'm sure are due to nerves. I get erections at night time and can masturbate normally. After some bad experiences, I spend my whole time during foreplay thinking \"get an erection, get an erection, get an erection\" which obviously leads to the exact opposite.  Do you think that using Cialis a few times would give me back the confidence that I'm missing? Would it let me know that I can perform and satisfy a woman? Would it then be easy to come off it and let nature take its course? I'd love to take it a few times, lose my nerves and then give up the drug. I'm slightly concerned that I may instead become dependant on drugs which are expensive and perhaps not healthy in the long term.  I know I can perfom, I just need to sort out my head. Has anyone else had any luck doing this?\n\n",

Many therapists would now also consider recommending at least a trial of physical treatment to supplement the benefits of psychotherapy.  The physician needs to identify the potentially reversible causes of ED such as certain medications.  The physician should check if there are any contraindications to the use of first-line treatment. A man who takes nitrate medicines for angina cannot use sildenafil (Viagra), tadalafil (Cialis) ) or vardenafil (Levitra) as the combination can lead to a dangerous drop in his blood pressure.  Apomorphine is effective in men who still have occasional erections.   On failure of treatment more invasive methods of therapy are available.  Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I am a 41 yr old gay man.  I have been celebant for almost 2 yrs now and have my doctor test me at least once a year for HIV and other STDs.  I have never tested positive for any.  I am currently under treatment for depression.  I have lost most of sex drive due to the depression and the medications that fight anxiety and depression.  I rarely even masturbate.  There is no excitement in it for me at this time.  Anyway - the current problem: I am circumsized, but still have some loose skin.  I've always thought of my penis as a turtle, because when I am not aroused, it retreats into the loose skin.  When I was sexually active, or at least masturbating, I never had a problem.  But since it's not getting used, gunk builds up in the loose skin.  I clean daily  in\u00a0the shower, but\u00a0it\u00a0continues to appear daily.  It's gotten to the point that the head of my penis and most of it when extended is very red, and very painful\u00a0to touch.  It is also painful in my underwear if I was to move the wrong way.  I have tried lubricating it with Neosporin, and at the beginning that would seem to ease or calm the pain.  That doesn't seem to be working anymore and the condition is present now more often than not.  Just this week I tried using Lamisal, but I didn't get any relief from that either.  So, before going to my doctor, I thought I would see if a doctor here, or some other person has experience the same problem and find the answer.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  This could be balanitis.  Balanitis is not sexually transmitted. It results from an overgrowth of organisms which are normally present on the skin of the glans. The condition most commonly occurs in uncircumcised men. The environment under the foreskin is warm and moist, and these conditions often favor the growth of the organisms that cause balanitis. These organisms are especially likely to grow if moisture is allowed to persist under the foreskin for a while. This may occur if you have not washed for a couple of days, or sometimes after sexual activity (vaginal, oral or anal - with or without a condom).  One common organism associated with balanitis is a yeast known as Candida albicans. Balanitis may occur because of excessive growth of Candida, due to moisture and warmth under the foreskin.\n\n",

It cleared up most of the cake like build up, but my penis continued to be very sore, painful, red, etc.  He sent me to an Urologist, who I saw yesterday and he said that I have what you describe and also something else, phimosis or phisosis, he obviously didn't spell it for me and I was nervous.    End result, he said since normal treatments have not helped and I had no objection to being circumcised, he set me up to have the circumcision procedue.  Funny, he then said before taking me to the nurse that would schedule it, if I had any upcoming vacations.  I said that yes I did, at the beginning of May.  He suggested that I have the surgery done when I return, otherwise I would have to avoid the pools, hot tubs and ocean while on vacation.  So.. he said 3 to 6 weeks after the surgery, I will be a new man.  Sounds good to me.  Thanks again for your reply!  John\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,      First of all, I just want to thank anyone in advance who takes the time to respond to this post.      I'm 22 years old and this post is sort of a follow up to a previous post I made. I have phimosis, meaning my foreskin doesn't retract fully. I have been doing foresking stretching exercises for a few weeks now, and they have been working but I've sort of run into a wall.   My problem is this: When I get my foreskin about 1/3 of the way down, there is a very small strand of skin (1-2 mm) that is connecting my foreskin to the very front of the glans. I have been trying to loosen this skin through stretching it, but I haven't been able to get the skin to detach. Will the adhesion eventually loosen, or is this something I'm gonna have to get some sort of surgery for.   In responding to this post, please keep in mind that I would like to try every possible alternative before circumcision.   Thanks\n\n",

I am not sure from your description but this could be a paraphimosis. Paraphimosis is the inability to reduce the retracted foreskin over the glans penis into its natural position. Is thst what you are experiencing? If so, this is considered a medical emergency.  Best regards.\n\n",

Sebaceous glands and hair follicles commonly get infected. They may be visible as small nodules or might only be felt as small lumps in the skin. They are yellow/black or red nodules on the hair shafts in the inguinal region. Nodules are often on the scrotum and occasionally on the base of the shaft of the penis. They may contain pus in them.  If they are still there I would advise you to have them checked out.  Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I hope you are feeling better now.   Opaque white discharge from the penis then it could be a sexually transmitted disease.  Common causes of penile discharge are 1. Gonococcal urethritis and 2. non-gonococcal or non-specific urethritis (NSU).  Gonococcal urethritis (gonorrhoea) is caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae a gram negative bacterium.  Non-gonococcal urethritis NSU is the most common form of penile discharge. Men aged between 20 and 35 years are most commonly affected.  It can be caused by a number of organisms including, Chlamydia trachomatis (up to 60%), Mycoplasma genitalium (25%), Ureaplasma urealyticum (15-25%), Trichomonas vaginalis (17%) and Herpes simplex (rarely).  In very few cases of non-gonococcal urethritis are reported not to be caused by sexual transmission. The symptoms in these cases are blamed on irritants, soaps or detergents, but no firm evidence exists to support this theory.  More commonly, this is a sexually transmitted disease.

Other causes are far less common in adults. These include lymphedema, mumps and a spermatocele.  Varicocele can lead to discomfort around the testicle, rather than actual pain in the testicle itself. A varicocele is formed when the veins that drain blood away from the testicles in the scrotum become varicose. This feels like a bag of worms at the top of the testicle on the affected side and the veins themselves may be tender to the touch. The discomfort is of a dragging, aching nature, and wearing a supportive pair of pants will help.  A doctor can distinguish between swollen veins and the normal underlying testicle through an examination. In moderate to severe cases, an operation to remove the varicose veins is curative.  Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Well I am writing in a question about my boyfriend. We have been together for 3 years and have not had intercourse. We decided to wait until marriage, but we have had oral sex. He is 25, will be 26 in 4 months. He has complained twice now about one of his testicals hurting and being swollen. I am not sure but I think it was the right one that was swollen. The first time it happened he tried to masturbate thinking it might be \"blue balls\" and that ejaculating would help but he said that it didn't help at all w/ the pain. Reading on the internet blue balls typically goes away after about an hour or two. I know the second time this has happened which was about a week ago the pain lasted for several hours and I did look at him and one of his testicals was double the size of the other one. He made several comments through out the day about it hurting. And it was probably about a month or so in between times.  He has not been to a doctor for this and is not on medications. I was wondering if this sounds like something we should be concerned about and if he should go to the doctor? Or if you could just give me an idea of what could be causing this. I have been looking online and haven't be able to find out much that sounds like this. Thanks\n\n",

These include lymphedema, mumps and a spermatocele.  Epididymitis, orchitis or epididymo-orchitis can all result in testicular pain and swelling.   Both the testicle itself and the epididymis are prone to infection with microorganisms. Inflammation of the testicle is known as orchitis, and that of the epididymis as epididymitis. When both occur together, as they often do, the term is epididymo-orchitis. All cause pain in the area of the testicle, which is tender, swollen and hot to touch.  Bacterial infection often descends from the urinary system leading to a typical infection that will normally respond to a course of broad-spectrum antibiotics. The viral infection mumps is not an uncommon cause of orchitis in adult men who are not immune, usually affecting one side, but sometimes both.  Best regards.\n\n",

During puberty when weight gain and height are demonstrated, it typically happens in \"spurts\". Male development, the testicles begin enlarging as well as the appearance of pubic hair. Generally speaking male sexual development continues for approximately 4 - 6 years in length and circumference after the testicles first begin enlarging. As always, it is important to have an evaluation by your physician to assure you are healthy etc. but relax, and don't become overly concerned at this point. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "title": "Concerns about Phymosis",
    "content": "Hi,      I'm currently 22 years old and uncircumcised. Until recently, I was not aware that the foreskin on the penis was supposed to retract enough so that it does not cover the head of the penis. Mine has never been like that. Although I don't have any trouble masterbating, sex can be painful because the foreskin gets pulled back much further than its used to. I looked around on the internet and found out that this was phymosis.       My question concerns some of the treatments of phymosis that are disseminated throughout the internet. I certainly want to avoid surgery, and so have been trying the foreskin streching exercises that are supposed to gradually loosen the foreskin so that it can retract fully. I was wondering what a real doctors opinion is on these exercises. I have only been doing them for about 3 days, and its hard to tell if I'm making any progress. The problem is that I feel like my skin is sort of thick on the foreskin and the stretching can be really uncomfortable, though not painful.       Regarding past surgeries, I vaguely remember visiting a doctor when I was very young, pre-puberty for almost the same type of thing that I'm doing now. He inserted something into the foreskin which stretched it out, but it was incredibly painful and he had to stop. At the time, I didn't know, nor did anyone bother to explain, what the purpose of that was.       Sorry for the long post, this has been a frustrating few days for me, finding out that I have this condition. Any help or advice you could give me would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

Typically, using a water based lubricant eases the discomfort. Topical application of corticosteroid cream has proven to be effective. I would suggest that you have an evaluation by your physician and inquire about the use of topical corticosteroid cream as well. I hope this has been somewhat helpful.

    "content": "Hi,  I am a 23 year old male, and I have quite a big problem - I have never acheived orgasm! and really need some advice as to what to do. I have no problems getting aroused, and I CAN ejaculate but I just don't experience much pleasure and just feel really frustrated & stressed afterwards. I am a normal healthy, physically fit person with no major diseases, and I have above average testosterone levels.  I am thinking about going to see someone qualified about this. You may wonder why I've waited until I'm 23? Well, obviously theres the embarrassment factor, but mainly it's becuase I just think their going to say it's a physchological/guilt thing, which I'm absoloutely certain it isn't.  So, can someone advise me as to who I should see about this? I'm not sure whether to talk to my GP/physician, or go straight to the urologist.  Also: is there anythign they can actually do about it, such as proper tests or anything? I don't just want them to turn around and tell me it's becuase of a guilt thing, or some wierd childhood trauma!!  The only other thing should mention is that I had frenuloplasty for an extremely tight frenulum. In fact, it wasn't even a frenulum it was more of an adhesion. But that's been corrected  and I can now retract the foreskin fully (although this is still painful when erect).  Please please please give me any advice/information you can so I can build up the confidence to go!!  Thankyou,  Dave\n\n",

I am suggesting to you, please wait a few years before making the decision to have sex. You can be intimate with your boyfriend  though cuddling, carressing each other, mutual masterbation, or oral sex. Keep in mind that oral sex does carry the risk of contracting STDs, so you should use protective measures.   If you should choose to have sex, please make sure you are using protection.

It seems that lately it has been happening more often.  I have not had intercourse in approx. 6 months.  Often when I ejaculate, I have to urinate immediatley afterwards.  However, occasionally even after I urinate I will have a slight burning sensation in my penis.  It seems to feel worst if I tighten my PC muscle.  It seems to feel slightly better if I try and urinate, but the irritation is still there.  I could almost describe it as a vaguely orgasmic feeling, however irritating, not pleasant.  There is a slight clear discharge that is clear and a slightly sticky consistancy.  This typically lasts for about an hour.  Do I need to go see my doctor immediately, or is this something that I will have to live with happening occasionaly.  Thanks\n\n",

It usually just means that the urethra is irritated by the force of those ejaculations. It also leads to the desire to urinate.  If you have any burning with urination when you haven't recently masturbated, you should see a doctor as soon as possible. He or she can check for prostate or other urinary tract infection or for non-specific urethritis.\n\n",

Immediately After I would masturbate I would have an intense feeling to urinate whether I actually had to urinate or not and an uncomfortable sort of pain would arise.

So If I chill out on masturbating for a few days will the irritation of the Urethra go away?  Or could it be something more serious?  I was recently tested for STDs but did not test positive for any and have not had any additional sexual partners.  Thanks Would Appreciate a response.\n\n",

Masturbating feels better than the burning. Masturbating a few more times right away would probably do it too.

    "title": "Penis Head Irritation",
    "content": "Hi, I am 15 and am having slight irritations on the head of my penis particulary in the middle area. There is nothing red or bumpy, when I look closely I see thin lines and very tiny dots...when I masturbate I have no problem but when I add lube to it and rub on that area it has a small burning sensation. Also when it is dry and I rub my fingers on it it stings for a slight second...I am just worried that in the future when a girl wants to give me oral if my irritation will cause me problems. Any suggestions besides seeing a doctor?\n\n",

Try to eliminate or reduce trauma to the penis which causes more irritation (masturbating).Try Eucerin cream, it's the best non-steriodal over the counter product for irritation, and gentler to the skin than Gold Bond.

    "content": "Hello,  Its really hard to tell, it could be harmless pigmentation or it could be something else such as a Fordyce spot.   Fordyce spots are not infectious and their cause is unknown. They are abnormally dilated blood vessels, covered by thickened skin. They can appear on the glans, shaft or scrotum. They may be solitary, but frequently appear in crops of 50 to 100. They are usually small (1-5mm) in size and may present as bright red or purple papules, painless and are not itchy.  Fordyce spots usually affect younger men. They may cause embarrassment because of their appearance, or a fear that they might be sexually transmitted. They may bleed if injured or even during intercourse.  Although a number of approaches have been tried, there is no simple, reliable treatment to remove them. Troublesome bleeding spots can be sealed with a device that uses a small electric current (electrocautery).  I recommend that you see a doctor to rule out anything more serious.\n\n",

    "content": "Hey guys, ive been having some problems lately with headaches when i get excited or start getting \"pumped\". I'm 14 years old, and im pretty active. During my basketball game, i started yelling and i got a really bad pain in the back of my head. Then the next day during school i messed with my teachers board and had to run out of class and got another sharp pain. Also during a Halo 2 tournament i lost in a close tie to my friend and started to yell and jump around and i got the pain again. It also happens when i masturbate but it is ALOT more intense. It happens about in the middle of masturbation, before i cum and a few minutes after i start. Could i have really high blood pressure? or is it adrenalin related or something else? I'm kind of afraid to ask my parents or my doctor, so i opted to go here first to see if i was the only one with this problem. Please help!\n\n",

I was told to use a hot water bottle to the back of my neck and to do neck stretching exercises and massage the back of my neck and scalp.  After a few days of doing this several times a day, the pain stopped and has not returned.  Good luck!\n\n",

    "title": "22 year old: ED/unable to perform sexually",
    "content": "Sorry for the long post...but I wanted to be very detailed. I really appreciate everyone that takes the time to read through this. I am a very frustrated individual.  Background: I am a successful, attractive, physically-fit 22-year-old male. I am 6'1 185 pounds and I work out regularly. I am not taking any medication and to my knowledge have no family history of this type of problem. I have never had surgery for any reason...nor have I ever had any major injuries--not even a broken bone or a concussion. I drink socially (2-3 drinks) about once/week. I am on a regular sleep schedule 7 days/week. I have never taken any illegal drugs, I don't smoke, and I eat healthy. I have always been a very social person. I played varsity basketball and tennis all through highschool, graduated with a 3.8 GPA, and was voted prom king out of a school of over 2000 students. I graduated from college a semester early with an excellent gradepoint average and have already paid off all of my student loans. I have more good friends than I can count and have virtually never gone without having a girlfriend. All good stuff. Now onto the problem...  I am having a sexual problem that I have found very little information on. I have a decent sex drive...but I have never made it past the heavy kissing/hugging/caressing stage in relations with women. I have been having this problem since my first relationship with a girl several years ago...and as a result have never actually had sexual intercourse. It just never makes it to that point...  My penis \"leaks\" a very large amount of pre-ejaculate and I have a very difficult time maintaining (or often times even getting) an erection. This is obviously quite embarrassing--especially when there is such a large amount of pre-ejaculate that it soaks through my pants. Other than my sex life (or lack thereof) my life is great. I have a great job where I've been working my way up the corporate ladder, I will be receiving my masters degree in the spring, I have a supportive family, I have a great girlfriend that I love and dozens of close friends. I don't feel depression/nerves/etc are playing a major role in this issue. Obviously at this point I do become nervous when I'm with my girlfriend and she's obviously very interested in intercourse...because I know I cannot perform. But that was not initially the issue. This is something I notice even when alone!  This is a problem that has ruined relationships and really taken a toll on my overall lifestyle over the last several years. I've had relationships with over a dozen women that I was very sexually attracted to and the same thing happens everytime...ultimately ending the relationships. Even when the idea of intercourse isn't on my mind I still run into the \"leaking\" issue during kissing, caressing, or even holding hands with a woman! I've been with my current girlfriend for nearly 3 months and I would really hate to lose her over this. I discussed my problem with her openly. She was very understanding...and we've been working on it...but the problem is still there. She's a 20-year-old girl who was sexually active prior to our relationship...and at this point I'm considering breaking up with her because I know she wants what I can't give her. It's terrible...but I've dealt with this same situation many times before. It's virtually impossible for me to have a fulfilling relationship with a woman because of this problem. It is extremely frustrating and is something that I don't feel I will ever learn to accept.  I masturbate 3-4 times/week. During masturbation sessions my erection is usually semi-soft...and while I still leak a large quantity of pre-ejaculate...I do usually reach orgasm if I rush to that point.  I have also noticed the length of my erect penis (even when firm) appears to be decreasing over time. I'm 100% sure that this is a physical problem...but obviously some psychological issues are involved as well. As soon as I begin to feel arrousal it is as-if the floodgates simply open up and the pre-ejaculate pours out until (sexually) I'm exhausted.  I have tried taking Viagra...and it seems to help to some degree...but doesn't eliminate the problem. I also don't like the idea of taking prescription medication for ED at the age of 22! If that is ultimately the only solution I will learn to live with that (taking one of the 'once-a-day' Viagra alternatives, perhaps) but I'm hoping there is another answer. Some herbs? Exercises? Diet? Changing my masturbation habits? Is there surgery for this type of problem? Have you heard of other people with this problem? I have no idea--that's where I'm hoping you come in.  Thank you for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "DJ:  I really appreciate your response. My question to you: is it normal for a person suffering from performance anxiety to have the same problems even when alone--attempting masturbation? Why is it that there is such a large quantity of pre-ejaculate even when simply cuddling with my girlfriend? Is massive quantities of pre-ejaculate a common symptom of erectile dysfunction? Is it a common symptom of performance anxiety? During any arousal whatsoever pre-ejaculate begins flowing constantly--even when an erection is not present. I can be in a public place holding hands with my girlfriend and spots on the front of my pants become literally saturated with pre-ejaculate.  I have attempted many (if not all) of the techniques for overcoming performance anxiety...but the situation seems completely involuntary. I reach sexual exhaustion before any attempt at intercourse can even be made.  Thank you again for your response. Anymore information you can add would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Levir,  Are you absolutely certain that the fluid you secrete is actually pre-ejaculatory fluid rather than semen?  The former is clear in colour while the latter is milky.  It strikes me that you may be having a prolonged subliminal ejaculation (or climax).  And, yes, high levels of performance anxiety could certainly impair the quality of your erection even during masturbation.  Have you ever tried masturbating after two or three shots of liquor?  I'm not suggesting that you resort to alcohol to resolve the problem, but a small amount of alcohol taken quickly does have a marked anxiolytic effect and I think this might be a useful diagnostic test to show that the source of your problem is psychological rather than physical.  Best wishes,  DJ\n\n",

I can be completely relaxed...just hanging out watching a movie and cuddling with my girlfriend...and it happens involuntarily. I don't even feel aroused during these times...just content. Many times I don't even realize it has happened until I stand up and/or shift around. The first doctor I went to recommended psychiatric therapy...and a dozen one-hour sessions and thousands of dollars later it did not appear to help even the slightest bit. There is no type of counseling that can solve this type of problem. The only time I feel any form of anxiety is when a woman is clearly wanting to have intercourse with me and I know I can't...because the problem has already happened. It happens involuntarily before I even think about getting involved sexually with a woman.  I was hoping there was some type of drug...or even surgery that could solve the problem. If this is performance anxiety it is far more severe than any case I have ever heard about...and I will apparently have to learn to live without relationships for the rest of my life.  Thank you for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Levir,  It was certainly not my intention to make you feel and sound so dspondent.  All I'm saying is that I don't think there's an underlying physical cause for your sexual dysfuntion.  Another question I should have asked you is do you still have normal morning erections or erections if you awaken from a deep sleep?  Because the existence of such erections very much rules against a physical cause.  With regard to medication, there are a group of drugs called anticholinergic drugs a small dose of which might very well dramatically reduce the severe problem you appear to be having with pre-ejaculation  Best wishes,  DJ\n\n",

If they are flat and present as a small area of the skin with a different color, then they could be postinflammatory hyperpigmentation.  These are localized, macular, brown hyperpigmentation at site of a previous inflammation. They occur at any age and are a reaction to trauma (physical or chemical injury), skin irritation, or dermatoses. They maybe associated with an inflammation of skin because of underlying injury or condition at the initial time of occurance.  They are not dangerous. However, given the limitations of the internet as a diagnostic tool, you are advised to seek a direct clinical examination to reach the proper diagnosis.  Best regards.\n\n",

It could be something so simple as an allergy to soap you are using, I however, would have it checked out by a doctor who can actually see the affected areas.  It would be best to get it treated before it gets worse.  Try not to scratch this area in the mean time to alleviate the itching as that it will increase the inflamation and make it worse.

    "content": "Hi,  my boyfriend of 6 months is very reluctant to go see a doctor about this, so I thought I'd ask on here first.  He is uncircumcised and his penis gets pretty sore whenever the foreskin is retracted, it is particularly bad during intercourse or oral sex (both of which retract the foreskin more than manual stim).  He told me that it started when he was younger, when he got a big infection because he didn't know how to properly clean it.  He does clean it properly now, but the problem is still there.  Recently I stupidly had unprotected sex with him (although it was not complete insertion) and afterwards and for about 3 days after I felt a little itchy and just not 100% healthy in my genital region...don't know if that is connected or just because it had been a while for me.   It is affecting our sex life and I'm just wondering if anything can be done about this (besides or before going to see a doctor)?  Thanks a lot!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Balanitis is inflammation of the glans penis commonly seen in uncircumscribed men. It usually causes redness and/or a blotchy rash on the glans, sometimes with a discharge. Balanitis involving the foreskin or prepuce is termed balanoposthitis. The most common complication of balanitis is phimosis, or inability to retract the foreskin from the glans penis.  Balanoposthitis may have any of multiple bacterial and fungal origins. Complex infections also have been well documented. These often are due to a poorly retractile foreskin and poor hygiene that leads to colonization and overgrowth.   Anaerobic organisms have been associated with the diagnosis, although in most cases, the patient is treated empirically and a specific organismal etiology is not obtained. Candidal infection appears to be the most common cause of disease. The condition in older adult men often has other etiologies, including intertrigo; irritant dermatitides; and candidal, viral, or fungal infections.   Treatment centers on antibiotics / antifungal treatment, improved hygiene. Topical antibiotics (metronidazole cream) and antifungals (clotrimazole cream) often lead to clearing of the lesion. In your case you will need to be treated too if you are found to have acquired yeast infection from him. This means, even if he doesn't want to check it out, you should get a check up.  Given the limitations of the internet as a diagnostic tool, you are advised to seek a direct clinical examination to reach the proper diagnosis.  Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Doctors,  I'm a 21 year old male from India. I've been masturbating since age 12 almost everyday! Since the past few years I've noticed that my right testicle had always been substantially larger than the left. I'd ignored it all the while as I'd read that a difference in testicle size is common and not a problem. Since the past year or so, I'm noticing a considerable increase in size. The left testicle is about the size of a marble while the right has grown to the size of an egg. I can now hold it in my hand without getting my palm around it. Also when I hold the scrotum taut and examine it, the right testicle is of a some what bean shape and not elliptical as the left. This testicle now shows through my pants and I can no longer wear tight fitting jeans or any other trousers. It's become quite a concern and it's embarrassing going out in public. Do I need to absolutely get it checked by a GP? I'm very embarrassed about going to the doctor about this and it's been weighing on my mind for a lot of months now. Please help!  Thanks, Jeetu\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  You need to go to see your doctor IMMEDIATELY!  The testes can swell for many reasons. Possible causes include cancer, testicular torsion, inguinal hernia, epididymitis, hydrocele, and varicocele. Other causes are far less common in adults. These include lymphedema, mumps and a spermatocele.  Testicular cancer is a rare cancer but is curable if caught early. The risk factors for cancer of the testicles include:  1. Age: Testicular cancer can occur at any age, but most often occurs in men between the ages of 15 and 40.  2. Undescended testicle (cryptorchidism): This is a condition in which the testicles do not descend from the abdomen, where they are located during development, to the scrotum shortly before birth. This condition is a major risk factor for testicular cancer developing in both the nondescended and the contralateral descended testes.[1]   3. Family history: A family history of testicular cancer increases the risk.  4. Race and ethnicity: The risk for testicular cancer in Caucasian men is more than five times that of African-American men and more than double that of Asian-American men.  Please visit your doctor as soon as possible to rule out this dangerous possibility.  Best regards.  References: ========== 1. Frank IN, Graham SD, Nabors WL. Urologic and male genital cancers.

    "content": "Hello,  Balanitis is inflammation of the glans penis commonly seen in uncircumscribed men. It usually causes redness and/or a blotchy rash on the glans, sometimes with a discharge. Balanitis involving the foreskin or prepuce is termed balanoposthitis. The most common complication of balanitis is phimosis, or inability to retract the foreskin from the glans penis.  Balanoposthitis may have any of multiple bacterial and fungal origins. Complex infections also have been well documented. These often are due to a poorly retractile foreskin and poor hygiene that leads to colonization and overgrowth.   Anaerobic organisms have been associated with the diagnosis, although in most cases, the patient is treated empirically and a specific organismal etiology is not obtained. Candidal infection appears to be the most common cause of disease. The condition in older adult men often has other etiologies, including intertrigo; irritant dermatitides; and candidal, viral, or fungal infections.  Treatment centers on antibiotics / antifungal treatment, improved hygiene and treatment of eczema if present.  Given the limitations of the internet as a diagnostic tool, you are advised to seek a direct clinical examination to reach the proper diagnosis.\n\n",

    "content": "I have had a pain in my left testicle for about two weeks.  I went to a doctor who found that it was firmer than the right but that was all he came up with .  I had an ultrasound later that same day and am still waiting for the results.  The technician told me everything looked good to her (althought that is not the official result).  The pain subsided for a couple days and is coming back today.  On the pain scale, it's about a 2 today and was up to a 7 last week.  In addition I've been dizzy all day and just don't feel right.  I could be overreacting and the two things could not be related at all but I thought someone might be able to shed some light on the subject.  Oh, I'm 26, 128 lbs and 5'10\" tall and have not had a health problem since infancy.\n\n",

There are many possible causes of testicular pain, these include: trauma or surgery; torsion of the testicles; infections such as epididymitis or orchitis; varicocele and hydrocele; referred pain from a kidney stone; an inguinal hernia or pelvic congestion (blue balls).  Assuming that your ultrasonography is normal that would rule out many of the causes above. It could possibly be an infection sucha s epididymitis or orchitis.\n\n",

    "content": "I currently have dull aching pains witin both my testes, more so in the right. I have had them for the past few days. I think they may be linked to when i was aroused and had an erection for a couple of hours through being with a girl but i didnt ejaculate or anything and i eventually lost the erection after she left. The next couple of hours my balls felt extremely tender and sore and although they are not that bad anymore the aching sensation still persists. I've had this problem before a few months back and got a check up with my doctor ho said everything was in good working order and sent me away, snse then till now i have been ok. This time i thought i should get a second opinion here. I am only 17 years of age so it may be something to do with puberty. On the other hand i have heard about 'blue balls' when you don't ejaculate after having an erection but i only hought that was supposed to last a few hours. I am a little worried and apprehensive so hopefully you can shed some light on what i might be going through. Thank you for your time in reading this and trying o help me out. SIC\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  There are many possible causes of testicular pain, these include: trauma or surgery; torsion of the testicles; infections such as epididymitis or orchitis; varicocele and hydrocele; referred pain from a kidney stone; an inguinal hernia or pelvic congestion (blue balls).  Blue balls is a slang term for a temporary congestion in the scrotum and prostate region that commonly results when prolonged sexual stimulation of the erect penis does not result in orgasm and ejaculation.  During arousal in a sexually mature male, the sympathetic nervous system is disrupted, resulting in increased blood and lymphatic fluid flow to the scrotum, testicles and prostate areas. As this happens, the veins carrying blood from the genital area become constricted, causing more blood to enter the area than leave, ensuring a high enough regional blood pressure to allow a sustained erection for penetration during sexual intercourse.  Because orgasm is not achieved, the blood tends to pool and become oxygen deprived.  This may result in the bluish tint that appears when blood engorges the vessels in the testicles.  The easiest way to relieve the symptoms of blue balls is through an orgasm either by masturbation or sexual intercourse. The resultant ejaculation jump-starts the sympathetic nervous system, which increases blood flow through the groin area, dissipating the fluid buildup. Even without orgasm, the symptoms of blue balls usually subside within an hour of onset. The symptoms can sometimes last much longer.  The fact that it has lasted a few days may point in the direction of infection. If it doesn't get any better overnight then you should seek medical attention by tomorrow. If you experience any new symptoms, discharge, increased pain, tenderness or fever you should seek immediate attention.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Do you mean white as in transparent or as opaque white? If it is transparent then this could be prostatic secretions after straining. If this is an opaque white discharge then it could be a sexually transmitted disease.  Common causes of penile discharge are 1. Gonococcal urethritis and 2. non-gonococcal or non-specific urethritis (NSU).  Non-gonococcal urethritis can be cause by a number of organisms including, Chlamydia trachomatis (25-60 per cent), Mycoplasma genitalium (up to 25 per cent), Ureaplasma urealyticum (15-25 per cent), Trichomonas vaginalis (17 per cent) and Herpes simplex (rarely).  Some cases of non-gonococcal urethritis are reported not to be caused by sexual transmission but this is very rare.  More commonly, this is a sexually transmitted disease. In such a case you should be examined in a sexually transmitted disease clinic (STD clinic). Otherwise you should seek help of a genito-urinary specialist or an andrologist, if one is available in your area.   Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  In most cases, masturbation is a normal, harmless sexual activity. Masturbation won't cause undo fatigue. Sex is not strenuous. It won't ruin the memory, shrink the penis, grow hair on the  palms. However, it may become a symptom of illness if it becomes a form of compulsive sexual behavior. Compulsive masturbation in an older child can sometimes appear if the child is being sexually abused.  Although there is no simple rule about how much masturbation is too much, it is generally considered to be compulsive if masturbation is performed excessively, as in your case. Or it becomes time consuming and interferes with a person's daily routine, work or social functioning. If it continues despite no longer being pleasurable or gratifying, or if it places the individual at risk of physical harm, or has legal or personal consequences.  You should seek an appointment with a psychiatrist, psychologist or sex therapist. If no clear trigger for the behavior is found, some doctors will treat the patient with psychiatric medications called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). This family of drugs includes fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft) and paroxetine (Paxil).\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  The presence of rash related to sexual activity could be anything from a herpes infection to a yeast infection or a dermatitis.  Herpes is characterized by recurrent bouts of genital vesicles, like small blisters, which rapidly break down to form small, painful ulcers. It is highly infectious and usually sexually transmitted.  Yeast infection in males commonly presents with balanitis of inflammation of the glans penis or the inner thigh. This requires antifungal treatment.  Eczema or dermatitis is a skin reaction to an irritant that is better be described as dermatitis. Eczema appears as diffuse red plaques with a poorly defined edge and finely scaled surface. It frequently causes quite severe irritation. It can be caused by infection or local reaction to skin injury from chemicals or radiation. There are a number of effective treatments available, such as steroid creams. It is not infectious.  I recommond that you rule out anything serious first by visiting an STD clinic and making sure everything is alright.  Please keep us posted.   Best regards.\n\n",

    "title": "Masturbation injury or STD?",
    "content": "About a year ago I had unprotected sex with a girl who soon after had a Herpes outbreak that was believed to be HSV-1. Planned Parenthood didn't swab it and by the time she got to her GP or GYN, it was long gone.  Her doctor (and she) were content with assuming that it was HSV-1.  I, on the other hand, freaked out and spent countless hours on this site, looking at my penis and going to doctors, dermatologists and even paying for my own STD tests. Right off the bat I got the IgM test for recent exposure and tested negative.  At around 12 weeks, I paid for a complete run through tests of all of the STD's (including the HerpeSelect IgG) and I came up negative on all tests including HSV-1 & 2.  A rash that I was probably over-analyzing still persisted, so my Dermatologist did a biopsy to rule out cancer, etc. Nothing. I committed myself to never putting myself through that again and put it all behind me and I'm doing my best to live a \"clean\" life.  4 nights ago I was away on business and to take care of some stress, I decided to masturbate in the shower. I used some of the hotel soap and away I went. I was pretty tired, so it was taking a lot longer than I'd hoped and as I was finishing up, it started to hurt/sting a little around the rim of my glans - the soap wasn't very \"sudsy\" or lubricating. (the shower actually went cold it took so long) I finally ejaculated and when I got out of the shower, it looked like I broke some blood vessels in that area and it hurt/stung pretty badly.  (I'm not sure if that's what I did, I'm just describing) It was pretty tender and when I got up the next morning it still looked pretty much the same and still hurt quite a bit.    Right now there's one main red, really irritated area and a few slightly raised smaller points about the size of a pinhead - most of them are on the rim of my glans, but one is further up, halfway to the ureter.  None have broken out into true blisters (I think), they're just there.  I'm starting to wonder if this all goes back to last year and beginning to worry.  Oh yeah and when I'm showering, I'm only taking a WARM shower and a few moments after getting in they turn white/fleshy and slightly larger.  Once I get out and dried off, they eventually go back to their smaller size & red color.  My common sense/practical thinking says that the hotel soap, friction and the long time it took me to ejaculate are to blame. My worrysome side is very edgy though and I don't want to put myself through what I went through last year.  This all said - could I have HSV and it have not really shown up for a year in either the tests or in symptoms? Or did I just do this to myself in the shower?  What are these things???  Your thoughts on my condition and suggestions of next steps would be greatly appreciated.  I can provide some pictures if you let me know where to send them.  Best Regards,  Soapy123\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Soapy123,  I apologize for the delay in answering your question and I am assuming that it all turned out fine.  Minor trauma to the meatus or shaft of the penis can result from allergens, mechanical trauma, intercourse, oral sex, or chemical irritants. These mechanically induced lesions\u2014as well as those mediated by chemical substances\u2014are often seen as a result of masturbation.  When erect, the penis, is more easily damaged, with one review noting that 50% of penile injuries occurred during sexual intercourse, while an additional 21% were characterized as sequelae of other erotic practices.[1]  The prolonged time and the irritant soap are enough reason for your complaint. I do not think you should look any further. According to what you said you were confirmed negative for HPV, there is no reason to suspect that the test results were wrong and that your HPV recurred 1 year later when another more direct cause is present.  That said and given the limitations of the internet as a diagnostic tool, you are always advised to seek a direct clinical examination to reach the proper diagnosis.  Best regards.

    "content": "Hello,  Hair follicles and sebaceous (sweat) glands are normally found on the penile shaft, particularly on the ventral surface (underside). They may be infected, trichomycosis in the case of sweat glands and folliculitis in the case of hair follicles.   They may be visible as small nodules or might only be felt as small lumps in the skin. They are yellow/black or red nodules on the hair shafts in the inguinal region. Nodules are often on the scrotum and occasionally on the base of the shaft of the penis. They may contain pus in them. The hallmark is that they will have a hair arising from them that reveals their true nature. These lesions can be associated with erythema and itching. Superinfection with other dermatophytes has been noted.  In your case it is very likely that the shaving, no matter how cautious, would lead to trauma and may infect the hair follicles or the sweat glands as described above.  Given the limitations of the internet as a diagnostic tool, you are advised to seek a direct clinical examination to reach the proper diagnosis.\n\n",

Since then I used to masturbate often but recently I have seriously decreased that activity to almost once, twice at most,  every three weeks. About a week ago (about a day after masturbating)  I noticed a slight itch on the foreskin. I used to get this irritation following intensive \"activity\" but this time it was different. I was completely thrown off by a milky discharge coming from my penis. I noticed it right before I urinated. It happened only once and I tried to ignore it. I masturbated last night and It happened again today. Please help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Balanitis is inflammation of the glans penis commonly seen in uncircumscribed men. It usually causes redness and/or a blotchy rash on the glans, sometimes with a discharge. Balanitis involving the foreskin or prepuce is termed balanoposthitis. The most common complication of balanitis is phimosis, or inability to retract the foreskin from the glans penis.  Balanitis is not sexually transmitted. It results from an overgrowth of organisms which are normally present on the skin of the glans. The condition most commonly occurs in uncircumcised men. The environment under the foreskin is warm and moist, and these conditions often favor the growth of the organisms that cause balanitis. These organisms are especially likely to grow if moisture is allowed to persist under the foreskin for a while. This may occur if you have not washed for a couple of days, or sometimes after sexual activity (vaginal, oral or anal - with or without a condom).  One common organism associated with balanitis is a yeast known as Candida albicans. Balanitis may occur because of excessive growth of Candida, due to moisture and warmth under the foreskin.  Given the limitations of the internet as a diagnostic tool, you are advised to seek a direct clinical examination to reach the proper diagnosis.  Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "I've had them for a good 10+ years.  I have never been able to identify them as they are unlike any pictures I've seen. They look similar, but smaller, to the cysts some guys end up with on their shaft, but they are all along the edge of my head.  (white, slightly petruding) I got them before I ever had sex, so that rules that out; They also don't look like any STD I've seen.  I've had a physical since I got them and the doctor never said anything.   They don't hurt. They will rarely pop (I've gotten a few from time to time, but they come back). They look nothing like pearly penile paupules - They take up ~2x more surface area, but don't petrude as much. They are further in on the head,  not so neatly arranged, and there isn't nearly as many of them.    I thought for a while they might be warts and got some wart remover, which had no effect on them at all. however, it did put a scab across the head of my penis for a while.  :)  I've taken antibiotics for other ailments that had no effect on them.  However, I've noticed they do become smaller if I apply hydrocortisone cream on them. (they go back to normal when I quit).  They also get a lot better with tretinoin cream, but I always end up having to quit with it because it makes my nutsack and shaft very rashy, crusty, itchy and painful.  I have no foreskin.  I can try to get a picture of it if anyone wants to take a guess. I'm not going to the doctor for it anytime soon because they are just aesthetically unpleasing, and I don't have the money for it right now.   Any ideas what they could be? Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,   I wouldn't rule everything out the way you did. They do sound alot like they could be pearly penile papules. These small papules are best described as embryological remnants. As you said they are usually located around the circumference of the crown of the glans penis. They are multiple in number and small (about 1-3mm).  They usually appear as yellow-white, domelike papules arranged in a row of multiple-grouped lesions along the corona and sulcus of the glans in adolescent males. That is the typical presentation, but by no means the only one.  They typically develop in men aged 20 to 40, and around 10 per cent of all men are affected.  Presentation may occur in males in their second to fifth decades. Rare cases in children as young as 11 years have been reported. They may be mistaken for warts, are not infectious (not an STD), and not related to personal hygiene.   They require no treatment. Some patients however, may request therapy to alleviate anxiety or for aesthetic reasons. Ablation using carbon dioxide laser, electrodesiccation with curettage, and excisional surgery reportedly have successfully eliminated lesions. Mixed results have been noted with cryotherapy.  You cannot rule out being seen by a doctor. There is no replacement to a direct clinical examination. If the doctor feels that he needs to confirm the diagnosis a biopsy may be made which would be definitive. That would ultimately cure the problem and save you the trouble it can cause you.  Best regards.\n\n",

It usually causes redness and/or a blotchy rash on the glans, sometimes with a discharge. Balanitis involving the foreskin or prepuce is termed balanoposthitis. The most common complication of balanitis is phimosis, or inability to retract the foreskin from the glans penis.  A specific type of balanitis is termed balanitis xerotica obliterans is the term given to lichen sclerosus et atrophicus when it involves the glans or prepuce.   This benign disorder of unknown, possibly autoimmune, etiology is observed in uncircumcised males and is an established cause of phimosis and meatal stenosis.   Typically following an insidious course, it is associated with scarring and fissure formation. The clinical presentation is that of a well-defined, flattened, pale gray-to-white/ivory patch that looks like wrinkled cigarette paper or roughened lichenoid scale with prominent margins, usually involving the ureteral meatus. Often, the advanced lesion is firm due to the underlying dermal fibrosis. Unlike the pruritus associated with vulvar lesions, male lesions often are asymptomatic, although sometimes they itch or burn.   Treatment of this condition with corticosteroid immunosuppressive regimens improves the outcome dramatically. Often, circumcision is required for the treatment for foreskin lesions.  Given the limitations of the internet as a diagnostic tool, you are advised to seek a direct clinical examination to reach the proper diagnosis.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello staff,  I am a 18 yr old and a virgin. Last night, about 18 hours ago, I decided to masturbate, which I do 2 to 3 times a week. It  took me about an hour & a half to two hours until ejaculation and everything was perfectly normal up until then. After I had ejaculated I noticed that my penis and my foreskin or perhaps just the foreskin had swollen up considerebly, mainly towards the end, although the swelling continues down the shaft to just past the half way point. There is no pain at all and it has not affected my uriantion. It looks to me as if blood has gatehered in the corpus spongiosum or the urethra and stayed there. I am not sure if the bulbus area is slowly expanding, but I do not think it is. I am very worried about this as the state of my penis looks extremely alarming.   Please notify me as soon as possible as to what this could be and what I should do? Any help would be much appreciated. Many thanks.  Kind regards,                                  FP.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Premature ejaculation is best defined as persistent or recurrent ejaculation with minimal stimulation before, on or shortly after penetration, and before the sexual partner wishes it.   Premature ejaculation is thought to be the most common form of male sexual dysfunction, with an estimated prevalence of up to 40 percent.[1]  It is believed to be a psychological problem and does not represent any known organic disease involving the male reproductive tract or any known lesions in the brain or nervous system. Anxiety may play an important role especially in secondary premature ejaculation.  Treatment of ejaculatory dysfunction are mainly non-pharmacological and centers on relationship counseling, behavioral therapy. If treatment with the previous methods are unsatisfactory pharmacologic interventions are then indicated.   Relationship counseling is of paramount importance because premature ejaculation can create discord and increase the tension surrounding sexual intercourse. Because many therapies involve the patient's sexual partner, it is important to educate both members of the relationship about premature ejaculation and to facilitate communication between the partners. An important objective is to relieve any form of performance anxiety on the male.  Behavioral therapy has been considered the gold standard of treatment, with reported success rates ranging from 60 to 95 percent.[2]Techniques include the Seman's pause maneuver, the Masters and Johnson pause-squeeze technique and the Kaplan stop-start method.   The methods can be self-applied, although with suboptimal outcomes; hence, involvement of the sexual partner is essential. Short-term gains can be substantial, but long-term outcomes are less favorable and depend on continued partner involvement.[1]  Because of the limitations of behavioral therapy, pharmacologic interventions are often used to treat premature ejaculation. Anorgasmia and delayed ejaculatory response are well-known side effects of tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.[1,2]  Consultation with a sex therapist, psychologist, or psychiatrist may prove helpful in order to explore psychological issues and to implement behavioral techniques (eg, squeeze-pause).

What's worrying me is that this started over 3 weeks ago when I had sexual contact with another man (I'm bisexual), part of which involved me briefly inserting my penis (unprotected) into his anus.  The swelling immediately after sex is very sore and red, but calms down relatively quickly, though a slight sensitivity remains in between.  No discharge or visible warts, etc.  Am very worried about what this might be....hope you can help.\n\n",

    "content": "Yes, it could be eczema. However, the itching may also point to a fungal infection.  Eczema most commonly affects other parts of the body, but occasionally it may first appear on the penis. In such cases, it may be a skin reaction to an irritant that is better be described as dermatitis. Eczema appears as diffuse red plaques with a poorly defined edge and finely scaled surface. It frequently causes quite severe irritation. It can be caused by infection or local reaction to skin injury from chemicals or radiation. There are a number of effective treatments available. It is not infectious.  Given the limitations of the internet as a diagnostic tool, you are advised to seek a direct clinical examination.  Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Im not really good at english but I will try to explain again! you will find Im abit lame or stupid but its ok to read it and no harm. I will talk about the proccess when I was young to now. better read all. If nurse and doctor want to take a challange lol I think just find.  May I ask something , the yellow sperm and there different groups look like jelly is it death sperm or what can it bejavascript:emoticon(':?:') Question  In my male repoducttve system, I having my left side of testis look like dropping and longer and my right is just normal I guess. Im now 18 yrs old and 1.79cm height   I want to have growing of sperm when im 30 year old. But I wats horny too much and playing with sperm too much Since when Im 12 years old to 15 years old and at my 13th years old  I start to grow taller by 11cm.  If im not clear at the top I mean I got to play with my body parts to lets the sperms comes out! and so badly I do it once a day from 12 years old to 13years old.. and slowly at 14 to 15, I try to control my process by doing it 2 to 3  times a week and at 15 to 16 I try way like to totally control stop the action. but It is impossible after when I was holding it for 4 weeks( at the process of first week is able to control , second week and third week I feel that theres time when I sleeping the sperm comes(2 times) out when Im dreaming and I feel Im quite awake at that moment)  and at the fifth weeks I feel really impossible because it is terrible when u sleep and sperm on ur pants and so embaressing for me and I playing with it so the sperm will come out fully! and sperms comes out! Because thats my limit of controlling it. I think your may think this not the information ur want to know if yes or no  just continue read.   Short 1  I feel that my sperm duct both side, there are lots of  something moving I guess is sperm if not it should be urine. It make me so unconfort like having DIARRHOEA repeatly and even feel warm. I feel very stressful everytime when that happen.   Short 2 Sometimes I can feel like there are sperm pushing to frow out from the urethra but my penis feels like blocking it from coming out. But its better if it can comes out. Only when Im sleeping I and dream of sex but I don want to just the brain, I feel like it control me to. and the yellow sperm comes out but mostly is like (smashed jelly). After the sperm comes out I feel better and no more fast flowing of sperm in my sperm duct and I feels refresh.   Question I need some solution for holding my sperm is that possible? But I don want sterilization! I want my sperm.  :?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there, Thanks for getting back in touch, firstly I wont treat you like a little kid and I certainly don't think you are stupid as you are not.  The symptoms that you describe and the feelings that you are getting believe it or not are perfectly normal .   the sperm colour and consistency are perfectly normal,  The fact that one testicle hangs lower than the other is normal, every male is the same.   the night time ejaculations are normal and are called \"wet dreams\",  or nocturnal emissions , these are nothing to worry about either.  You sound a perfectly normal guy who is worried about this problem, please don't worry too much as stress and anxiety about this will also make you more stressed,   If you are really worried go and see your doctor who will refer you to see a urologist. This is a doctor who specialises in this sort of issue and they will advise you that what you are experiencing is ok. Please try not to worry.  Let us know how you get on.  Good Luck\n\n",

    "content": "Make sure you are using the right size condom.If the penis is to large or small for the condom, it will not stay on. When you areready for sex, have yoru girlfriend manually or orally stimulate your penis while getting the condom ready so the penis stays erect. Having her put it on also may help it to stay erect. Make sure there is enough lubrication, think about using a lubricated condom or KY jelly. To much friction from to little lube can cause the condom to come off. As soon as you ejaculate, remove the condom. Make sure you grab your penis at the base, holding onto the condom as you pull out. You can squeeze the tip of the condom to make sure there were no leaks, if you see a leak, you can get PLAN B, which need to be taken within 72 hours of intercourse, and it will protect against pregnancy.  Look for spermicidal lubricated condoms, which will kill any sperm if you happen to have a break.  Think about using a second back up method such as birth control pills.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, im a 17 year old male.  Ever since i've been 12 or so i've started growing pubic hair, i started masturbating around this time.  Now i have a decent amount of hair down there, no where else though, and i can masturbate and get quite a large amount of semen.  My problem is, i've never noticed any penis or testicular growth, ever.  My penis is about one and three quarters long, and four and a half when erect.  My whole family are late growers, but it's getting ridiculous.  I've tried to be patient but i can't anymore and it's really depressing, mostly because i have a few girls who are really interested in me but i can't really do anything about it.  If i could do anything to change this up, get my growth started ( im about 5'6 and skinny) I'd greatly appreciate the recommendation.  I'm also wondering if i should stop masturbating, if that would help any?  Thanks for your time, hope you can help me out? :(\n\n",

I've felt this way since about the age of 16 but i thought it would change. I look extrememly young and a few times my voice has been passed off as a female. Not one day that passes by i get the phrase \"Be glad you look young, when your 40 you'll look like your 25!\" YEAH, OK BUDDY. Its getting bothersome. I'm scared to even get involved with girls because of my penis size and just overall embarassment of looking 15 at the age of 21.  I have a decent amount of pubic hair around my genitals and under my arms but zero on my face. I cannot ejaculate however i do masturbate daily (since the age of 12.) Ive read some other forums about seeking a doctor but im almost too afraid to seek help in just utter embarassment and disgust with my body. At times i feel suicidal because of it. Is it too late?

Do you think there is something wrong with masturbation?  Ejaculation usually occurs between the beginning of puberty and mid-late teens.  It is concerning if you don't have sexual desire and have never had an orgasm.  (You can have an orgasm without ejaculating).  Best to see your doctor about it just in case.\n\n",

I was searching for the effects of masterbation and I fond this:   Problems associated with Over-Masturbation and Over-Ejaculation:  Is this true????    Over-ejaculation melts down the acetylcholine/parasympathetic nervous functions first and then the liver functions that release essential enzymes for the syntheses of the neurotransmitters acetylcholine, dopamine and serotonin and  the chains of hormone production; it causes the brain and adrenal functions to perform excessive dopamine-norepinephrine-epinephrine conversion and turn the brain and body functions to be extremely sympathetic.  It results in the brain's and nervous dysfunctions, stress, anxiety, impatience, eye floaters or fuzzy vision, buzzing (noisy) ears, cardiovascular irregularities, urinary incontinence.  http://www.actionlove.com/extra/over.htm\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I'm 38 and masturbated chronically for years.  I had ALL of the symptoms that Dr.Lin indicated (testicle pain, premature ejaculation, burning in spermatic cord, prostate problems, severe eye floaters) and MANY more symptoms.  My life is a wreck.  The MD's can't fin anything wrong.  I took his products for a while and actually did get a boost.  However, he is only interested in selling products and does no want you to figure out the actually problem.  While taking his products, I had a stressful week and had a severe setback (would have been nice if he said to avoid stress).   I have been to a local practictionary of Chinese medicine who suggested I have liver congestion and need to detoxify.  Adrenal fatigue is also another result.    I think Dr.Lin tries to make it soooo confusing that you just say \"I have these symptoms, I don't know what he is talking about...I guess I'll try his products.\"     He doesn't organize his site so you can learn to avoid all the other things you are doing wrong.  He really doesn't want you to learn.  He just wants you to buy his stuff.   I'm still looking for answers.   But I would suggest you lay off the porn and masturbation.  I wish I had.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Energizer,  Not knowing your age I will answer this question as if you are entering puberty. Puberty can start happening in the average male anywhere from about 11 \u2013 14 years old, usually around the age of 12. A male will also start seeing fine hair that will eventually become dark and thicker growing on his face, underarms, buttocks, back, chest, arms and lower legs. Some men have more hair than others, this is normal and is hereditary.  Light, fine pubic hair will start to grow at the base of the penis and will eventually start growing down the inner thighs and eventually down the whole leg. The hair will get thicker and darker as the male hormones become abundant with age. This thick pubic hair doesn't actually grows up onto the penile shaft or glans, it just clusters around the base area and grows onto the scrotum   A pubic hair is thick and shaving or waxing the genital region can cause itching and a person may experience infections from painful ingrown hairs as it grows back.  If you have questions on your development as an adult I recommend you contact your physician and get a physical done.\n\n",

How long have you been with your partner?  Maybe you're unconsciously self conscious.  You said that your penis head seems to get \"overstimulated\" and sometimes you lose your erection.  Is it possible that oral sex is not your thing?  Even though it is unheard of, there are plenty of men that don't enjoy oral sex.  If you are still concerned, you should speak with your doctor.  Don't be embarassed, doctor's really do deal with these type of problems on a daily basis.  Good Luck Nurse Gina\n\n",

    "content": "Pelvic pain can be caused by \"pelvic congestion\". When women are sexually aroused, they experience some degree of pelvic congestion caused by an increase of blood flow to the vagina and vulva. This congestion, which is normal and temporary, is usually relieved by orgasm. If a woman does not orgasm, the congestion subsides, but more slowly.  Pelvic congestion can also be associated with unexplained pelvic symptoms that are uncomfortable, and even painful. Pelvic congestion, primarily affecting premenopausal women, is not considered a disease, but a medical condition that describes a transient state related to the phase before menstruation occurs. Pelvic congestion syndrome is a collection of symptoms, including chronic pelvic discomfort or pain and pelvic congestion itself.\n\n",

After about another ten minutes it continued to tingle and felt like it was vibrating. The vibrating sensation has persisted for over 48 hours now and I'm starting to get worried. In the beginning I thought that maybe she caused a blood vessel to burst and then I thought that maybe she caused cut of blood circulation but both do not seem to be the case. I can still become erect but it feels a little sore. This morning I woke up abruptly because I felt what felt like a pen prick in the head of my penis. I'm not sure what's going on...I\u2019m a little embarrassed to go to the doctor...can anyone with some formal training or experience help me with an explanation. I would greatly appreciate it.

The description you have given is suggestive of an epididymal cyst, which is also known as a spermatocoele.  This is a sperm-filled sac in the long, coiled tube that lies above and behind each testicle.   Often, it causes no symptoms, but the patient with this condition can usually feel a firm, smooth lump on top of the testicle. When symptomatic, the patient may complain of pain, swelling or redness in the scrotum or a sensation of pressure.

Be sure that this is something you both want to do, and that your girlfriend is ready to make this commitment, and make sure protection is used.  Stress can cause loss of erection, so I would adivse you to relax, try not to worry to much abotu it, because the more you worry abotu not beign able to perform, the more often you will lose your erection.

    "content": "Having sex is not always the answer, in fact it can complicate things somewhat, sex under the wrong circumstances or for the wrong reasons is never a good idea. You have to ask yourself honestly if you are sexually attracted to the person, and then work from there. If you want to have sex with someone purely to clarify your own sexual orientation, you will be doing what might be the right thing for you, but for the wrong reasons, afterwards you will feel conflicted. Sex is most enjoyable when by doing it you satisfy a deep inner longing for someone, sex should be the result of a powerful sexual attraction. Obviously this attraction should be mutual as well. If this is the case, then good luck to you, I hope you find great pleasure.\n\n",

    "content": "Are you having orgasms, but no semen comes out, or are you not able to climax at all?  Orgasm of course normally includes semen, but the presence of semen is called ejaculation and is separate from orgasm.  If the problem is my first question, the most common, but not only answer is retrograde ejaculation  Retrograde ejaculation is a condition where the seminal fluid is ejaculated backward into the urinary bladder instead of out of the penis during orgasm.  This usually occurs because the neck of the urinary bladder, which normally closes to block such retrograde flow, is unable to do so. This may be due to a nerological (nerve problem) or injury of some sort to the neck of the bladder.    Do you notice that your urine is cloudy after orgasm?    Diabetes is an extremely common cause of retrograde ejaculation (also a very common cause of impotence).   Also, some drugs or medications can affect the bladder neck.    Retrograde ejaculation is sometimes very difficult to treat; the medications are not always effective.  If and again IF this is the problem, it doesn't make a difference in your sex life, except if you wish to become a father one day, then is becomes a problem of course but can be treated by a doctor getting sperm from the bladder and aritifically inseminating the woman and has very successful results.    However, this is only a suggestion; to be diagnosed accurately, you  need to see a doctor, preferably a urologist, a specialist in these matter to accurately be diagnosed.\n\n",

To fix the problem, the doctor simply ties off the affected vein to redirect the flow of blood into other normal veins.  After surgery, the doctor probably will recommend that a guy wears a scrotal support and places an ice pack on the area to bring down any swelling. There may be discomfort in the testicle for a few weeks, but after that, any aches and pains will go away and everything should be back in full working order.  I would say that if its only been a few hours it is too  soon to tell. Were you told to Ice up or wear a scrotal support?\n\n",

My problem is concerned with testis size  (if i remember well  they are 2.5 ,2.5 ,4 cm) cause comparing with others men they look like smaller.  scrotum is also quite smaller and this is a problem for me...cause the way they look like  affects my masculinity..i think i'm not like a normal man sometime... Now things gets worse cause most of the time my scrotum is like sucked up, and the feeling of having it not relaxed ..increase my suffering for the sizes. I would like to know if some people are more sensitive than others for this condition and is something can be done for that, i mean to have them relaxed for a longer time cause when i have them relaxed i think less about my size problem. i would really appreciate if u can answer me.

    "content": "I'm 19 (never had sex, no STDs) and last night I had a very long erection and masturbation (about 4 hours.) Afterwards, my penis was slightly sore, which I would expect after that, but it was also very swollen. It is as if the foreskin has even swollen, but the swelling continues down the shaft. It is NOT difficult to urinate, that still happens normally, but it is harder to get the foreskin back. My hope is that the swelling is due to trauma and that it will go down in time, since this happened only 12 hours ago, but I've heard of some conditions where the foreskin swells and causes the need for circumcision. I do NOT want to have to do that. Does anyone know if this sounds like a temporary swelling or is it more serious?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Doctor,  I have had an ongoing problem for over a year now.. during intercourse i lose my erection.. during foreplay it is fine, but when it comes to intercourse it is not so.. I think the problem may stem from my addiction to masturbating over pornography? i tend to masturbate every other day now.. whereas for a long time it was around twice a day.. everytime whilst viewing porn on the internet..  When i think about it now, i think maybe the problem could be that my imagination is lacking when i have sex because im used to having visual graphic images in front of me ?!? hence the failure ?!? I did see my Doctor about this problem when it first started and he prescribed me with Viagra, now here is my second major problem.. i am now single but have been seeing my ex on and off, and when we have sex, the only way i can is to use viagra because i worry that if i don't take it i wont get an erection at all !?! she does not know that i take it, so i feel i am betraying her also.. Oh dear, all in all its very frustrating and very annoying, i never had these problems when i was 17-20 but now i cant seem to shift them, do you think it could be a mental problem and an addiction to masturbation ?!? For the record i do not smoke, but i enjoy a drink at the weekends.. say 15 pints over a Friday n Saturday night. Look forward to an early response. Gump.\n\n",

    "content": "I am very concerned for myself and my fiancee ongoing.  When we first started a sexual relationship it was great although, more often than not I had to initiate it.  As we felt more comfortable with eachother he told me his quirks, preferences, and desires. He did say he thought that at one time he had a porn addiction. He is very much into porn.  (I am not opposed to it and use it myself occasionally)  I know that he must have had a hard time in the beginning trying to pull off sex so often....He is a daily masterbator and has an entire ritual of it.  Our frequency of sex has majorly decreased as now he feels as though he can be \"himself\".  He has apologized over and over for this and has told me of major problems it has caused in past relationships.  I know he feels very badly about it.  He says he doesn't think about having sex much and hasn't since he was in his mid twenties.  ONLY MASTERBATING.  When it has been awhile since our last encounter he can perform but doesn't ejaculate most times unless he masterbates after intercourse.  He tells me it has nothing to do with me, it is fantasy and that everything has to be just right for him.  I do not know how to help this situation nor do I know what to do for myself.  I am not a fan of simply masterbating to relieve stress.  I have not changed in appearance, if so only for the better.... Any comments or feedback... please get back to me.  One last thing.... he is a wonderful man and my best friend, although this is something he can't really talk about anymore....\n\n",

What i want to know is can too much masturbation/pornography effect your performance in the bedroom as it reduces your use of your own imagination ?!?  do you think if i could give up the porn it would have an effect on my sex life?!?\n\n",

    "content": "First off, I'm a healthy 25 year old man. Just a few months ago, I noticed that when I got an erection, sometimes I would get a little fleshy bump maybe 1/8\" long (maybe a tad longer) and maybe 1/16\" wide on the underside left side of my penis, probably 1\"-1 1/2\" down from the head (looking down from my angle). These are estimates and may not be exact, but you get the idea. It's beneath the skin, kinda in or on the erectile tissue. Not on the skin. It's not something I've ever had before. It doesn't happen every time I get an erection, either. Just sometimes. It doesn't hurt or even feel annoying. It's just there, and when I get it you can see it raise the skin a bit. It's small but noticeable. When my penis goes back to its flaccid state, this bump disappears, nowhere to be found.  Again, this bump only happens during an erection, and even then not every erection I get has this bump. And it's beneath the skin, in or on the erectile tissue.   What is this? Should I be concerned?\n\n",

    "title": "Exposure to STD's",
    "content": "This is going to sound a little weird, but I have been very concerned.  About 6 weeks ago I was staying with some friends who are still in college.  They had a party one of the evenings I was over there.  I was getting out of the shower and put on what I though was my underwear and apparently someone had gone into the bathroom while I was in the shower.  I put on another guys underwear that were filled with warm semen.  I took them off immediately when I noticed but the semen got all over my penis.  I am afraid some got into my penis and possibly into a chaffed area I had near my testicles.  I washed it off, but I am concerned I could have contracted something.  The last couple of weeks my penis has been very itchy and I have a slight throbbing in my left testicle.  I have only had one sexual partner my entire life and she has only been with me and we have been married for 4 years.  Should I be tested for STD's due to this exposure???  I have had relations with my wife and I'm afraid I could have given her something.  Please advise.\n\n",

I've tried thinking about things that would arouse me, tried focusing on ejaculating, and my most desperate i've even had to revert to porno. I can go for about 2.5+ hours without climaxing.

    "content": "First, you may want to see a doctor to rule out any medical problems, but I doubt you have any problems, since you have climaxed in the past.  I would be inclined to say that this issue is a reslut of the stress you are under to climas.T The more pressure you are under to have an orgasm, the harder it is to acutally have one.  I would suggest you stop worrying about it, stop trying, stop thinking about it. Then, start with foreplay, have your girlfriend tease you until right before you start to climax. Then stop for a minute, get things under control again, and do it over, have her tease you right to the point, but not over it. Do this several times, or during sex, stop right before you feel it, then finally allow yourself to release. most importantly, stop worrying about it, that is probably the number one reason it won't happen.  Make sure that you have talked to your girlfriend about safe sex and birth control.\n\n",

With the penis curving to the left, the right side of the penis has a fairly large vein or something else running from the base of the shaft to the scar from my curcumsision(mind the spelling).  During an erection it(the vein) seems to grow larger almost to 1/4 of an inch in diameter. Where it disapears, into the shaft of my penis, I cannot really tell if it actually goes into the head of the penis.  I do not feel any discomfort from it nor does it bother me during intercourse.  Besides this vein, my penis looks normal, and I have normal ejaculations. I have gotten over the apearence of my penis after talking with my partner about it for some time.  My question is now, what is it, is it unhealthy and should i consider surgery, and will it cause any reproductive problems in the furture.\n\n",

However in the last year or so I've noticed a significant shrinking in penis size; and noticeably weak erections; I don't always wake up with them.  Also from time to time I have a mild pain around my testicles and the lower shaft of my penis; it's more like an uncomfortable pressure than an actual pain, it usually when I\u2019m sitting down at my desk or something.    I've been reading websites talking about similar symptoms involving over-masturbation but they are usually trying to sell me something; could one of you doctors give me some suggestions as to what it could be and more importantly what I may do to correct it?  For the record, I have no STD\u2019s and saw a urologist about this problem and tested negative in all of the tests he scheduled for me.  I do not use drugs or steroids and have not had any physical trauma in the area; there is a history of high cholesterol in my family but I have not been tested myself.\n\n",

    "content": "I too have had a similiar problem.  In fact during my time in the service, my age being 17-21, I masturbated between 5-7 times a day.  After moving in with a girlfriend of mine and having sexual intercourse on a regular basis, I noticed I still had urges to masturbate.  At first I was frustrated because I felt arroused but I was not getting errect.  During my sexual intercourse however, I had no problem getting errect.  I talked it out with a few of my ship mates that I kept in touch with online and many shared similair expierences.  One joked of a person that masturbated as a teenager only in the bathroom on the toilet.  Once he became sexual active and stopped masturbating as much, he still got errections while sitting on the toilet.  Im not sure if any of this was true, but it did make me think about the phycological effects masturbation.  Instead of taking my problem to a proffesion, I tried a little experiment on my own.  Every time I felt the urge to masturbate but was not \"aroused\", I did nothing.  I started to notice I did not masturbate but once every two days during the first month.  After two months it dropped down to once a week.  After three month my masturbation was so rare that I almost forgot about my problem.  It was hard at first just because I was accoustom to masturbating every time I felt the urge.  So in the end, I believe my problem was more of a habbit my mind picked up, that almost like an alarm clock, told me to masturbate.  I just had to unlearn it.\n\n",

    "content": "Most men have different shaped testicles, that hang at different lengths. Most men do not have symetrical testicles. If the testicle was undescended, it would not be outside the body at all.  Undescended testicles are common in male babies, and usually are treated early. If it goes undected until adulthood, that testicle will not be able to produce sperm, also, an undescended testicle is more prone to tumors. Moving the testicle to the scrotum usually will not help with the ability to produce sperm. Usually in adults with undescended testicles, the testicle is just removed.  In your case, I do not think that an undescended testicle would be causing your slow maturing. I htink you should see a doctor to discuss possibilities of why you are not putting on weight properly, and if hormone treatments are nessary.\n\n",

I can run around my house naked and he doesn't even notice.  I go to bed trying to be affectionate and he just rejects me left and right.  I have started seeing a therapist myself because this has led to some self esteem, rejection, and self security issues.

    "title": "[no title]",
    "content": "Dear Married_&_Loney:  Your question is about your husband's sex drive, but you also said that it was \"not just sex anymore, we don't do anything.\"  You did not elaborate, but I assume that you meant that you and your husband have become detached. The fact that you are going to a therapist alone makes me concerned that he is no longer involved in the marriage, let alone in sex.  If that is the case, the problem is bigger than treating sexual appetite and function.  On the other hand, men are usually open to sex, even in a bad relationship.  Tthe fact that he ignores you when you are being sexually provocative and actively rejects you when you are sexually aggressive, even though you have returned to the weight you had when he was first attracted to you, strongly suggests that this is not just a problem with the marriage.  Paradoxically, your efforts ot arouse him may even threaten him.  It is quite possible that your husband's sexual problems are causing him to distance himself from you, in to avoid having to face failure.  You did not say anything about your husband's age or health.  Many medications can interfere with sexual appetite and function.  Diabetes, atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), high blood pressure, tobacco, excessive alcohol use, depression, sleep apnea, testosterone deficiency, and too much of a pituitary hormone called prolactin are common causes of sexual problems. Over what time period did he begin to lose his sexual interest?  Did he have difficulty achieving erections, or did he have problems maintaining his erections?  Does he awaken with erections?  It would be helpful to know whether or not he has had problems with sexual performance, either earlier in your relationship, or in previous relationships.  Has he been married before, and, if so, what was his history in that relationship?  Your statement that you \"used to be able to arouse him\" suggests that you have had to take the initiative all along, making me think that he has had a problem for at least as long as you have known him.  Is he bothered by his sexual deficiencies, or does he not see \"the big deal\"?  This information would be helpful in targeting evaluation and treatment.  Your message suggests that your husband is not willing to face the problems with your marriage.  Would he be willing to see a physician?  If so, it would be helpful foir you to  go with him.  Men who lose their sexual appetites seldom perceive that as a problem, but  they will often accept the idea of seeing a physician to deal with their partner's concerns (\"It's for her, not for me!\")  The first specialty that most patients and physicians think of for male sexual health is urology.  Urologists are primarily trained as surgeons, but some of them do have an active interest in sexual function.   Most endocrinologists are very familiar dealing with sexual problems.  Even if it appears that the sexual issues may be caused by other problems, endocrine causes of sexual problems often contribute.  Endocrinologists are the best qualified to diagnose and treat  diabetes, high blood pressure, and hormonal abnormalities.  Since endocrinologists are acustomed to looking at the body as a whole and in dealing with  complex problems, most of us are also very thorough.  An endocrinologist would be a good starting point for identifying the cause of your husband's sexual dysfunction and coordinating his evaluation and therapy.  I am sure that your therapist has already pointed it out to you, but your husband is the one with the problem.  Blaming yourself for his shortcomings will do neither of you any good.  I hope that this helps you get your man back, better than ever.\n\n",

If i have an orgasm and there is pressure on the north face of my penis, which is this sensitive area, i feel extreme pain.  Also, when this area is damp and is rubbed constantly, the same feeling occurs, except not as worse as the orgasm.  I have no idea what this is.. it may just be a naturaly sensitive area, but when i am sexually active, and am recieving a blowjob, by the time orgasm comes around, it hurts SO bad... because it is both damp and pressured, which is extremely painful.  I am still a virgin, and i am 15 years old, and i don't want to have sex until i know what this is, because i know that it will hurt just the same while having sex.  If anyone could give an opinion or suggestiong with this it would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you!\n\n",

He had this a lot the first few months we were together.  It seemed to be worse if I rubbed the edge of his head a lot - he said when he masterbates, he mostly only touches the shaft.  Its worse with blow jobs, and it seemed like partly because the edge of his head would occasionally rub against my teeth -- he has a very wide head.  It also seems worse if he is very aroused for a long time.  So it seemed to be better if I used my hands and mouth on his as little as possible and we didnt take too long.  It also seemed to subside as he became more comfortable in the relationship.  However, the problem has reappeared.  We fought so badly this summer, we barely had sex at all.  We finally became sexually active again this past week -- and three times in a row, he's had this pain, and its been excrutiating.  I don't know if i've been more enthusiastic because its been a while, or if he's emotionally uncertain and therefore holding back some, and this has an effect, or what.  We even skipped 2 days, and it happenned again.    I agree its a big problem -- but as I said, it lasted a few months the first time, and the seemed to go away -- for 2 full years.  I wish I knew what caused it, but for now -- try less stimulation before orgasm.  And hope that, once you are comfortably married and mostly having intercourse, it will ease up.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I am 27 & my husband of 5 years is 26  we went through this problem when we first got married, we were both virgins at the time and he had not mentioned this problem previous to our wedding night, as well it was several weeks before he mentioned it.  I finally talked him into going to the doctor to get examined but unfortunately the Dr could not offer any real help.  So we experimented with various items such as sensitivity cream ect... without any real great results.  The rest of this post is more towards dbmamaz since she is more in a situation like myself and I really wouldnt want to confuse highondrums2005 with information that he may not be ready for at his age.  dbmamaz have you tried other forms/avenues of making him orgasm without all the extra touching to his 'sensitive' area?  After extensive searching online for possible ideas/solutions, the only one that I came up with that works best & everytime is by rubbing/massaging his 'G-Spot' otherwise know as his prostate gland.   While it seems to me that most guys get all worked up when a women wants to explore that area of there body, it really is a great solution if you can get your partner comfortable with it.  My husband was quite shocked when I first started exploring and it took a long time for him to let me insert my finger to explore(wont go into detail since this is an open forum but if you need some tips just send me a PM and I'll get back to you)  After a lot of searching for 'THE' spot, I finally found it, and it was the best thing ever for our relationship. Once you spend a little 'quality' time with this area all it takes is a couple strokes on his shaft and he is done, and it is ALWAYS a huge orgasm without any pain whatsoever since there is no real previous time spent on his penis.  Since then we of course have expanded our sexual activities, since it seemed like there was only me doing that to him & him performing oral on me, so once he was confortable with everything we have started using a 'strap-on' most times, and it has been the best ever since...we both ALWAYS achieve orgasm around the same time(both are especially big for different reasons...but again its an open forum so I wont go into detail)  I really believe that has 'saved' our sexual relationship, while it might not be ideal for every couple out there, for the painful situation we were in, it totally solved the problem in a exciting way for both of us.  I wish you the best of luck with the 'problem' if you need any of the tips I used with my husband feel free to send me a message    trish\n\n",

    "content": "For the past 3 months or so my bf (aged 34) has been suffering some sexual problems. He has both lack of desire (he says sex seems distant to him) and is no longer getting erections (or very very rarely).  I don't know if one is the cause of the other or they are both a symptom of something specific.  We are not having any emotional problems, he is still very attracted to me etc and claims he has no \"issues\" that he can think of. He's not stressed or overworked.  He is longer waking with morning erections and even with the use of porn, is unable to masturbate. There was one occassion where he woke with an erection which we made use of, however when he orgasmed only the tiniest amount of semen came out (and only after his orgasm had finished and he milked his penis).  This has me all very worried as it seems to me it must be something physical (especially as he previously had a very healthy sex drive etc), and we have tried several things including taking zinc and ginseng, to no avail.  I cannot convince him to see a doctor as he says it's just \"one of those things\" and he's sure it will come right by itself. Can anyone advice me does it sound like something physical? Something serious?  He has no other health problems that we are aware of. (no obvious signs of diabetes, heart disease etc)\n\n",

You didn't mention his age, but diseases like diabetes and high blood pressure, medications for blood pressure and antidepressants can also be a factor.  If these do not apply, perhaps he needs a testosterone level done, many middle age men experience a reduction in  testosterone levels, reducing their libido.  Stress can very well be a factor in desire.  It's not uncommon for people in general to be uninterested during the week if they have especially stressful jobs and/or work long hours.    Is it normal on the weekends?   Do you have a routine that you follow?  If so, changing things can add excitement and increase libido dramatically.  Talk to your husband about what he would like, communication is the key.\n\n",

The thing that bothers me is that he has to go in our computer room and shut the door and lock it.  I know he looks at naked pictures and he has looked at porn.  Why does he have to do it in a locked room with the computer??  I know it's embarassing to do it with the door open, but why can't he go in the bathroom?  I'm starting to feel like I'm being used now when we have sex.  B/c if I don't want to have sex, he goes into the room and does it.  I feel like he uses me for the release and that's it.  I'm starting to think he has an internet/porn addiction.  I don't know what to do.  He's starting to understand that this can ruin our marriage finally and he doesn't go in there that much anymore.  It just bothers me.  Any suggestions??  Advice?? [/b]\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there.  I wouldn't say that there was such a thing as excessive masturbation unless it was creating a medical problem.  However from what yoy state in your post it sounds like you and your husband need to talk things through, he may very well be \" addicted to the computer\" but it obviously is causing problems within your marriage.    I feel that you would both benefit from either marriage guidance or sexual counselling from a professional.  However this is something that you would have to approach your husband with very delicately,  sit him down at a convenient time for both of you and gently explain how you feel. after all he may be using the internet as a fantasy but try to tell him that he has the real thing near him. Talk about what your likes and dislikes are, try to talk about new ways for lovemaking, this may be embarrassing but it's certainly worth trying.  Good luck and best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello.  From what you describe you may well have a slight allergy to the KY Jelly.  If you have not experienced this burning sensation before during or after masturbation then this is a possibility.  As you say a burning sensation when you urinate is also a symptom of a urine infection but do you get frequency i.e do you find that you are passing urine more frequently than before.  Best option is to go and see your doctor and hand in a urine sample to check for any evidence of infection and get this treated.   Good luck and best wishes.\n\n",

Blood in the semen may be related to for example, inflammation, infection, or any injury to the male reproductive tract. A urinalysis and culture should be completed to rule out any infection of the urinary tract. Also a semen culture/analysis would be recommended. If infection etc. is ruled out then an pelvic and scrotal ultrasound would be warranted to evaluate for inflammation etc. along the reproductive system. Call your physician for an evaluation.

I have had blood in my semen for about a month now and went to my urologyst(?) were he placed me under a lot of tests such as, going into my bladder with a camera, ultra sounds, regular testes exam, and determined that it was an  infection. I have had anti-biotics for 7 days at a time( took twice each perscription was for 7 pills-one a day) and this has not cleared it. I noticed after sex prior to the medication, there was a lot of blood in me ejaculate and when i uninate after sex a lot of blood flushes before my urine and a couple of blood clots... this lasts fo every other time during intercouse... But when I wait a few days clear as a whistle than if my partner and I continue once a day... it starts up again. This is affecting my sexual drive and I am tired of going under painful tests to determine what seems to be guesses. Is there any other thing you may think of that I should do? i am only 23years old for crying out loud\n\n",

My partner and I are both faithful to one another, so I was suprised when I smelled the exact same odor on his genitals when we haven't had sex in over a week.  Does this mean we've communicated some kind of infection? I wonder, can men get yeast infections from their femal partners? Also, I just came off Depo-Provera last month, could this have anything to do with it?\n\n",

Other than that, since the skin was broken there is a chance for infection, so you need to keep the area clean and watch for signs of infection such as redness, swelling or discharge.

    "content": "Hello Kk,        From your description, everything is fine physically, however, you haven't described if both your testes are descended or not (i.e. when you examine or palpate your scrotum, do you feel a ball or firm mass in each sac or not? This is another matter to consider). You are 16 years old and is still in the puberty stages of growth and development so there is still a chance that your hormones can get the job done. On the average, western people have a size 4-5 inches when not in the erected state and an average of 6-7 inches when in the erected state. For asians, it is around 3-4 inches when not erected and around 5-6 inches when having an erection.         What matters, most of all, is your ability to 'procreate' (i.e. are your sperms adequate enough for fertilization to take place?). Aside from that, according to most women, the size doesn't matter... it is the performance that counts the most.  M.D.\n\n",

If underlying health conditions have been ruled out,  psychological factors may certainly be responsible for causing this problem. Remember this may happen to many men at some point during their lifetime (You are not alone.) Once a man has experienced ED he may become excessively worried that it will happen again causing \"perfomance anxiety\" which in turn leads to more stress, guilt, feelings of inadequacy. My suggestion to you would be first and foremost, don't put so much pressure on yourself. Try some relaxation techniques. Keep in mind that the key to intimacy is not \"just performance.\" Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "title": "Badly bruised penis / testicles / pubic area",
    "content": "This happened 4 nights ago. I am a 35 year old male, never had any sexual issues.  I was having some pretty intense intercourse with my ex-girlfriend, when all of a sudden my penis started ballooning in size. It didn't hurt, I just noticed it got very tight all of a sudden. I pulled out, and noticed that my penis was severely swollen, basically bruising up bigtime.  No blood ever left my body, it was all inside the skin. Nothing was coming out of the tip. No signs of blood anywhere, except for a hugely ballooning penis shaft (which was still very erect, and gaining huge girth by the minute...).  We examined it, and found that sacs of liquid (blood, I'm assuming) were forming in the skin, all the way down to the start of the head (I am circumsized). (Nothing entered the head area, it remained normal size).  I freaked out, put ice on it, and eventually fell asleep. I wasn't worried since I was able to maintain an erection, and it did not hurt. By morning, the swelling was not bigger, but it had not gone down. I noticed I was also badly bruised in my pubic region (the area where the penis shaft meets the pubic region).  I woke up with a large erection, so I was relieved things were \"still working\". After it went limp, my penis basically looked very deformed, and ballooned out (from the swelling and blood that had ran down the shaft on the inside).  I have put ice on it (the penis shaft, the testicles, and the pubic region) before falling asleep each night. The swelling is tremendously down, almost back to normal size. However, the color is horrendous. My entire penis is still extremely bruised in color (purplish/black color, although the swelling is down and the shaft is back to normal size). I also have this same extreme discoloration of a semi-circle in my pubic region, as well as most of my testicle sack.  I have not gone to a doctor. I have been able to get and maintain erections since then, with no further swelling. I have not attempted sex since then, however.   Everything seems to be in \"working order\" and getting \"back to normal size\", however I'm very concerned about the discoloration. Now I know that bruising pretty much takes awhile to discipate everywhere else on the body, I'm just wondering if it will take longer on the penis/testicle/pubic areas?  I'm really embarrassed about this - more than anything.  It's more of a laugh between my ex-girlfriend and I now, I think it boosted her ego.. haha. But I am doing ok so it's ok to make light. Anyway, Does anyone have any advice?   NOTE: I also should say that I have had ZERO discoloration of urine - so nothing was bleeding in my urinary system, or anywhere in the urine tubes in the penis.  Thank you!  Black and Blue, me\n\n",

    "content": "Hi!  I don't think that its normal to have testicular rashes and itching. Perhaps a fungal infection of the skin may be the reason. You can try antifungal creams to be applied over the area. If the itching is a problem, you might want to take a benadryl tablet before you go to sleep.  If you have a history of promiscous sexual relationships, you might want to visit a dermatologist to look into the matter.  bill\n\n",

How can I have a low sex drive, yet still experience vivid sexual dreams, and why is this occuring all of a sudden. Any help is appreciated.\n\n",

Now on the other hand if I try and pop it of course there is some what of pain but the same pain u would get if u were popping a pimple. I can touch it and press against it and there is some what of a discomfort but nothing majot.  I can not fully pop it tho, Yes puss does come out of it but it never actually goes away, I do shave in that area so I was wondering if its an infected ingrown hair or not. And is it a good idea for me to be trying to pop it? It just seems to get bigger a couple days later after I have tried popping it.  Does anyone have an answer to this problem and hopefully, U can help me! Thank You\n\n",

    "content": "Is there a specific reason why you do not want to see a doctor about this?  The testicles should descend by at the latest one year of age.  The risks of leaving them undescended are increased likelihood of cancer.  Another drawback is itt is not able to be examined for lumps.  It also can cause infertility, even with just one undescended testicle.    There is also a possibility they are not present at all.  Testicular torsion can happen before a child is born; while in the uterus, there can be a \"twisting\" of the testicle which kills the tissue.  I highly recommend you do see a doctor about this.\n\n",

    "content": "I think it was during my first sexual encounter when the woman i was with was very small built and my penis hit the back of her and it hurt alot or because in my youth when i'd have an erection i'd keep it between my legs but my penis almost rotates a little to the left and also falls left and down. and when erect it does not want to go to the right to the point where it feels like i could in a way break it if pull it to the right. and will not at all stand out straight. I would like to know what i could to to fix these problems and what could have caused it to happen.\n\n",

Do you have any problem getting and maintaining an erection before you orgasm or only afterwards?  Need more information on this.  It is normal for a man to have a refractory period after orgasm before he can acheive another erection.     The diet pill you are taking is very similar to amphetamines, which can definitely cause a problem getting an erection, but they don't usually cause a problem with libido.    If lack of libido is the problem, it may be due to other medications, mainly antidepressants and blood pressure medicines.    As far as finishing before your wife, why not try using a vibrator during sex so she can have an orgasm?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I'm a 26 year old male who for the last 5 years has been suffering from prostaitis. I find that when I have either sexual intercourse or masturbate that it gets worse. I have the usual symtoms of needing to go to the toilet finding it hard to go and weak stream of urine. I had test done by my local Gp about 6months ago for having an enlarged prostate which turned out ok, so my doctor perscribed me with tablets which I can't remember the name of now I think there was a C at the start and an X figured if thats any good. They kind of made a difference in that they stopped me from not needing to go to the toilet as much but, I still sometimes have problems urinating and when I ejaculate it hurts.  But I think that the problem has effected the way in which I breath, when the prostatitis is quite bad I feel quite sick and I feel a tightness in my stomach, I also get skipped heart beats and can sometimes feel lighted headed esp when I am having sex or masturbating. I am now at the stage in which I am frightened of having sex because I always get the same problems, I find it hard to breath properly, keep a decent errection and when I ejaculate I feel almost like my whole stomach seizes up the muscles just tighten and I can hardly breath at all. I don't have this problem through any other type of physical exercise just when I have sex, masturbate of even begin to get aroused, it all seems to be connected to my prostate problem.  Have you heard of this before? or does this sound completely stupid? Also I read on numerous sites that ejacultaing when suffering from this condition is good because it flushs toxins out etc but in my experience it just makes it worse and with all the other problems it cuases me ie my breathing and the skipped heart beats I'm wondering what the hell can I do?\n\n",

If it is varicocele, what causes this, and will this mean I am completely infertile, or that ther is a slight chance i will be? My doc said the varicocele reduces the sperm count, is this correct?

The increases in temperature  may cause damage to sperm or inhibit the production of new sperm. If a varicocele is present an ultrasound should identify this disorder. If the varicocele is not causing symptoms and infertility is not an issue treatment is aimed by supporting the scrotum either with an athletic support or snugly fitting undershorts. If there are symptoms, pain, testicular damage, etc. and a question of fertility, the method of treatment is a surgical procedure. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

I told my doctor that I believe the  left side is unreasonably large, but my doctor said it wasn't anything to worry about and that they aren't removed unless there's is a good reason - low sperm count and such.  I asked him pointedly whether it would cause problems (damage or even cancer due to the additional heat).  He said unlikely.  But this thread has started wondering  again.  Would it be a good idea to just skip my family doctor and go to a urologist?  Does it  hurt? Not really.  I mean,  there are times when there is a dull pain at the back of the left testicle.  Usually shfting  how I'm setting or just moving my scrotum a bit takes care of the problem.  Doesn't happen often though.\n\n",

    "content": "Have you  had sexual experience (intercourse) before you were married?  Can you still ejaculate with masturbation?  It's sounds like orgasmic anejaculation, which is largely a problem with men who masturbate often and are fairly new to sex.  If this is the case, the most likely cause is that you have become accustomed to a certain way of acheiving orgasm, and although sex is enjoyable and you are aroused, it is different from what you are used to, so it takes a long time and usually produces no ejaculate.  Also, focusing in on having an orgasm will delay it further.  Psychosexual counseling is the method of treatment for this; there is no medicine for this problem.\n\n",

I had to start manually retracting the skin prior to sexual activity, and I also had to assist manually to extend it back out afterwards.  It eventually got to the point that I couldn't even manually retract it, so now I am unable to get a complete erection...just nowhere for it to grow to. This is causing an almost complete loss of sensation during sexual intercourse, and other problems as well.    I was recently taking NSAID's (Naproxen and another variety) for a prolonged time about 6 months, it was during that time that this problem surfaced, could this be related?  I know there were warnings about prolonged use of those meds.   What does this sound like?    I'm a very modest person, and I have major problems discussing this sort of problem with anyone\n\n",

    "content": "It sounds like classic hypoglycemia.  Do get tested for diabetes; hypoglycemia can be a sign of early diabetes as well.   It is NOT healthy to only eat 2 times per day.  You should be eating small meals (healthy snacks included) every 4 hours at least.  Your brain is lacking glucose when you don't eat enough, and has difficulty in working as well as it can normally.  Breakfast is most important.  If you eat less often, especially if you eat a larger portion, it will pack on the pounds, because it slows down your metabolism.    Eat plenty of protein with \"good\" carbs with your meals and snacks, too.  Cottage cheese, any type of dairy, peanut butter and nuts are good choices.  Eat carbs, but healthy ones; whole wheat only, and plenty of fruits and veggies.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi im a keen runner and cyclist. Im 34 yr old and during the last 6 months have been getting a problem with my gonads retracting up inside my body, after a hard session running or cycling.  The problem first occured in a cycle in cold weather, i put it  down to  the cold and wearing a particular type of cycle shorts which may be slightly too small for me. Ive not worn them since but this problem now affects me quite frequently not just in cycling but running too.   It doesnt really cause any pain, just a bit of discomfort. When i finish my session, to return my chappies to thier rightful place i gently apply some pressure to the areas either side of my penis to 'pop' them back into my scrotum.  Any suggestions, ive got an appointment to see my Gp about this, but im  not expecting to find a miracle solution, it may be something ive just got to live with.\n\n",

    "title": "condom use",
    "content": "My partner and I are having trouble with condom use.  We are currently using trojan-enz with spermicidal lubricant, but we have tried other brands and styles  as well. When his penis hardens and he applies the condom before intercourse, it does not roll smoothly down his penis as it should. He has to pull and stretch the condom over the head of his penis and it is often a struggle to get the latex all the way down the shaft to the base; there end up being folds of the latex on his penis.  We both know the proper way to put on a condom, but it simply does not work that easily.  Though we are monogomous, I have had other partners in the past and this was never a problem.  His penis is large, but could it's size be causing this problem?  Could the thickness of his penis prevent the condom from rolling down the shaft?  Also, our condoms break during sex, somewhere between occassionally and frequently.  I realize that this could be a result of the condom trouble, but it is beginning to make me very nervous.  Any advice or help would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm experiencing a problem... i am circumsized, and everything is normal about my penis except with one thing. If i have an orgasm and there is pressure on the north face of my penis, which is this sensitive area, i feel extreme pain. Also, when this area is damp and is rubbed constantly, the same feeling occurs, except not as worse as the orgasm. I have no idea what this is.. it may just be a naturaly sensitive area, but when i am sexually active, and am recieving a blowjob, by the time orgasm comes around, it hurts SO bad... because it is both damp and pressured, which is extremely painful. I am still a virgin, and i am 15 years old, and i don't want to have sex until i know what this is, because i know that it will hurt just the same while having sex. If anyone could give an opinion or suggestion with this it would be greatly appreciated.   Thank you!\n\n",

It's like nothing I've ever smelled before and very hard for me to describe, but it's almost a musty sour smell that becomes extremely overpowering at times.  It's not limited to a specific location, rather it can be everywhere I go.  My fiance (who works with me) cannot smell it and thinks I'm nuts.This leads me to believe that the problem is ME, and not necessarily the air around me.  What can cause this?  It's slowly ruining my life as I can no longer smell anything else except for this.  Even food no longer tastes good.  I've never heard of anyone else who had this problem and I'm absolutely baffled now.  Any thoughts would be appreciated.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Masturbation",
    "content": "Hi there,  Yes, most young women also masturbate, just as young men do. It is not harmful to your health. Different cultures and different social groups have a broad range of reactions to it, and so many people take these attitudes with them into full adulthood and into marriages and relationships. The key is to be aware of how a person's culture may affect his attitudes and those of his partner or spouse. In your case, ifyou are originating from an East Indian culture, you may find a certain degree of modesty or even insecurity on your wife's part at the beginning of your marriage. She may have been taught that any kind of sex, including masturbation, is something that a woman should hide, even after she is married. Therefore, you can begin to help her relax into a happy and comfortable physical relationship after marriage by keeping these point s in mind: 1.) You can reassure her that it is normal for her to want to seek pleasure and to       find ways to share her pleasure with you. Let her know, in other words, that      her pleasure matters as much as yours does.   2.) You can remind her that affection and caring go along with passion and that       therefore she need not feel guilty about sex.   3.) You can let her know how much you look forward to having a baby or babies with       her, and of course they are the happy result of sex!     4.) You can point out all of her most beautiful features and best traits, physical        and personality-wise, and let her know you will take time to relax with her in       the bedroom and not be in a \"hurry.\"     5.) Finally, you can ask her where and how she likes to be touched and keep        asking her until she overcomes her shyness, if she seems shy or nervous.        Communication is so important!      Good Luck to you! I am sorry that I do not know what books in your city to    suggest,; however, one of the Indian doctors who frequents this site probably    will be able to suggest something.     Best Wishes,     Lisa, lisashetler@yahoo.com\n\n",

I am currently 17 years old in highschool and I have a curved penis. Please do not take this as a joke, because it is a problem that has grown bigger in my mind as I grow older. Will this problem prevent me from having sexual relationships with any girlfriend or wife that I may have?  I have read about a disease that causes the curvation of the penis and it appears that it generally appears in adults older then me, so I don't know why I have this. Is there a way that it can be cured? Any knowledge on this subject would be greatly appriciated. For an idea of the shape it would be comparable to a banana ( sorry for the bad description ). Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi johnh, No apology is necessary. Actually a curved penis is a little more common than most men realize. Conditions that cause curvature are penile injury, urethral stricture (narrowed urethral opening), Peyronie's disease (hardened scar tissue on the penis), Hypospadias (misplaced urinary opening). Mild curvature does not prevent a sexual relationship (unless of course anxiety over the symptom causes erection failure) nor does it cause infertility. I would suggest you have an evaluation by your physician who may refer you to a urologist for an evaluation. Please keep in mind that physicians see many \"imperfections\" so to speak which most of us have in one way or another. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for the great reply. I will contact my physician and have it looked at. Althought, I may have one other problem. When masterbating, the 'friction' I suppose against my penis can cause it to get irritated and swollen almost. I don't know what causes this, but gentle rubbing does not affect it at all. There is no errection problem though. I don't know how 'rough' sex may or may not be and once again hope that this problem can either be fixed or not a problem when having sex. Once again, sorry for the almost crudeness of my post, but I don't know of any other way to word it. Thanks\n\n",

Now regarding  the irritation problem during masturbation, if you are not using a lubricant (water based like KY lubricant) you may want to try it since it will reduce the irritation from friction. If an erection problem is not present now I would find it unlikely to be present during sexual intercourse. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

I have had a large red bump appear on the left side of the penis shaft and it has been there for about two months.  It location is in what i commonly like to call the penis sideburns, so im hoping it is an ingrown hair.  Is this a possiblity since it has been like two months.  I am not really worried about an STD since i have been with my girlfriend for 5 years, since grade school, and are both free of diseases in that catagory.  What in the world could this be and what could i do to get rid of it? How can i tell if its just an ingrown hair?  Thanks CaneHog\n\n",

There are new meds out that come in a pill form but the pill is actually like a little sponge and you pass the sponge part in your stool (the doctors forget to tell you this part) usually about 12 hours later. How about foods with seeds in them like okra? Usually a polyp will cause a secretion of mucus to be passed in the stool and will bleed easily, have you noticed either of these symptoms?  You definately should schedule a doctor\u2019s appointment with a Gastroenterologist if possible.\n\n",

    "content": "Since Christmas I have been suffering from chronic epitytimo orchitis. I have been hospitalised twice, and am now on my forth batch of antibiotics. Fortunately the constant nausea and feeling like I\u2019ve got a hangover resulting from a Year long drinking spree have passed, but my pain has not and my life has come to a stand still as a result. This is a reoccurrence of my condition. I became ill a year and a half ago for the first time, again for a period of three months. Fortunately now however I have a G.P. who is taking this flare up seriously (whereas a year ago, while treated by another doctor, my mental health was questioned, which I felt to be inappropriate and patronising and I was given little help), and we have formed an understanding regarding pain control. I have been taking dyhidrocoedine for two months now, and while I understand the dangers of taking such a drug, I feel the level of pain I\u2019m in allows for it at the moment before we start discussing a longer term solution. I\u2019m about to undergo an endoscopic examination, to be followed by a bladder pressure test.  I\u2019m trying to come to terms with two problems: the damage I\u2019m taking and possible loss of fertility, and   I\u2019m terrified this pain isn\u2019t going to go away. I feel like I'm dying. It\u2019s really making my life difficult, personally (I can\u2019t work, eat, sleep or sometimes I have to walk with crutches) and socially (at times I feel like I could kill).  Can anyone tell me of any techniques to relieve the pain? Such as exercise or diet? Would exercise help me or could it make me worse? At the moment I would consider anything, but I\u2019m trying to be as pragmatic as possible and know I can\u2019t keep taking the pills eternally. I understand it\u2019s likely that this illness will occur again (it\u2019s possible it stems from a problem from my kidneys), and I\u2019m afraid my pain will rumble on for years. I really need a solution. Thanks for reading, sorry if this has rambled, I\u2019m stoned and panicky. Any help would be aprecciated. I\u2019m 24, 5 foot 8 and weigh 8 stone btw.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,   Epididymo-Orchitis is usually due to viral or bacterial infection caused from a variety of things, surgery, catheterization, infection in the bowel or urinary tract or vas deferens and can be extremely painful as you know. The usual treatment is antibiotics for bacterial, immobilization of the scrotum with a jockstrap, pain relievers, ice packs applied to the scrotum and draining of abscesses if necessary.   Do you feel any soft lumps or fluid around the testes? Have your Health Care Providers checked for hydroceles or an abscess if that has not been done recently? The two most common causes of this in men are Chlamydia and Gonorrhea. Bowel bacterium Escherischia Coli and Tuberculosis infection can (in rare instances) also cause this.   The outlook is usually good once the cause is found and under control but it may take several months for your swollen testis to return to their normal size. In some cases they remain enlarged for life.   Can you go to a Urologist for care?\n\n",

The penis doesn't actually have a \"bone\" in it, there are two tubelike masses of tisssue called corpora cavernosa that run through the center of the penis. They become engorged with blood during sexual arousal which causes the penis the become erect and rigid. Each corpus cavernosum is covered with a fibrous sheath and this can be torn if bent wrong. In severe cases, the urethra can also be damaged, this it the tube that urine passes through. If he continues to have erection problems he will need to contact a Urologist for treatment and may require surgery to repair.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I know that you know what this is but for others that may read this I'll put a short description. Plus I can make sure we're talking about the same thing, is this what you have?  (NEJM) Mondor's disease is characterized by thrombophlebitis of the subcutaneous veins of the anterolateral thoracoabdominal wall. The condition is three times as frequent in women as in men and is usually benign and self-limited, although it has been associated with breast cancer.  Has your Doctor put you on  any nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs? Either over-the-counter or prescription? If not, this may be what you need.\n\n",

    "title": "Immediate Aching During Sexual Arousal",
    "content": "I have a problem with an aching pain in my testicles during sexual arousal.  The symptoms appear to be very similar to \"blue balls,\" but the problem is that the onset of pain occurs very quickly, sometimes less than fives minutes after I become aroused.  What confuses me even more is that this only happens when I am with a real person, which leads me to believe that it may be psychological.  My sexual experience with partners is severely hampered because of it.  Also, the pain intensifies greatly during orgasm and for several seconds afterward before finally fading away.  I'm not sure whether or not this is also a symptom of \"blue balls.\"  My testicles are often tender for several hours after this happens.  If orgasm is not achieved, the pain usually takes one or two hours to dissipate.  I have no idea whether or not this is related to the above problem, but I figured I'd mention it anyway. I have a problem where If I don't drink enough water, or if I hold my urine for an extended period of time, the end of my stream will lurch and become very cloudy, putting sediment into the toilet.  After this happens, I will experience a burning, and sometimes intense pain near my prostate and all the way up to the tip of my urethra.  This will last anywhere between 15 minutes to an hour, and seems to go away faster if I drink lots of water after it happens.  The reason I mention this is that if I don't achieve orgrasm after experiencing the above testicle pains, then the second problem will sometimes occur with great intensity  the next time I urinate, regardless of how much water I've had or how long I hold my urine.  Any help or advice would be very much appreicated, as I have had to deal with both problems for many years.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear andrew444,  I am sorry to hear about your erectile dysfunction. The Erectile dysfunction you describe can be due to more intercourse than you can handle or that you have relationship problems (attraction factor). But erection problems are common in adult men. In fact, almost all men experience occasional difficulty getting or maintaining an erection. In many cases, it is a temporary condition that will go away with little or no treatment.  I don't think its to be taken seriously as you are a young man. Ofthen older men experience such diffuculties due to high age which can result in some medical problems. It can also be due to insufficient foreplay, try some fellatio (male oral sex) before the love act.\n\n",

That is not to say that these claims are unfounded, its just that they may not have been adequately confirmed yet. The debate is still on with some for and some against. The theory states that when a woman climaxes within an hour of her partner\u2019s ejaculation, she retains significantly more sperm than she does after non-orgasmic sex. When a woman doesn\u2019t have an orgasm, little to no sperm is retained. One study by Levin R.J. looks at this issue differently: Click here!  Unfortunately, I cannot give you a clear decision on this one. What does your gynecologist have to say about this? Maybe someone else would like to elaborate by posting their opinion?\n\n",

    "content": "One year back I had undergone testosterone hormone replacement therappy as it was prescribed a physician after a blood test to see the levels.  He said I am having hypogonadism and  had used andriol tablets for three months during the treatment and the results during the treatment were better.  At present I am taking medicine for lowering cholesterol in the blood and ranitidine for duodenal ulcer in the stomach.  Doctor said to continue these medicine for one month.  Now after 10 days this tratment will be over.  My present problem is I am not getting erection and not having the desire for sex.  My age is 36 and that of my wife is 30.  My penis looks very very soft and is small.  Even if I do a massage it is very difficult for an erection.  I noticed some veins gathering on the left testicle but no pains.  It looks like a gathering of veins curled on the left side of the testicle.  Could you please advise what type of treatment I should undergo to solve my erection problem and which doctor I should consult.  Even if erection comes when she is around, it does not last and the strength is not enough to have sex.  I do not have any other physical or pshychological problems.  Are there any treatment available ? if yes please advise it will be a great help.  Thanks and regards,  Man\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Abdul-Nazer,   Thank you very much for the update.   Regarding your sexual problem, as discussed before, you look like you have a problem in your endocrine glands, having a low testosterone means that either the testicles are not producing any and this means that you either have a problem in your testicles and the treatment for this will be to take testosterone for the rest of your life and this will have to be under strict medical supervision.  The other possibility is that you might have a pituitary gland (the master gland that controls the testicles) or hypothalamus problems (the organ that controls the pituitary gland). In addition to checking the testosterone level in the blood, you have to have other hormones checked including fsh, lh and prolactin levels. This is mandatory because you might have a pituitary tumour.   You have to see an endocrinologist (specialist in endocrine glands).  Taking viagra might be beneficial once we know for sure that there is nothing else that should be dealt with.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Abdul-Nazer,  Thank you very much for the update.  The complete blood count are normal, the liver function tests are normal, the iron studies are normal, total cholesterol is just a little bit elevated but the good cholesterol is also elevated (so no need to worry), kidney function is normal, electrolytes (including calcium and magnesium) are normal. Urine analysis is normal.  Regarding the hormone profile, the thyroid functions, prolactin and testosterone, you have to provide us with the range of normal in the lab where these tests were done.   But in general, there is no problem with prolactin until it is above 20. The tsh looks normal. Regading the testosterone, i am not sure about the testosterone level that you sent and whether it is normal or not. Hormone levels have many pitfalls to their measurements and levels and you need to see an endocrinologist (a specialized doctor in hormones) to make sure that everything is in order and if your testosterone level is actually low and you need to take testosterone then he will be the one adjusting the dose. Please, no delays, see an endocrinolgist as soon as possible.  There is also one thing that i would like to suggest and that is to have a doppler ultrasound of the arteries of the penis to see whether there is a blockage.  If you are smoking, please, stop smoking.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.  Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

He had also applied an injection on the penis and the erection was full at that time.  The penis looks very soft most of the time.  However, the doctor said nothing to worry about the size of the left testicles and the viens gathering there.  the gathered viens are some what black shaded nerves and curled together and placed just below and around the left testicles.  For the right one there is no such nerve.  My lower abdomen is little fatty and I doing regular jogging to reduce the tummy.  Thanks a lot for your valuable advise and support as always.

    "content": "Hello: Unfortunately, what we are born with is what we are stuck with.  The reason the penis becomes erect is that it fills the spongy tissue in it with blood.  If there is an increase in the blood flow, the penis will appear larger.  However, drugs to increase the blood flow can be dangerous especially for individuals with hypertension or coronary disease.  Before taking any \"medications\", prescribed or not, it is important to have a thorough checkup by your doctor.  After all the purpose of having a large penis is to stay alive to enjoy it.

    "content": "I have question concerning my left testicle. I've always had a small tight scrotum. Tight for alot of the time. There are times when it is relaxed and loose. Which feels much better. Of course that is when it is very warm out. My problem is my left testicle is almost always either in what you call in the prescrotal area. Or almost equal time it is like popped up in me. I think that is the inguinal. I also want to say when I went through puberty I never developed in penis size or scrotum and testicle size like my male counterparts did. It is usually in the inguinal area then my scrotum is very tight and squeezing my testicles. I've consulted a physician before about this but they say I am just hung high. A very common problem. First of all is this a very common problem. Second of all should I just accept that I am hung high? I know it increases the chance of testicular cancer.   It is very uncomfortable when it is, how you say popped up inside me. From my description do you think there would be any hormonal treatment that could possibly force the testicle to descend in to the scrotum like is should be thus being much more comfortable to me. Plus is there any drug or hormone that may increase the size of my testicles and penis.   I know that is alot of information but it may not be enough. Please respond and if more info is needed I will be happy to give it to you. Thank you very much!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi!  It is my understanding that what you are suffering from could most probably be retractile testis, which, unlike undescended testis, produces sperms and testosterone normally. Undescended testis is fixed high up, while retractile ones go up and come down depending on the actions of the scrotum. Rarely after puberty do retractile testis need treatment. But in your case, it would be best to consult your urologist regarding a solution. I am not aware of testosterone in the treatment of retractile testis, but in pediatric patients retractile testis do respond to treatment with the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin. As I said, it is best to consult your urologist.  bill\n\n",

    "content": "Dear pooh_okcu: First of all there is no such thing as a normal number of times for a newly married couple to have sex.  The amount of sex a couple enjoys depends on many different things.  While it is true that younger ones often engage in sex more often than senior citizens it doesn't apply in all cases. You mentioned that both of you are busy and tired. While women are capable anantomically of having sex despite how they feel, men have to be able to have an erection to engage in sexual intercourse.  The fact that your husband is tired but seems able to have sex on his days off (the weekends) shows that his tiredness is affecting his ability to get aroused. If he is unable to get an erection because he is tired then talking to him about it will only make him feel worse and could cause him to have self-doubts about his sexuality. This is turn can prevent him from being aroused when he isnt tired and so then you have a chronic problem.  It goes like this...You nag, he cant get erect when tired, you nag more, he cant get erect when not tired.  Then what you end up with is NO SEX.   AS a  nurse and a married woman of 35 years I can tell you the best advice is to be patient. Don't approach him when you know he is tired, and wait for him to approach you when he is rested.  Showing him this consideration you may find brings you rewards.  For you might find that you may or may not have sex more often but the sex you do have will be much better. Thanks for using The Doctor's Lounge, Carolyn\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I am a 21 year old male who has been experiencing pain in my upper left testicle area and in the area at the base of my pelvis. I began experiencing the pain about 48 hours ago. (Incidentally shortly after sex) I also ran a cross country race in very slick conditions in the morning, and might have twisted or pulled something and not noticed it. It was sharp, and was made worse by walking, and was quite sensitive to the touch. I had epidiymitus last year, but the pain is different, their doesnt appear to be a swelling of the epidydimus, and I havent had any fevers or sick feelings. In the last twelve hours, a dark bruise has formed on the outer portion of the upper area of my scrotum. My question is should I be concerned about whats happening? Or should I simply take ibuprofin and wait for it to get better? Any help on this subject would be greatly appreciated!!  -Bernie\n\n",

    "content": "Hi.  My boyfriend is having some problems with his testicles.  He gets a pain that starts at the base of his right leg that shoot down his leg and then back up and the pain goes into his testicles.  Because of this he can't get and erection and it hurts him very much.    He has been to see one or two doctors who obviously have no clue.  One doctor sent him to a Chiropractor, that helped a back problem he had but not his testicles.  Another doctor sent him to a Acupuncturist and that didn't help either.    Each day his pain grows more and he doesn't know what to do.  He can work because the pain makes it almost impossible to walk.  He applied for worker's comp but they told him since all he has is pain they can't give it to him.  They said pain is only a symptom not a disease or disorder.    He has another doctors appt on the 31st but his pain grows worse each day and he fears the doctor won't know anything like that last few.  We were talking the other night and my boyfriend said he wondered if maybe it was a nerve problem, or maybe its because he works in a chemical plants and is exposed to numerous kinds and ammounts daily.  But he doesn't know.  Any advice or ideas?  If whoever replies could email me @ nilmatia@msn.com I would greatly appreciate it because I'm not always able to get onto the e group to check.  Thank you   Nilmatia\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Vinodh,  Normally, some semen gets out of the vagina after intercourse when the female sits and/or stands up. There is no problem with conception in this case provided that there are not other barriers for pregnancy.  But if all the semen comes out instantly after intercourse, this is a condition known as effluvium seminis and it is treated by putting a pillow under the female's back during intercourse and not let her sit or stand up for a while to give the semen a chance to fall back into the vagina.  If this does not work and still all the semen rushes out immeiately after intercourse, then your wife has to see a gynecologist for further management.

If I were to answer your question from a purely technical point of view: Then testicular ultrasonography has sensitivity of approximately 90% in your case (meaning it can detect up to 90% of clinically significant testicular lumps). Again, what is more important is the interpretation.  That said, if your symptoms should progress then you should seek a second opinion and possibly a new ultrasound.\n\n",

    "content": "Hey I'm a first time user and hope to get a more specific answer.  I was having sex with my girlfriend and I guess during the course of it I injuried my penis.  It hurt on one side for a day but it then went away.  The injury looks like a ridge on the side that is about 1mm high and about 1.5 cm long that runs along the width.  I for the first time had a \" severe\" panic attack that sent me to the hospital and the first time I went the doctor just relesed me so the next day my arms were feeling weird so I went to another ER room and got checked.  They sayed it was anexity disorder but I asked the ER doctor about my penis and he took a look but said it looked alright and he didn't seem too concerened about the condition.  A week later I went to a family doctor for a check up and too asked him about it and examined it a little closer(felt the ridge) and he said it was a bruise and showed me a diagram of what was injured and it will be ok.  I noticed though also a very slight ridge much less than the other on the other side but near the base.  My question is am I going to be ok because its been about 18days and I feel that it doesn't quite function the same way.  I notice morning's it is sorta hard but it doesn't get as hard as easily as it used too.  It never changed any colors or anything like that so I don't think it was severe.  I also wonder if it could be due to my uncertainty about it, which I think brought on the panic attack because it happened after I had sex.  I am currently on Paxil-CR (12.5 mg) for about a week and occasionally use a Xanex (.25 mg) average 1 a day sometimes none to treat the anexity and fear I have developed from that panic attack eposode.  I know that might have some to due with my sexual drive but how bad is the injury? Also it does work and I have no troubles having an orgasm but it is sometimes tough to get hard on \"demand\" like I felt it use too.  Sorry about length and thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Vinodh, There's no limit to the number of times you can have sex during the day. As long as both of you want it, then both of you can have it.  If you're wife is having a normal pregnancy, sex is considered safe during all stages of the pregnancy. A normal pregnancy is one that's considered low-risk for complications such as miscarriage or pre-term labor. Talk to your doctor, nurse midwife, or other pregnancy health care provider if you're uncertain about whether you fall into this category. Of course, just because sex is safe during pregnancy doesn't mean that a woman will necessarily want to have it! Many expectant mothers find that their desire for sex fluctuates during certain stages in the pregnancy. Also, many women find that sex becomes uncomfortable as their bodies get larger. You and your partner need to keep the lines of communication open regarding your sexual relationship.  Many women find that they lose their desire and motivation for sex late in the pregnancy - not only because of their size but also because they're preoccupied with the impending delivery and the excitement of becoming a new parent. This is when you as a husband should be understanding. Another important point is that many say that it may not be safe to have oral sex. Blowing air into the vagina has been associated with venous air embolism following orogenital sex during pregnancy. This can be fatal to both mother and fetus.  Regards,\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 31 year old male, 6'4\", 190, in good shape, smoke 10-12 cigarettes a day, rarely drink.  My girlfriend and I have recently started having sex.  It has hurt our relationship more than anything !  She is 5'6\", 115, petite.  We're frustrated beyond all belief b/c we cannot engage in extended foreplay at all before sex.  I will get fully erect when we begin, but when we 'play' I loose some of this.  She has no problem getting me back to the point where I can achieve penetration, as long as I don't have a condom on.  This means that once I am fully erect it is like a race to get the condom on and penetrate.  It limits the positions we can try b/c of this time factor.  About 1/3 of the time we end up loosing the race and I cannot penetrate her at all.  I'm still erect, I'm just not fully erect ... with her small frame and body construction I need to be very 'hard' for us to get anywhere.  Quickies are fine for us, some of the best sex that either of us have ever had, but we cant prolong it ...  she thinks that I am not that attracted to her, which is totally not true ... I just feel like an idiot. This has never happened to her or myself before.  She has been with men larger than I am and it works fine.  Personally, I have never had a problem like this before, thinking back on it though I don't believe that I have ever had to be fully erect to acieve penetration before.  I will become that way as sex progresses and I get that stimulation, but I don't think I have had to start off that way.  Another thing, I am allergic to her cats and take allergy meds before I go to her house, could this have anything to do with it? This is really hurting our relationship, she really doesnt think I am attracted to her and I know she still belives it no matter what I say or do !  Is there any help for me?  Something we are missing?  Soemone told me Viagra, I'm 31 !!! I have no problem getting excited, it's just really hard for me to stay fully erect to achieve penetration as we put on the condom, then the condom tones down everything so much that we have to REALLY work to get going again.  It's a freakin nightmare, great relationship being hurt by sex !!! UGH !\n\n",

    "title": "does this sound like erectile dysfunction?",
    "content": "I recently became intimate with the man I am dating. I knew something wasn't quite right the first time. He stopped in the middle of intercourse and said it was because I was too tight and that it hurt him. He didn't try again the rest of the night. The second time we tried, it didn't go anywhere, he wound up stopping again. He later tells me that he has not been able to sustain an erection for a year, but hadnt been to the doctor and was too ashamed and embarrassed to tell me.   I told him that it was okay and that he should go see a doctor to find out what was going on. Two days later, he tells me he went to the doctor and when I ask him about it, he is is pretty vague. He said that there was something wrong with his kidney and arteries and that there was a valve failure and that he needed to get an ultrasound and go under the knife.   I'm no medical professional, but I thought it seemed so sudden that after the first visit, that a doctor would recommend surgery. Is this a common treatment for erectile dysfunction? I thought perhaps the doctor would try to rule out other causes, such as psychological problems, testosterone levels, etc. before recommending surgery. I was just wondering if anyone could shed some light on this for me. I would like to ask my boyfriend again, but I have the distinct feeling he will be offended or put off by my pointed questions. Thanks in advance.\n\n",

I would be in a better position to understand the situation if I came to know the tests undergone by your boyfriend before his doctor came to the conclusion of \"kidney\" and \"valve\" problems.  Reading your description, it is obvious that your boyfriend has been indistinct about his problems. I wouldn't assume on his doctor with such unclear narration of what transpired between them. But you are right when you say that erectile dysfunction needs some workup to rule out its various causes including psychogenic, before a definitive surgery targeting a specific cause.  We really need to get our facts straight before jumping into conclusions.  Warm regards,  Bill\n\n",

We have been married for 4 months and there is no problems with attraction. The times when he can't get an erection he simply just can't...without trying very hard, and then it won't last long at all. This has only been going on for 4 days, but it is enough to scare him and me. He had been smoking pot for about 10 months just about everyday, but he has decided to cut back and has only been smoking once in a while for the last few weeks, and not very much when he does. Could this be a reason for this happening? We currently do not have medical insurance so he can not go to the doctor, so I really really need your help. All answers will be greatly appreciated and looked into! Thanks a lot\n\n",

One incident that might be directly associated is an event while working out at the gym.  I was running on my 5th mile on the tread mill when I felt this urgent feeling to pea.  While urinating I felt a lot of pain and a little blood.  I was scared but did not see a doctor.  The incident has not occurred since.  I thought it was a kidney stone.  Could this have caused urethral stricture and be the cause of my blood in semen?

    "content": "Hi!  Blood in the semen is called hematospermia. As you rightly pointed out, for most patients with this symptom, no further diagnostic workup is needed. But for some it might be the first indicator of a urological disorder, probably of the prostate glands or urethra or seminal vesicle. Infections, trauma, and other systemic illnesses like hypertension, liver diseases, bleeding disorders may also contribute.   While often perceived as a symptom of little significance, blood in the ejaculate can cause great concern to the men who experience it. One should consult a doctor if:  1. Age is more than 40. 2. Recurrent hematospermia in more than 10 ejaculations. 3. Hematospermia for more than 2 months. 4. Presence of blood in the urine associated with hematospermia.  Considering your age, and the duration and recurrence rate of your symptom, and the fact that you do not have blood in the urine presently, I would safely remain in your situation. But if one were to be 100% sure of good health, it would be prudent to have a visit to your doctor and have the workup.   Once again reiterating that there is no cause for alarm here,  I remain.  With warm regards,  bill\n\n",

    "title": "Testicular Growth",
    "content": "Hi, I'm 20 years old and recently a lump formed on my left testicle. I first noticed it in October and have had it examined by three different doctors, none of which were able to feel it during examination. It is about the size of a pea, and is located on the bottom of the testicle.  It is definetly something new, and has never been there before. The reason I haven't just accepted the doctors' diagnoses is because, none of them were even able to find it. But the reason they couldnt feel it was because, basically doctors offices are usually cold and, my scrotum ends up shrinking in the cold (obviously) and when that happens, the position my testicle in changes, and it makes the doctors attempt at finding the lump far more difficult.  It is definetly not part of the epididymis since i can feel the entire area around the lump which is the regular smooth feeling of the testicle.  It is not attached to anything. It doesn't really hurt at all but, every so often i feel a pain that sort of shoots up from the area into my stomach.  I heard that there is some way that if I exposed my testicles to a flashlight, that somehow the light can help show me whether somethings wrong or not. May sound far-fetched but, I don't know. Thats why I am posting this!! I need some help! Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi!  Masturbation does come under the broad disorder of paraphilia not otherwise specified. If intense recurrent sexual urges involving specific acts happen for longer than 6 months, the term paraphilia is used. There are different kinds of paraphilias, and masturbation is one of them.  Masturbation is sexual self-gratification. It is not done by just some, but by most in one or other occasions in a lifetime. Only when it is done to such an extent, so as to affect one's normal life activities, or bring harm to self or others, would it be a 'disease.' Masturbation as a paraphilia usually occurs between the ages 15 and 25.  One way of helping oneself out of the clutches of masturbation is to avoid situations that generate initial desires, like pornography. Many believe that paraphilias develop in patients who lack the ability to develop relationships. Working on issues such as developing intimacy, carrying on conversations with others, etc., provide channels. But by the time one is of age, marriage would seem best to reflect on a relationship developed, sexual gratification being one of the functions of marriage. Until such times, discussing with peers and friends regarding the issue, and finding out if others are in the same boat as you are, would ease your situation to feel less guilty about the whole thing.  If everything fails, psychotherapy by a psychiatrist would help paraphilia.  Warm regards,  Bill\n\n",

Upon his birth in 1991, he has got a right scrotal hernia with undescended testicle. 50 days after his birth we have done the hernia operation for him. The surgeon also lays and extend the testicle to it extreme location but it is still in the inguinal canal and not in the scrotum.  When he was of 3 years old, the urinary tracts surgeon explore his situation and said that the undescended testicle was small in size and his opinion is that the boy did not need further surgery.  When he was of 12 years, the surgeon touch the right testicle in the canal and said that it was moved a little in the direction toward the scrotum but it is still out side it in the canal. The sonar U/S report shows that:  -\tLeft test : normal size ( 14/20/9 mm ), seen in situe. -\tRight test : small size ( 7/5/6 mm ), seen in the scrotum but highly up not in siute.                Both show no fluid collection.          CONCLUTION :  small right test. not in situe.  The surgeon advice us to continuo explore his situation periodically.  Now, he was of 13 years old, we took for him the sonar U/S report which shows that:            CONCLUSION: -\tRight testicle: mal descent \u201c post operative after birth\u201d is seen in the inguinal canal and measured 19 x 7 mm in diameter. -\tLeft testicle: Normal size and echogenicity and measured        10 x 26 mm in diameter.  The important note best to our knowledge, that the size of the right testicle grows to a considerable measure, and it advanced in the canal toward the scrotum but it is still out side it. The opinion of the surgeon now is to do a surgery operation to download the testicle to the scrotum and he expects that may be it will functionally work like left normal testicle. We need to know your kind opinion in addition we have some questions as well. Our questions are: -\tIs the surgery operation now useful to make the testicle of (19 x 7) mm to work normally in the future? -\tIs the surgery consists of one operation only, or it may need more than one operation? -\tOther opinion says that it make no difference if you leave it as it with out need to surgery as it is of small size? Please, it too kind of you and highly appreciated if you could help us and advise us in this subject with our kind regards.  S. HUSSAIN salnaseri@yahoo.com\n\n",

    "content": "Hi!  Cryptorchidism [undescended testis] is what we are dealing with here. I find that you have already had your briefings with the urologist, and as such, your queries are on controversial areas in urology.   **************** \"Is the surgery operation now useful to make the testicle of (19 x 7) mm to work normally in the future?\"  I doubt if you will find straightforward answers to your questions. Nevertheless, I do know that as your urologist suggested, it would be possible that the smaller testicle may function better with another surgery.    \"Is the surgery consists of one operation only, or it may need more than one operation?\"  As to how many more surgeries would be required, it might depend on the state of the testicle presently and the outcome of the efforts to anchor it.   \"Other opinion says that it make no difference if you leave it as it with out need to surgery as it is of small size?\"   Infertility and malignancy are two risks of cryptorchidism. Only about 10% of men with history of unilateral cryptorchidism develop infertility, a rate which is similar to that found in other studies in the general population. From this statistics, it can be concluded that leaving the maldescended testis alone would make little difference in terms of infertility.  Surgery is not protective against the development of future malignancy. Periodic exploration, as your doctor suggested, and biopsy of the undescended testis is recommended for early detection and management of cancer. Again, we find that it makes not much difference if we decide to operate knowing well that it will not prevent this risk. ********************  I see that you are facing difficult questions here. The need of the hour is hope and trust in the origin of us all. Whatever we decide upon, we have the best intentions at heart, and whatever the outcome, let us pray for strength to face any consequence of our better intentions.  Praying for the best to come out of the future of your son,  I remain   With warm regards,  bill\n\n",

    "content": "Hi!  These are some of the relevant lines of articles that might interest you.  'For men whose impotence is caused by psychological factors, Viagra (Sildenafil Citrate) has been shown to work in 90% of these cases. For impotence that is traced to a biological cause, Viagra has a 60%-70% rate of effectiveness. This is even true in cases of spinal cord injury, or in men who have had their prostates removed.'  [ http://www.paralinks.net/sexualitysci.html ]  \"Erectile Dysfunction caused by difficult-to-treat etiologies such as radical prostatectomy, severe diabetes, and spinal cord injury have demonstrated efficacy.\" ('Sildenafil: a 4-year update in the treatment of 20 million erectile dysfunction patients.' - December 2003, Current Urology Report journal )   \"Existing evidence suggests that oral sildenafil is a highly effective and well-tolerated treatment for Erectile Dysfunction associated with SCI.\" ( 'Efficacy and safety of sildenafil citrate (Viagra) in men with erectile dysfunction and spinal cord injury: a review.' - September 2002, Urology journal)  From these statements we can come to a reasonable conclusion that viagra works for most patients, but there could be individual variation with some who might not find it utterly useful.  Hope this helps.  Warm regards,  - Bill\n\n",

    "content": "Winkychick, Penile discharge is commonly the sign of a sexually transmitted disease (STD), and requires prompt and accurate diagnosis and treatment. There are two main types:Gonococcal urethritis: (Gonorrhoea which is an STD) Non-gonococcal or non-specific urethritis (NSU).Causes of NSU are:Chlamydia trachomatis (25-60 per cent). Mycoplasma genitalium (up to 25 per cent).  Ureaplasma urealyticum (15-25 per cent).  Trichomonas vaginalis (17 per cent).  Herpes simplex (rarely).Routine tests are not available to detect all of these infections, so the cause of the NSU might not be found. In some patients, no sexual contact has occurred and the symptoms are blamed on irritants, soaps or detergents, but no firm evidence exists to support this theory.  It is essential that sexual contacts of men with gonococcal urethritis and NSU are traced and treated, preferably in an STD clinic. Without treatment of sexual contacts, recurrence is likely and treatment will probably fail. Pregnant or potentially pregnant sexual partners should not be given erythromycin or tetracycline antibiotics (including doxycycline).\n\n",

This subsequently causes blockages and dilation of the vein. It is typically painless, but can be painful. In studies, patients were noted to have thrombophlebitis after a prolonged sexual act with or without intercourse. It was described as cord-like thickening of the superficial penile veins.   Diagnosis is via ultrasound which shows blockage of the vessels. Treatment is with anti-inflammatories (i.e. aspirin or ibuprofen) and most resolve within 4-6 weeks. If it persists, then surgery may be necessary. A referral to a urologist would be reasonable.   Followup with your personal physician is essential. Regards,\n\n",
