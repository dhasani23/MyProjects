    "content": "Hi, Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation has been observed as a frequent complication in inactive HBV carriers at time of chemotherapy or post-chemotherapy. This is a severe complication frequently seen in  patients with  lymphomas.(Lamivudine have efficacy to treat the patients once the clinical disease is apparent. Lamivudine prophylaxis beginning before chemotherapy and until at least for 6 months after the end of chemotherapy is recommended for all HBV carriers).  It appears that effects of cancer chemotherapy in patients with HBV infections has been better studied and more well known than in HCV infections.   Some studies have observed that Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (which often goes undiagnosed in asymptomatic carriers), may become clinically relevant during periods of immunosuppression or severe illness. There have been some reports showing the significance of HCV infection in patients being treated with chemotherapy.  Some researchers have found that chemotherapy dose delays or  need for dose reductions occurred in those with Hepatitis C:  Liver disease affects cancer chemotherapy by - Poor drug metabolism and   \u2013 myelosuppression, leading to poorer outcomes.  The current treatment standard for Hepatitis C (interferon and ribavirin combination therapy) is also known to initiate myelosuppression. With decreases in bone marrow activity, recovery becomes a huge challenge.  Experts in this field have suggested that more integration between the fields of hepatology and oncology will be necessary in the management of such patients - thus improving outcomes. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Lakexpert,  In general, non-steroidal anti inflammatory medications (such as ibuprofen and naproxen).  The class of non-steroidals known as COX 2 inhibitor (such as celebrex, vioxx, etc.) are reported to have less side effects, including less GI irritation.  These medications are often useful in arthritis type illnesses.  More specific treatment depends on the underlying cause of your pain.  You may want to see a rheumatologist for further evaluation if you are able.  This way you can get recommendations for a specific treatment plan that is taylored to your situation.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Iam a 25 year old female from Canada who was diagnosed with Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (1.3 cm, Grade 1, Node Negative, ER+ PR+) in September 2006. I underwent a modified radical mastectomy and sentinal node biopsy in September. No family history of breast cancer and no other cancers in the immediate family. I began chemotherapy November 17th, 2006: 4 cycles of Adriamycin and Cytoxin every 3 weeks.   During the 1st treatment I was prescribed Zofran and Stemetil for nausea. Nausea and Vomiting persisted for 4 days and on the 4th day I took a reaction to the Stemetil (muscle spasms of the jaw and clenching teeth). During the second treatment I was again prescribed Zofran and Ativan in addition and was told to take Gravol with Ativan as needed. The nausea and vomiting were worse this time and I ended up in hospital with extreme dehydration. My oncologist then told me that many people find that Cannabis a very effect relief from nausea. He said that he could prescribe the pill form of marijuana, but he said it doesn't work as well as the inhaled form of the drug. I decided not to use it in fear of taking some other reaction.  As I enter my 3rd treatment, I am now being prescribed Zofran and Decadron. The doctors tell me this is the last option. I am wondering what you think of marijuana use as a form of anti-emetic. I am also wondering if marijuana could possibly interact with any of the above drugs I am taking (AC chemo, Zofran, Gravol, Ativan, or Decadron).   Your advice would be appreciated. Thanks.\n\n",

I am not aware of interactions; however, there is not good cross reference data for marijuana as it is not a prescribable drug in most places.  I have looked up the interactions between marinol (the pill form of marijuana) for all of the drugs with the exception of Gravol which I am not familiar with.  There are no reported interacttions.  As with all medications, combining any medication should be done with caution and under the the supervision of a physician.  Rare interactions are always possible, even though they are not reported.

After my last AC I had a horrendous hand foot reaction where my hands swelled out very badly and peeled multiple layers(im now losing my finger nails). I was put on prednisone 50 mg declining dose for 2 weeks which i finished about the 2nd week of Jan. Immediately after I began to get the following symptoms, horrid salty bitter taste in mouth feeling like fumes , very foamy and thick saliva( i can blow bubbles from my mouth), pain below my sternum and extending to the right side  under right breast in rib area (the pain is sharp and the area is tender), an gaggy feeling(depnding on how i sit), the pain will fluctuate depending on how i sit ie if i put my legs up incresing pressure then it hurts more, i find white stuff around my lips constantly and my mouth is really dry , my nose is running like a tap and white stuff crusts around the opening, I also feel much weaker than i did when i was on the chemo(which is saying alot). I also had small pustules in my vagina but 4 days of diflucan seemed to clear that up. I had blood work taken and my liver functions were slightly elevated altho my gp felt that was as a result of the chemo, prednisone and diflucan. I had an endoscopy which was neg for disease or infection(they thought about yeast at first).I don't have heartburn nor do i have indigestion(altho they've had me on nexium for the past 3 weeks) I don't know where to go from here...I feel like im on a merry go round and am suffering big time\n\n",

He has undergone two cycles of chemotherapy with oral 5-FU (Xeloda) and carboplatin. After the first cycle, the enlarged node in his neck, which had been about the size of an olive, was no longer palpable. Since we were told there was only a 50% chance of responding to chemo, this was very good news. But we would like to know if this is very unusual, or if the oncologist just wanted to be over-optimistic. Does this suggest that he may experience a durable remission? Is it possible for the cancer to disappear from the CT scan altogether? Most studies seem to indicate a survival time of only 9 months for people in his situation.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello hsmith, I am happy to hear that your husband has responded well to his chemotherapy. It is unusual to get responses of this nature with gastric cancer, but it is not impossible. Current literature points to possible response rates of up to 70% to xeloda in patients who have favorable thymidine phosphorylase (TP) and dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) expression profiles. These enzymes are involved in the metabolism of the xeloda. Patients who TP positive and DPD negative showed the highest response rates. Please refer to this abstract for further information: Click here! It should be noted that a relationship doesnt always exist between response and survival. Many drugs produce durable remissions without affecting the overall survival of the patient. That said however, it is not known if the subset of patients included in the above trial who had the highest response rates had a survival benefit as well or not. Let's hope for the best, baring in mind that the speed and extent of your husband's response looks very promising and is infact an achievement in its own right.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you ver much. You mentioned two things that have puzzled me, however. The first is--why does remission not correlate with survival? I have heard this many times, and it is counterintuitive to think that a durable remission would not mean longer survival. Do the patients die of other things? Does the cancer become more aggressive when it returns, and thus wipe out the time gain of the remission? It is sometimes very difficult to made sense out of statistics, when looking at an indivisual case like ours. After all, my husband was not supposed to survive for five years post surgery in the first place, and had been pronounced \"cured\" with a clear CT scan only a few months ago. Second, if tests for enzymes like the one you mentioned can predict response to chemo drugs so well, why are they not used to help select which drugs to use? Is it merely the cost that makes them impractical? I have heard of tests on tumor cells that can show which drugs might be most effective, but our oncologist just dismissed these as useless.

    "content": "Your question regarding the relation between responses in general and survival is a good one. However, it isn't a question that would be easy to answer. Bare in mind, like you suggestions that alot of the evidence that we use in decision making is based on clinical trials and statistics. These are just what the numbers say. The results of all these clinical trials up till now have not shown an improvement in overall survival in patients receiving these drugs. They have shown varying responses however. Also note, that in designing these trials, investigators are faced with many problems including which patients to include and which to exclude. If one trial includes patients with a better chance of surviving (better prognosis) than another trial that would shift the survival curve and patients in that trial would have a better overall survival. Since it is not completely known till now all that constitutes better prognostic factors we don't always know what to make of the numbers presented to us. All that can be said is that till now the numbers have not shown an improved survival by taking these drugs but have shown variation in responses. As to what happens to patients that have undergone a good response later in the course of their disease. I would have to answer that on a purely emperical basis. Some patient's however, undergo rapid fatal recurrence. Why are these tests not done in all patients? The trial I have referred to above is a phase II trial. Meaning that it is in the second phase of drug testing. This trial needs to be verified by larger Phase III trials in order to be confirmed. Does this mean that the abstract results are not significant? On the contrary they are very significant but we have to be careful at this stage and wait for the verfication trials. Finally, like you said earlier it is very difficult to make sense out of statistics, when looking at an indivisual case. Statistics give you a general idea there are many exceptions that are not explained by them.\n\n",

What treatment options have they recommended?  I cannot cite for you the specific incidence of head and neck cancers among patient who have received a solid organ transplnatation.  Independent of other risk factors for various cancers (i.e.- smoking), patients on immunosuppressive therapy after a solid organ trasnplantation are at increased risk for various cancers.  This may be due to the immunosuppressive therapy interfering with the body's immune surveillane which does play a role in eradicating cancerous cells.  Can you post more information about your husband's situation?  Jeff Gordon, M.D.\n\n",

They let me watch procedure and film...It is right on the vocal cord and very prominent, although described by them as \"small.\"   He has 10 yr. history of cigarette smoking (pack or less per day) but stopped 7 or 8 yrs ago.  No alcohol usage for over 15 yrs.   First heart attack @ age 46 resulted in quad. bypass-six months later angioplasty on one artery despite strictest of diets.  Cholesterol meds of little help.  Triple bypass @ age 51.  Full arrest six yrs later when I gave CPR 'til paramedics arrived-shocked several times before transporting to nearest hospital, then airlifted to major one.  V-tach 2 days later, then another.  Stroke suffered during full arrest clearing within 10 hours, w/no residual affects.   Two yrs later underwent nephrectomy for very small  renal cell carcinoma in order to get on transplant list.  With new head of transplant team, that hospital later refused to add him.  Seeking others we learned of one in Louisiana & he was put on that one.   To tell you how tough he is...casually ask me to drop him by ER where he was immediately admitted to CICU & at 4:00 am next morning a partial catherization was done.  (They were afraid to do full cath.)  He had only ONE artery open & it was 90% occluded!   Doctors were incredulous that he had walked into ER.   I was told at that point that nothing could be done if that one occluded, and I should call in family. as it was highly likely to do so.  Cardiac assist pump \"installed\" but Drs. stated 3 days was max on it.   We flew thru lightening storm by air ambulance to LA. with perfusionist & other medical staff.   Kept on pump there for 19 days before being weaned off.  Four months later he got new heart, but 11th day after transplant developed perforated ulcer & was rushed back for that surgery. Thus my screen name!   I am a  person of great Faith, and he depends on me to interpret medical jargon, so have tried to learn all I can about prevailing conditions.   Monitor him closely without alarm and help him face what he must with positive outlook by keeping his focus where it will be serve him.   Often make him laugh by telling him I'm afraid he'll be kidnapped for new body parts & scrap metal. SO appreciate it if you will give me the unvarnished truth.\n\n",

The use of illegal drugs and alcohol will almost invariable complicate the interferon treatment and will add to the potential risks of interferon treatment.  In my practice, if someone is using ilegal drugs and using alcohol to an excessive amount, then I would have serious problems recommending the use of interferon.  I am not saying that interferon in the case that you describe shoudl be stopped.  rather, if the doctors caring for the patient do not know about the use of illegal drugs and alcohol, then they should know.  Fourth,  the best thing that can be done is to have the patient seek drug and alcohol addicition therapy.\n\n",

There are excellent drugs to help minimize or prevent the development of chemotherapy during or immediately after chemotherapy.  Some chemotherapy drugs have a higher risk of causing nausea than others do, so different anti-emetic strategies are used for different types of chemo treatments.  Palonosetron has the longest half-life of the other drugs related to it, so appears to provide a longer level of anti-emetic support.  I have not yet used it since it was approved several months ago.  I would consider it only if current anti-emetic drugs being used during chemo treatments are not working.  If a current anti-emetic drug is working, then there may be no additional benefit to replace it with palonosetron.  If a current anti-emetic drug is not working or only working partially, then consideration for using palonosetron is reasonable.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Drf, To quickly answer your questions:  1. Yes you are right for a drug to become approved for human use it has to have undergone in-vivo studies. It takes 12 years on average for an experimental drug to travel from lab to medicine chest. Only five in 5,000 compounds that enter preclinical testing make it to human testing. One of these five tested in people is approved. As a matter of fact drug approval goes through two main phases: 1. Preclinical phase: invitro studies: Assess safety and biological activity 2. Clinical phase: This phase is further subdivided into 4 phases phase I: Determine safety and dosage phase II: Evaluate effectiveness, look for side effects. phase III: Verify effectiveness, monitor adverse reactions from long-term use.  Additional 2.5 years for review and approval of FDA. phase IV: Additional Post marketing testing required by FDA.  Question2: No not all antineoplastic drugs work in the same manner as a matter of fact many tumors are resistant to most antineoplastics. Another area you may want to research is the area of the multidrug resistance gene (MDR).  Good luck,\n\n",

    "content": "Dr Fouad,  thank you for your reply.    Maybe I wasn't clear enough first time around.  Whilst ara-a was well known for use in leukemia, would isolated reports on cell lines from other neoplastic strains, such as LePage's 1976 article linking treatment to a lymphosarcoma cell line, 1/ invariably lead oncologists towards in vivo studies in these other conditions or 2 / is there little inference to be drawn from results seen in isolated cell lines, as within the context of multiple testing some cell lines will always show up positive results.  I suppose my real question is, if one tested 15 adenoca cell lines and one experimental line showed some reaction even though the others didn't, would there be an inititive to attempt in vivo studies with the drug against adenoca's?  I just can't seem to follow the developmental trains from in vitro to in vivo, even though studies in vitro show positive effects, in vivo studies don't seem to mirror which neoplasms are assessed.  I can't find any real correlation!  I hope this makes some more sence  thanks  R\n\n",

    "content": "I agree with Dr. Fouad, yes any drug has to go through all these phases before approval. The point is that in the preclinical phase the drug passes from the invitro studies (e.g. cell cultures) to invivo studies in animals. Ofcourse the results of cell lines are not always reflected in invivo studies because of many factors. Eg. cells inside the body in each organ are under the control of many factors that cannot be applied in cell cultures and this is the reason for the contradictory results between in vitro and in vivo.   Now to jump from cell line studies to invivo experimental studies most of your cell line results should draw the same conclusion. From that point you can take it to the next step which involves animal studies before you jump into the clinical phase (humans).\n\n",

    "title": "Sarcoma",
    "content": "A desmopladtic small cell tumor usually affects adolescents and adults of young age.  The common part of the body affected is the abdomen and usually surgery is not undertakne since the tumor is located in multiple locations and may well be widespread in the abdomen.  There is a chromosomal finding in this disease: a  translocation between chromosomes # 11 and 22.  This is a distinct translocation form that seen in Ewing's sarcoma.  A diagnosis of a specific type of sarcoma should be done by a trained Pathologist who is versed in the complexities and challenges of sarcomas.  Before calling a sarcoma a desmoplastic small cell tumor, it is imperative that a thorough Pathology analysis be done since sometimes various types of sarcomas look alike.  For my patients with sarcomas, I have a Pathologist at a sarcoma center review the pathology.\n\n",

    "content": "Most chemotherapy drugs are dosed based upon body surface area (BSA) using height and weight in a calculation. Some drugs are dosed just based upon weight. For the case of carboplatin, given that it is cleared by the kidneys, a different calculation is used that takes into account a person's intrinsic kidney function (called creatinine clearance). Thus, the area under the curve (AUC) has been developed to better calculate the dose of carboplatin than could be calculated if just BSA were used.\n\n",
