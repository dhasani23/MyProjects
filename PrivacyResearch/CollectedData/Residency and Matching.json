    "content": "I liked Essay Edge, but remember - they don't write for you, they edit! It's expensive, and honestly I don't think it's important enough to pay for. Residencies want to see your board scores, grades, and  letters of recommendation. A personal statement most likely isn't even read until after youve been granted an interview. Good luck!\n\n",
