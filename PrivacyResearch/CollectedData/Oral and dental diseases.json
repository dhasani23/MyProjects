    "title": "Re: Sore White Node On Tip Of Tongue",
    "content": "Hi, From your description, the exact location of the lesion and the type of papilla that you are referring to are not clear.In diagnosing lesions over the tongue, a clinician has to go by - the history, - the morphology of the lesion and - digital palpation(especially to look for \"induration\"-which may indicate a malignant lesion and in 'whitish' lesions, and also to see if the whitish 'lesion' can be easily wiped off or not).  Therefore, i will confine myself to a brief account on some of the probable lesions.  - Hypertrophied foliate papillae: located over the posterior part of the lateral borders of the tongue.These may enlarge due to infection or chronic irritation and cause concern. - Hypertrophied circumvallate papillae: These papillae, 8-12 in number, are located over the dorsum of the tongue in a 'V' shape at the junction of the oral and oropharyngeal parts of the tongue. When hypertrophied, they frequently mimic a malignant tumor. - Glossodynia: seen mostly in > 50y old women, is said to be associated with cancerophobia. Affected individuals may complain of an itching sensation over the tip and adjoining lateral borders of the tongue.The fungiform papillae are enlarged and the area appears raised and red. This condition also may be associated with a number of other diseases (iron deficiency anemias, pernicious anemia, candidiasis, diabetes mellitus, xerostomia, lichen planus etc). - minor salivary gland tumors. - malignant tumors (squamous cell carcinoma, lymphoepithelioma, lymphomas as well as others)  Although some of the lesions mentioned may not be intrinsically 'whitish' in color, they may get coated by food particles and aquire such an appearance.   In managing these lesions, generally, the threshold for biopsy is understandably low. Any such lesion, which persists beyond a reasonable period of conservative measures must be biopsied. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I am a 21-year-old female, and I do not drink or smoke. I am in relatively good health, although I do suffer from mild asthma and acid reflux, which has not acted up since June.   This week I bit the back of my tongue (accidentally, of course), and when I tried to investigate the healing process today, I noticed a white bump on the underside of my tongue, with about a 0.5cm diameter. It does not hurt, and although there appears to be some redness around the white area, it has not impeded my eating or drinking of any type of food. I was wondering whether or not what I'm noticing is a version of the common canker sore, or if it is something that I should take more seriously.  My family does not have a serious history of cancer, although my uncle passed away from a brain tumour four years ago. Along with this white spot, I also noticed small amounts of blood emerging with mucous expulsions from my nasal cavity. I was also wondering if these phenomena were related, and if you recommend professional evaluation.  Thank you for your time, UTGal\n\n",

    "content": "I have always had reoccurring breakouts of what I assumed were canker sores inside my mouth. I know that cold sores (caused by herpes) are generally found on the outside of the mouth, but I've read conflicting reports on whether they occur on the gums or not. I also read conflicting reports on whether canker sores appear on the gums or not. Some say they do, others say they don't.   I have had ulcers break out in my mouth everywhere from my tongue, my cheeks, the base of my gums, and the inside of my lip. They have all the appearances of a canker sore. White coating, red halo...I have never had a breakout outside of my mouth. Which is where cold sores typically break out.  I know that canker sores aren't contagious while cold sores are. Recently my boyfriend had an ulcer come out at the base of his gums. It had a white coating and looked like the ones I have gotten. But he's never had canker sores before, so now I'm worried that maybe what I've always thought are canker sores are actually cold sores...  So, to clarify my question. Can canker sores break out on the base of your gum or not? Could I possibly have cold sores?\n\n",

    "content": "I have what FEELS like a canker sore, inside of my mouth, against the back of the cheek, about 1/2 cm. below the point where the cheek meets my gums.  It is slightly higher up then the surface of my top row of teeth, so I don't think it was caused by tooth-to-cheek friction.  I know what a canker sore looks like, but I can't look at it in a mirror because it is so high up, so I cannot say if it looks like a normal canker sore.  I can only feel it with my tongue.  I've had them in the past, but only on the inside of my lip.  Therefore, I don't know if they can appear in the location I describe.  The sore is not round, but oblong shaped, approximately 1.5 cm. long, and slightly raised from the surface of the cheek.  This sore is painful to pressure, suction (via cigarette or drinking straw), and mouthwash.  I woke up with it 4 days ago and it does not seem to be improving.  Any insight would be appreciated.\n\n",

This morning I found a flashlight and was able to stretch my cheek out enough to finally see it in a mirror, and it does indeed look exactly like the typical canker sores I used to get inside my lower lip as a kid.  So, hopefully, it will clear up in the same manner as canker sores of my past.  Sadly, I cannot afford to be treated by a professional right now.  I'll have to stick with some vitamin B12, liquorice root and milk of magnesia and hope it helps.\n\n",

    "content": "I have had a green \"slime\" on the top of my tongue for quite some time.   Using my fingernail I can scrape it off, although not completely. The severity seems to wax and wane, although it is always there. I am pretty orally hygenic, have missed brushing every once in awhile but not often.  I first noticed it about a month ago, and my mother who is an FNP thought it was a yeast infection, so I started taking Fluconazole. It did not help.   Afterwards I tried taking an adult probiotic, just to see if that helped. It did not. Vigorously brushing and using mouthwash seems to help, but still cannot get it to go away.  I plan on going to a doctor as soon as I have money, as this doesn't seem to be a life-threatening symptom, but it is still rather gross and something i'd like fixed, or at least to have an idea on what it is.  Also, I do not smoke nicotine, rarely (as in once a month, if that) smoke cannabis, drink with friends maybe once/twice a month, and sexually inactive for quite some time. Pretty fit and healthy otherwise, although living in a damp climate like where I live has not been good for my sinuses, which i'm not sure has anything to do with this.  I have had sinusitis twice, and surgery twice.\n\n",

When these get sorrounded by mycelial threads of certain fungi such as Aspergillus Niger, a black,furry tongue results. Candida albicans also can produce a similar picture.  Chlorophyll containing chewing gums have been sited as a reason for conferring the green colour seen some cases with this condition.Antibiotic therapy is a prominent risk factor.  Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Background: Female Age: 28 Never had a single cavity, filling, or any other form of work done on my teeth. Wisdom teeth have never been removed. Very good health, physically active, married 10 years. Have mild asthma, treated by rescue inhaler Non-smoker and non-drinker Do not take any medications regularly  For the past 7 years I thought a knot in my front mandible was a Mandibular Torus. It grew slowly and has been painless. However I have come to find out in recent days, after a trip to the Mayo clinic in Rochester, MN for a biopsy, that it is a rare tumor called a Odontogenic Myxoma. I have been informed that they will be doing a block excision that will also includes the removal of 6 of my front teeth. They will not be doing a bone graft as it will need to be monitored over the next 3-5 years to watch for recurrence. I will be fitted with some kind of a bridge over the missing  area of jaw bone about a month after surgery, and eligible for implants after 2 years.  These recent developments have me wondering a few things.  1) How rare is this tumor. I asked one of the 2 surgeons who will be doing my surgery this question and she was unable to say, but just stated it was very rare. That she had never seen it before. The second surgeon who has been in this field 30+ years spoke as though he had only seen it twice, and both cases the patient was quite deformed in the mouth by the time he treated them. I have tried to look up some statistics online, however the most I have been able to find is a few sites stating .07 people for every 1 million. But I am unsure how reliable these sources are.  2) When I have have a block excision of the tumor and the removal of the 6 teeth, what kind complications should I expect by not having a graft of any kind to replace the missing area of my jaw? Will I be able to talk? Are there any pictures of people who have had a block excision this large in the front mandible to give me an idea of how little or how much I should be expecting to have left of my mouth when I come out of surgery? I'm a bit concerned something this extensive being missing from my mouth for this long my frighten my children and I just want to get an idea of what I may look like afterward.  I have attached an x-ray done of the tumor a few weeks ago. I have been in for a full work up of CT scans (with and without the iodine IV), chest x-rays, blood work and biopsies. It took the pathology department 3 days longer then the surgeons expected because of the rarity of the tumor and they have determined it is benign. They have found nothing else anywhere. Nothing in my lymph nodes, and they checked my heart as I am told this tumor is usually found there instead of the mouth.  Any help, thoughts or opinions would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you...\n\n",

They are uncommon (odontogenic myxomas represent  1% -17.7% of all odontogenic tumors).  Within the skeleton, they occur almost exclusively in the jaws. Outside of the jaws, they are extremely rare. Those that occur in the jaws are said to be of odontogenic origin(believed to arise from the dental papilla or follicular mesenchyme).  Odontogenic tumors pose a considerable challenge not only to the clinician (many of them resemble each other clinically), but to the histopathologist and radiologist as well.

    "content": "I've had some strange symptoms going on for about a month now.  It all started when I heard a grinding sound (like bone on bone) on the right side of my face when I opened my mouth.  I also experienced some slight dizziness at this time.  The grinding subsidded later that night and then I started to experience a burning sensation on my tongue which moved around to different areas of my tongue.  After about a week or so the burning sensation went away and I began to experience jaw discomfort.  I would describe it as tension or tightening which would come and go at random times.  Now it seems the jaw tension has gone away but I'm noticing a tickly, tingling, burning sensation on my chin and lips which comes and goes and sometimes moves to just the right corner of my mouth.  I also feel a crawling skin sensation from time to time on the right side of my face and experience twitches in various parts of my body.  Every time it seems to be getting better another symptom pops up.    At first I thought it might be wisdom teeth, then I started investigating TMJ, just wondering if anyone can shed some light on this before I go to the doctor.\n\n",

    "content": "I was grinding/clinching my teeth at night and sometimes during the day. Doctor believes it is a type of nervous/anxiety thing. (I recently got my braces taken off and wear a clear retainer to bed) I asked my doctor what I should do and told me to start wearing the retainer more often - as a type of mouth/teeth guard. A clear retainer is very comfortable and you can wear it during the day without notice. The reason I mention this is because wearing a sports mouth piece can be somewhat unfortable plus it is hard to talk in one (should you want to answer the phone or talk to someone after putting in the mouth piece.   My mother has the same problem of grinding her teeth and tried wearing a sports mouth piece and found it to be bothersome and finally broke down and bought the expensive $500 mouth piece. In opposition, I paid half the cost and got a clear retainer from my dentist.   hope this helps\n\n",

    "title": "Re: impacted wisdom tooth & facial pain",
    "content": "Hello --  What's most likely to result if the nerve is damaged during a removal would be numbness. While this is probably preferable to pain, it's a close second at times. Fortunately there may be another way to approach this, and that would be to have a consult with a neurosurgeon. If the tooth is impingeing one or more branches of the facial nerve (and apparently it is) then this would be every bit as much a job for a neurosurgeon as for an oral surgeon or dentist. They could (and should) work in tandem in planning the extraction, and perhaps the  neurosurgeon could actually do the removal. That's no guarantee there wouldn't be problems, but with a neurosurgeon at least you'd have the best prediction of potential problems and, if he were to do the surgery, you'd likely also have the best chance of the best outcome. While relief of pain is ultimately necessary, avoidance of numbness or loss of range of motion is equally important.   I hope this is helpful. Please follow up with us here as needed. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I've been dealing with recurring cold sores, one after the other since August of 08'.  They appear on different parts of my lips.  They look like the regular cold sores I usually get.  I don't understand why this is happening since I've never had it this bad since childhood.  My doctor prescribed me Zovirax.  If I catch it in time, the cream quickly heals the cold sore but it comes right back within 2 to 3 weeks.  I've also been taking lysine and vitamins to boost my immune system but it doesn't seem to be working.  My doctor thinks that there is nothing more I can do, and that I should take lots of vitamin C and lysine.  He thinks its common that colds sores reoccur in the winter.  But how can that be in my case when this started in the late summer?  What I didn't tell my doctor is that I think its something more then just recurring  cold sores.  This may be far-fetched, but about a year and sometime earlier, I was with a man whom I had oral sex with.  The first time I performed oral sex on him, I woke up with a cold sore.  It went away and I thought nothing of it.  Later on I got two yeast infections and a sore throat that had white puss and looked inflamed.  I went to the doctor to get it looked at.  I told the doctor the story, and she thought it could just be Mono.  The test went through, and I tested negative for Mono and  any STD of the throat.    Since then I've been single, not dealing with anyone, and out of no where this coldsore thing happens.  I really worried, and these coldsore are taking over my life.  I want to start a new relationship, but I'm afraid that I might give him cold sores.  What should I do?    Thank you in advance\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  It is the nature of cold sores, usually caused by herpes simplex virus, to be somewhat erratic, random and unpredictable, except the reasonable certainty that at some time they will show up again. There are also often periods when they are especially active, but they are usually aggravated most, to my understanding of the subject, during the summer, due to exposure to sunlight. Continue to use the Zovirax, which is excellent for suppressing this until outbreaks die down. There really is little else that can be done other than the vitamin C, which does seem to help.  Your theory about oral sex may not be so far fetched, it just may not make a lot of difference. While you may now have herpes simplex type II acting in concert with the original virus, the two are so similar as to make little difference, and either can be transposed to the \"other end\" depending upon sexual habits, etc. There's really little to differentiate between the two and the treatment is exactly the same.  I hope this is of some help to you. Good luck with this and please, by all means, be up front in any future relationships, as your partner will certainly either thank you for your honesty or, if of questionable character, may just walk away from the possibility of infection. I suppose that comment is judgemental, but if the relationship is an honest and solid one, something like this really shouldn't get in the way. On  the other hand, if more casual sex is in play, you certainly still owe your partner the heads-up.   Best of luck to you with this. Hopefully the current flareup will soon resolve and give you some peace for a while.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: canker sore turned into blister",
    "content": "Hello --  Some recurrent canker sores can cycle numerous times, depending upon what the trigger may be. If this one is in a single spot and keeps recycling itself, it may be getting irritated by something like a rough edge of a tooth or ingestion of something that aggravates canker sores, like citrus or other acidic fruits or juices, figs, and they also can be caused or aggravated by certain conditions like low levels of vitamin B-12. If it doesn't resolve on its own pretty soon you might want to try GlyOxide, if you haven't already. It's available over the counter and is a combo of peroxide and glycerine, so it stays put where it's placed with a dropper (unlike plain peroxide, which only serves as a momentary mouthwash). If that doesn't clear this one up, or if you start to have more recurrent ones, you may have advanced to a more complex form of the original problem. It's benign, but obviously can be very painful.   I hope this  is helpful. Good luck to you. Follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Infection or nerve exposed",
    "content": "Hi there -  Generally an abcess will cause marked local swelling and local fever in addition to pain. Early on there may just be pressure on some part of the nerve, which can cause excruciating pain without having gotten that much worse. Although an infected tooth could once upon a time cause systemic infection and mitral valve prolapse (MVP) used to be a concern and cause for premedication, it's now not considered to be a major concern. Add to that the fact that you're already on antibiotics and things should be fully managed for now, except, of course, for the  pain. The pain is a direct result of pressure on the nerve of the  tooth,  which can sometimes  simply be nothing more than air pressure. Those nerves are very, very sensitive when exposed or touched by anything. You're covered by the antibiotics you're taking and needn't be concerned about endocarditis right now. Getting the tooth repaired or removed will  resolve the primary problem, which right now is pain.   I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you and please update us after you've seen the dentist.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  This doesn't sound like osteomyelitis, but rather perhaps an abcessed tooth which has created a fistula (or even just infectious tooth abcess material having drained into one of the parotid glands via fistula, and which has now maybe created a secondary pocket). Amoxycillin is a reasonable first-line antibiotic for this, but probably something stronger, like ciprofloxacin, may become necessary, as well as possible intervention by an oral surgeon to clear  up any residual problems, may be necessary. In fact, that's where I'd go next, and see an oral surgeon, who might be have better insight into this sort of thing.  Hope this is helpful. Please follow up with us as necessary and also update us as to progress.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Osteomyelitis of the Jaw?",
    "content": "Thank you, this is very helpful. Yes, I will definitely be doing that once insurance rolls over. What you say makes alot of sense. It began as a sore tooth. I would put oragel on it and leave it alone until it began to hurt again. Then it formed a rather large absesss, without drainage. And now that is has started draining, it has become more of a small crater. When I went to the ever trusty MedClinic, the doctor told mee that it was an inflammed salivary gland and only suggested that i eat sour foods. Well after enduring about 2 bags of warheads without any change, I assumed he wasn't correct. I let it be for a while until, one night i was poking around the inside of my mouth and discovered the channel... and after being prodded, the yellow pus began draining. This scared me half to death, and I overreacted a bit and made a night visit to the emergency room. They were the ones to perscribe the antibiotic, and it helped with the swelling. Wwell, now i just have a big, leaky crater on my jaw. The emergency room suggested that I saw a dentist, and he did absoloutley nothing except reffer me to a dermatologist.... and my best guess is that the dermatologist will only send me to a plastic surgeon! It does not hurt that often anymore, and it does not hinder my day to day routine, so I thought of just leaving it be, because i figured that it couldn't possibly drain forever... but now, I believe it could indeed drain forever. I will make an attempt to see an oral surgeon soon, but unless it is more severe than I imagine it is, it will be a short wait until I get it checked out again. Again, thank you for your quick response. I will keep you updated as I find out more information. -S.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  It would help to know if these holes have been  present for a long time (forever?) or if you've just recently discovered them. If  they're congenital they probably won't cause any problems. In fact, if they are as small as you say, it's  likely they won't cause any problem anyway, unless they are the product of a disease process such as some localized infection which may have caused them and which could recur or cause them to become larger.   If you could fill us in on the  details regarding these holes,  especially how long you've been aware of them and if there was ever any sort of lesion or lesions on the roof of your mouth prior to discovering these,  it would be helpful.  Good luck to you. Hope to hear from you soon.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  The parotid gland is the same glands that swell when you get the mumps. They are the 2 largest of our salivary glands and they empty into our mouth. Being that the Doctor actually saw the swollen gland, I wouldn\u2019t want to downplay his diagnosis. If it turns out not to be a pimple, another thought would be that you could have a viral or bacterial infection in the parotid gland called parotitis, you may have a salivary duct stone/stones or it can be infected from poor oral hygiene. Being that it is a salivary gland, sour will increase the pain, so will pinching it. Treatment consists of antibiotics, warm compresses, massaging the gland and try to express the content through the duct into your mouth and if it doesn\u2019t get any better, your doctor may have to drain it surgically.\n\n",

What about a tumors or stones, can these things be missed?   There is something in my cheek in the Parotid area, that I am not imagining. It hurts when pressed very firmly (as the doc did) and it is causing me some discomfort. I get little headaches that shoot along the jaw up to my temple now (not sure if this is related).   I am visiting my doctor for a follow-up soon. Is there any other kind of test that I can get done to confirm that this is nothing? It's been there for almost 2 months now, it has to be something. Could it really have been a deep pimple and this is just the remnants?\n\n",

You have ruled out a duct stone and if the gland remains swollen and tender or if you can see pus coming from the Stenson\u2019s duct intraorally (inside your mouth) or you can have a swabbing done.

The mass (or former lump) seems to be disappearing more which is a good thing. While it is hard to notice now, it is still there. As I said before, it is kind of a flat (quarter sized) area that is ever so slightly raised but feels a lot firmer then my right cheek in comparison. I'm feeling better about this though as it seems to be going away. We'll see what we find out next week I guess. I am sure some more test will be conducted in regards to my parotid and my new ear problem. I will keep you all posted.  Thanks again for all your help!\n\n",

You may get some relief from ibuprofen but it will be temporary and infection can cause serious trouble if it moves into your blood stream.  You may ask your local health department for a referral to a dental clinic or facility that may use a sliding fee schedule or offer discounts to cash paying patients.    Without health and dental insurance it is wise to start a health savings account for such needs.  These days it even makes sense for the insured since higher copays, premiums and fewer benefits often put them in the same crisis situation at times.  Health problems do happen to almost everyone eventually.  Best wishes\n\n",

    "title": "Hard Invisable Bump on Inside Lower Lip",
    "content": "Hello there...  A few days back I had this sore on the inside of my left lower lip that I couldn't leave alone (lol).  I kept biting at it, etc.  It was a little red and white at the head (kind of like a pimple if there were pores in my mouth).  It hurt a little when I would bite it, but nothing too bad.  It was right in the middle of my lip on the left side of the inside of my mouth.   A couple of days went by and the white head and redness went away completely.  Now however, in exactly the same spot (I'm assuming) there is this hard, 'invisible' bump.  It doesn't hurt at all, I just notice it and can feel it from the inside of my mouth and out. It's hard, and its size would lead me to describe it as a small pebble.  Is this a by-product of me biting my mouth sore?  Should I give it a few days and see if it shrinks or grows? Should I just go see the dentist ASAP?  Any help is appreciated.  Thank you.\n\n",

If it should remain for weeks or if it becomes larger, then you should definitely bring it to the attention of a doctor or dentist, but these  little lumps almost always go away in time on their own.

    "title": "Re: very small clear blisters on my lips",
    "content": "Hi there -  It sounds like you do have herpes which first blossomed as oral stomatitis, responded to the initial treatment, then returned a false negative test result, probably because you'd just been treated for it. While it should show up anyway,  sometimes immediately after (or during) treatment the virus will go dormant and not show up.   Your current symptoms still sound like herpes. I can't prove this at a distance, of course, but the description of the original outbreak and the subsequent symptoms, plus the fact that you say the possibility had crossed your mind early on, suggests you had placed yourself at risk of infection, so having it show up isn't surprising. A follow-up test would be useful, and it doesn't matter whether it's genital herpes or just a flareup from an early case of chickenpox; it is treated the same, and is essentially the same thing. It's uncomfortable and can be communicated to others, so it should be treated and, more importantly, should be accurately and definitively diagnosed. I'd either go back to the original doctor or a different one, and be re-tested, then do whatever it takes to get the symptoms  under control and watch out for future flareups, which can be fairly infequent or can be somewhat regular, depening upon the individual.   I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you. Follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "For the last week or two i have been in a considerable amount of pain, and have seen a few doctors for multiple reasons.  In early AUGUST i began experiencing frequent headaches on and around my left temple/ left side of my head.  I began to notice these headaches were usually accompanied by aching of my top left teeth, the 2 back most ones, so after feeling this for about a month i called my dentist.    I pointed this pain out to the dentist when i saw him around SEPT. 15 and they took x-rays and assured me there was no cavity, so i just assumed that these newly developing headaches caused the teeth to ache, and i'd just have to deal with it. (I am no stranger to headaches)  These headaches/toothaches continued and seemed to worsen, and i began developing a lot of pain in my left shoulder and left side of my neck, so by mid OCTOBER i began seeing a chiropractor for my now very painful neck and shoulder.  Around the same time i began seeing the chiro, i went to a family med. center because i was experiencing symptoms that seemed typical of sinusitis.  I have been taking amoxicillin antibiotics for almost 10 days now, and to no avail.  Within the last two weeks my jaw and mouth have been: -popping and cracking all over the place, both sides -getting REALLY bad toothaches, mostly on the left side, mostly upper teeth -getting pain pressure or plugged feeling in ears, mostly left side -limited movement with jaw -when i smile or open mouth wide i get pain in temple, ear, and pulling pain in the spot where i had been getting my headaches -its hard to eat, yawn, etc. -i feel dizzy or like my eyes are being affected somehow  The pain has gotten really bad and has been progressing really quickly to the point where i am in tears frequently and the pain is moderate in the morning but by the early evening is severe.  Please what should i do i am panicking and i feel like i'm going to be in pain forever and there is something seriously wrong!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I am otherwise healthy, not on any medication.  I'm not sure how long this whiteness has been there, but I've only recently noticed it.  It doesn't cover the entire tongue, but is not \"patchy\" either.  It can mostly be scraped on with a fingernail, but some does not seem to come off.  There appears to be thicker whiteness in the back of the tongue since that part is harder to reach.  There seems to be no whiteness in any other part of my mouth.  From what I have read, this can be oral thrush.  Am I correct?  What could be some reasons that I have this?  I am aware that thrush can be a sign of a compromised immune system, as is caused by HIV.  But I'm not sure whether that can be the cause since I've never had unprotected sex and haven't shared needles.  Could you please also tell me how this can be remedied?  I've tried brushing the tongue, which doesn't quite seem to help.  I'd greatly appreciate the help.  Thanks so much.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, This is a common condition and it can be aggravated by smoking.  It is not necessarily thrush but often is just accumulated dead skin cells, bacteria and debris.  Brushing is advised as well as quitting smoking, avoiding dehydration by drinking plenty of water and increasing fiber in your diet. Crunchy foods \u2014 such as apples, broccoli and popcorn \u2014 help scrape debris from your tongue.  It is usually temporary and harmless.  I hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  About a month ago I had oral surgery to extract a wisdom tooth on the right side of my mouth.  Since then, the extraction sight has healed nicely, but I've noticed a small bump present in my jaw close to where the tooth used to be.  Now, usually I would not be concerned and would assume that it is simply a side effect of the surgery.  However, my wife was diagnosed with HPV about a year ago, which means that I've certainly contacted it as well.  My wife and I engaged in oral sex frequently and I have recently become aware that HPV can cause oral cancer in individuals who practice oral sex.  Should I be concerned that this lump is more than a side effect of the oral surgery or am I just freaking myself out over nothing?  Are there any other symptoms or signs that would let me know one way or the other?    I've scheduled an appointment with my dentist soon and plan to ask her about it.  Is there any specific questions I should ask her?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  This is more likely to be an enlarged lymph node as it occurs in a lymph node region (submental). Following throat, gum, or dental infections or inflammation, the draining lymph nodes become enlarged, painful and tender.   After control of infection or inflammation with adequate course of antibiotics, they should regress in size but never to normal size. These enlarged nodes are usually soft to firm, not painful, mobile and less than 1 cm.  Since it occurred after tooth extraction, the possibility that it is reactionary to inflammation in this area is high, however, direct clinical examination and a thorough history is the best way for identification of its possible causes.  If your physician would see it of benign origin he may recommend serial examination, as nodes who become smaller or stationary are reassuring while those increasing in size or number are concerning and are investigated promptly.   It is true that there is an increase in the risk of oral cancers in those who practice oral sex, but mainly in those exposed to multiple partners (more than 5), however, there is no approved test to find HPV in men. To my knowledge, this subject is still an area of research.  I would advise you to follow up with your doctor.  Please keep us updated.  Best regards.\n\n",

    "title": "Consistent Bump on Inside Lower Lip",
    "content": "Hi.   About two months ago I noticed a bump on the inside of my lower lip. Thinking it was a cold sore, I left it alone.   It started to grow and shrink in size, however, and has not gone away. It is obviously not a cold sore, but it does not seem like a mucous cyst either (since the descriptions I've seen of those are clear/blueish bumps). Mine looks very much like a pimple (red sides with tiny white bump in the middle).   Also, a large, whiteish bump often grows from the main bump which makes eating and drinking difficult since I keep biting it and rubbing food against it accidentally. I started putting hydrogen peroxide on it a few weeks ago, once or twice a day, and that seems to help with the white growth. However, it never makes the original bump go away. At times, when it grows larger, it looks like a blister (with the white bump in the middle of a clearer seal), so perhaps it is a mucous cyst.   I don't even know which kind of doctor to go to for this, and I don't want to go to a regular doctor just to be told I'll have to go to a different one. Also, from what I've read about mucous cysts, they have to be surgically removed. I really don't want to have that. If this thing in my mouth is annoying but not harmful, that really doesn't seem necessary. If it is a cyst, is there any way of getting rid of it without surgery?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Consistent Bump on Inside Lower Lip",
    "content": "Hello -  What you describe sounds like oral stomatitis, a canker sore which sometimes forms spontaneously and, with luck, will resolve within a week or two. However, sometimes these things, which are actually usually caused by a virus, can be re-aggravated so often by being in the wrong spot and getting bitten, that they develop a bacterial superinfection (meaning superimposed, not a super bug). This is why stubborn ones tend to respond to hydrogen peroxide, and I'd continue using that as often as practical. Also, if you can find it, there's a product  called Gly-Oxide, which is peroxide in a glycerine suspension, which makes it thicker so that it stays put and is able to work longer on the actual spot. You might ask a pharmacist if this is still available. It's a lot easier to use than pure peroxide.   If the lesion doesn't resolve soon, you may need to have a doctor look at it -- most general practitioners should be able to deal with this -- and either be started on a special anti-viral medication or perhaps have the lesion cauterized. It should be looked at if it stays much longer, as it could cause a scar (with a permanent bump at the site) which could attract yet more biting, additional lesions, etc.  I hope this is helpful. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  What you describe could be a cyst or enlarged lymph node, or possibly a canker sore that hasn't fully develped yet. These latter are usually painful, but since it isn't open as yet, it may not have fully developed. Then again, it could be something that's been there all along and you've just recently noticed, an anatomical anomaly that isn't important. So long as it's not causing symptoms I wouldn't be too concerned, but you should have it looked at regardless. It doesn't sound as though it's anything urgent, and if it does become painful and red then it's probably a canker sore (stomatitis). These tend to run their course and go away.   Nonetheless, if this thing doesn't disappear within a week, or if it becomes larger, painful, etc., then it should be looked at by a doctor.  Hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I have never heard this side effect associated with oral contraceptives.  Your best shot at avoiding dry socket is to follow your doctors orders exactly, do not suck out of a straw, rest until you recover and try not to do anything that might dislodge the clot that forms following extraction.  In some cases it just cannot be avoided as the cause is something you can't control.  It can be related to a difficult extraction, a fragment of tooth or root left there, or even some bacterial infection at the site.  Some people develop this in spite of everything going \"right\" otherwise.  Best wishes and good luck with the coming procedure.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Kate1982,  Most likely, you had a small area that may initially have become inflamed due to a viral infection or some trauma that now is having a hard time getting better due to continued trauma.  These can be difficult to manage.  If you feel that there may be an infection setting in you should see your doctor since you may need antibiotics.  If it seems more like it is irritated due to the continued trauma you may want to try using a topical numbing medicine such as orajel to help some with the pain.  Another idea, which I have never tried but could work, is to try covering the gap between your teeth with a dental strip or tape.  Keep in mind I just thought of this and have never actually seen anyone do it but it may help.  If this doesn't get better soon I would recommend you see your doctor.  Best wishes.\n\n",

If you prefer to have the tooth saved and a crown placed rather than having it pulled and having a bridge put in I think the repeat root canal is reasonable.  I cannot comment on the antibiotics since I don't know what they were prescribed for.  I would recommend you call your dentist about this.  It would also be reasonable to request a second opinion from another dentist if you feel this is needed.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "HI, I searched the forums and I could not find a discreet answer regarding this, the thing is, since I came back from Japan in the summer, I've noticed (this was whie in Japan to) that in the back left of my mouth (back right if you are facing me), there's a relatively large hole... I am pretty sure it should not be there, and I took a white light and flashed it into my mouth and looked at the opposite side, and the hole is there, but not nearly as big, and not protruding outwards either. Anyway, regarding the hole that is protruding outward, I thought at first maybe food was getting stuck into it, so (I know this is bad but it was really annoying and I didnt have anything else to use at the times.) I ended up trying to use my finger at first to get it out, but my finger was to big to fit in the hole so I poured alcohol over a paper clip and ran it through hot water and stuck that in, the white thing came out just fine, it was a little solid so I wondered what it could have been. The next time it happened though,  I tried the same way, but it felt like it was attached to the inside of the hole, and it took a long time to get it out, now its back AGAIN and I'm getting irritated with it so I want to know what exactly it is, and the best way to rid myself of it. The thing that gets stuck in the hole is always white and is increasingly becoming harder to get out. Also I am not sure why the hole in the back left of my mouth is popping out so much when the back right is not. Any ideas?\n\n",

Since this is persisting I would suggest you see your regular doctor or an Ear/Nose/Throat doctor for further evaluation to find out for sure what is going on.  If it is a tonsillith it may be necessary to have a tonsillectomy to help cure the issue.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Pain coming from the tooth is often worse when pressing on the tooth.  Tooth pain may also be referred from another place, most commonly the ear or the sinuses.  It may be that you are actually having some inflammation of the middle/inner ear or the maxillary sinus (located in the cheek bone).    If this pain continues I'd recommend you see your doctor for an evaluation.  An Ear/Nose/Throat specialist may also be of help.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I can almost feel it coming from the upper wisdom teeth. 6-Itchy frontal teeth (from time to time) 7-Occasional numbness/paresthesia in upper lip and left cheek. 8-Pain in all upper teeth, like a nerve pain (It's barely noticable and is not constant) 9-And rarely some strange vertigo (it's barely noticable) 10-Also, some noises (like violin) irritate my ears and cause this strange feeling in the head, along with the nerve pain in the upper teeth.  I went to a dentist, and he said that they are growing fine. But I think that he was wrong. My lower teeth stopped growing, but they are still almost completely covered in gum, and that already makes them vertically impacted (soft tissue impaction?). And my upper teeth grow completely sideways, but not towards the other teeth, or towards the back of the head. They grow towards the cheek. I can see in the mirror that they grow in the wrong direction. I also asked for an x-ray, but the dentist said that there was no need for it.  I have also read about TMJ, and I have some symptoms that fit. And now I wonder what exactly do I have? If my dentist was right then I am only left with TMJ... My question is: \"Can above symptoms be caused by wisdom teeth? And from the description that I gave you, can you tell me if my teeth grow wrong/impacted?\". I would be very grateful for any help!\n\n",

I'd say I get them every 2-3 weeks, and I feel as though they keep getting more painful and larger each time I get them.  I've tried many kinds of over the counter ointments which help but only temporarily.  I know the causes of canker sores are generally unknown and that they are quite common, but I'm concerned about how they're becoming progressively larger and more painful.  What should I do?  Thank you so much for your advice!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, There seems to be a genetic tendency to get these sores since some people are much more prone than others.  There is no known cure or definite cause of these mouth ulcers which can be very painful.    The usual preventive measures that may help reduce the incidence include being careful about eating any foods that may traumatize your mouth such as sharp-edged chips, high acid foods, nuts, and some spices.  Keep a food diary so you can discover if there is any food-link to your outbreaks.  Secondly, don't talk and chew at once - more likely to bite your mouth if you do this and the result can be a sore.  Use good dental hygiene and a soft toothbrush.  This can help get rid of offending foods that might linger in the mouth.    My son actually noticed that his occur when he doesn't eat enough vegetables.  He has never liked veggies but once he began eating them regularly (his Japanese wife is a good cook and uses lots of vegetables) he noticed the cankers didn't happen.  When his wife traveled back to Japan to visit her family, he slipped back into his bad American diet and the cankers started again.  Now, he eats the greens daily whether he wants to or not.  Just an interesting case that was easy enough for him to prevent the sores once he discovered what worked for him.  Once you have a sore, try not to irritate it by rubbing your tongue on it.  Healing will occur faster if it is not irritated further so eat soft foods and try to leave it alone.  There are some topical treatments that can reduce the pain and possibly speed the healing.  Some are by prescription and a doctor or dentist can recommend; others are available over the counter such as anesthetic solutions or ointments (numbing qualities in mouth products similar to what is used for teething babies.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "ive not had my wisdom teeth come out yet, but today whilst i was eating nuts i thought i had some stuck on my gum, upper left, where my tooh should be, i tried to mov eit but i couldnt, then i suddenly realised it was a tooth, in three out of four corners i have a tooth poking through, so its started coming out.  my question is, if one is coming, do the other 3 come too? i wonder this because in two areas of my mouth ive had aching teeth recently, and if they are on their way i would have thought this may be the cause in the other areas. also how quickly do they take to fully come out. And, for the last four weeks ive had a sore throst that no doctor can explain, however could that be from the wisdoms coming? ive also been feeling dizzy and having mild headaches for the past 3/4 days would this be due to the tooth and would this happen even if the tooth is completely normal? i just don't want it to be impacted, ive had enough trouble with my root canal (as a side not that either hasnt been successful or my gum around that tooth is still infected) im still on the waiting list for my dentist so this is all coming at a very very bad time. Oh, is it normal tat if i run my finger over the outside of my gum (behind my lip) my other wisdom areas feel flat, where as the area that is partially erupted is slightly swollen, not majorly, just noticably - i don't actually have pain in the area\n\n",

    "content": "Wisdom teeth can cause distress, that's for sure.  Some people are able to have them come in without difficulty but for most it's crowded in there.    They can come in one at a time or all at once - totally individual.  Also, some people have genetically absent wisdom teeth (one or more) so it is possible that there could be less than four total.  Your dental xrays should be able to determine this.  Wisdom teeth can also erupt partially, stay completely impacted, or erupt fully - in short time or over a long time.  Again, it's all up to the individual, how much room is in the mouth, etc.  Your pain could well be coming from this tooth but I can't determine that for sure.  If your sore throat and headache continue you should have it checked out.  You could be experiencing some type of seasonal allergy that is causing a little drainage, making your throat sore, but I would think the doctor would be able to visualize redness if this were the case.    Take pain relievers such as acetaminophen to get you by until your dental appointment but if that doesn't do the trick or you have other symptoms of infection such as fever, swelling, etc. you should call the office to see if they can work you in sooner for a non-routine exam.  Good luck with this.\n\n",

There are several different reasons this inflammation can occur.  Treatment depends on the cause.

    "content": "For the past two days I have been suffering from gum pain on the lower right side of my gums. There is a strip of healthy looking gum right underneath the teeth, and then the whole area below that looks reddish and thin. It's extremely tender. I have been using Crest mouthwash, flossing, and brushing my teeth as normal. My newest symptoms are inside cheek inflammation and pain and a metallic taste in my mouth.  I am currently taking Spironolactone and Loestrin 24 Fe for my PCOS symptoms. Could these medicines be causing my symptoms? I also attempted to use Crest white strips for the first time yesterday. Could this be the culprit? The strips didn't touch the area of affected gum. If not, what could this mean? I have always had a perfectly healthy mouth (no cavities ever! just a warning that I had the beginnings of receding gums and should floss regularly) and don't think something like gingivitis would come upon me so suddenly now. I am 25 years old and a female.   In addition to an attempted diagnosis, does anyone have some advice on pain relief? Thank you.\n\n",

The white strips may be a possibility.  Regarding pain, you can try ibuprofen and tylenol.  You may also want to try a topical pain reliever like oragel.  Seeing your doctor is important.

    "content": "Hello, I'm a healthy 23 year old Male. When I was about 16 I accidently shot myself in the mouth with a BB gun. I didn't think it was loaded and I stuck it in my mouth and pulled the trigger. The BB lodged in the fleshy sort of area on the upper left side of mouth, not quite at the jaw or the throat thank god. Anyways I didn't tell my parents or anybody about it because I was scared. Dumb, I know. So a few years went by and it never really bothered me or anything and then when I was about 18 or 19 it started to worry me because I thought maybe it could travel through my body or hurt me in some way. I went to the dentist who took X-rays and found the BB still in the place where I fired it. He suggested I see an oral surgeon to have it removed. I saw the oral surgeon and he said since it had been so long that anything bad would have already happened and there was no need to take it out because the body forms some kind of shell around it and it will just stay where it is. All of the sudden two days ago I started getting pretty bad pain, especially when I chew, right around that area and I'm really scared it's related to the BB. Could it, this many years later, be doing harm? Can it travel to my heart or brain? If it was a copper BB can it poison me some how?  I would greatly appreciate any advice. I am going to make an appointment with my dentist tomorrow and have an X-ray done as soon as possible to make sure it hasn't moved anywhere over the last few years. And if the pain doesn't go away I might go to the hospital in the next few days because it really does hurt. thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Matt Foertsch,  I agree with your oral surgeon that after this long it is unlikely to cause you any problems such as eroding deeper into the bone/brain or getting into a blood vessel and traveling elsewhere.  It does occasionally happen where a foreign body begins causing pain after many years, sometimes related to recent trauma in the area (even mild).  Seeing a dentist or oral surgeon about this is appropriate to make sure it is OK.  If it is not causing you any problems I agree with the surgeon that it probably does not need to come out.  If it beginning to cause pain it should probably be removed.  Regarding the copper issue, cases have been described where a person has developed lead poisoning from an embedded bullet that was leeching out the lead from within it.  This is an unusual occurrence and I am not aware of such reports with BB's; however, I cannot guarantee that this won't happen.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "When I brought this up to the dentist last week when I had a regular check-up, he said that this bump looked like a clogged salivary gland.  This bump has now been here for 2.5 weeks, and it hasn't changed a bit.  Well, sometimes it seems like it goes down, and then it swells up again.  I am just wondering, should this go down eventually?  I asked my dentist and he said that if it is still there in a month, he may send me to an oral surgeon just so that he can look at it.  He also told me that if it grew or started bleeding to let him know.  He wasn't worried about it all, but it worries me a little.  I have never smoked and I rarely drink.  What causes a blocked salivary gland anyway and how much time should I give it?  I am going to on a job assignment for 5 weeks, so I hope it does not grow or give me any trouble.  It doesn't hurt or anything.  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Salivary glands can become blocked for several reasons, most commonly due to a small stone that forms (usually from calcium or some other substance solidifying) in the gland that subsequently becomes lodged in the duct.  If you aren't experiencing pain they usually are not harmful and will resolve eventually.  Eating things that make you salivate (such as sour foods, etc) can help wash out the stone and resolve the problem.  It shouldn't stop your trip but if it hasn't resolved by the time you get back it's probably a good idea to have it evaluated by the oral surgeon.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 23 year old woman with some allergies.  During the early evening last night, my tongue became sore and swollen.  The sides of my tongue are the sorest, but my guess is that is due to brushing against my molars.  My entire tongue is really red, and feels like it is burning.  My only guess is it could be allergy related, but I don't think I ate anything I was allergic to yesterday.  It is difficult to talk or to eat anything, but I have no other symptoms that I am aware of.  Could anyone give me a little insight?  Thanks, Stephanie\n\n",

I have been taking Advil for pain and it takes the edge off but it comes right back.    I plan on going to see another dentist this week.  Any ideas what could be causing this? Lori\n\n",

This has been going on for about  7 months now and whenever I eat especially they just rip open again. Once it does finally heal I end up tearing it open some how.

I'm left with a itching feeling in my throat as well as pains in the front and these cuts on the sides of my mouth. The skin also seems to be pealing on my lips leaving them red and raw as well.  So i went and bought some neosporin, it worked well and healed both sides of my mouth but now about 3 days after finally healing today the left side got another slit in it and soon after the right side was open again with two slits.  This is driving me nuts, They seem to just be appearing for no reason. Is there anything else this could be or to go get tested for?\n\n",

I have had quite a bit if work done to my teeth awhile back.My teeth aren't lose or falling out.He isn't in the bussiness to repair teeth only maxifacial surgery and remove teeth.I'm wondering if this may have something to do with why he wants to just pull them all out.I'v talked to others who have had transplants and they said that they still have their teeth and they were pretty bad during transplant.

    "content": "Its been a week and I had this one bump on my upper lip, it was also on my lower lip but alot smaller with a white dot.  The bump on the lower lip hurt everytime I smiled and I thought it would be chapped lips.  Then the upper lip got a lil bigger and its been there ever since, now it looks like its moved to the other side of my upper lip.  There is no puss or any fluid inside, it is just a bump.  I've used chapstick medicated to see if that would help but it seems like its taken too long to get rid of.  What could it be?\n\n",

It is hard to explain the shape, at first I just thought it was round like a cheerio.

    "content": "Dear Elliemay,  i think that this could be part of the normal degeneration and regeneration of the tongue but a little bit too fast.   On the other hand, it could be abnormal. i recommend that you pay a visit to your doctor to take a look at it when it is at its peak.  This could be either an abnormal exaggeration of the normal degeneration and regeneration of the tongue or could be a fungal infection even though the description is a little atypical.  Do you have any sharp tooth that is constantly rubbing against this part of your tongue and be the cause of this reaction by causing continuous irritation of the tongue at this specific point? This could the culprit.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

I have tried to research my issue on the internet and I don't really know what to look for.  I would like to see some images of other \"tongue disturbances\" to compare.  I do not have any teeth that constantly touch the area.  It is on the left side of the tip of my tongue about the circumfrance of a dime.  If you can picture a line a bit line thicker than thread that makes an incomplete circle.  That would be what it looks like.  It is baerly raised to where sometimes I don't think it is at all, but I can still tell that it is there because it has a type of sensation like it was burnt, but w/o pain.  Do you know what kind of doctor I should see?  I do not have a primary.  Also you mentioned that it could be a fungal infection.  Can you get ringworm on your tongue.  It possibly looks like that.  I have had ringworm several times.  I get it easily.    Thanks again in advance.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  Like elliemay, I have been searching the internet for my symptoms--and elliemay's come as close as anything I've seen.  I moved into a new house about a year ago, and at first I thought I was having allergic symptoms to the house--but there was no itchy eyes or sneezing.  The main symptom was this numb / burned feeling on my tongue, accompanied by a few red marks on the tongue--and like elliemay, occasionally a circular red mark on the tip (about the size of a dime) and a soapy taste in my mouth.  In addition, I feel dizzy (actually wobbly, not just lightheaded) a lot.  Also, my tongue sensation is almost daily, not every few weeks or months.  So, I would be interested to know whether elliemay was diagnosed and treated (or cured!). Or does anyone have any other suggestions for what this might be?  (FYI, I am also an insulin-dependent diabetic.)  Thanks for any and all help (and thank you, elliemay, for letting me know I'm not the only one with this weird tongue sensation!!).\n\n",

    "title": "IM SCARED ABOUT MY LIP PIERCING",
    "content": "About 2 weeks ago to this day I pierced my own lip. At first it didn't go all the way through and I just developed a bump on the inside of the left side of my mouth. I was told that since I did it with a safety pin that there would be a scar left so I just decided to push it all the way through. Then without expecting it, I felt something rubbing hard against my gums and I found out that on its own the back of the earring had gone all the way through. I put a back on it and really liked it. About two days ago, the whole closed up and I started trying to reopen it. Now it is all the way through again, but I have a millimeter size circle surronding the hole where the piercing went in and its red and blue. On the inside of my mouth is a circle where skin has been removed and the exiting hole in the middle. Just like on the outside. I take the earring out at night because it hurts too much to keep it in and every morning I put it back in. It hurts from the my bottom teeth right to the hole for a moment and then goes away until I ethier hit it or play with it. Im scared to know if its infected because my parents don't know. I really like it, but I'm willing to take it out if it's going to cause health problems. I am also bulimic and that is probably affecting it too. I just need to know which would be a safer thing to do. I'm keeping it clean by disinfecting it 3 times a day using disinfectant and also washing my mouth out with saltwater. Anything would help me out a lot??  :lol:\n\n",

    "content": "Hi HARTunderATTACKxx, Piercings done without a sterile procedure are even more susceptible to infection. The appearance of blue may be a  result of bruising and the redness may be either irritation or infection. I am quite sure that even though you are attempting to \"hide\" this from your parents they probably already at least suspect that you have done this just by the appearance on your lip. I would suggest that you remove the piercing and if you like it as much as you say you do, talk it over with your parents and if they are agreeable have it done by a professional. Keep in mind that if they adamantly refuse you doing so they are only trying to do what is best for you. Now, my concern for you is that you stated that you are bulimic. Eating disorders (Bulimia) are very dangerous. Do you realize the consequences of having this disorder? Medical conditions that may result from this condition include erosion of tooth enamel, electrolyte imbalances, (which if are severe enough may cause death), irregular heart rhythms, (severe cases may result in heart attack and possible death), rupture of the esophagus or stomach, etc. etc. I would strongly suggest that you seek treatment for this disorder.

If you have a bleeding tendency disease that has not been diagnosed yet then you risk bleeding to a dangerous degree. There is always the possibilty of infection at the site of trauma. More dangerously, there is a risk of a slow infection that slowly enters the blood stream and silently causes damage of the heart valves and could later lead to stroke. There are cases 'bacterial endocarditis' that have been recorded after lip piercing.\n\n",

    "title": "Mouth ulcer",
    "content": "Hello Friend, I hope by now that your symptoms have improved. Due to the fact that it was initiated by trauma, you can pretty much rule out oral cancer. Cold sores (also may be referred to as canker sores or herpes simplex virus of the oral mucosa) should heal within 3-4 wks maximum. If not completely healed within this time frame, you will need to see your physician and have a biopsy (removal of small sample of tissue for analysis). Based on your history, most likely you have a simple mouth ulcer, which can be a  very painful white or yellow open sore that occurs anywhere on the mucous membrane of your mouth. If it developes into a cyst or unbearable swelling, go to your physician. In the meantime, decrease smoking and alcohol intake, maintain oral hygiene as tolerated and Ibuprofen may help to alleviate swelling which will in turn decrease some of the discomfort. Be sure to avoid spicy foods and lean toward bland foods and neutral liquids (water, Gatorade, or 7-Up as tolerated). Also, consider over the counter lidocaine  if available to you or something to that effect (ask the pharmacist or your dentist) if pain is unbearble.  Much luck. LMK how you are doing.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello  I\u2019m a 23 year old male without any real bad habits (IE Smoking, drinking) and for the past several weeks I\u2019ve been having an odd sensation on the inside of my right cheek. For awhile the skin inside my cheek felt raised, with a really intense coppery taste. That\u2019s calmed a little, but it still feels \u2018weird\u2019 and sometimes the coppery taste goes away but comes back after eating or rubbing the area with my tongue. Sometimes it also feels a bit stiff, I can move it easily enough but the area just feels stiffer on the skin, but when I move it goes away for awhile. Other times it has a rather annoying \u2018stinging\u2019 pain sensation, not really terribly painful just really annoying. I\u2019ve looked several times and can\u2019t find anything different in comparison to my other cheek, other then the skin looks slightly more \u2018wrinkled\u2019 like the skin of your fingers would look after too much time in the water.  I went to see the dentist for a cleaning little over a week ago and she said she didn\u2019t see anything unusual and that I may have just bit my cheek. But I\u2019ve bit my cheek before and I can\u2019t recall the symptoms lasting this long or being this irritating. I\u2019m really scared it might be something serious, though I may be panicking over nothing I\u2019d really rather be sure what it is and what I could do to help it. Any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you.\n\n",

There is another possibility, that this might a side effect of a new medicine that you started taking recently, but this is a remote possibility as usually this develops faster than that and does not affect only one half of the lip.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.  Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

The sense of smell and taste are very closely related and dysfunctions may have many causes, from recent infections, dehydration, smoking, vitamin deficiencies (B12 specifically), mineral deficiencies, etc. Have you had a recent dental exam to rule out any disorders? If you have had a dental exam then I would consider one of the other above problems. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

At first I had excessive thirst, would always be thirsty no matter how much I drank...there was always a feeling of a parched mouth. After about 3 days of drinking tons of water, soda. milk whatever I decided that maybe it was the sugar in all those drinks that was making my dry mouth worse...ao I switched to nothing but seltzer water about a gallon of it a day with maybe a pint or 2 of water during the day. I did this for 2 days and it gave me massive acid relux for which I took pepcid complete to get rid of it (I am still taking this). At this time I began to realize that I wasn't really thirsty..My stomach felt like it was packed with water (which is pretty much all I drink now) I figured It was the dry mouth that was making me think I was thirsty.  Anyways here I am 2 days later, still have a very dry mouth and now my eyes are starting to get slightly dry. I drink nothing but water and the occasional cup of caffine free root beer and the occasional glass of milk. My appetite is low as I have a hart time chewing, so I'am relegated to weak stews and soups. Also I havent turned on the heater in our home since the day after I got the dry mouth. ..so its been almost a week with no heater.  Any help will be greatly appreciated\n\n",

My first thought when there is a complaint of unquenchable or unusual  thirst is symptoms of diabetes. Some of the symptoms of diabetes are: unusual thirst, excessive hunger,frequent urination, unusual weight loss, extreme fatigue or lack of energy, blurred vision, frequent or recurring infections,cuts and bruises that are slow to heal, tingling &/or numbness in hands &/or feet etc. I would strongly suggest an evaluation to rule this out, as well as any other anomolies.

Is there any advice you could give me to get rid of it and have 'normal' looking lips.It makes me very self aware.\n\n",

    "content": "What you are experiencing is an abnormal sensation in the tongue. Most of the authorities associate taste and smell together all the time so what you might think is related to taste could actually be related to smell.   Taste and smell dysfunctions have several causes  1. Common cold and influenza.  2. Nose and throat infections.  3. Dry mouth.  4. Smoking (especially pipe). Do you smoke?  5. Vitamin B-12 or mineral (like zinc) deficiency.  6. Gingivitis. 7. Drug side effects such as antithyroid drugs, captopril, griseofulvin, lithium, penicillamine, procarbazine, rifampin, vinblastine, or vincristine.  8. Sjogren's syndrome (Dry mouth and eyes associated with some autoimmune diseases).  9. Bell's palsy (Paralysis of the nerve going to the face causing facial droop). Does not sound like it in your case.  10. Here's one more really unlikely possibility: Since sensation ultimately resides in the brain, the problem could be upstairs. Migraine, epilepsy and brain tumor all come to mind, but each of these would be exceptionally rare explanations for your problem.  I would advise you to see your doctor and have an examination of the nerves of your face, nose, ears, throat and tongue if your symptoms persist or worsen, or if your symptoms appear to be associated with other unusual symptoms.\n\n",

I don't remember though if xrays were done on opposite side of mouth and this is the side that I do have a tooth that I worry about.  I had taken meds that I had at home from having a wisdom tooth removed that became infected.  Only because she wasn't able to get me in that day.  So I thought after it cleared up I thought it must have been related to a cold I had had.  Now the same cheek is swollen again when I woke this morning.  After doing a search what has me afraid is could this be  Lupus related ?  Which I have been told I do not have and don't want to think this but I don't know what is going on.\n\n",

Also, my tongue has been sore.  At first I thought it was due to the fact that I may have bitten it, or some other oral-related injury, but it's been sore now for a few weeks, mainly in the back, and it keeps moving from side to side.  I was wondering if these two could be related, and if not, what could be causing my tongue problems.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear ichip, Oral ulcers are common and occur at times of stress when the body's immunity decreases. Given your history of depression it could well be the cause. It would be a combination of things really: lowered immunity combined with the oral injury.   Yeast infection (candida) is common in diabetics and those taking broad spectrum antibiotics. They could happen to anyone. If you still have them they should be checked out. Your doctor will prescribe an oral antifungal gel and rule out any underlying cause.\n\n",

I would like to clarify my problem if I may - I do not sense that I have bad breath, nor has anyone ever told me so.  Instead, what I do sense is an unfavorable odor from my saliva. I have tried breath mints or breath sprays but they do not remove the odor from my saliva.  I was wondering if there were a way to solve my problem but I am too embaressed to ask my local doctor. I would appreciate any kind of advice, Sincerely, temp.\n\n",

They have more trouble wearing dentures.   Bad breath is worst when there is little or no saliva flow, for example after a night's sleep. As soon as one wakes up and starts to salivate, the smell recedes somewhat.   Another classic way to get saliva flowing is to drop a few drops of lemon on your tongue (also helpful for saxophone players).   It becomes obvious then that saliva should smell a little offensive as it is responsible for ridding the mouth of its bad odours.\n\n",

It almost looks like strawberry tongue (usually happens to children I've heard), but I am 29 and as I said it still has not gone away after 5 weeks.  I visited a free clinic since I have no insurance and they said that they didn't know what it was nor did they prescribe anything.  They told me to rinse with hydrogen peroxide 3 times a day for a week and if that didn't help then to see a specialist.  Well its been a week and no change.  As a side note, I have been dating someone for the last 11 months who regularly breaks out in cold sores on his lips (not tongue).  I have no cold sores on my lips or on my gums.  Help.  Want to go to the hospital today but afraid I will just get the run around like at the free clinic and have to pay $400 for not being insured.\n\n",

The presence of bumps on either side of the tongue as opposed to only one side is against cancer (cancer usually develops as a painless bump on one side of the tongue). Other possible causes: oral herpes simplex infection, canker sores, tuberculosis, bacterial infections, or early-stage syphilis. It could also be an immune system problem or an allergy. The cause can usually be determined within the context of careful history taking and examination. Please keep these causes in mind during your next visit to the doctor and try to raise these possibilities for him/her.  Good luck.\n\n",

(We shared an orange the night before, and the sore was there in the morning.) It was not red and on the edge of the lip as most cold sores I've seen. It was white and in the middle of the bottom lip, and looked more like a canker sore, which from personal experience I know can be caused by acidic foods. However, in my research I see that canker sores are supposedly inside the mouth only. Do you think that this sore is contagious, or really just a food reaction? I have been kissing him...and getting cold sores is one thing that I never want to do. Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi!  Herpetic infections of the lips are quite common and could be transmitted to others as well as re-infect self by autoinoculation (eg. touching the lip sore and then wiping the eyes). As you rightly pointed out, canker sores are not found on the lips/gums/palate.  Topical (to apply over the lesion) antiviral medications may reduce viral shedding and increase patient comfort. For recurrent sores, that might not be enough, and emollients may be tried. If the recurrence is more than 6 time a year, oral antiviral medications may be tried so as to prevent it from happening. Immunodeficiency is another reason oral antiviral meds may be begun.  Hope this helps.  Warm regards,  Bill\n\n",

My symptoms include:  All-Over Headache, Stiffness on the lower neck/upper back, Nausea, 101.2 temperature, tiredness, Over-all malaise.  About 10 days ago I had a very corroded tooth built up (bottom back molar).  As soon as the novacaine wore off I got an amazing toothache.  I told my dentist but he couldn't do anything cause I was moving the next day.  Since then the toothache has continued (under my chin, on the side, and a small earache) and I have had to take Ibuprofen twice a day to get rid of the pain.  This morning when I woke up the pain was considerably less, I haven't had to take any pain killers at all today.  My question is - is it possible that the tooth could've drained an infection into another part of my body and that is why I am feeling so sick & sore now but the toothache has lessened?  Or am I just being paranoid and it's probably the flu?   Thanks.\n\n",
