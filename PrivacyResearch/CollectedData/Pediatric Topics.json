    "content": "Dear Doctor,  I am trying to find a reason what could provoke such a painful beginning of the menstrual period for a 15 year old girl during her first day of the menstrual period.  For the past year, we have been to 10 emergency rooms when the periods of the girl started. She would start vommitting on the first day of the menstrual periods, for 12 hours, every 30 minutes. When we get to ER, they can't stop the vommitting. The vommitting disapperas after 12 hours. The bleeding is normal, not heavy. All this is happenning in the first day when the periods start.   For the usual days all lab tests are ok, but when the periods start the acetone gets very high, leukocytes are higher than usual, and the fever is high. Moreover, pain in the abdomen, loosing constant consiousness, and increased convulsions. The girl is only 15 years old, didn't have any intercourse. The doctors cant give us a treatment for 10 months.  Could anyone give me any advice. Have done MRI on her hypothalamus during periods, before and after periods. Everything looked well. Did xrays on her ovaries also all was ok. And still she continues to vommit so much, every 30 minutes during 12 hours on the first day of the periods, and pain in the abdomen. Every month we end up in ER. We would appreciate if anyone could give us a hint, how we could diagnose what is the root of the problem. Could it be psychological, and why is the vommitting taking place for so many hours. Everytime I look at her, it is like I am loosing her. The second day of the periods everything is stabilizing, no more vommitting, the periods continue normally. Thank you very much.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Serendipity_link,  Some women will have extreme symptoms in association with their menses, especially young women.  You may want to consider talking with a gynecologist (or her pediatrician if he/she is comfortable with these issues) to discuss treatment options.  Frequently, we will treat women with oral contraceptives to try to \"smooth out\" the hormones some.  This will often really help with these symptoms.  I suspect that this fluctuation in hormones is contributing to her symptoms.  A less likely possibility would be something like endometriosis.  This condition can cause a lot of pain.   I am not sure why there would be the need to wait 10 months to treat.  Starting an oral contraceptive is only one of a few treatment options so discussing with a gynecologist can be very helpful.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Opto77,  There are a couple possibilities for this.  First, it may be a fun thing for her to do.  She may be playing when she does this and has made it a \"bedtime game\".  Second, she may actually have learned to self-sooth herself by doing this routine before sleep.    I'm not really sure this needs any treatment if she is healthy and isn't going to hurt herself by doing it (i.e. falling off the bed dangerously).  Often these behaviors go away on their own over time.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Ksk,  I suspect this issue has already been resolved for you.  Sorry for the late response.  I'll answer for the benefit of those searching for the same issue.  There are a few possibilities.  There may be a clogged duct.  Even though your daughter is young, there are still some ducts in the breast area that can become clogged.  These ducts can get infected so if it is painful I would suggest it be evaluated.    This may also be a swollen lymph node.  We generally think of lymph nodes only being in certain areas but there is lymphatic tissue spread throughout the body.    7 years old would be young but a common cause of lumps under the nipple are the appearance of breast buds.  These are the beginnings of breast development.  The key issue here is for the physician to recognize this so that the bump isn't biopsied.  Biopsy could potentially damage the tissue.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Tara-mara2010,  It sounds as if your daughter has quite a complex case.  Unfortunately, with the limitations of the internet, I am afraid I will not be of much help to you.  Your doctors may have already thought of this but when we hear of children getting frequent infections, especially repeated pneumonias, we think of immune deficiencies.  Additionally, if the same lobe of the lung is always the area involved, she may need a pulmonologist (lung specialist) to consider inserting a camera down the airways to take a look at what may be going on in that area.  There are several periodic fever syndromes, although this doesn't sound like any specific one that I am aware of.  Stay in touch with your doctor and continue to pursue an answer.  Often, with illnesses like this the diagnosis remains illusive until finally a new symptom develops that pulls everything together and allows the answer to be found.  Best wishes.  I wish I could be of more help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, An axillary swelling the size of a golf ball in a 10 year old boy needs to be investigated promptly. You have not mentioned about how it feels like(consistency). If is is cystic, a Cystic hygroma (Cystic lymphangioma) is a possibility. 75% of these occur in the neck, 20% in the axilla and 5% in the mediastinum, retroperitoneum, or pelvis.Most cystic hygromas (50-65%) present at birth, but can present at any age.   A lymph node mass is another possibility. There can be several causes for a lymph node mass in this area. A lymph node mass or any other mass needs to be biopsied(fine needle aspiration cytology-FNAC).  BCG associated lymphadenitis usually presents within 6-months but rarely presents late (there are reports of children who developed lymphadenitis 1 to 5 years after the vaccination). Non-tuberculous mycobacteria are the most common cause of mycobacterial lymphadenitis in children  in the US.  As for your grandson, the issue should be taken seriously and investigated promptly. The are likely to include baseline labs, a chest X-ray, soft tissue ultrasonography, and an FNAC.  Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, From your description, it seems likely that your little son may have fractured his clavicle in the recent past. Fractures of clavicle are common fractures in childhood.   They may even be surprisingly symptomless especially during infancy. It is probable that the trauma went unnoticed. In small children, the fracture tends to be of the green-stick type (due to the relatively thick periosteum in these children). But a firm diagnosis is only possible following a clinical examination. They almost always heal without any particular problem. Good luck!\n\n",

Burning hand and feet with bluish discoloration,light sensitivity are some of the features.These are more seen in infants and younger children.Post pink disease children complain of bright flashing lights. Mercury containing products are banned in many countries.Though the condition is unlikely in the present days,yet the condition needs to get reminded of when a child presents with light sensitivity and redness and pain of hands and feet.

    "content": "Hello,High platelet count(More than 400, 10 to the power of 9/L) is of two types.Commonest in the pediatric age group is secondary thrombocytosis which occurs generally during a bacterial infection.Primary types are rarer and associated with myelofibrosis.  The familial types which can be identified by testing the family members for thrombocytosis. Since your child has got leucocytosis this could represent a reaction to something like an upper respiratory infection.History of muco cutaneous bleeding and bruising may be the findings with the primary types.Splenomegaly is common here.Throbbing and burning of feet have been reported too in the primary types.  Iron deficiency anemia can present with thrombocytosis. Serum TPO(Thrombopoetin) levels may be of help to differentiate the types.This is usually elevated in reactive types. With my good wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,Hope your son has recovered and fine.The most worrying problem in heart disease is sub acute bacterial endocarditis.But this is comparitively commoner in valve replacement surgeries, than other interventional surgeries on the heart.The risk in treated congenital heart conditions is very low.Fever,Anaemia,increased white cell count,and positive result after blood cultures(Mainly staphlococci) are the cardinal features of SABE(Gram-ve organisms-open heart).Suspected source of infection would be dental caries,tonsillitis,sinusitis etc.So unexplained fevers not controlled with standard antibiotic treatment as in the case of valve replacements or congenital heart disease and bypass surgery would have to be investigated for SABE.Long term complication for fontan operation,are arrhythmias and development of protein losing enteropathy.

    "title": "Red Pinprick Dot Rash Only Appears When Sleeping??",
    "content": "My son is 10 months old. June 15th he had a 102 fever so we took him to the doctor. The doctor said he had an ear infection and a throat virus. Then I noticed a few pinprick dots on his feet. He was given amoxicillin and Tylenol for pain. The next day he would not drink, eat or hardly sleep. Towards the end of the night I noticed a rash and called the doctor. She asked me a lot of questions. At the time I could not feel the rash but I could see it. It was only on his feet and legs. It look like red pinprick dots. It seemed to go away when I stretched the skin. She said it was probably just the virus. We switched to infant ibuprofen because he wasn't comfortable, he was still in some kind of pain. The next day it was gone but it came back but only when he slept. He felt fine, was happy, eating and sleeping like normal. The doctor wanted to see him since the rash was still there. It went away before we made it to the doctors office. She looked at this ears and throat and they were all clear. No throat virus and no ear infection. She had us keep him on amoxicillin. Once again he went to sleep and it traveled up his stomach a little bit. Today he hasn't wanted to eat much but is taking bottles just fine. He's sleeping a little more than usual. His rash is just about gone until he sleeps again. After he's been asleep for about an hour. I can now feel the rash. It is a little bit raised off the skin. It doesn't seem to bother him at all. He has maybe three that look more inflamed then the others and those are on his fingers and toes. He has two bigger ones that look like mosquito bites and those only showed up today. Also, he has the dots in his diaper area and some on his arms. He is still on the amoxicillin and his flare ups have nothing to do with that. The first time I called the doctor it was after he hadn't had his nighttime dose. I have taken at least 20 pictures as it changes. The doctor told us it was probably nothing but I can't help but worry. He has a follow up on the 25th. Is there anything we can do? Is there something that doctor is missing? What could it be?\n\n",

    "content": "My son is 10 1/2.. when he was between the ages of 6 and 8 every month like clockwork he had a spiking fever 103 to 104 F, nasea with maybe one bout of vomiting, and he complained his tummy hurt although the dr's could find no evidence of why.  then after three days  it always seemed to go away..with or without antibiotics.. now its starting to happen again.  This time the hospital payed special attention to his sodium being at 128 and his urine sodium content being quite high. they admitted did several blood tests.  They checked for Addington's and it was negative.  he did have a positive blood culture for strep.  A strep throat culture was sent and it was negative.  A CXR was done and it was negative.  He was given only IV solution for the 4 days and once the positive blood strep culture came back they gave him Pencillin.  Every morning his serum sodium was low but by evening it would be just barely at the \"normal\" range.  I was also told he had a heart murmur (which they said could be due to the fever) and blood in his urine.  I have looked back over some of the bloodwork done over the years and also see his platelet count is quite high...and his sodium was low but only at 133 in previous blood results.  As his fever came down and his blood work was getting better they discharged him.  Can anyone tell me what could possibly be going and what to ask about as four years of this is just to much.  thanks in advance...\n\n",

    "title": "Re: 7 Month Old with Constipation",
    "content": "Hello, It is certainly distressing to see your daughter's discomfort.  Be assured that this is probably a temporary problem and the changes in diet will most likely improve the situation.  Breast fed babies are rarely constipated and so it surprises mothers when they wean their babies from the breast that they encounter this problem.  The system has a harder time digesting artificial formula so it is common for them to have this problem.    The infrequency of stool is not a concern and not an indication of constipation but the dry, \"pellets\" may be.  Some babies benefit from the addition of about 4 ounces of juice per day.  Giving fruits like peaches, prunes and vegetables like squash, carrots and sweet potatoes along with cereals like oatmeal, barley and mixed.  The rice cereal sometimes contributes to constipation so I would try one of the others.  In time, these changes will probably help but you may have to also try a different formula.  The problem is that it takes a couple of weeks to really know how the change is affecting the baby.  Sometimes a mild laxative or suppository is necessary but you should discuss this option with your child's doctor.  Just remember that the goal is not a certain frequency of bowel movements; just a softer consistency that allows her to pass it easily.  As she gets older, more fiber in her diet may be needed.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I think you are describing straining to pass a stool.  This is fairly common.  Please be sure your child is getting fiber in his diet and plenty of water to drink.  Dehydration will result in dry, hard-to-pass feces.  Fiber is found in whole fruits and vegetables, beans and whole grains.  If these measures don't help, you should discuss this with his health care provider in case a mild laxative is needed but in most cases normal stool can be achieved with diet, liquids and activity.  At his age, I suspect activity is not a problem.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I was thinking it was possibly a keloid but after much research I've seen that they don't form in newborns and they come after having some sort of trauma, which is impossible as she had it on arrival.

    "content": "My 2 year old little girl has been getting up at night and projectile vomiting, at least once a night, her fever has reached 100, and she is listless. She has a runny nose and complains of stomach pains during the day, she feels a little hot, but not with a bad fever, but at night it all gets worse... I am concerned and I would like some more information on what I should do. I know that I am keeping her hydrated but what else can I do? Should I use a cold rag or cold water on her neck and forehead? what kind of medication should I give her? is there anything I can do about her throwing up? is it bad that she is better in the day and gets much worse at night? should I take her to the doctor or hospital?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi- My 8 month old daughter has always gotten phlegm when she drinks anything and everything. At this point, she drinks soy formula, apple juice, water and pedialyte. We have tried to have her drink sitting up and that didn't make any difference. She starts drinking, starts sounding congested, gets phlegmy and then has to drop what she is drinking and tries to catch her breath. I feel so helpless! Our pediatrician has said that perhaps she isn't digesting it properly. How is that? I just don't know what to do for her. She is starting to get frustrated so she refuses her bottle and/or sippy cup!\n\n",

One possibility would be Enfamil's Pregestamil which is effective for many children with metabolic and digestive problems.    I would also add humidity to the room to help her with thick secretions.  If these measures don't help she may need additional testing for metabolic disorders.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "9 month old not eating nearly enough",
    "content": "Thank you for your help. My 9 month old son was born at 24 weeks gestation. He was gaining weight well until about 3 months ago. At that time he had a VP shunt placed. (Also that was when he switched to formula from breast milk) Since then he has fallen off the growth chart. Last month he gained only 2 ounces. The neurosurgeon does not think it is related to the shunt. He has had an upper GI which showed nothing. He has been on Reglan since birth and Prevacid for 2 months now.  It is a constant struggle to feed him. He is only 14lbs and eats a scant 15 - 18 ounces a day. His Dr. told us he needed a minimum of 20oz just to maintain and that we had to make him eat at least that. It makes me want to scream. If I force feed him he throws up. We are feeding him every 2 hours around the clock and are at our wits end. We are so worried about him.  His gastrointerologist  had us switch his formula to a hypoallergenic last week, but he seems to despise that even more. He is bright eyed and vocal still but he is starting to sleep a lot more. I am worried that his lack of growth will have long term consequences.  I don't want to insist on a g-tube, but the pace at which this diagnosis is moving is frightening me.  What could be causing this? Allergy? Reflux? Behavioral issues? Neurological issues?  Please help!\n\n",

Your child may benefit from a special \"pre-digested enzyme\" formula such as Enfamil's Pregestamil which may need to be specially ordered by your pharmacy.  Talk to your child's pediatrician about this possibility.  Your child may be sensitive to both cow's milk and soy proteins.  If this change doesn't help he may need to have additional testing done for other metabolic disorders.    Best wishes.\n\n",

Sometimes people will say they have a \"cold in the eye.\"  If it is caused by bacteria treatment may be needed with antibiotic drops.  Sometimes it will clear on its own, especially if it is viral in nature, and you can just use warm moist washcloths to clear the gunk out.  Use gentle strokes from the inside to outside aspect of they eye lids.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Additional response to jasonw, If I am understanding this correctly the child received the adult instead of the child's dose, or did you mean in addition to the child's dose?  If it was the adult dose instead, it was basically the equivalent of a double dose and the additional amount of vaccine your child received will not be harmful.  It is good that you were notified in case you notice any adverse reactions.  Sometimes extra vaccines are given when records are not available, etc. and it does not do harm unless the child had a reaction to it as an isolated event.  Basically the dose is considered valid, even though there was an error and it does not need to be repeated or corrected.  If he received the adult dose AND the child's dose (since it was given in place of the Hib) then the dosage is three times recommended but still unlikely to cause a problem unless as noted above.  Additional doses of vaccines are rarely a problem.  It is still a bit confusing to me based on the listed vaccines given which indicates he did receive the Hib.    Best wishes.\n\n",

While uncommon, breast cancer can occur within your son's age group, for either males or females.  I urge you to have this evaluated as soon as possible.  If that evaluation is negative, it may be related to developing hormone levels of puberty.  To evaluate that possibility, please see an endocrinologist.    Please let us know what you find out.

    "content": "Hello all,  I just thought I'd add a bit of reassurance to this issue.  It is very common to have some breast tissue develop in pubertal boys.  This is because both men and women actually have breast tissue.  During puberty, levels of testosterone and estrogen rise in boys (and girls).  This rise can cause some initial enlargement of the breast tissue that subsequently resolves as the level of testosterone increases and the estrogen levels settle down a bit in boys, while in girls the estrogen levels continue to increase inducing further development of breast tissue.  Breast cancer, while possible, would be incredibly rare at this age.  It would NOT generally be advised to have a biopsy of this tissue in a pubertal aged child.  Instead, reassurance and continued observation are usually the appropriate choice.  Best wishes.\n\n",

He complains of the pain 2 to 4 times daily. He is a good, healthy eater and has always had a normal, consistent bowel routine, usually having a bowel movement twice daily. Lately, I've noticed he's been having more bowel movements daily, 3 to 4 daily, the other day he had 5. At first, I thought perhaps he was complaining of hunger pain, but yesterday in the middle of dinner, he started having the pain and couldn't eat anymore. I am going to take him to the pediatrician on Monday, however thought I may find some answers here. Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I know how difficult it is to watch your child suffer.  If your daughter has constipation with her IBS then narcotics would just add to the problem, besides affecting her neurologically.    If she has diarrhea symptoms with her condition, she might benefit from loperamide (Imodium).  Other medications may include anticholinergics for cramping, antidepressants (like amitriptyline), or antianxiety agents such as paroxetine (Paxil).  Sometimes psychological therapy or stress management may help with stress that may precipitate her IBS episodes.  Other alternative therapy might include dietary changes, if she notices any pattern with her foods.  A diary or journal can help to determine such triggers.  Regular exercise almost always helps and she should avoid adding any substances such as tobacco or alcohol that could make things worse.    Best wishes for both of you,\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Sometimes babies have trouble getting rid of secretions because they are a little bit thick.  Have you tried adding some humidity to the room, especially if you are in a dry climate.  This can help thin and loosen the mucus.  The fact that the baby was OK after the scare is encouraging that it is probably not a serious problem or defect.  It would be impossible to diagnose a hiatal hernia or any other condition without seeing the baby.  Many babies have reflux and the acid that backs up into the esophagus can cause severe pain and this may be the reason for the episode.  Your doctor will probably evaluate the baby for this.  Sometimes oral medication helps if this is what they determine to be the cause.  In most cases the baby outgrows the condition by six months to a year so this is painful, but usually not long-term.  Best wishes.\n\n",

The color of stool varies with diet and as long as it's pasty, it does not sound like constipation.  Sometimes it's just a matter of maturity and his body getting the signals.  Just keep trying, encourage him and if you don't have a small potty chair, perhaps that would help him to relax a little.  It's also fine to have him sit with a picture book or something while waiting.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "My 23 month old daughter has not been herself since last Thursday.  Every evening - with the exception of Saturday and Monday - she has vomited.  It usually happens only once (Thursday it was twice) but the VOLUME of vomit is unreal.  It seems that she is losing everything she's eaten all day, up until then.  Other than this she is fine.  No fever.  No diarrhea. Not dehydrated.  A little lethargic and not as hungry as usual but happy within herself.  They haven't noticed anything unusual at daycare.  She hasn't tried any new foods.  We took her to the clinic last night and were told not to worry; that it was just a 'tummy bug'.  I've never heard of a tummy bug that acted like this.  Wouldn't she be sick all day?  Wouldn't there be some other symptom?  Please advise.  I am worried..\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Should I be concerned about my daughter's digestive health?",
    "content": "Hello Fireflower,  Vomiting happens often in toddlers and can be \"normal.\"  Vomiting such as you describe your daughter is doing could be due to delayed gastric emptying, where the food and drink stay in the stomach longer, the stomach becomes overfull, and thus the child vomits.  A medication called Reglan or certain antibiotics can be given to help the stomach empty faster.  (Note: antibiotics should be used judiciously and only when necessary to avoid needing increasingly stronger dosages) If there is weight loss or signs of dehydration, or if you know she isn't improving, she needs to be re-evaluated.  Since children can't report symptoms well and it's a matter of observation, the American Pediatric Association recommends that you keep a symptom diary of her vomiting, noting the time, what she was doing at the time she vomited (as, crying or playing), and what she last had to eat and/or drink.  If she doesn't return to normal soon, have her regular doctor check her, and don't hesitate to get a second opinion if you are still concerned.  Some general guidelines of actions to take when children are unusually ill:  When to call 911:  if the child is having trouble breathing, or if there is severe dehydration, which includes excessive sleepiness, fussiness, sunken eyes, cold, dizziness, splotchy hands and feet, or delerium.  In these situations, minutes count.  When to go to the Emergency Room:  if there is severe abdominal pain, vomit has bile (dark green substance) or more than a tinge of blood or blood that looks like coffee grounds (and take a sample of vomit with you to the ER), has a swollen, tender abdomen, or is irritable or lethargic, which may also occur with a stiff neck (signs of meningitis), or there is high fever (102 F or above).     When to call your doctor:  if there has been vomiting steadily for 24 hours, signs of dehydration (decreased urine - as, 6 to 8 hours without a wet diaper, blood in vomit (a tiny amount is likely due to esophogeal irritation and isn't cause for alarm), or jaundice (yellowing of skin and whites of eyes).  If you suspect your child has swallowed a toxic substance, call the American Association of Poison Control Center hotline (800-222-1222) or your local poison control center immediately.   I hope this helps.  Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: 2 1/2 yo with a undescended testicle",
    "content": "Hi,  Cryptorchidism is perhaps, the most common genital problem encountered in pediatric practice.  Cryptorchidism is a broad term which includes incompletely descended, retractile, absent ,ectopic, or atrophic testes.  Clinically, undescended testes may be -  palpable or  - nonpalpable.  Approximately 80% of undescended testes are palpable and 20% are nonpalpable. Nonpalpable testes may be either intra-abdominal or absent.  Some types of \u201cpalpable\u201d testes may be at times, difficult to palpate. For example, - testes which just come out of the internal inguinal ring on straining but get back into the abdomen otherwise, are sometimes called as the \u201cemergent\u201d or \"peeping\" testes, and - those in the superficial inguinal pouch in obese individuals.  The undescended testis poses certain problems, notably... - the risk of testicular cancer - Risk of torsion of the testicle - risk of reduction in spermatogenesis and - risk posed by an associated inguinal hernia.  For undescended testicle discoverd at birth, there is not much controversy about the management.These are treated by orchidopexy between 12-18 months of age (some prefer at 9-12 months of age).The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends surgical correction at one year of age.  In any case, surgery before 6 months of age is not preferred due to the following reasons... - The blood vessels of the testis are of very thin caliber and thus prone to damage. - some of the undescended testes(rather low lying) may descend spontaeneously upto 6 months of age.  From the age of 2 years, changes occur in the testis which can be found on light microscopy as well as electron microscopy. Bringing the testis down into the scrotum before this age can improve semen quality and fertility later in life. Men born with bilateral undescended testes usually have very poor sperm quality, even if corrected by surgery.  Unilateral cryptorchidism has a reported infertility rate of about 10%, compared with about 6% reported for the general population of adult men.The fertility reduction following orchiopexy for bilateral cryptorchidism is more marked, about 38%, or 6 times that of the general population.  As for the anesthetic risk, risk between 6 months of age and 2 years is far less compared to the risks in adults (more the age, more the risk, generally).  In recent times, laparoscopic management of intra-abdominal testes has become possible.  Your child needs to be assessed by a pediatric surgeon and the best course of management should be planned. I trust this information may be useful to you. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Child back pain: Real or psychogenetic?",
    "content": "Hello samwarr,  Back pain is uncommon before adolescence.  Children usually do not use pain symptoms for secondary gain.  Chronic pain in children demands further evaluation, and organic diseases must be considered.  In a 6-year orthopedic study, it was found that back pain was the cause of referral in less than 2% of referrals in children age 15 or under, but approximately half of those children had serious underlying disease.  Back pain has many potential causes; psychogenic pain isn't impossible, but is extremely rare, and should be considered only after extensive evaluation, including orthodpedic, rheumatologic (pediatric rheumatologist, if possible), neurologic and pain specialist evaluations.  Nocturnal back pain in particular must be evaluated, as osteoid sarcoma or osteoblastoma must be ruled out; CT scan is the definitive study.  When giving the history of the pain, include the onset or precipitating event, if known, the location of the pain, whether it is localized or radiates, and details such as is it continuous, how severe it is, is it present upon awakening, is there fever, what helps or makes it worse, and has the pain altered the child's usual functional ability and activities.  Evaluation of social and family factors should also be made.  The initial tests are usually comprised of a complete blood count, uric acid, urinalysis and culture, lactate dehydrogenase level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and specific imaging, such as X-ray, CT, MRI, bone scan, and single-photon emission computed tomography, as recommended by the various specialists.    Discussion with your daughter's pediatrician is recommended, with requests for further evaluation and referral to the specialists listed above.  If you desire, a second opinion can be useful.  Good luck to you and to your daughter.  Please advise us if we can provide further information or assistance, and let us know how things turn out.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Is there something wrong with my sons puberty?",
    "content": "Hello markymark,  Puberty generally occurs between the ages of 13 and 15, although it can occur earlier or have later completion.  The initial signs of puberty include increased growth, especially of height; increased shoulder width; growth of penis and testicles; voice changes; pubic, beard and armpit hair growth; and nighttime ejaculations (\"wet dreams.\")  There are 5 stages of male sexual development:  1.  Downy pubic hair that is similar to abdominal hair appears.  2.  Enlargement of the scrotum and testes occur.  The scrotal enlargement includes reddening and folding of the scrotal skin.  Sparse pubic hair becomes apparent.  3.  Enlargement of the penis occurs.  The majority of this growth is in length, although some changes in the diameter of the penile shaft may occur.  Further enlargement of the scrotum and testes occur, and pubic hair thickens, curls and becomes coarse in texture.  4.  The changes noted in Stage 3 continue, with enlargement of the penile glans (head), with thickening of hair in the pubic area.  5.  Completion of sexual maturation, in which the penis, scrotum and testes are fully matured and adult-sized.  The testes constantly manufacture sperm, with limited storage space available in a scrotal structure called the epididymis, so sperm must be released occasionally to make room for the newly manufactured sperm.  Nocturnal emissions are the result, and are a normal part of maturation.  Physical growth can continue in males into their 20s, though further growth of the penis and scrotum would be very minimal, if at all.  If your son is progressing through the stages according to those described above, he is likely a \"late bloomer.\"  However, this should not be assumed, and should be evaluated by your doctor, who can check testosterone and growth hormone levels and provide you with specific medical advice as to whether or not there is a growth problem with your son.  Testosterone and/or  human growth hormone can be replaced until maturation is achieved.  Consultation with an endocrinologist may be recommended.  Good luck to you and your son.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: 2 year old with lump under sternum",
    "content": "Hi, There could be several causes for a lump close to the xiphisternum in this age group. - benign soft tissue tumors(lipomas, neurofibromas) - rectus sheath hematomas.  One of the more common causes of abdominal wall trauma in children is lap belt injury. In addition to intraabdominal manifestations such as bowel injury, lap belt injuries can result in contusion or hematoma of the anterior abdominal wall. If there is injury to the structures within the rectus sheath (rectus abdominis muscle, the superior and inferior epigastric vessels), a rectus sheath hematoma results. It can be occur in any part of the rectus sheath(more common below the arcuate line). Occasionally, it occurs as a feature of child abuse.  In your child's case, as there is no history of pain, tenderness or redness(to suggest a rectus sheath hematoma), a lipoma or a neurofibroma are the more likely diagnoses to be entertained.You must show your son to his pediatrician who will be able to arrive at a more definitive diagnosis after examining your son.

If there is no oozing fluid or pus and your doctor is OK with it you can put a few drops of warm, not hot, oil (such as olive or vegetable) in the ear and there are some prescription pain relieving drops if this doesn't do the job.  Try to keep water out of the ear.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi i am very worried about my 3 year old son he has frequent nosebleeds and has done done for a couple of years now, i understand that children do sometimes suffer from nose bleeds but they are becoming more frequent i have taken him to the doctors on a couple of occasions but they are putting it down to him putting his finger up his nose. Which he has now learnt not to as he fears that he will get a nose bleed but the nose bleeds are occurring at any time sometimes when he is asleep and there is a lot of blood and sometimes when he is just sat doing nothing and after he has the nose bleeds he seems to be very hypoactive i know that these are related as i have monitored them, i am just not sure what to do as i have taken him to the doctors and the hospital and they put it down to the blood vessels in the nose, i would just like a second opinion, if possible please. Many thanks\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Frequent Nosebleeds in children",
    "content": "Hello, We don't know exactly why some people are more prone to nosebleeds than others.  In some cases relief is obtained by adding extra humidity to the room, especially when sleeping so if you have not tried this you might want to.  Perhaps a saline nose spray could also be used and a lubricating ointment for the inside of the nose (apply gently with a cotton swab).  Also, some people benefit from additional salt in the diet.  Along with preventing physical trauma (as with fingers and foreign objects), these are some easy home remedies to try.    Nosebleeds are rarely a cause of serious problems so try not to worry about it but teach your child how to deal with it when it happens.  This includes pinching the soft part of the nose and then pushing this tissue towards the face to apply pressure.  Have him lean forward so the blood does not run down his throat and continue for five full minutes.  He should sit quietly, not lie down, and ice may help. He should avoid bending over, straining or eating hot foods.  You can try a nasal decongestant to constrict the blood vessels but this should be only an occasional, temporary measure.  Best wishes.\n\n",

This condition responds to external application like canesten.There is nothing to worry.Also you may be advised to take food rich in Bcarotene. A doctor would be able to confirm the diagnosis and also to rule out other conditions like vitiligo. Bestwishes.\n\n",

I have talked to his pediatrician about it at every checkup and she pushes it to the side and won't discuss it.

You would need more information on her condition and what the doctors have suggested in the way of restriction to be certain.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It could be just a preference or a sensitive gag reflex that discourages his eating, but I would recommend a visit to the pediatrician to see if there is any other physiological concern.  If it is emotional and he just doesn't like solid food, the doctor might suggest some supplemental liquid nutrition while introducing soft foods gradually.  Does he try finger foods like dry cereal or crackers?  Does he eat anything with a gel-base such as jello or fruit snacks?  If he gags on everything it would suggest a problem that should be checked out - enlarged adenoids or some other obstruction perhaps.    At any rate it's time for an exam with a doctor.

    "content": "Hi, You have not mentioned certain details in the history provided such as, - the duration of the symptoms, - whether your son is complaining of severe pain, - if there is any redness of the scrotum,or - has he any fever?.  I can well understand  your anxiety and concern. If your son has acute pain or redness of the scrotum, then one will call it as an \"acute scrotum\"- a surgical emergency. Several causes need to be considered including, - torsion of the testis, - torsion of the apppendix of the testis(Appendix testis),  - a strangulated inguinal hernia, - an acute orchitis,and - an acute epididymitis or epididymo-orchitis.  In the absence of the aforesaid picture(i assume it is so), other conditions which need to be considered are, - Acute idiopathic scrotal edema and - insect bites.  Acute idiopathic scrotal edema (AISE), a self-limiting acute scrotal edema and erythema that resolves without sequelae.The cause is not known. It appears likely that it is a localized allergic phenomenon, perhaps a local form of angioneurotic edema.May be sometimes associated with periurethral infection or acute anal fissures.  Insect bites are also capable of causing this type of a presentation.  In your child (going by the history and assuming that an acute scrotum had been excluded), an insect bite or AISE appear most likely.An ultrasound and color doppler evaluation of the scrotum usually can sort this out fairly reliably. He should be expected to get well quite soon. Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, To some degree hormones are involved.  As you reach puberty your body does put on some extra fat layers as part of the protection that might be needed in pregnancy.  It is intended from ancestral times to protect a growing baby even in times of famine.  That is, if the mother has some extra layers of fat, she will be able to sustain her pregnancy even when food is scarce.  These days we don't usually need this but still it's there.  Your body will round out a bit as you mature, but it is important not to store more fat than is needed and you should be physically active every day along with eating healthy foods without added fat and sugar.    You should discuss your concerns with your family doctor or pediatrician who can determine whether or not this is excessive or if you need to worry.  The doctor can also determine if any lab tests for thyroid disorder might be needed.  You may benefit from a dietician consult as well.  You are wise to be alert to this as we are in an epidemic of obesity at present.  It can be difficult to know what is normal growth/maturity and what is just plain fat.  Finding healthy physical activities will definitely help.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Does your child have any trouble with his bowels (constipation or other)?  Sometimes they have movements near the same time each day and this could be part of his pattern.  You might try giving him a warm pad to see if it helps.  The fact it does not continue throughout the day is reassuring that it is not a serious concern.  Perhaps there is something in his diet that is bothering him. Does he have trouble when he eats any particular food that you have noticed?  Some children have lactose intolerance and don't do well with milk.  Keep a food and activity diary to see if there is a pattern.  If it continues or gets worse, you should have him seen by a health care provider.  Best wishes\n\n",

    "content": "My son's right knee became swollen (size of small baseball) 2 weeks ago and started limping.  He never complained of pain, he just limped around on it.  On Monday we took him to the doctor to get it checked out.  The doctor checked his mobility in his knee to check his ligaments and tendons and they all moved fine.  There were no prior falls, temperature, bites or rashes that I could recall prior to this.  We decided that we would give him motrin for 48 hours and ice/heat during that time and go back regardless on Wednesday.  They followed up on Tuesday and there was no change in his leg.  Tuesday night he did complain his leg and back hurt (maybe overcompensating for limping).  Wednesday we returned and took blood to test for ESR, CBC, ANA and arthritis and wrote a prescription for knee xray.  I mentioned to the doctor if we should check his hip too, just incase?  Today we will go get an xray to find out more.    Is there anything else we should check for or get other tests done?  What if nothing comes back from the xray, should we get an MRI?  Please advise.  Thank you for your time.\n\n",

You can always follow up later if it continues to give him pain but you sometimes need to let the body take care of itself once you rule out any more immediate concerns.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "5 Year Old Daughter with crotch pain",
    "content": "Hi, My 5 year old daughter has crotch pain (no itching) in her vaginal area and her anus.  There is nothing visible in either area.  No redness, etc.  This started about 2 1/2 months ago on vacation.  It occurs several times a day and we put some cream on her which helps temporarily.  (It doesn't seem to matter what type of cream--we've used desitin, nystatin, clotrimazole--nothing helps permanently).  When it first started we took her to the doctor, they tested her urine and it tested negative for infection.  A couple of weeks later at another doctor's appointment, she tested positive for a UTI.  She was put on amoxicillan.  After 2 or 3 days she hadn't improved much so the doctor put her on another antibiotic (I can't remember which).  Over the next week or two, it slowly seemed to get better.  When she finished her antibiotics, the problem seemed to have stopped.  It was mostly gone for about two weeks, but then it started up again.  I took her back to the doctor and her urine was tested again, and tested negative.  There really is nothing visibly wrong.  The doctors have no idea and we are at our wits end.  Her behavior through all of this has been awful (can't blame her, poor thing--she feels miserable!)  But I'm about the pull my hair out!  Also, at the same time that the crotch pain started, she began to have severe itching on the soles of her feet.  There is no visible problems here either.  Her feet look perfect.  About 3 times a day she will say her feet are too itchy, and we rub hydrocortizone or Benadryl anti-itch creme on her feet and she's okay for awhile.  I can deal with this problem, it's not nearly as bad as the other, but I mention it because they started at the same time and could possibly somehow be connected (though I can't see how).    Also, both problems began while we were on vacation and we were using a hot tub/swimming pool that week.  Don't know if that could somehow be related...  And we've checked her for pin worms and haven't found anything.  Not to mention that she doesn't scratch her bottom at all.  She does seem to find some relief by just putting her hand in her underwear and holding herself.  Please help!  Thank you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: 5 Year Old Daughter with crotch pain",
    "content": "Update:  In the month since I wrote about this problem the feet itch stopped, but the crotch pain continued.  We finally got her on another antibiotic, which made a difference right away.  It went from her complaining about the pain several times each day, to just once a day--and sometimes not at all.  However, after ten days on the medicine it hadn't competely gone away.  The doctor renewed her prescription and she has since been on it another ten days.  I took her to a urologist last week who told us to decrease the dosage (from 1 1/2 tsp. twice/day to 1 tsp. once/day).  In the past few days the pain has begun to increase.  THat doctor is now out of his office for a few weeks and the other doctor in his office told us to just continue the prescription (which he renewed) until the other doctor gets back.  My daughter will have been on the antibiotics at that point for 6 weeks. And the problem is not going away!  I called my family doctor back because I didn't feel I could wait for 3 more weeks with the problem increasing again.  He wants to refer us to another urologist who can see her sooner.  I have been giving her cranberry juice and acidopholus tablets in the meantime to try to prevent yeast infections.  Does anyone have any ideas about what it could be that is causing this pain?  She doesn't have extra pain when she urinates, so the usual symptoms of UTI aren't there, but clearly it is helped by the antibiotics, but the medicine is not clearing whatever it is up completely.  PLEASE HELP US!  This problem is causing major stress and strain for our family.  Thank you!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Weight should be evaluated based on the graph for development - height for weight and it should follow a normal growth curve for him.  It is not so important what the weight is but that he is growing at the appropriate rate based on his birth weight and age.  If he is eating well and doing fine developmentally there is also the element of genetics involved.  I assume your child gets well child visits with a pediatrician or family doctor who is monitoring the development and growth.    Some children have metabolic disorders which can interfere with their growth so you should make certain he is not having any trouble along those lines so it is important to have follow-up care with his doctor.

The bleeding stopped pretty quickly with washcloth and ice applied-- she's not in terrible pain.  Her dentist is on vacation.  Is this emergency room material?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Having ruled out a broken bone, it is best to just watch and see if it resolves on its own (probably will).  There may have been some soft tissue injury but since they have checked it out, the best thing is watchful waiting but try not to worry too much. Children will do what they feel up to and will let you know if there is pain.  The gait of a child this age still may not be what you will see later on.  The bones still rotate a bit for several years of the child's life.  Usually it gets straighter as time goes on.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The best thing for newborns with stuffy nasal passages is some humidity in the room and saline nose drops.  Use these carefully and then follow with a bulb syringe to remove mucus.  Sometimes it's just swelling of the tiny little nose and not really a cold.  But it is hard for the baby to breathe at times as you say.  The normal temperature and hydration is encouraging.  I am not aware of an oil but a humidifier is good to have in the room.  If she develops fever, breathing problems, or does not eat call the pediatrician.  Giving her breast milk is the best thing you can do since this provides antibodies against germs in the environment.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "3 year old daughter - hx febrile seizures, erratic temp",
    "content": "After receiving the MMR vaccination, our 18-month old daughter began having what has been classified as grand mal febrile seizures. She's had many. At least 10 - 15 of them. We've also noticed that she has focal seizures as well.   During many of these seizures doctors could not find anything wrong with her or a reason for her fevers. Her temperature was always erratic. We went through 7 thermometers of all types because we thought they were broken. One second her temp would be 102.3, a minute later it would be 101.7, the next minute it would be 99.7, then would jump back up to 101.5, etc. This occurred each and every time she had a seizure. We kept telling her pediatrician but he seemed to ignore us. This is our 3rd child - we are NOT hysterical parents.   Our pediatrician at the time finally sent her for an evaluation with a neurologist where she had a CT and an EEG. The results came back inconclusive and the neurologist suggested we put her on anit-seizure medication. We declined.   She experienced the worst seizure the day before Thanksgiving November 2008. It lasted 20 minutes. At the emergency room, the doctors could not find any reason for her fever. Again, she was given a rocephin shot and put on oral antibiotics.   We had had enough and we stopped taking her to the doctor. We remained hypervigilant to her temperature for several months and started letting her body fight it's own infections. She got sick, but had no seizures. Her body temperature when she had fevers was what I would consider normal. It would rise slowly and drop slowly.   Last Monday while she was at daycare, she had another seizure while outside playing. This was her first seizure in over 1 1/2 years. I took her home after she became more aware of her surroundings (took about 45 minutes) and she slept for 3 hours. When she woke up she had fever of about 101.8. I gave her a dose of Motrin and she immediately threw it up. I wasn't going to take her in to see a doctor or anything, but it was suggested by a friend that I take her in since she hadn't had a seizure in so long and wasn't able to hold down the meds.   I took her to the ER where she had 103 fever. They tried to give her Tyelonol orally but she promptly threw it up. They gave her a suppository. It took 3 hours for her temperature to return to normal. Then an hour later it started shooting back up again. They ran a chest x-ray (clear) and did a BMP blood work. Her WBC was a little elevated. Her throat, nose, ears, eyes were clear. They sent us home with a recommendation to follow up with our PCP. They gave me a 650 mg tylenol suppository to use that night (cut in half for each dose). I gave her half and it took the second half four hours later before her temperature went down to normal.   The next day at our PCP, our daughter had a fever of 101.9 and the doctor remarked that she didn't seem sick. She was talkative, alert, awake, moving, jumping up and down, happy. The doctor also noted how long it took for her temperature to lower when we were at the ER the previous evening. The doctor discovered a red throat and white pus pockets. Ran a strep test (negative) and said she had pharyngitis and gave her a shot of Rocephin and a prescription of Cefdini 250 mg which she has been taking twice daily 1/2 tsp.   By Tuesday night, her fever was gone. Kept her home Wednesday and she was great. Anxious to go back to school. Wednesday night I checked on her and she was sleeping on top of her coverlet, sweating profusely. Her temp was 94.6.   She returned to daycare today (Thursday) and was fine all day until she woke up from her nap. She had a temperature. The daycare worker took her temperature in both ears and got two varied readings. 99.9 Right ear and 97.5 in the left. They gave her Tylenol and I picked her up. They checked her temperature again and it was 99.7 in the right ear and 89.9 in the left ear. I called the doctor and they wanted to see her today.   They're running tests to check out her thyroid and pitituitary glands. and the doctor mentioned something about a calcium test??? I'm waiting on these results. They're also setting up a referral to send her to a pediatric endocrinologist.   Tonight she seemed fine, but then started complaining about her throat hurting. I gave her a cool drink of juice and left the room. (It was bedtime) A few minutes later I heard her whimpering and when I checked on her she threw up. She then complained about her head hurting. Her fever was completely erratic, 101.6 to 99.9 to 100.3 and back down again. I gave her a suppository of tylenol and am waiting to see what happens through the night.   If you read this far - - - you are too kind.   What kinds of things could the doctor be looking for by doing these tests and sending our daughter to a pediatric endocrinologist?  What type of questions do I need to be asking?  What should we know in advance?   Special Note: I took Brethine during my 2nd and 3rd trimester. She was 4 weeks early and breech (I have a septum that divides my uterus).  Special Note 2: Her father had febrile seizures.  Special Note 3: She is in the 99th percentile. Age 3, 49.8 pounds and over 3 feet tall. I forgot how much exactly. She's not fat. Has a lot of energy. Has trouble falling asleep, Eats well and a lot.\n\n",

This could be due to a number of causes including - torsion of the testis, - torsion of the apppendix of the testis(Appendix testis), and - a strangulated inguinal hernia.  Some of the differential diagnoses are, - an acute orchitis, - an acute epididymitis or epididymo-orchitis, - Acute idiopathic scrotal edema and - insect bites.  I urge that any child with this kind of history should be taken immediately to the A&E department of the nearest hospital for an emergency assessment.Hope your brother was treated and is well by now.

    "content": "Hello, It is much less common in girls, but boys often continue to grow in stature even through the early twenties.  Most commonly the growth is completed by around age 16, but I am aware of many boys who continued to grow several inches and achieved their full height in their twenties.    Typically your height will reflect your family genes, though good nutrition can encourage growth to the degree that the children pass both their parents in stature.  So, examining your family tree will help you determine your likely adult height.  The fact that your bones have not yet fused may very well indicate continued growth for you.  Best wishes.\n\n",

However, I'm concerned that it was roseola, because of the sequence of events: fever for about a week, then a rash that lasted a couple days.    Normally if he's exposed to something he's allergic to he'll get a rash for about 30 minutes, an hour at the most.   The normal allergy rash is bumps that are flesh colored.  This rash was flat and red, so I'm pretty sure it was related to the fever.  My main question is that since the rash went away while he slept last night, if it was roseola or a virus of some sorts, should we still be concerned about him being contagious???  We take him to a little kids play gym on Saturday mornings, we don't want to expose other kids to it.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I am not aware of any risk associated with giving vaccines while recovering from lead poisoning.  If you are worried about further exposure from mercury in thimerisol for preservation of vaccine, you should know that very few vaccines now contain this so that would not be a concern.  Some people do choose to use an alternative schedule to get their children fully immunized.  In this schedule, vaccines may be slightly delayed and are given alternately so instead of 6 vaccines in one visit, it might be broken up to be 3 vaccines with a return for the other 3 in one month rather than two.  The same number of vaccines are given but they aren't given all at once.  You can also pick and choose which vaccines to give and you can discuss the pros and cons with your doctor.  Some can more safely be delayed than others which may put your child (and others) at risk for serious vaccine preventable diseases.  Some people choose to delay hepatitis vaccines and in a low risk population this is acceptable, assuming you don't forget to do it later.  Of course you have parental privilege but you should only omit vaccines after fully understanding the risks and benefits of the decision.  Some things that make sense:  Make sure your child gets adequate amounts of bioavailable calcium and iron and eats at least two servings daily of foods high in vitamin C, such as fruits, vegetables, and juices, especially while in treatment.  Follow your doctor's orders exactly.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: lactose intolerant or acid reflux?",
    "content": "Hello, Reflux disease in the infant can persist for several months and the formula may not make any difference at all (even those which claim anti-reflux properties).  The doctors can prescribe medications to help but the child will need to outgrow this and I would not expect it to be gone already if the case is severe.    The rash around the mouth could be due to acid or milk intolerance.  If so, changing to soy is not necessarily an improvement since it is a high allergy food.  Solid foods are normally introduced around six months so the doctor was probably thinking that by that time he would likely have outgrown it.  But, it is not because of the solids that they get better so starting them sooner than five or six months won't expedite the healing.    There are various food intolerances when a baby receives artificial feedings and sometimes all you can do is try something else.  There is a formula (Similac Expert Care Alimentum and Enfamil Nutramigen AA or Pregestamil) that can be tried on the recommendation of your doctor.  Some of these must be special ordered.  If it is lactose intolerance one of these might help.  You usually need to give the new formula a couple of weeks to see if it really makes a difference.  In most cases the baby does outgrow this so try to be patient a few more months.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, This arrangement is perfectly fine for a child of any age since you have other outlets.  The advantage to a window is natural light and fire escape.  It is not necessary f to have this light in a room meant for sleep and taking the child outside the room at times will suffice.  The disadvantages of having a window are the dangers sometimes posed where a child might fall out, get entangled in blind or drapery apparatus so of course in some ways your child may actually be safer.    There are regulations in the real estate market for listing a home for sale.  Without a window it cannot be counted as a bedroom but you are free to use the room however you see fit. The purpose of the regulation is to not mislead a potential buyer and it has an effect on property taxes and valuation notices.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: 1 Month Old Constipated",
    "content": "Hello, Of course breast milk is the preferred food for infants and this is much less a problem when breastfeeding because it contains the perfect balance of fat and protein.  Formula often causes some GI distress.  However, it is important to be certain we are talking about constipation since a formula-fed baby could be \"normal\" with a different schedule than what you may think.  Formula is not digested well so it remains in the stomach for longer periods of time and infrequent stools can still be normal for your baby under these circumstances.    If an infant is truly constipated the stool consistency will be formed (firm, dry and pebbly), more like individual peas or pellets.  A soft paste consistency in the stool, no matter how infrequent, or even following straining and gas, is not constipation; just \"infrequent stool\" and it is due to the high residue left in the colon of the artificially-fed baby.    Crying while passing a stool, or bleeding from the rectum can also indicate true constipation.  These events should be reported to the baby's doctor.    Do not switch to soy formula (it may be even worse) and do not add cereal to such a young baby.  These are sometimes tried but are not successful.  Also, your baby needs the iron contained in the formula but it is really not the cause of constipation in the small amounts contained therein.  It is a common falacy that the iron causes constipation.  Sometimes doctors will recommend the addition of sugar (lactulose) such as with Karo corn syrup added to the formula or giving juice (fructose) as in apple, pear or prune juice.  But, introducing your baby to fruit too soon may make him more likely to develop allergies so unless he is truly constipated it's best to avoid altering the formula.  The problem with any additional feedings (water, juice) is that the baby is at risk for not getting adequate nutrition - the breast milk of formula is needed in sufficient quantity and filling the baby with other liquids may reduce his intake so be careful with how much you give.  I would suggest diluting the juice and limiting this supplement to 2-4 ounces/day total.  Some babies will do better with a change in formula, but eliminating milk by using a substitute or using a less-healthy low-iron formula is not a good idea unless there are other concerns.  Any change in formula will take a couple of weeks for adjustment so be patient and talk to your doctor about this.  It is possible to induce lactation even after starting out with formula, should you be inclined.  Again, talk to your doctor about this option.  Some exercises to help relieve infant constipation include gentle tummy massage (clockwise direction at baby's naval, massaging in circular motion moving hands out and away from the center of the baby's tummy).  Try giving a warm bath for relaxation (you can follow with a tummy massage, using baby lotion - they love it!).  Some gentle bicycling of the baby's legs can sometimes help get things moving.  Move the legs gently as if he were riding a bicycle while lying on his back.  This sometimes helps them with gas as well.  In some cases your doctor may suggest an infant suppository to help him if he is straining.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I have an 18 month old son who was previously healthy, he started becoming sick about 2 weeks ago. He wasn't eating as good as usul and was cranky. He came down with a fever of 103.7 on Monday June 11th. I brought him to his pcp and they said his throat was red and was viral pharangytis and to call in 5 days if symptoms did not improve. He seemed somewhat better and had low grade temps on and off until Sunday June 20th. He began having a high temp (105) and had a febrile seizure, and I was not able to get it down I brought him to the ER at Habro Children's Hospital in Providence, RI. The doctor's there debated about whether or not to prescribe antibiotics (no tests done) and decided again it was viral (puss noticed on tonsils) The next morning, Monday June 21st not satisfied with the diagnosis and watching my son lose weight, not eat or drink, no wet diapers and turn blue (hands, feet & lips) still with a temp of 105.7, I brought him back to his pedi. They decided to do a chest scan & some bloodwork. His white cells came back high (don't know the number) for a bacterial infection and chest scan normal. He began taking augmentin. 2 days passed and the fevers continued to be sky high (now 111 days with a temp. And 5 days with temps over 104. Concerned about dehydration and turning blue again, I returned to the ER. His temp was 104.9 when we arrived & he was out of it. They did bloodwork, another chest scan, began iv fluids, and did a spinal tap for menengitis. His sed rate & crp were 70 and 90 respectively and his white cells normal (due to antibitoics?) He stayed in the hospital and they tested for a bunch of viruses and bacterias, the infectious disease team was consulted.(Adenovirus, cat scratch, menengitis, epstein barr) Everything was negative! His fever curve trended down and he had better PO si they released him. My main questions are: would viral exudative pharangytis cause the sed rate and crp to be so high? He is going for an echocardiogram tomorrow to rule out atypical kawasaki disease, does this sound like kawasi? No rash, yes red eyes, possible joint pain, diarreah. Do symptoms of kawasaki disappear but still have kawasaki? What else could it be? And lastly if they tested for all viruses, and they were all negative, why are they diagnosing him with a virus? Please help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Kawasaki disease is a disorder of uncertain etiology. The incidence is more predominant in male children.  High fever uncontrolled with antibiotics, rashes on the body, redness of eyes and swelling with redness of hands and feet which later leads peeling of  skin on the hands and feet, strawberry tongue and crusting on the lips are characteristic. This picture may resemble Scarlet fever but the differentiating points are neck lymph nodes swelling, lip erosions and increased platelet count.Incomplete cases also occur. In very young children the presentation may not be typical but certain laboratory features like, decreased serum albumin,increased WBC count, increased ESR and increased CPK ,and increased platelets, point to Kawasaki's and an Echo-cardiogram should be done.If the ECHO is negative and there is no fever Kawasaki's is unlikely. The importance of recognizing this condition is that it can involve the blood vessels supplying the heart and cause weakness of the vessels called aneurysms. Medication is with gamma-globulin.Aggressive treatment would ensure favorable outcome. With my best wishes for speedy recovery.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello: I am sorry you little one has had to deal with this.  Here is some information about canker sores you might find helpful.  Canker sores are small, round, open sores inside your mouth.  The center of the canker sore can be white or yellow.  They can be painful.  They are not harmful.  We do not know what causes canker sores.  There are things that may trigger them:  Stress  Not getting enough iron or vitamin B12  Food allergies  Fatigue  Biting your cheek or tongue Anyone can get canker sores.  Teens and young adults get them more often.  Women also get them more than men do.  Canker sores can run in families.  The first sign can be a tingling feeling in your child's mouth.  A sore that looks like a small, round, red spot or bump will form.  It will then turn into an open canker sore. The center of the canker sore can look white or yellow  It is usually small.  They can be painful  Canker sores are not contagious.  Most canker sores heal by themselves.  There is no treatment that will stop canker sores from coming back. You can do some things to lessen the pain.  Homemade mouthwashes. Swish the mouthwash in your mouth for one minute and spit it out. Do not swallow. Do not use for children who cannot spit it out (usually children less than 7 years).  Mouthwash #1: 2 ounces of hydrogen peroxide + 2 ounces of water  Mouthwash #2: 4 ounces of water + 1 teaspoon of salt + 1 teaspoon of baking soda The doctor may give your child a prescription drug.  Do not eat spicy foods or acidic foods such as lemons or tomatoes.  Do not eat sharp foods like potato chips. They can poke the canker sore.  Carefully brush your teeth so you don't poke the canker sore. Canker sores can last for 2 weeks.  The pain is usually gone in 3 to 4 days. Canker sores cannot be prevented. Call your doctor if your child's canker sore does not go away.  Call your doctor if your child's canker sore gets worse.  Call your doctor if your child also gets a fever, diarrhea, headache, or skin rash  Call your doctor if you have any questions about your child's condition. I hope you little one feels better soon, Carolyn\n\n",

    "title": "Eye Pupil Not Centered?",
    "content": "I have an 18 month old baby with dark brown eyes and yesterday as the sunlight was hitting her face, I noticed for the first time what appeared as if she had absolutely no pupil in her right eye.  I pulled back her eyelid and noticed that the pupil in her right eye was not centered at all but was located in the upper left portion of her iris.  She sometimes bumps into walls as she walks and I always thought maybe she was still learning to balance herself as she learns to walk. I'm curious to know what this eye condition is called and why her pupil is not centered.  The doctor's never pointed it out before and I'm wondering if something like this could affect her vision.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Corectopia may also be defined as \"eccentric location of the pupil so that it is not in the center of the iris\".  It may be  - congenital or - aquired: due to trauma or scarring of the iris (accidental or surgical) or, ocular causes such as high myopia, ectopia lentis, coloboma iridis , Axenfeld-Reiger anomaly, persistent pupillary membrane, and hyperplastic pupillary membrane).   It may be  - unilateral or  - bilateral.  When corectopia is present from birth (i.e. \"congenital\"), the displacement of the pupil is usually towards the nose(medial).  Bilateral congenital corectopia is a sign that merits chromosomal analysis and neuro-developmental assessment.  Lipoid proteinosis (Urbach-Wiethe disease) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder.There have been reports about association of bilateral corectopia with this condition.  Idiopathic tractional corectopia: is an isolated unilateral congenital pupil abnormality. Shown to responded well to simple lysis of the fibrous strand that is typically seen in this condition.  Management depends upon the cause.It can be medical,surgical or both. As your child has an allegedly unilateral pupillary  abnormality,i suggest that you should consult an ophthalmologist, who in all probability will first exclude the possibility of this being a bilateral corectopia and of course assess the overall condition of the eyes.Only an ophthalmologist will be best placed to advise you regarding the further management of your child.

We got our boys tested, so we could get a baseline for future reference ot look back at and found our 5' 9 1/2\" tall, 120 pound 15 year old who we found has high cholesterol. His results were Cholesterol total at 250 and his LDL direct was 159.8. Pediatrician told us that they don't have any medications for kids under 18 with high cholesterol to take though he was going to inquire because of the genetic history and getting control of this now instead of paying the price later. This kid eats so healthy its ridiculous, vitamins, fiber, fruits, vegis', lean meats, rarely has red meats..... What can he take to help bring his LDL's and cholesterol levels under control????? He does also have low level allergies to peanuts, wheat and soy and severe allergies to all grasses.  Any help would be appreciated..\n\n",

In the past year to 2 years she has also been pooping in her pants.  We have gone to several pediatricians, urologists and gi ped's. We have been told everything from behavioral to constepation to UTI to urine reflux.  She is currently on med's now to prevent UTI's (antibiotics, furabantin) and another med that stops bladder spasms (oxybutynin). This was supposed to fix the problem with in a few months. It has been 4 mo. now and nothing is changed. We were also told by her school that she is underweight and under height for her age. She is noticably smaller than kids her age. Her 3 yo brother is almost as tall as she is and he weights about the same. Mentally she is developing fine. Sometimes it seems behavioral because she will have long periods when eveything works as it should. Other times she will have 10 accidents in one day. Sometimes she says it hurts, sometimes she says she doesn't know when or why it happened. She also tells us she didn't know she did it.  We are at our wits end. We have tried everything we could. We have rewarded her for going and we have also punished her because we thought she was just being lazy and didn't want to stop what she was doing. At this point we just feel sorry for her. She can't do the fun summer activities that we would like her to do because she will have an accident and have to be picked up and taken away from the activity.  She has about a month and a half to correct it or she will have to be home schooled. She almost didn't finish kindergarted because she had to be taken out of school so often.  PLEASE HELP. Even if you don't have an answer for us just some guidance on who would, would be great. Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "I apologise now for my long post! But hoping someone can help.. Here goes...  About 3 weeks ago, my son started having skid marks in his pants.  we have never had any toileting problems since he was 3 and constipated, but i remembered this could be a sign.  I saw my nurse and she prescribed lactulose for him. He currently goes a toilet twice a day anyway as this was the routine we established when he suffered when he young.  The lactulose appeared to start making him constantly leak ( not nice for a 10 year old), so I spoke to my GP who sent him for an x ray.  Towards the end of last week and after the x ray, my son had a large bm and the leaking stopped.  I went back to the GP yesterday, who said my son was constipated all the way back into his bowels and colon.  He has prescribed movical.  One sachet a day at night ( its the adult version - son is only 10 ) . We gave him this last night and today he has found it harder to go to the toilet.  I was wondering if he should have been given the adult version and if he should have been given a higher dose to clean him out?  Hes never had any pain in his tummy and the doctor yesterday said that he thought his rectum was now clear as no longer leaking, but how do we get rid of the backlog?  Will one sachet a day be enough to do this? I did ask the gp but was told just to stick with the one sachet a day for a month, then call back for a repeat prescription.  Any advice will be greatly received.\n\n",

    "content": "My 2 year old just keeps getting sick.  This started shortly after he turned 1.  When it started he would get sick for a month at a time, it always started with a runny nose, then would shift into diarrhea and vomitting, and he would sleep for more than 14 hours each night and still take 2 naps a day.  During the month the runny nose would go away after a week or so, but the diarrhea and vomiting and the sleeping would stay around the entire month.  He would rarely get a fever with it.  After the month he would be just fine for about 2 weeks and it would all start again.  After 6 months of stool tests and the doctor telling me they were just viruses, he got sick AGAIN this time with a fever of 103.  We took him to the ER.  His blood tests came back and were very alarming, we ended up having to take him to an oncologist.  Turns out his red and white cell count was way down, and his neutraphil count was dangerously low.  After 4 months of going every week for blood tests everything came back fine.  Then he got sick again, we ended up going to the G.I. specialist.  They did a series of blood tests which all came back fine, then we did a colonoscopy and endoscopy to find out that he was actually allergic to a food of some sort.  We ended up finding out it was eggs.  And now since December he is still getting sick, this time with HIGH fevers, some as high as 105!  I take him to the doctor and yet we find no infection.  Sometimes he doesn't even have symptoms except for the fever.  I am getting worried there is something more serious going on.  Should I be worried and seek out some more help?\n\n",

    "content": "Firstly, thank you for you time in reading my question. For 4 months now, my 9yr old has been suffering with bouts of vomiting every 2-3 weeks. She always gets stomach cramps before this and there is no food pattern preceding it. I have cut out milk but this has made no difference. A headache and sleepiness usually follows. She has recently (twice) had white/cream stools just before and/or after. The vomiting usually lasts no more than 2-3 hours until her stomach is empty. My GP has done 5 urine samples (some of which he or the hospital had lost) they have come back clear, even when she showed all the signs of a urine infection during one of these I mentioned to him that she was showing early signs of puberty ie; sweating and breast growth. He said she was too young for puberty and disregarded any link, saying periods always come first, which I don\u2019t feel is the case. She has now missed a lot of schooling and i work. More importantly i am now very concerned. I eventually got him to agree to a blood test eventually yesterday which GP said if was clear, there is nothing else he can do. My daughter has hardly ever been poorly before this started in February which coincides with changing schools, which she enjoys when there (As a teacher i know the signs of a unhappy child) When she is not sick, she is generally a well child, but always seems to be hungry. Also complains of getting a funny taste in her mouth and spits up thick mucus from time to time in-between bouts of illness, also complains of stomach pain between these bouts on occasion. She has not had any weight loss. She has not been prescribed any antibiotics at all. She is displaying all these symptoms tonight. She is never unwell during school holidays. And does not have school dinners anymore Should I consider changing GP\u2019s for a second opinion as only one GP in our practice Kindest regards\n\n",

    "content": "Don't be scared off by how long this is. I know to keep it short, this is as short as I can make it. It's a long story.  OK- I'm 15 years old and I've been sick for almost 3 years now. It started out with headaches, and over time, more and more symptoms have popped up.   Here's a list of them, in order that they began.  -chronic headache -chronic fatigue/tiredness/weakness. (always falling asleep, exercise is over-tiring and difficult) -sensitivity (muscles hurt when they are touched, even not that hard, and that spot will feel bruised for a while) -night sweats and chronic low-grade fever -swollen lymphnode on my neck.. behind my left ear. it's been there, getting bigger and smaller randomly, but hasen't gone away, for 2 years. doesn't hurt or anything. -joint stiffness and pain -joints grind together and pop when moved (and it hurts) -dizziness/lightheadedness (especially when singing and exercising) -random spontaneous heart pain (usually lasts anywhere from 10 seconds to a few minutes, I could be perfectly relaxed and it'll start, but not too often) -short term memory problems -increased thirst (this one is recent - I'm always thirsty, when before I never really was)  -ever since I've been more thirsty, I've been getting random bouts of feeling sick to my stomach. Feels like I'm gonna throw up randomly for 5 minutes to a couple hours -seems like my immune system has also been bad lately - 4 colds this cold/flu season, when it's usually 0 to 1 - and I wash my hands plenty  I've seen 3 different primary health physicians, a neurologist, a jaw doctor, a headache specialist, a naturopath, and probably others that I've forgotten. I got my head MRI'd... no tumors! And my blood taken several times. The neurologist prescribed a muscle relaxant because he thought it was muscle tension causing it. It did nothing for me. The jaw doctor said I have TMJ but we haven't gone back to him.   The naturopath put me on a very restrictive diet for a month - no gluten, dairy, red meat, and a bunch of other seemingly random things (like red dye #40 and mustard). That did nothing. I completed a course of biofeedback at the Children's Hospital because they, too, thought it was muscle tension, but I passed with flying colors, and did exeptionally well from the start, and it didn't help - plenty of evidence that it's not muscle stress or tension.  I went to see a new doctor recently and he took blood and urine samples. The only thing he saw weird was my iron, which was at \"28\", but at the time I had a bad cold so he said that can increase your iron, so my iron is too low.   For several weeks now I've been taking the iron he's prescribed. We're going again next week because all that has happened is that my dizziness and stomachaches have increased in frequency (the dizziness probably because I'm in a play with a lot of singing). And I'm not feeling any better from the iron pills.  What's wrong with me? I just want to feel better.  P.S.- Also in the past year I've gotten breast cysts 2 seperate times...both times they got infected. I don't know if it's at all related but might aswell put that out there.\n\n",

I was told I would get the results today but they did not have them, would it take longer if the results were not good or is it just taking longer? The surgeon seemed pretty sure all was well after the surgery, can you tell by look if it is not cancer? Thanks, just waiting is driving me nuts\n\n",

He has a tracheostomy and feeding PEG and for more than one year the opening for the PEG has been leaking coloured discharge and blood.  He has tested postive for MRSA at this site and also his nose.  The doctors have recently tried baterial washes and antibiotic cream around the PEG but this has not solved the problem.  Is my son at risk of the MRSA attacking his body, should he get an infection of any sort?  This did happen several years ago and we nearly lost him.  What can be done to get rid of the MRSA and heal with site of the PEG? I look forward to receiving your advice. Many thanks\n\n",

    "title": "4 month old w/ bloody stools w/ increased Eosinophils",
    "content": "My 4.5 month old baby boy started having bloody stools about 3 months ago. The blood is bright red and is fairly scant. The amount of blood varies between every stool. Sometimes the blood is absent to the naked eye. Often the blood will be mixed with mucous. Sometimes there is just mucous without the blood. It is typically very watery and only becomes thicker after he has had some rice cereal.  When I presented to my pediatrician once I first noticed the blood, a C&S was run and came back negative for any bacteria or parasites. Next to consider was allergies. Aaron consumes only breastmilk. We add Tri-Vi-Sol to the breastmilk. We do not use formula. Since our 2nd visit about 2 months ago, my wife eliminated milk products from her diet. A month ago, she has eliminated soy from her diet as well. We were convinced it was the soy as the amount of blood continued to decrease after she stopped consuming it. All that changed after his 4 month immunizations. A few days after the shots, the blood became much more apparent again and with every meal. Not knowing what else to do, my wife has now also cut out all nuts, chocolate and eggs as of 4 weeks ago. The blood has decreased again but still appears in small amounts every other diaper or so.   Aaron is a happy little guy white no significant changes in discomfort, increase in crying, or other ADLs or apparent s/s. His spit ups after meals have decreased \u2013 He did vomit forcefully about a month ago when we trying introducing formula (Similac Soy), otherwise he has not vomited since he was a 1 month old.    We recently introduced rice cereal reconstituted with my wife\u2019s own breast milk. He is fine eating it with no change in the amount of blood in his stools.   The stool consistency is usually fairly soft with occasional diarrhea. The color ranges form bright yellow to dark green. He usually stools during each one of his day meals.    I would like to know if we can\u2019t seem to r/o cretin foods, what should we be considering? Running the C&S again? R/o GER? Ulcer?   We just had a CBC done on 10/9:  WBC 10.3 RBC 4.39 HTC 32.4 MCV 74 RDW, RBC 13.8 PLTS 482 Neutrophils 26% Lymphocytes 5% Monos 6% Eosinophils 16% (this is very high above the 4% norm) Basophils 2% Neutrophils Absolute 2.7  And has a Stool Culture 10/11: Clostridium Difficile Toxin A+B, Stool, EIA \u2013 Negative for C-Diff Stool Culture \u2013 No Salmonella, Shigella, or Campylobacter Isolated No E.Coli 0157:H7 Isolated  If we are unable to stop the blood in the stools, any future side effects?  What could the increased Eosinophils mean? Our doctor said this was a concern.  We also have a dog in the house. Could this be related?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, An absolute eosinophil  count would have been helpful.  Eosinophilic gastroenteritis is one condition that deserves mention. Etiology of this condition is unknown. Food allergy is believed to be an important suspect and a family history of allergies is usual.  Intestinal parasitic diseases are also implicated (including reported cases due to canine hookworm -Ankylostoma caninum).  The extent of Intestinal involvement is variable.When large gut is involved,bloody stools may result.  Pathologically, stimulation of eosinophils occurs, resulting in migration of eosinophils deeper into the wall of the gut and release of chemical mediators(cytokines) and the aftermath of their action completes the picture. IgE levels are raised in most patients.  I hope this information is useful to you. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, If your sons eyes were dilated equally, that is probably fine.  If one eye dilates and the other not, it is a more serious concern.  It is possible for him to have a concussion (like a bruise on the brain from being bounced against the skull).  Most of these resolve on their own without problems but can take a few days.    If he has nausea, vomiting, loss of consciousness, visual disturbances, balance problems, prolonged headache or dizziness you should take him to a doctor or hospital for evaluation.  Most children will rebound quickly and act normal so if this is not the case, talk to your pediatrician.    It can be challenging being a parent of an active child.  Best wishes.\n\n",

This will allow for the causative bacteria to be isolated and antibiotics sensitivities be determined to ensure that the antibiotics being used are effective.  If she is still having symptoms I would recommend she see her doctor again for reevaluation.  Also, erythromycin is notorious for causing some stomach upset so her stomach pain may be associated with the antibiotic at this point rather than the actual infection.  Dysuria (pain with urination) can take a few days to fully resolve but should be getting better after a day or two on antibiotics.  Best wishes.\n\n",

We hope to treat her cholesterol and weight issues with a nutrition and exercise plan through the medical team at the Clinic as I have been unsuccessful in helping her at home.  I was concerned by the numbers I saw with her blood count results, which were mailed to me by her pediatrician. Her white blood count was 10.07 (the range is 3.84-9.84) and her platelet count is 407 (the range is 150-400). Should I be concerned at all that her numbers are above the norm, however slight. Again she hadn't eaten in more than 12 hours prior to the blood draw.  As a baby, my daughter was tested for leukemia (and thankfully was cleared) because she had an elevated wbc during her first year. I am a bit concerned now because I haven't seen any issue with her blood count since then and I do have a two and a half year old niece who is undergoing treatment for JAK2 and polycythemia vera.

When a three month old has an elevated total and direct bilirubin level, biliary atresia must be in the possible list of causes.  CMV infection can also cause a hepatitis that can mimic a biliary atresia presentation.  It is important to have a pediatric gastroenterologist (GI specialist) involved in figuring this out if at all possible.  It sounds as if the proper tests are being done but even the interpretation of these tests can sometimes be confusing.  It is definitely possible that a liver biopsy may be necessary to help sort things out.  I hope you are able to find a definite answer soon.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello mom0702,  Back pain in children is something that really should not be there without a good explanation (trauma, etc.).  If your daughter is having numbness in her legs this is a potential sign of neurological involvement and may be a sign of a spinal cord problem or something compressing some of the spinal nerves such as a slipped disk.  I would recommend continued evaluation of this problem, possibly including imaging of her lower back (such as an MRI).  It is important to know that younger children rarely complain of back pain as a \"typical\" ache or pain.  When young children complain of back pain I take it very seriously.  If you need a specialist, seeing a pediatric orthopedic surgeon would be the best next step.  Follow up with her pediatrician is also advised.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Moridos,  Speech is a complex developmental milestone and there is significant variation in the rate of development.  In general, we expect a 2 year old to be saying around 50-100 words and have about 50% of what is said be understandable to a stranger (parents understanding what is being said doesn't count).  If there are concerns, the first step is to have your son evaluated by his pediatrician who can assess the developmental status of his language development.  At age two, if there are concerns, often the first step will be to have a hearing evaluation performed.  If the child is not hearing clearly it is difficult for them to hear pronunciations properly and thus learn to speak clearly.  If this is OK, we'll often just watch for a few more months.  Many times, when there is a mild delay, within a few months the child takes off and catches up in their speech without difficulty.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Szdramirez,  It is very common for children in bilingual families to initially be a little behind \"typical\" speech development.  By two years old, though, we would expect the child to be able to say 50 or so words (in any combination of the languages) and probably start putting two word sentences together.  When you say his hearing is fine, has it been formally checked by the audiologist?  If not, this is probably the first place to start.  If his  hearing has been evaluated and is normal, the next step can be varied.  Probably the best place to start is with his primary care doctor.  He should have a careful evaluation to see if he is delayed in any other areas or if there are indications of other problems that may be contributing to the speech delay.  It may be advised to see a developmental pediatrician or a speech therapist.  Best wishes.\n\n",

He always makes either the honor or merit role each semester. My husband and I have been talking about having a child and I really want to because I do not have any of my own.  I have always wanted to be a mother. The only thing I am really worried about is will my child have autism? My husband has told me that his mother drank and did drugs while she was pregnant. She would just leave him in his crib and not work with him at all. He does a pretty good job with most things but he does have a speech problem that we continue to work on. My biggest fear is having another child with autism. I know no one can tell me 100% that the child will or will not have it. I know it is pretty much a genetic lotto. Is there any insight that you can offer me on this. I really wanted children, now I am really scared. I would be heart broken if I could not have children.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello You are correct that nobody can predict this.  We don't know how much is genetic, how much is environmental or interactive.  But, as you have seen with your stepson, a diagnosis of autism does not have to be a serious problem for life and with today's knowledge about early intervention much can be done to avoid negative effects.  Most autistic children grow up to be productive and happy adults especially with early diagnosis and treatment for social concerns.    This potential problem would not deter me from becoming a mother if that was my goal.  3-5 % of all babies are born with a birth defect - it's a chance we take.  Just do everything you can to be healthy yourself, including taking a daily multiple vitamin containing at least 400 mcg folate or folic acid starting before you conceive.  Stop any bad habits such as smoking, alcohol or drugs.  These can all increase your odds for a healthy baby.  But, if you do have a baby who presents a challenge in some way, that does not mean you won't love being the mom to that child.  Great rewards come with children and none are immune from problems of one kind or another.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Generalised joint laxity is quite normal in during the first 18 months of life following birth. This laxity affects the axial and limb joints It is well known that maternal relaxing hormones which cross the placental barrier act on the ligaments of the fetal joints and allow moulding of the joint structures perinatally.  Maternal relaxing hormones such as 'Relaxin' is produced by corpus luteum in pregnancy and is found in decidua and placenta.It is believed to relax the ligaments of the maternal bony pelvis, soften the uterine cervix and relax smooth muscles (the central role of this hormone in parturition is not yet clear). It also relaxes the fetal joints.                                                    Whether this perinatal laxity may increase the susceptibility to dislocation of the hip is being investigated.  'Benign joint hypermobility syndrome' is thought to be an inherited (autosomal dominant pattern) connective tissue disorder.  Gereralized joint Hypermobility may occur in several connective tissue disorders some of which are,Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome (EDS), Marfan syndrome, and osteogenesis imperfecta.These usually have charecteristic phenotypes.   Certain chromosomal and genetic disorders such as Down syndrome and  metabolic disorders such as hyperlysinemia and homocystinuria may also feature generalized joint laxity .    Coffin-Siris syndrome is a disorder is characterized by the absence or hypoplasia of the nails, especially those of the fifth fingers and toes, growth retardation, microcephaly,mental deficiency, coarse facial features, sparse scalp hair and lax joints.  In the case of your child, who is 17 months old,the popping sounds could mean joint laxity and if the symptoms persist beyond 18 months, it would be advisable to consult your pediatrician. Best wishes!\n\n",

If those around you get the recommended flu vaccines themselves, this will also improve your odds for avoiding this flu.  Using good handwashing techniques can also help since you don't always know who is coming down with flu.  Also, using disposable tissues and general health consciousness such as coughing and sneezing into elbows can also reduce risk.  Try to enjoy your baby and your family without being overly concerned since the risk is not that great.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Recently, we were notified by our public school that many children were experiencing flu-like symptoms and to take extra precautions with our children. Since my son has asthma, he cannot get the nasal mist and he cannot have the flu vaccine for reasons stated above. Is there a blood test to see if what my kids had in June, was in fact the Swine Flu? It would determine which route I should explore, as far as sending my kids to school. If they did have it, I can rest assured that thye have immunity and that they are safe from being infected. It also helps determine whether or not to vaccinate my older kids with the H1N1 vaccine. PLEASE HELP.

He wouldn't look at us as much, wouldn't respond to his name as much, started rocking back and forth, and started moving his head back and forth like he was saying no. still babbling but saying mama and baba less than he used to. He still wanted to be picked up and held but didn't give tight hugs like he used to.  We took him to the doc and he has an ear infection,  been on antibiotics for 5 days.

    "content": "My 20 month old daughter has been drinking excessively for the past few weeks. She goes through at least 8 to 10 9oz sippy cups a day and 30 diapers every 2 days. She gulps her cups down like she is dying of thirst. At night she goes through about 5 cups and 6 diapers. She doesnt sleep well at all, tossing and turning, and crying out for cups. She also has a really hard time breathing....retracting and tugging while panting like she has been running a marathon. Many nights she wakes up doing this. We give her albuterol updraft treatments but they don't always work. We have an app with pulmonary on 15th. Any suggestions or ideas of things we may try or drs we may want to see? We have been in childrens many times with various infections including pylonephritis twice. She has really had a hard time with illness and dad and i are at our wits end on what to do.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Has your doctor ruled out diabetes?  These symptoms can occur with this and children also are subject to this disease, though not as often as adults.  I would ask about that.  It sounds like you need to just follow up with the pulmonologist and as each concern is eliminated, it may take a few visits with specialists to pin down the problem.  This is because many conditions share symptoms.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It is not known how long an exposure might be present for symptoms to occur but if there has been a concern, it would be wise to have blood testing done to verify levels that may be present.  It is possible to have lead poisoning without any symptoms at all.  If there has been an exposure it's best to find out before symptoms may show up and some symptoms are quite subtle and not solely definitive of lead exposure.  Lead can be absorbed and stored in many organs of the body so the symptoms could be wide and varied as well.  Some of the same symptoms can also occur with other conditions or may show up as a learning disability which may not be apparent for several years.    Balanced nutrition includes adequate amounts of vitamins and minerals such as iron, calcium, and vitamin C. A person who eats a balanced, nutritious diet absorbs less lead than a person whose diet is inadequate.  So, this is something you can do.  There are also treatments if the levels are too high already but all sources of lead exposure should be removed first.  I hope this helps.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Toddler eats constantly",
    "content": "My son just turned 3 years old and I have a concern about his eating habits. He is a very big boy, 40 \" tall and 42 lbs and thin.   To give you an idea of how much he eats (and that I\"m not over exaggerating) I will go over yesterdays eating routine:   7:00am breakfast - a bowl of cereal, peanut butter sandwich, yogurt.   8:00am - banana.   8:30am - yogurt, half of a peanut butter sandwich.   10:00am - small bowl of triscuit crackers and half an apple -   11:00am 5 pieces of cheese and whole wheat crackers. -   12:30pm 2 and a half pieces of chicken,  bowl of rice and 4 pieces of broccoli -   2:00 pm - cheese and grapes-   3:00pm ham and swiss sandwich.   5:00pm - yogurt and 10 raspberries.  6:00pm - big plate of spaghetti and garlic bread.  6:30pm 4 celery sticks and small handful of almonds.  7:00pm popcorn, granola bar.   8:00pm - bowl of cereal.   8:30pm - crackers.   8:30 is the latest we feed him, but always insists that he is hungry. He is very very active, constantly moving, jumping and running and wont sit still for more then 40 seconds. I wonder if its possible that he is actually this hungry or if hes eating out of boredom or habit? It seems impossible that he could be this hungry, but if I don't give him something to eat when he says hes hungry, he will go to foods that he doesnt even like to eat (like carrots, pears and if enough time goes by even cottage cheese which he is usually completely disguested by). He is not chubby in the least, he looks and acts very fit (you can see abdominal muscles) and it seems as though he is burning all of his calories, but I'm concerned that there will be problems in the future. He probably eats more then me and my husband together and hes only 3. His pediatrician says he is very healthy and to let him eat when hes hungry, but it just seems excessive.   People are always concerned that their toddlers don't eat enough and I am unsure if my sons eating is ok or if I should somehow adjust his behavours? or unsure how to proceed. Any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Toddler eats constantly",
    "content": "Hello, Children experience growth spurts where they need more calories and use them for growth and energy.  With a healthy diet such as you describe, and in absence of concerns for overweight, I would not worry about this.  Chances are his appetite will change in time but it sounds like he has a very high metabolism.  If he is active physically he is probably burning lots of calories.  Frequent eating is often better than three \"large\" meals as it sustains a more even blood sugar.  You should periodically have your child examined in a well-child visit with his pediatrician but I suspect this is not of concern.  At your visit, the doctor will probably consider family size history and other factors such as the pattern of growth on a normal curve.  The important thing is that he stay in the normal growth curve even if he is in the 90th percentile.  If he/she is concerned, test may be ordered for thyroid function just to be sure there are no other concerns but I don't think you will find any problems.  Some childhood conditions that include overeating are usually manifest by excess weight.  This does not sound like your child.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I'm hoping that there is someone that can help me. My son is 18 months old, and ever since he was a few months old he has been suffering on and off with this usually watery, vinegary smelling diorrhea. It can last from just a day to a few days, and is always accompanied with a really bad, sometimes yeast like rash. The rash at its worst can cause him extreme discomfort, as it will have little sores and be very very red. When he was a baby and first got this bad rash it took a few months to clear up, eventually with the use of prescribed thrush cream (sorry can't remember the name) Nowadays when he gets the rash it would usually take about a week to clear it up. He also suffers with dry skin, which on one occasion he did scratch and make bleed an area on the top of his neck, under his hairline. I cannot use any shop bought products at all on him, I bath him in diprobath, wash him with aquous cream and then lather him in diprobase. This keeps his dry skin at bay but doesnt completly get rid of it. We used Dermol lotion as well once but that was useless. In addition to this, I thought I might mention that he is also always tired and very pale, although I am fairly pale myself. My other son is not pale. He sleeps through the night, but he also gets very tired and subsequently very grumpy in the day as well. He would sleep most of the day probably if you let him. I am just starting to wonder if all these things could be linked, and was just seeking some informal advice before I go to the GP. If anyone can offer any sort of advice I would be extremely grateful. Thank you for reading!\n\n",

There is a condition called precocious puberty where a child develops much sooner than she should but at her age it would not be so unusual.  You could discuss this with her pediatrician to be sure she does not have an endocrine disorder of some kind.  If she could get some nutritional counseling to help her with the weight issues it would be helpful since extra fat will exacerbate this development.  It needs to be done in a very sensitive way and she should be encouraged to find physical activities she can enjoy.  It doesn't hurt to be a worried grandma and look out for your loved ones.

If the vaccine was the live, attenuated (weakened so it cannot cause disease) form as with the nasal mist you should wait 28 days for the next vaccine if that is also live (mist).  However, if one of them is the killed virus by injection, no waiting period is necessary, even with this extra dose.  A few side effects such as the runny nose for a few days is considered normal and rarely comes with fever as the flu does.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: 14&11 yr. old were double dosed w/flu vaccine",
    "content": "Hello, Most children younger than 10 do require a second dose in order to get full immunity.  It is recommended that the second dose be at least 28 days after the first but if given at 21 days it is still considered valid for protection.  One day earlier than that, I really can't say if the protection would be there, but I would expect no harm to come from this anyway.    Approximately a third of those children receiving only one dose will receive adequate immunity with only the single dose, but because we want higher levels of success than that, the second dose brings the immunity rate to around 76%. So, even then, it is not perfect, but protection will be significant for the most part.    Nobody can say who will build adequate immunity and who will not even with the vaccine, but the odds are better if you follow the advised schedule.  Since some people even with the full dose never are able to develop immunity, we just don't know in an individual case.  We don't know why some people are unable to develop immunity this way - it's just one of those things.    In short, extra vaccines will not hurt your children and I would not expect any adverse reaction or that you would need to watch for anything in particular.  Some people do react with a slight appearance of illness such as mild sore throat, cough, etc. which goes away quickly in most.  But, this is not related to extra dosing; just the typical.  Opting out of the second dose in a child younger than 10 is up to you. If she is over 10 it is not needed.  Safety has been shown to be very good with this vaccine.  I hope this answers your question.  Best wishes,\n\n",

    "content": "OK, thanks for the clarification.  So she did not receive any vaccine (the 12 year old).  In healthy people, this flu seems to run its course without much trouble.  Flu always carries a certain risk, usually related to complications.  Of course she may never even be exposed to this anyway.  It's luck of the draw.  I would not be overly concerned if she is healthy and you don't put someone who is at risk in your household, such as a person on chemotherapy or otherwise immuno-compromised or a newborn.    Have a healthy winter!\n\n",

Childhood cancers are actually quite rare but this is often the fear we have whenever something isn't exactly \"normal.\"  Try not to stress over it.

    "content": "Hello, Sometimes treating reflux requires some trial and error.  If one medication doesn't work, another may be tried until you find a combination of medication and other measures that help your baby find relief until his system matures enough that the problem resolves.  Since you noticed some improvement without the medication, it might mean this is not the right one for your baby right now.  Talk to your doctor about this.  It is one of several meds that might be helpful but it is not a surefire cure.  The stomach acid is very strong so helping in any way you can is worth it.  Other measures to help include breastfeeding (never stop when a baby has reflux - it will usually get worse on formula; not better), frequent burping, frequent \"snacking\" rather than large feedings, keeping the baby in a more upright position following the feeding and trying to keep him as calm as possible.  I know this is a very trying time for you and your little one.  Be patient, knowing he is in pain and the crying is something he can't help.  It is a time that can put a baby at risk for shaking so when you need help, please get a trusted loved one to step in to try and calm the baby while giving you a much needed break.  It will get better so try to focus on that future time.  Your efforts will be rewarded.  Best wishes.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Last week my daughter came down with what I suspect is the flu. Her pediatrician suggested I treat it like the flu but wanted to refrain from diagnosing. My daughter has ran a temp of 102.1 or greater since 10/21, with a runny nose, and loss of appetite/energy. However yesterday, 10/25, her fever returned to normal. Today she woke up with her fever returned but low grade at 99.2, and has vomitted upon eating her lunch. Her fever has reached 100.2 since vomitting and I'm starting to get concerned. She has asthma as well which concerns me about possible complications from the flu. My question is this, should I be concerned that her fever returned today after almost 18 hours the day before with no fever? It just seems weird to me and like I said I'm concerned she might be at risk for pneumonia as a complication of the flu.\n\n",

Your child is considered contagious until she has been fever free for 24 hours without the aid of fever reducing medications.  The reason they give the 24 hour cut off is to try and allow for some resolution of fever which is just temporary; not an indication that the infection is gone.    If your daughter has breathing difficulties, color looks gray or bluish, if she seems lethargic, very sleepy and not waking or extremely irritable, you should have  her checked out.  If it's just the fever, you can probably ride it out.  Just watch for new symptoms.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "My daughter is 7 and has had some signs of puberty since the age of 5. She developed body odors in the armpits and a vaginal discharge. She saw an endocrinologist at 6 and when she began developing breast. She had some blood work and bone scans, the blood test were slightly abnormal, though the bone scans were okay. The doctor opted for no further treatment, unless more signs developed.  The symptoms that have developed since then are, breast tissue has grown and areolas are large, small acne like bumps on forehead and nose, excess sweating, she has put on 20 pounds in one year and gets winded easily, she has 5-10 long dark pubic hairs, yeast infections, and she has been having mood swings lately. She has never been one to tear up over the slightest thing but she crys so much and seems near tears quite often, and other times she is so touchy and testy that she screams and gets angry over small stuff. I went through precocious puberty many years ago, and the emotional roller coaster of not being able to fully understand what was happening to me caused me emotional pain and low self esteem. Please help me figure out the best thing to do for my daughter.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: High fever could it be Swine Flu?",
    "content": "Hello, Fever is a classic symptom with the flu.  Most cases right now are turning out to be H1N1.  It is up to you whether or not to get a firm lab diagnosis but if it is flu the risk is to others who are at the doctor's office.  Your child could expose many so if the fever and discomfort are controlled with the Motrin and drinking lots of fluids you should be fine to let it run its course if your son has no underlying medical conditions which might put him at risk.  He should not be taken into crowds, schools, day care until he has been fever free for 24 hours, without the effects of the fever reducing medication.    Complications of flu are often the most concerning part so if your child seems lethargic, unresponsive, irritable to the point of not wanting to be touched or held, refusing fluids, not waking up, not urinating, skin bluish or gray, breathing problems, or if fever remains high in spite of Tylenol or Motrin, you should call the pediatrician who may advise you to come in and how to handle the exposure.  Sometimes they ask you to use a different door and avoid the waiting room.  In some cases hospitalization and antiviral drugs are needed.  But, keep in mind that fever could indicate other infection besides flu so in the absence of any other symptom you must consider what else might be causing the fever.  He had no sore throat or ear pain?  Be alert to any indication of infection somewhere in the body or if you get an uneasy feeling about how things are going.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: My 2 1/2 year old speech seems delayed",
    "content": "Hello, Speech develops at variable rates and they understand much more than they can form into words themselves.  It's hard work to learn to talk.  If you sense a delay, it would be wise to speak with your pediatrician about it because sometimes the problem lies with the ears.  Fluid in the ears can make speech difficult and even though you know she hears, it could affect only certain sound ranges.     There are also early intervention programs which evaluate children for developmental milestones.  Screening is often done through the school district to determine if some children need some extra attention prior to starting school at age five.  Check with your doctor, local health department or school district to see what might be available for testing your child's developmental skills and determining if she is within the normal range.  Again, normal varies a lot and verbal skills may suddenly click even after a time of \"mumbling\".    Even if your child is found to be within normal limits, checking it out early can't hurt and if there's something that needs attention, it can make all the difference since intervention can begin sooner rather than later.  It is not unusual for a child the age of yours to still have limited speech and the fact that she has consistent \"names\" for items is a good sign.  Use every opportunity to point out words to  her such as \"this is a table\" just to reinforce the pronunciation so she hears the way it should sound.  Eventually she will be able to formulate it correctly.  Patience is the key here.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The most obvious way is to do it together.  Most little boys want to do whatever their dads do.  Without making a big deal of it I would just suggest you casually share the experience.  If he doesn't want to join you, fine, but in time he probably will.  I think not making a big deal of it is the most important thing.  Role models in all things are very powerful for children.  Keep it in perspective - he most likely will change sooner than you really want him to since they grow up over night.  Oh, I've also heard of people who encourage boys by dropping a few Cheerios in the bowl and inviting them to \"aim.\"    Good luck  Good luck.\n\n",

An exogenous source (from outside the body) of hormones that may produce this are either from drugs containing hormones such as contraceptive pills or cosmetics which contain estrogens in their composition.

She also develops a high fever after being exposed to hot temp. And runs a fever for no app. reason throughout the year. Her fevers have gotten as high as 105.5. She has gotten several ear infections in the last year not counting the 3 right after her vaccine. She just seems to stay sick alot more than my 5 other children. She has never been tested for anything and none of our doctors(we have had several due to moving) have ever seemed concerned. But I feel in my heart something is not right. Is there something I need to be pushing to have her tested for?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I see you have many concerns about your child.  I will try to address them as much as I can.  First of all, Raynaud's Syndrome does not have a known cause and it definitely has not been associated with any medication taken by the breastfeeding mother.  I do not know what medication you refer to but it is very unlikely to be the cause of this disorder which is related to blood vessel dilation.   This disease can be secondary to another underlying condition - another disease or thyroid disorder.  Most doctors can diagnose Raynaud's directly from a description of signs and symptoms but if another disorder is underlying, tests may be able to help diagnose that.  There is a cold-stimulation test that can be done in the office.  There is no blood test to determine Raynaud's syndrome.    Some children do have depressed immune systems and seem to pick up every infection that goes around.  In most, this allows their own immune system to develop and recognize future like infections with antibodies.  Your pediatrician should address the frequent ear infections.  There are vaccines available now to help reduce these and breastfeeding helps, but some children are very susceptible and require tubes in the ears to cure this problem and allow the ears to drain properly.    Mother's intuition can be a valuable tool in your child's health so if you feel in your heart that something is not right, bring a good, detailed description of her health history and infections to a scheduled physical exam for her.  Explain your concerns so the doctor can check her thoroughly.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I have a 16-month-old who had a positive PPD and now she is on INH for 9 months.  We are vegetarians and I was reading that while on INH foods high in tyramine should be avoided, including soy products (tofu, tempeh, etc).   The main protein in her diet is soy and I am having a lot of trouble finding things for her to eat without it.  Cheese and tuna fish is restricted too, so mainly she is just eating pasta and fruit and veggies - which she hardly touches.  So my question is, how important is it to avoid these foods in her age group and what is the risk if she does eat them?  I have spoken with her pediatrician and she doesn't give me a definite answer - just says to give her the meds with carbs???  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks so much! Shawnie\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Isoniazid is best absorbed when taken without food.  As for the rest of her diet, perhaps you could use more beans - pinto, black, navy, kidney, etc. are all excellent sources of protein and can be cooked, mashed, pureed, added to soups or other foods.  Legumes are also good and peanut butter serves the purpose as well.  Cottage cheese is also good.  The recommendation is to limit cheese and fish; not avoid it altogether so these can supplement your child's diet.  If you allow your child to eat eggs, this is another good source of protein.  Small amounts of tofu should not be a problem but you should try to adjust it as much as you can.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "My 15 year-old daughter awoke this morning with small swollen glands (?) directly beneath each ear, right next to her jaw. The right side is the most swollen and is particularly painful, she feels pain when she opens her mouth, even to speak,  or moves her head too suddenly - even swallowing causes discomfort. You can't really touch the swollen gland either, due to the discomfort it causes. The glands were not swollen when she went to bed last night. Yesterday, however, she had a severe, burning stomach ache around mid-morning, accompanied by chills - it went away after an hour or so. I was sick yesterday as well, with stomach pain and vomiting - though mine lasted longer and I still feel the effects - no swollen glands for me, though. She said that she stomach ache felt like  the burning sensation she would get right before developing a bout of hives (she went through a period of hives, about 6 bouts in one month). She has been taking Nadolol and Zomig (5mg) for a few months for severe, every-day headaches that she has had for around 6 months - I don't know if the medicine could cause it, even though she's taken the medicine for a while. I looked online and can't find any explanations for this - since the swelling is not equal on both sides, and only one side is painful. I can see the gland if I look at her neck from the side, so it's fairly noticeable, though still small in size. I read that this is not actually a lymph node, but a salivary gland - is that correct? If so, what could cause swelling? Someone mentioned mumps in children, but she's vaccinated against it.\n\n",

    "content": "My daughter is 42 pounds and 3 feet 3 inches tall.  Since she was around 18 months old, I have noticed that on occasion she will have a few drops of bright, thick blood (that sometimes looks like it may have clear mucus mixed with it) on her stool or in the toilet after a bowel movement.  Many times she has no stool on her bottom, only traces of the bloody mucus.  The bowel movements are not unusually large or firm.  She never complains about pain or constipation.  She has always taken her time about having a bowel movement.  The first 1-2 minutes are spent passing the stool and the next 5 minutes she spends on the toilet after she has passed the stool.  She says she's not finished yet, but rarely does anything extra.  This occurs every 2-3 months during one bowel movement and sometimes on the following bowel movement as well, but never more than that.  Her bowel movements otherwise are every day to every other day and normal.   Her pediatrician at the time said there was nothing to be concerned about, but he only felt of her stomach and said everything felt fine.  I don't want her to have to go thru any unnecessary testing.  She is a very healthy, active child.  Her medical history includes only one bout of stomach flu, a few runny noses, and one urinary tract infection when she was about 12 months old.  The only family history of gastroentestinal problems is her maternal great-grandmother who was diagnosed with diverticulitis at the age of 65.  Should I be concerned or follow my pediatrician's lead and trust that it's not serious?\n\n",

    "content": "My son, 13 yrs. old, had cervical lymph nodes according to the doctor who took our medical examination. However, his chest xray turned out to be negative, meaning his chest is fine. He is not having cough or colds, no symptoms of TB infection, had BCG vaccination when he was a baby, and he is healthy. He was advised to take mantaux skin test, and it turned out positive. The doctor prescribed him isoniazid for 9 mos. and said that if he did not take the medicine, his infection may become full blown in the future.  I did not tell the doctor that he had primary complex when he was 6 yrs. old, had undergone 6 months medication, took three medicines-rifampicin,isonizid and another medicine which  I cannot remember now. After 6 mos.,his doctor told me that he had been cleared of primary complex and should stop the medication.   He also had taken salbutamol cough syrup, and antibiotics when he was 8 yrs old, because he had asthmatic cough attacks according to the doctor. He grew up taking a lot of medicine, and I'm afraid of giving him isoniazid now, cause it may damage his liver.  Is it possible that primary complex or TB infection may recur after being infected and treated in the past? Would it be possible to have positive mantaux test because of a positive test in past? Should I give him the prescribed isoniazid now though he had been cleared of primary complex before.  Please help. Thank you and God bless.\n\n",

The second swelling that appeared on his head may not be a lymph node(i did not understand its exact location from your account). In infants & small children, palpable cervical, axillary and inguinal lymph nodes may be a normal feature(unlike in the adults).Nodes upto 1.5 - 2cms may be considered normal in this age group(unlike in the adults).

    "content": "Hello, Surgery requires a period of healing and what you are experiencing sounds like it is in the normal range.  You do need to be alert for signs of infection, especially if you develop a fever or notice a foul odor with the pus at the site.  Some oozing and bleeding is common and usually stops without intervention excepting slight pressure with a clean gauze.    Your size will not be affected.  If your penis seems small now it is probably because during recovery it is best not to have any type of erection and your body is taking care of itself until you heal.  The only thing removed is foreskin and there is nothing that happens in the circumcision to cause any other disruption to function.    It takes a while for complete healing and all genital stimulation/sexual activity should be avoided for about six weeks.    Best wishes for a full and rapid recovery.\n\n",

    "title": "Chronic sinusitis in 6 yr old",
    "content": "Hello, My son has chronic sinusitis which has not responded to 12 days Augmentum, 2 weeks Singulair, 2 weeks Rhinocort aqua. Then he had a ct scan, which  all I know is his maxillary  was completely opaque, his ethmoid as well as his splenoid was involved and his ostia   was blocked all unilaterally. He was also born with microtia,, atresia had ear reconstruction for the inner ear in 03 and had his adenoids ou Jan. 05. After the ct scan, the ent gave him 2 weeks of Omnicef, which also did not work. His ped. now has him on 2 weeks biaxin, we are on day7 and see no improvement. The ped said I would see if it would work in one week and I see no change. He had a RAST last week for dust mites, asperilligus as well as pets, which we don't have any.  Should I call about continuing the biaxin ,? He has drainage coming from his repaired atreic ear, which is clear and watery, so now he is also on ciprodex ear drops for a week. Is there a possibility that the ear prob. is in any way coming from the sinusitis? He has not had drainage of this type since he has had the ear rebuilt, so I find this odd. If the asperiligus comes back positive, would that then be indicitave that the sinusitis may be a allergic reaction to the mold, and could that be why no antibiotics are working? He is back on Rhinocort Aqua, now as well, but his ped. said his one side of his nose was completely swollen shut. Are there any benefits to continuing the biaxin for the next 7 days? I am afraid all these antibiotics may cause another yeast infection in his repaired ear, as he had a yeast inf. in there in Feb. as well. I am aware this looks rather complicated, and I apologize. I unfortunately have had very few of my questions anwered at this point, and we are one month out from having had the ct scan, and all the ent said was that's some sinusitis. So any answers you may be able to speculate on would be very helpful. I understand you can not give med. advice, but if you could tell me if biaxin would work by now if it were going to work, as well as explain the signifigance of a pos. asperilligus rast, as well as speculate on the poss. that the clear watery drainage might be coming from the sinusitis I would find itr ever so useful for my next conversation with the ent, which will not be for another 2 weeks. The not knowing anything can really get to a mom! Thanks in advance, Kim\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Kim, As for the continuation of Biaxin, you should know that in most cases of antibiotic use, a doctor chooses an antibiotic based on the most likely cause of the infection. If an antibiotic is stopped in midcourse, the bacteria may be partially treated and not completely killed, causing the bacteria to be resistant to the antibiotic. This can cause a serious problem if those now-resistant bacteria grow enough to cause a reinfection. It wouldn't harm, though, if you'd like to call your doctor to give him feedback and see if he'd like to continue with Biaxin.  As for the clear ear discharge, it is likely to be the result of the sinusitis. As you probably know, this area, the ear, nose and throat, is like a network of connections, so the congestion resulting from the sinusitis is also causing congestion in the ear and the resulting clear watery discharge. I believe you are referring in your description to the condition known as 'Allergic fungal sinusitis'.  Patients in this case present with symptoms of chronic sinusitis, which may include facial pressure, headache, nasal stuffiness, discharge, and cough. The condition is usually suspected in individuals with intractable sinusitis and nasal polyposis.  These patients usually have atopy and have had multiple surgeries by the time of diagnosis. CT scan of the sinuses reveals opacification with concretions and/or calcifications. The treatment of choice generally is surgery. I hope I have clarified matters for you.\n\n",

My only concern is that if this is a fungal allergy sinusitis, would the steroids have a bad effect on his condition. I feel certain I have read that steroids should not be used if it is fungal? Unfortuantely, I have done so  much research into this that I cannot find where I read that, or is that only in invasive fungal sinusitis, not allergic? I should finally hear the results of the rast tommorow and then have a better idea, I hope as to if this is fungal allergy or another allergy. Thanks , Kim\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks again for your prompt response! His RAST came back completely negative, completely. The Biaxin seems to have shown some improvement, however we are allmost at the end of his 14 days on it. Can you tell me what the chances are that he will rebound once he ends his biaxin? I am afraid when he ends the course, his sinusitis will come back.I am afraid it was the anti immflamatory action of the biaxin, not the antibiotic properties? I guess time will tell, but is it common , once the biaxin is finished, for the sinusitis to return? We have not started the oral steroids as of yet, I want to see if he continues to improve while he finishes the antibiotcs. Do you think he should have any skin testing done for allergens since the rast came back completely negative, or does that mean allergies are not a concern? Thanks again for your input, you have been very helpful, and I do appreciate it, Kim\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Dr.,  My wife was in her 32nd week when she went into labor. I rushed her to the hospital and the doctor said the baby will die if she doesn\u2019t take the baby out by C-section. So, after the operation they took the baby and placed him in an incubator and hooked him up to all sort of machines (ventilator and stuff with red light etc). After the first day they removed the ventilator because no need the baby will be okay without but they put oxygen support (something that is hooked up to the baby\u2019s nose). However, the baby got worst (his face got darker and he looked pale) after they removed the ventilator. Is this a bad medicine practice or this is normal!? Trail and error!! The baby has the following problems:  1)\tHas undeveloped lungs  2)\tThe baby breathes faster than normal 3)\tThe baby has a polycystic kidney  I hope a doctor could tell me briefly what to expect (Is it possible that his undeveloped lungs will improve!!? If yes, when should I expect the results?) What is the best course of action? Should they wait for his lungs to develop or should they start assessing the polycystic kidney?   I kindly thank you for your time and help. I am looking forward to hearing from you soon.   Sincerely yours,   A concerned father\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Prematurebaby,  Unfortunately this is actually a fairly complicated issue, difficult to fully explain in the context of the internet.  I would advise you to talk with the neonatologist (newborn intensive care specialist) to get more specifics about your baby.  I can give you some information that may be helpful, though.  Lung development varies some but in general, babies lungs are fully developed by about 34 weeks.  At 32 weeks, the lungs may or may not be sufficiently developed to allow for unlabored breathing.  It sounds as if your baby was not quite fully developed.  They can continue to develop after the baby is born although there is an increased risk of longer lasting difficulties so the baby will need to be followed closely for this.  Regarding the ventilator, it is not uncommon for a baby to be showing signs that they are ready to be taken off then subsequently need to be put back on.  The issue here is balancing so that the baby doesn't stay on the ventilator longer than necessary.  Being put back on the machine is not necessarily a bad thing.  It just means your child will need some more time before the next trial off the machine.  The kidneys may or may not be related.  If there was not good urine output from the baby's kidneys, the amniotic fluid does not increase properly and this can lead to decreased lung development.  Your neonatologist can help clarify this issue if needed.  I hope this helps.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  There is a specific metabolic disorder which  can cause this odd symtom, and it's known as Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD). It's caused by the body's inability to break down certain amino acids, and it can be realtively mild and cause little to no problem, or it can, in some cases, cause some nutrition-related problems that require medical treatment. It would probably be useful to have the child checked for this specific missing enzyme, but it sounds as though he is relatively healthy, so he may only have a very mild form (or he may not have this at all). I don't know what the  treatment is for this, but I've never encountered any great deal of concern about it among doctors, either, so while it does need ruling in/out, I believe it is a manageable problem, if, indeed, it's even present.  I hope this answers your question. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Antiss,  For some reason, some children will periodically have a maple syrup smell in their sweat.  The etiology of this is not known and it appears that in most cases it goes away on its own.  The most common form of maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) presents rapidly after birth and can be fatal if not treated.  It would be nearly impossible for this to be the case if your son is 3 years old and has not been being treated.  There is an intermediate form of the disease that can present at an older age; however, this is quite rare and I believe there are only 20-30 cases known world wide.  Also, there are some intermittent forms that present with symptoms when the body is stressed (such as during illness).  The common symptoms of MSUD include neurological manifestations including coordination problems, seizures, etc.  If this problem does not resolve I would recommend you have your son see his doctor for further evaluation.  If there is concern, a metabolic geneticist would be the specialist to consult.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm an 18 year old girl 5' 1\" and 198 lbs.  About 5 years ago i was diagnosed with suto tumor ceribrie. My father tried to figure out what was wrong with me for a long time because of all the symptoms i had. Eventually we found a doctor who knew what was wrong and i went into the hospital for a week.   After i returned home from the hospital i was prescribed a 250MG of Diamox to be taken twice daily. I would have a regularly 3 month check up to keep track of my condition. Three years ago I was prescribed to reduced the Diamox to once a day.  Then two years ago i finally was able to stop taking the Diamox completely. I go every 6 months with my doctor.  Everything has been going pretty good until about December 08. I was very tired all the time and seemed depressed. I never felt good and eventually stopped doing anything besides going to school and working. I never did anything with friends (before i was very social) Finally in February my parents took me to my pediatrician and i discovered I had Mono (for the second time, first time was a year ago December 07) I was told i had already had it for a couple months and everything should be getting better. I took two weeks off from work and a week from school to  get rid of my exhaustion and make the mono effects go away. It took an additional week for most of my symptoms to leave.  During the time period of Jan 08 to jan 09 i went from 178 lbs to 198 lbs. I'm afraid i will soon start getting back my symptoms. I recently, in the last month or two, started to have headaches back and this stinging pain in my head that i had b4. I still feel very tired and it seems like i might be depressed. I have tried to get my weight under control for Years upon years. There is nothing wrong with my hormones or anything. I got that tested when i found out i had mono.    I get home from school at 11 so i have all my meals at home by myself. My main question here is their any meal plan that is complete. I feel i need a strict diet to jump start my way to feeling better. I know that at 178 lbs i am way more content with myself and feel better. Is there any thing i can do right now? I don't want it to get worse.  Help is truly appreciated and needed immediately.\n\n",

Low thyroid levels can present as increased weight gain (despite \"normal\" food intake) and poor energy levels.  It can also contribute to depression type symptoms.  Pseudotumor cerebri has also been reported to occur with hypothyroidism.  Certainly eating healthy and moderately is important but I think, given your history, you should consider looking into some of the medical reasons for weight gain as well.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,        My 10 1/2 year old son recently had a throat and ear infection which cleared with antibiotics. Then he developed a chest infection which x-rays showed mucus in the bronchials. He was given a nebulizer, fluicimal sachets and zithromax syrup. The coughing stopped and he seemed fine now however he wakes in the night gasping for breath. He is unable to catch his breath and he is also unaware he is doing it.  In the morning I ask him if he remembers and he says no. He is sleeping with me as my husband is away I'm terrified this will happen when he returns to his own bed and he may choke or I will find him unconcious or worse. Any ideas or diognosis would be great .I live in Indonesia and have a problem with the doctor's take on things they wanted to test him for TB. Which is silly I thought. I look forward to hearing from you. Distraught Mom.\n\n",

    "content": "My seven year old is having lymph node removal surgery for MAC (mycobacterium avium complex) followed by 4 weeks of antibiotics.  The doctor recommended a yogurt a day to help with the side affects. My daughter loves yogurt now and I do not want her to make a psychological association between yogurt and the icky side affects of antibiotics.  I already hate anything orange flavored due to a similar association with a medication taken for a long period as a child.  Would it be appropriate to use yogurt some days and a probiotic such as FloraBEAR from RenewLife on other days? Just so she doesn't get sick of yogurt.

    "content": "Hello Angels4kali,  Using a probiotic may help minimize some of the side effects of diarrhea that can come with antibiotic use.  In general they are safe.  Live colony yogurt has these good bacteria in it as does the probiotic supplements.    I'm not as up on the subject as I once was but I believe that the only probiotic that has actually been shown to be helpful are the ones that have lactobacillus GG in them.  Despite the claims, most have actually not been shown to make a significant difference.  Regarding swapping between yogurt and the probiotic, this should be an acceptable method.  As a general warning, probiotics should not be used in those without a normal immune system.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Samsonsmom,  From what you are describing, it sounds like your daughter does not have any problems with hearing.  It would be very unlikely to be able to hear others but not herself.  If she can hear whispers without difficulty then she is probably fine.  If there is concern, however, her hearing can be formally tested.  Having decreased hearing could certainly cause one to talk louder and it is a relatively noninvasive test.  I suspect that she simply hasn't learned to control her volumes yet.  This is very common and as she gets older she'll be more in tune with \"appropriate\" levels of volume.  In the meantime, you can continue to gently reminder her to speak softly when needed.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I have an 18mo old daughter who prior to 8mo of age was perfectly healthy in all aspects.  At 8mo of age she got a cold which of course caused her to have a stuffy nose. Two months later and several antibiotics later the nasal congestion had not cleared.  We opted to have just her adenoids removed by her 12mo b-day.  This seemed to be fine after her healing time (12/08).  By the beginning of this year she got another cold which caused congestion in her sinuses.  Since January she has been on Amox., Augmentin, Cefidnir, Rocephin shots,  and is almost now completed another Rx. of Vantin.  She seems to be cleared mostly, but there are times through out the day that I will hear a phlegmy sound when she is breathing from the nasal area.  My doctor had said that she may need to be tested for a protien definciency.  What does this mean, and is there something that I can do for her if the test is positive?  Also I have heard of fungal alllergies, what is this, and could this be a cause for the sinus congestion?  Please help I am afraid that all these antibiotics may be doing more harm to the overall health of her body.  Thank You in advance for your advice on what to do next.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: 18mo w/chronic sinusitus for past 10 months",
    "content": "Hello Karengm,  I would recommend you consult a pediatric ear, nose and throat physician.  18 month olds do have sinuses but not in the classic sense that we think of them.  It is unusual for a child of this age to develop chronic sinusitis, particularly that would be so resistant to antibiotics.  I am wondering if something else is actually going on.  This is the age when allergic symptoms can begin to develop and can mimic a sinusitis.    Also, children this age tend to have anywhere from 12-15 colds a year (mostly respiratory and mostly in the winter season) so it can seem as if they never really get over the infection when, in fact, it is repeated different viral infections (which will not respond to antibiotics).  If there truly is a sinus issue going on, the pediatric ENT doctor should be able to help identify the problem and suggest a corrective measure.  I am not familiar with the protein deficiency that your doctor is suggesting so I cannot comment on this.  If you happen to have a specific name of a condition I may be more familiar with it.  I hope this helps.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Om_3abadi,  MCV and MCH are both marker of cell size.  The can be low in thalassemia; however, there are many more reasons they can be low as well.  There was one value on the CBC that I did not see in your post.  Do you know what the RDW value was?  One of the most common causes of low MCV and anemia is iron deficiency.  With significant iron deficiency, daily multivitamins with iron are unlikely to have enough iron to overcome and correct the deficiency in a timely manner.  Typically, the recommendation is \"treatment\" doses of iron for 2-3 months then returning to a \"maintenance\" dose.  With iron deficiency, along with the anemia, there clasically is a low MCV and a high RDW.  With thalasemmia, the MCV is low but the RDW is also low.  RDW is a measure of the variation in size of the red blood cells.  In thalassemia the red cells are small but basically all the same so the RDW is low.  (With iron deficiency, new red cells being made are large while old ones are smaller causing the RDW to be high.)  Another common cause of anemia is chronic illness or inflammation, although this often does not depress the MCV quite as much (but can do so).  I would suggest talking with your son's doctor about the CBC results and seeing if further testing is needed.  If needed, iron storage levels can actually be measured to see if they are low.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello and sorry for the delay in answering.  The low MCV and high RDW is suggestive of iron deficiency.  In addition, the iron levels are at the bottom of normal.  I think this is highly suggestive of iron deficiency.  It can take several months of \"treatment\" iron doses to restore iron levels.  It is also helpful to know that most multivitamins with iron actually have \"maintenance\" dose levels that will keep iron levels high once they are at that level but are not sufficient to fill up a deficit.  I would suggest that you continue with the iron supplementation and repeat labs in 6-8 weeks.  Give enough time for your son to get good iron dosing or the test may not be helpful.  If his iron levels are not improving he may need further testing to see if there is a reason he is not absorbing the iron.  Iron deficiency is quite common and the absorption issues are fairly rare so usually iron supplementation will work.  I still believe thalassemia is unlikely; however, if there is still concern further testing could be done after his iron levels have corrected.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I work with a 9 year old boy with autism who is also nonverbal, so it makes resolving medical issues very difficult.  In the past eight weeks or so, he has been sent home from school at least 5 times for vomiting at school.  It usually happens in the morning.  He throws up his breakfast and then has to be picked up around 11.  He has a bad home situation and I want to find out what is wrong with him, but his mom never takes him to the doctor.  She says that the throwing up is because he has allergies and he is swallowing mucus.  However, from what I understand, he throws up food, not mucus.  Even though he vomits, his mom still sends him out with me for the normal 6 hours I work with him.  He threw up today and he doesn't appear to be displaying any other signs of illness, and he hasn't thrown up again.  He is a little tired, but that could be from lack of sleep.  It is not unusual for him to be tired, even when he doesn't vomit at school.  He is taking 1mg guanfacine twice a day and his mom gives him Benadryl for allergies, though she says he threw up because she didn't have any to give him this morning.  As I said, it is a bad home situation, and I really don't know what to believe.  I am concerned that she is possibly messing up his doses of the guanfacine.  Could this be causing the vomiting?  He also is almost constantly constipated, likely due to his poor diet, but we don't know for sure.  Is it possible to vomit from allergies? Or could it be the medicine?  Or another more serious condition that he needs to see a doctor for?  His mom doesn't seem to show any concern whatsoever about this problem and I really don't know what to do.  I am very worried about him and have never seen anything like this before in a child.\n\n",

    "content": "Gosh I wish I had read this when you posted it.  I want to say that anything that has to do with children is very touching to my heart.   Ok...the vomiting can be a sign of many things of course.  And allergies do not normally cause people to vomit.  The only reason I can think of that he would throw up from that is if his stomach is empty and he develops nausea from the sinus drainage (swallowing the mucous).  OR is mom giving him the medication on an empty stomach which makes him feel nausea? I do not believe it really means an overdose of the guaifenesin.  (though I could not discount it completely).  It sounds more as if this child has an underlying problem.  I know you say he is autistic and has a bad situation at home.  So it could be nerves. Or it could be something to do with the brain also.  (if this is a recent occurence and never use to happen, then I would wonder if the child has headaches accompanied by the vomiting).  This could be a dangerous situation.  It can also be a condition called gastroparesis whereas the patient vomits without warning and without nausea.  (not neccessarily a dangerous condition in and of itself but very hard to deal with).  My other concern is if the child might vomit while he is in bed and on his back.  I would worry that he may aspirate this into his lungs if so.  What I suggest is that you go ahead and call child protective services to be sure the situation is fully investigated.  Not only the vomiting, but the lack of concern on the mother's part.  Please whenever you think a child may be in danger be it a physical illness or a concern of abuse/neglect, contact someone to investigate it.    I also want to ask if this autistic child tends to hit his head against things repeatedely?  I know some of the autistic children do this.  This can cause a bleed on the brain which in turn can produce vomiting from increased pressure on the brain.    This is a very complicated situation with many possible answers as to why the little child is vomiting so much.    Sincerely,  Debra Van Ness RN\n\n",

    "content": "Hello and thanks for your service. My son, who is 2, got a salmonelliosis. We suspect that it was because of a small turtle he touched. It was severe and he was admitted to the hospital for one week in antibiotics (March 29 to April 4). All results in both blood and heces were negative when he was discharged. However, as a follow up we made some stool tests and they called me today that he is positive. We are very concerned and also someone told me that it could last even months. What is the treatment from now on then? Can he infect other people? WIll he be suspended from day care again? It has been already a night mare for us and him and now we are again in this.  Thanks very much for all your help\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Though this infection can be a real nuisance, most people are able to recover without medication, but may require rehydration due to the water loss through diarrhea.  Sometimes infection spreads and antibiotics are needed.  Your child will likely be excluded from daycare because it can be spread due to hygiene concerns that occur in a childcare setting.  These kids are notorious for not washing well after using the toilet and if they get feces on toys, etc. that other children may \"mouth\" he can give it to others.    I'm sorry you have to deal with this, but it is important to prevent the spread until it is completely gone and your child's stools are negative.  Best wishes\n\n",

She's also had diarrhea on and off for a couple weeks.  And now, just within the last two days, has been a little lethargic.  She looks tired all the time even though she's been sleeping alot within the last 2 days, even has dark circles under her eyes.  Her heart rate seems to be elevated as well, between 140-152 while sitting.  Her only medical history is recurrent pink eye that I was told couldn't be treated with an antibiotic because it is viral pink eye.   Should I be concerned about these symptoms?  Her one year well child check is on June 4th, is it okay to wait until then to see my doctor about these symptoms?\n\n",

    "content": "I have been in denial for quite sometime that something is wrong with my child.  When she was two my doctor referred her to a behavioral specialist.  I took it as an insult to myself that something might be wrong with my child.  I told him that she was just throwing a fit and every child does it.  I didnt want her on medicine.  i thought it was a cop out for parents that didnt feel like dealing with there children.  I now see that certain children do need medication not for the parents, but so that they don't hurt themselves emotionally or physically.  This is very hard for me to admit.  I am in tears writing this.  my child is a state champ in wrestling.  She beat 42 boys at state.  She is eighth in the nation.  She is a remarkable child both physically and mentally.  I just think sometimes she cant control her mind.  The whole family walks on eggshells. The kids could be playing and laughing and she says there laughing at her. If we say or do anything wrong we don't know how long the fit will be or what it will consist of.  Most of the time it is running out of the house or away from me at public place.  It could be thirty feet or a mile.  I have a hard time physically catching her.  She is the fastest in her school.  The final straw was she lost a wrestling match took off out of the doors and climbed two fences into a football field, climbed to the top of the bleachers and told us she was going to jump.  She didnt and i don't think she would.  its just a tactic to get the attention of me and my husband.  She gets all of our attention.  The other kids don't get near the attention because they don't have extreme outbursts everyday.  We don't have insurance but i am taking her to the doctor.  I just wanted to get some input on what on earth is going on in her mind.  We love her so much and don't want her on medicine but it is effecting the whole family.  Im afraid shes going to run off and get hit by a car, grabbed by a stranger, or do something that could hurt her.  It is emotionally tiring on her as well.  I don't want her to have to do this everyday.  I LOVE HER SO MUCH!  please help\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Your daughter needs a complete mental health evaluation to find the correct diagnosis.  It is possible she has some chemical imbalance which causes her behavior and if she can be helped with medication, it is no different than a diabetic who needs insulin.  Many parents feel as you do and resist medical intervention or believe that if they are good enough parents they won't need it.  The truth is mental illness is very common and some of the most productive members of society have been plagued by this.    Fortunately we now have excellent medications that can help most disorders so that people can lead productive and happy lives, free of the problems that have interfered at times.  Be patient because it can take a while to find the right medication or combination of meds and/or therapy.  It is worth it!  There are many types of problems but a good doctor and therapist can help you find answers.  You might try a mental health clinic, perhaps through your local community health arena.  Another good resource is NAMI (http://nami.org).  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Milk allergy is common in infants.  This is why cow's milk is not recommended.  Breastfeeding is the safest course for your baby and it has been shown to reduce allergies because the baby gets the antibodies you have made.  Chances are very good your baby will not have a problem but avoiding milk now has not been shown to be effective in preventing it in the baby.  It is very rare for a breastfed baby to be sensitive to his mother's ingestion of milk products but if it turns out this is a problem for your baby and you notice excessive fussiness, you can always do an experiment by going milk-free for a few days to see if there is improvement.  If not, it's probably not cause by your diet.   Most breastfeeding mothers can eat whatever they wish without effects on the baby.  It has also been shown that many babies who can't tolerate cow's milk based formulas, also do not do any better on a soy-based formula, so breast is definitely best!  Try to continue for at least the first year of life, though you will add other solids (cereals, fruits, veggies) at around 6 months.  Congratulations on your desire to give your baby the best.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Since flu can last for a week or longer, fever can be present for a while.  Treat it with acetaminophen; not aspirin and make sure he gets plenty of fluids to drink as dehydration can also cause fever.  If it gets quite high or he shows signs of dehydration, confusion, lethargy, headache, refuses to drink, or does not want to be held and cuddled like most sick children do, he should be seen by a health professional since sometimes there are complications of flu that include bacterial infections and \"traveling\" in the body such as moving through the blood stream, into the spinal fluid which can cause meningitis, or the lungs, causing pneumonia.

It is soft and movable, as if there is fluid of some sort in there (like a hematoma or cyst?). We had kind of noticed over the past maybe week that the back of her head seemed to be getting flatter, but just assumed it was from sleeping on her back all the time, we didn't realize there was a raised area above it giving it the appearance of being flatter. It is behind her anterior fontanel (which feels normal, no bulging).   There are no other symptoms to speak of. She is not irritable, eats normally, alert and cheerful. It does not bother her to touch it.   She is with me all day... no trauma or head bumps or anything else I can think of to logically explain this.... if she was newborn I would think caput or cephalohematoma, as it was a 27 hour induced labor followed by ceasarean, but two months later with no signs previously?  I have tried finding information online with no luck. I called a nurse line and they had no ideas (told me to call her doctor.) I tried to call her doctor last night, but they did not return my call (not very happy about that.)  Any ideas???????????\n\n",

The location is a bit unusual for such an occurrence but hemangiomas can occur just about anywhere.  These often will get bigger initially over the months to years after birth then subsequently involute and disappear.  They are not dangerous.  I would, however, recommend you have this evaluated by your doctor to determine what this is for sure.  I cannot be certain given the limitations of the internet.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Momwith4kids,  Your son's symptoms may be due to a few possible things.  It may be that he has a bit of a stomach infection (especially given the diarrhea and headache).  It may also be that he has some gastroesophageal reflux, where the stomach acid comes back up into the esophagus (food pipe).  It can cause a burning feeling in the center of the chest, although it would be less likely to cause headache and diarrhea.  One other possibility would be that he has a malabsorptive problem such as lactose intolerance or celiac disease.  If his symptoms do not improve over the next few days or if they get worse it is probably time for him to visit his doctor.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Of course toilets are dirty but chances are your baby will be fine.  I'm glad she didn't drown - it happens.  Hepatitis A is probably the most concerning infection that could be transmitted by the fecal-oral route.  Signs of this would be nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, though quite mild in children.  Use good handwashing if your child shows symptoms because this would be contagious to others as well, but it is usually something people recover from without long-term problems.    Most infections your child might have gotten would have similar symptoms in the GI tract.  Chances are your child's immune system will be able to handle any germs she got.  I know it's gross to even think about this, but if she doesn't show symptoms soon, I'd say she managed to avoid anything too bad.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Question about choking toddler",
    "content": "Hello, Yes, you have experienced a mother's scare for sure.  Many mothers don't realize how easily a baby can choke on foods.  Even \"baby\" cookies can be mushed up by the baby until there is a large chunk left that can be inhaled whole, causing choking and even death.    We generally don't encourage a blind fingersweep because you can push the object down further.  If you see the object you can sometimes be successful in bringing it up.  If it had gone into the trachea, rather than the esophagus, your baby would have reacted badly with coughing, continued choking, possible airway obstruction, breathing difficulty and turning blue in color.  I suspect it was the esophagus - lucky for you both.  Be sure you are familiar with choking treatment in babies.  Back blows with the baby turned, head down and declined over your other arm - a firm back blow sometimes dislodges the object.  If not, chest thrusts (often called the Heimlich maneuver) can be used.  In all cases, babies must be treated quite gently, yet firm enough for the air in the lungs to blow the object out.  Check into infant first aid and CPR.  As more people become educated, more babies will be saved.  You may save another person some day with this skill.  This is an excellent question to remind caretakers of the dangers of \"finger foods\" when not in tiny bites.  Hot dog circles are notoriously choking hazards in small children - even older ones so it is suggested these be cut into quarters after the discs are sliced.  Enjoy your baby!\n\n",

She was off of it during the summer, and put back on it when her teachers started complaining about her adhd once she returned to school. So the idea is to only give it to her on school days, and leave her off of it on days when she doesn't go to school. I can't get a clear answer from her doctor's office regarding this question.

    "title": "Re: Question about Concerta for chils'd ADHD",
    "content": "Hi Kyndra, The idea of \"drug vacations\" came about when there was fear that growth might be retarded because of ADD medications.  The appetite suppressant effects of some of them was the actual culprit.  So, if your child is eating well and gaining appropriate weight, you don't need to have the breaks unless you want to.  Sometimes it seems kind of mean to give your child the medication just for school activity.  With a disorder such as ADD/ADHD, they usually need help in all their activities and appropriate behavior and the ability to stay on task at home and in weekend activities such as sports, can be just as important to his/her self esteem and development.  It also may help your family life.  For these reasons I do not recommend taking the child off the medication until you want to try weaning off at some point in the future to see if the need is still there for the treatment.    In many children, this medication can make the difference between success and failure in many venues so I would not alter the treatment from day to day or week to week at all.  But, discuss your concerns and reasons for doing it with your doctor.  Just be assured, the breaks are not actually needed.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I assume you are using an infant suppository, but  you should only use these if you truly have a constipated child.  This is quite rare, especially in a breastfed baby.  Some people compare the amount of stooling to others and feel their baby is constipated.  There is a huge variation in what is normal for a baby.  Some stool with almost every feeding; others can go several days.  The criteria for determining this is the consistency of the stool.  If it is hard, dry and pellet-like, there is constipation.  If it is straining or passing gas, but infrequent and the consistency is soft and mushy, it is NOT constipation.  You do not want your baby to develop a dependence on external stimulation, but to learn to pass the stool when the urge comes naturally.    If fussiness is your basis for the decision, the baby could be colicky or if you use formula, digestion is sometimes delayed.  You can give baby simethicone drops for gas and try soothing methods for the fussiness.  The Happiest Baby on the Block by Dr. Harvey Karp is one book with some good ideas.  Also, Elizabeth Pantley has written some excellent childcare books.  Good luck.\n\n",

It was very bright on the scan, im sorry that I cant remember the name of what they said it was. I was under the impression in the past, from his cystic fibrosis team, that liver problems in patients with cystic fibrosis usually occured from the late teens onwards so I am little worried that he has started with all this so young.  When he was 4 months old he was admitted for IV antibiotics for a chest infection. During his visit he was overdosed. He should have had a dose of 540mg of Tazobactin but actually 5.4g was administered.  I am now wondering if this could have contributed to the liver problems that he is now facing.

I had a ct scan w/ contrast finding no PE's but a thinning of the heart wall. Then a Echocardiogram revealed that the thinning of the heart wall was insignificant.

However, I would like you to describe exactly how it all started, beginning with the bronchitis attack.  Also, does the low oxygen saturation begin immediately upon walking, or does it take a few minutes? Any past history of repeated bronchitis attacks, asthma, or any chest troubles would help.\n\n",

    "title": "Hypoxic with unusual symptoms",
    "content": "Regarding this post, I am having the same type of situation.  I am often hypoxic.  It was recently determined that my saturation level is diminished upon walking with no known cause.  My breath sounds are also mysteriously diminished.  At times, walking any distance makes me light headed and results in a pounding headache.    My situation began three years ago when I woke up with severe shortness of breath.  (never had breathing problems prior to this) On the third day, I began coughing globs of purplish matter (of solid color) which I was told by my physician was blood.  Chest x-ray and CT were fine.  Shortness of breath never improved, 'severe uncontrollable asthma' was diagnosed as no other cause could be found.  Asthma medications only relieve the symptoms momentarily.  Large doses of Prednisone seem to provide the only relief and this is also short lived when the dosage is stopped.  The only thing coinciding with the start of my symptoms is that the shortness of breath began the first night I slept in my new house.  I've been told numerous times that this is just coincidence as it does not improve when I am away.  Lately I have also had swelling from my feet up into my thighs, abdomen, dehydration, unusual sensations in arms and legs, toes and feet turn blue when sitting\u2026  Now a very odd sensation is occurring.  It is as though my body stops and is silent for a moment before resuming if this makes sense?  It's very peaceful but for a second or two, it is as though everything stops running, like a pause.  Is this something I should be concerned with?  Anything you can tell me regarding these issues would be greatly appreciated!  Thank you!\n\n",

It could also result from an allergy to any material used in the furniture or paint. You could be genetically predisposed to asthma, but the process was triggered by exposure to something in that new home, and once triggered it would go on even when you are away. Kindly discuss this with your doctor in order to investigate.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, No, you are not at any increased risk because of your history of H-pylori.  This theory has been mostly disproven by the medical community on further analysis.    In our hopes for a cause and cure for SIDS, we examine all kinds of factors, but this has not proven to be a likely contributing factor.  The most important things you can do to prevent SIDS is make sure your baby sleeps on his back without fluffy bedding, toys and pillows until he gets older.  Use a firm, flat mattress and dress the baby in appropriate clothing to keep him warm but not overheated.  Sleep sacks are good which keep the baby's body covered without him getting trapped in heavy blankets.  Also, nobody around the baby should ever smoke any tobacco products as second hand smoke is another known risk factor for SIDS.  Tummy time is important for proper head and neck development so plan some play time when the baby is awake, especially as he gets a little older.  This will encourage his neck muscles to develop as he tries to pull his head up off the surface.  Babies kept too much on their backs, without break, and in carseats, swings, etc. tend to get flat heads so changing position is important when the baby is awake and hold your baby rather than keeping him always in some kind of chair or carrier.    Enjoy your baby!\n\n",

The muscles of the upper face are normal so the nasal and eye expressions should look normal.  According to medical literature, the condition is benign and over time, the facial asymmetry should improve.  It is documented that ACF is associated with cardovascular abnormalities like ASD.    I have not read of any other associated abnormalies (eg hydrocephalus or cerebral palsy) which would cause developmental delay.    reference: UptoDate 2009, Tiffany M McGee-Garrett MD  All the best to you and your daughter.\n\n",

    "content": "My nearly four year-old child had reflux as an infant.  She spit up frequently, and we were referred to a radiologist for the diagnosis. She was put on Zantac until about 9 months old, when she seemed like she had outgrown it.  Now she has a chronic cough, and often complains of headaches or stomach-aches.  She also gets a clear runny nose and sneezing, which we have attributed to seasonal allergies.  She is currently on 4mg of Singulair once a day, which seems effective some of the time. Lastly, she has complained about her mouth hurting, usually when she is eating.  We are beginning to think she may have food allergies, possibly to tomatoes and oranges, which seem to exacerbate her coughing.  The cough has given us a scare- she couldn't stop one night and was wheezing, with a red face and eyes tearing. Her paternal grandmother is known to have several food allergies, yet my daughter does not display the gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting/diarrhea/bloating.  She is always asymptomatic when we reach the doctor's office, and is otherwise very energetic and alert.  We're very concerned that if it is a food allergy and we don't take action, she could have future, more severe reactions.  However, is it possible that her reflux is back, and that is the cause of all her symptoms?\n\n",

It is impossible to say exactly so I would take her to the pediatrician with a good diary of the events, triggers, activities, and foods relating to her health - both during attacks and when all is well.  Diagnosing children can be very difficult of course. Good luck.\n\n",

Goat's milk seems to be more safe in this regard, and formula is also considered safe in general. For this reason I am unable to provide any ratio of breast milk to cow's milk for you. I could refer this question to the obstetric/gynocology team here and see if anyone has access to more knowlege on this subject. Please check back here in a day or so to see if anyone has any more useful information to offer.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Feeding an infant with cow milk",
    "content": "Hello.  Feeding an infant cow's milk is strongly contraindicated.  Breast milk is the best nutrition for babies under one year.  Also, goats milk is not appropriate for human babies (while it is terrific for goats).  Both cows milk and goats milk are not formulated for human babies.    Some of the most important things to remember when trying to increase your milk supply:  1.  Mother's nutrition should be excellent.  Mom needs to be taking in enough nutritious calories to make enough milk.  Also, Mom needs to be taking in enough healthy liquids, ie, water, healthy juices, not soda.    2.  Feed your baby often and freely.  Babies need to nurse every 90 minutes to 2 hours.   Typically, they will nurse about twenty minutes on one side.  You can then switch to the other breast, and allow the baby to nurse as long as he or she wants.  Remember, to start the new feeding with the breast that you finished the last feeding.    3.  Breast feeding is a supply and demand relationship.  The more frequently baby is allowed to nurse, the more your milk will come in.  It will take your body up to 24 hours for the supply to catch up with baby's new demand.  Frequently this happens when babies are having a growth spurt, at two weeks, one month, six weeks etc.    4.  The fact that baby is nursing constantly does not mean you don't have enough milk, it means that the baby is building up your supply.  Don't worry if you can't express much milk manually or with a pump.  Your baby is the best breast pump.    5.  Be patient with yourself.  Breast feeding takes practice, for you and for your baby.  If you need help, call your local La Leche League Leader.  They can be found online.  They offer support, and a series of four meetings, and are a wonderful resource.    Good luck, and I assure you that if you stick with this little hurdle, the rewards for you and your baby are tremendous.  Your breasts were designed specifically for this incredible purpose.    Take care, Linda Perry, CM, CPM, CTT Midwife\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Feeding an infant with cow milk",
    "content": "Hello, John is correct that you should not give your baby regular cow's milk.  While it is the perfect feeding for a calf and older children can digest it, an infant is not able to properly digest this milk without modifications being made to it.  That is essentially what an infant's formula is - modified cow's milk.  The perfect food for your baby is your milk.  In addition to the nutrition, you are also able to continue to protect your baby from disease with ever-changing antibodies produced in your milk.    If you feel you need to increase your milk supply, start with increased feedings.  Your milk should meet the demand within a day or two.  Let your baby suck as much as he/she desires and you can even encourage more frequent feedings while working on your milk supply amount.  Supplementing the baby with anything can disrupt your supply so it is not recommended unless the doctor is noticing a weight loss and you need to temporarily supplement while your milk supply is improving.  Keep in mind that your baby may not actually be hungry following the feeding, but because they have a strong suck reflex, if offered an artificial nipple, they will suck, as if hungry.  This is not a good indicator of adequate feedings.  Weighing the baby and monitoring for wet and soiled diapers is the best way to determine.  While building up your milk supply, even if it is low now, just allow the baby to suckle at the breast as often as needed.  This will encourage your milk to increase in volume and it will satisfy your baby's need to suck.   There are some herbal remedies that can help milk production.  Fenugreek and Blessed Thistle are often used if you have good access to pure products.  The doctor can also prescribe Reglan or Domperidone if it is available where you live.   You could also contact LaLeche League International for help and support.  They can be found on the web at www.llli.org  Please do not give straight cow's milk to your young baby.  Of course you should be in touch with your health care provider if you are concerned about weight gain or the baby is not having wet diapers, seems lethargic or dehydrated.  Keep in touch.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  While your child would seem to be suffering from a mild \"failure to thrive\" situation, and while the bloodwork probably does indicate something is wrong, it's dificult to narrow it down more.   Hemoglobin is marginally low. White count is elevated, but not as in an actute bacterial infection, although it is close to that range. No abnormal cells, adequate platelets. This all is suggestive of either a low-grade infection or perhaps some sort of anemia, perhaps due to  an abnormality of the bone marrow (although this is far from clear based on the results provided).  Probably the best course is to follow this for a while and see if it resolves (as an infection) or if the abnormalities can be correlated with a marrow or other sort of disorder,  or perhaps a metabolic disease. It is extremely difficult, at this distance, to hazard a more precise guess, and the child really does need to be followed up to determine why he is slightly under the norm in terms of growth and has slightly abnormal bloodwork.   I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello cmr1987,  Hope all is well!  There are tons of really good info online about subdural hygromas, even some pretty nifty pictures of the brain. A subdural hygroma is basically a collection of CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) in the subdural space. Very similar to hydrocephalus that you mentioned earlier, just in a different space. The subdural space in a \"normal\" brain is actually not a space at all. It is really just the seperation of 2 different parts of the brain. Picture it like this, you have 2 pieces of bread on top of each other, the space in between would be your subdural space. So, any collection of anything in that space is abnormal, because it is really just a \"virtual\" space.  The CT that your baby is going to have performed will give the Doctors a really good image of what is going on.  I wish you both much luck!\n\n",

If this is a continuous reoccurring episode, I would certainly have it checked more thoroughly. It may be viral in nature like you suspected, but if you are treating the symptoms at home and they keep coming back, I think its time to re-evaluate. Perhaps it is a bacterial infection and she may need the use of antibiotics. You mentioned that these papules have ruptured before, it would be a really good idea to have the practitioner obtain a sample for a culture, then you can know exactly what your dealing with and how to effectively treat it.  In the meantime, watch for fever, and good hand washing and try to encourage her to avoid touching/scratching/picking the area :) Easier said than done.  Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, my daughter has had recurrent and severe headaches for the last two years. She is now 6, and has been under the care of a neurologist for the last year or so. She takes 5ml of Pamelor (nortriptyline) every night to control the pain.  We had blood work run twice on her, at my request. Her platelets have come back moderately high both times. The neuro tells me the range for pediatric platelet count ends at 350 and hers is 453.   My problem is that I am concerned about her, while everyone else tells me it's nothing to worry about. I feel like I am missing something huge here, and it nags at me all night and all day. She says the headaches are constant, but flare greatly after increased activity, such as P.E. or recess. She will literally be playing and then be down for a couple of hours with pain. She is also vastly below the normal range for her weight, and has been in the 15th percentile for the last few years, but she eats like a horse. MRI and CAT scan of the head came back normal, with only mild scarring presumably from the headaches. She is also perfectly healthy otherwise; there has been no symptom of an infection since last July when she was stricken with a stomach flu.   Thoughts? I am severely frustrated, but due to our insurance I can not obtain a second opinion without significant cost. Thank you!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: 6 yr Female, recurrent and severe headaches",
    "content": "Hello --  It seems as though the headaches are a bodily response to something (as opposed to a structural abnormality like a growth, or marked change in blood pressure or intracranial pressure). This could be a variation on the histamine (cluster) headache theme, and since those are rare in people as young as your daughter they may manifest differently. One reason I suspect some sort of rebound headache is because of the way it flares after play. However, even mild scarring in the brain or its lining leave me wondering if this might not be an autoimmune problem. These are fairly unusual in such young patients, so it's more difficult to quantify. If all the benchamarks  have been met clinically through testing, there is little choice but to watch and wait for a change. This is far from ideal, but since there is no clear cut syndrome recognizable, this may be the only way to discover the underlying cause.  The platelet count should be monitored, since that is also unusual in a patient this age, and thromboythemia is almost never seen before adulthood. Something is going on, but it's difficult, so far, to pin it down. It has to be very uncomfortable to know something is not right but be unable to go right to it and correct it.  If the Pamelor is effective this suggests also an inflammatory (autoimmune) problem. The good news, if it works, is that it does.   I wish I could give you a better answer, but like your doctors, I find myself in a blind alley for now. The best case scenario would be for the  problem to simply resolve,  which is also a possibility.  Good luck to you and your daughter and please follow up with us if anything changes or there is anything further to add.\n\n",

With lymphocytosis (elevated lymphocyte count), recurrent infections, a drop in red cell and neutrophil count, the idea of leukemia naturally would cross the mind.   One simple way of judging if the lymphocytosis is reactive (e.g. from viral infection) or malignant is to recheck the CBC after illness subsides to see if the cell count normalizes.  Any abnormalities during non illness may warrant further testing.    I'll run this past the oncology department too to get their opinion.    All the best to you.\n\n",

Her doctor did a full blood workup and it all came back fine.  About a month after the blood work, she seemed to pep up again. About three weeks ago, she woke up with a scratchy voice.  I looked down her throat and saw no redness.  I then felt her glands and found a pea sized lump on her left side.  Her voice went back to normal later that day and she had no other symptoms.  I had a friend who is a nurse feel it and she suggested that I call the doctor to be sure.  When we went to the doctor (about a week after I first felt the lump), he felt one on her right side too.  He said that he wasn't concerned since they were both small, movable and not tender to the touch.  Yesterday, I found one behind her left ear.  We happened to have her 5 year appointment that day, and again, her doctor was not concerned.  I love her doctor, yet am still scared.   Should I ask to see an ENT?

    "content": "Hello --  The appearance of prominent, enlarged lymph nodes is fairly common and normal in small children when there are viral or bacterial illnesses, even mild ones, and these are usually far less prominent as the child grows. However, they also can be indicative of some more troublesome problem. The doctor has observed the elastic (normal) nature of these glands, and so feels they are of no concern. If they continue to appear in more locations, become  larger or harder, or if there are other symptoms, then by all means be more aggressive in seeking rule outs via blood work. Right now, however, I think it's probably safe to say the doctor is going  with what is reasonable and normal for smaller children. If you are still doubtful, either insist on follow up bloodwork or seek a second opinion.   Hope this is helpful. Good  luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there --  There are glands at the back of the head, and these may or may not be abnormally swollen, but also may have nothing to do with the tumble. Once something has happened, the natural tendency is to look closely at areas which may have been affected, thus the discovery of the bumps (glands most likely), which may have been right there all the time anyway.  Absent any neurological symptoms (odd behavior, vomiting, excessive crying, excessive sleeping, etc.) I think you can probably relax. Those bumps shouldn't be related to the spill even if they weren't present previously.   Hope this is helpful. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  This sort of incident, while potentially serious, usually is not, which is why the doctor has taken a fairly casual approach. If there are no symptoms and if the spot hasn't changed in terms of swelling, coloration, etc., then there's probably no cause for concern.  However, one should always be watchful for 36 hours after a bump like this, looking mainly for behavior changes, excessive sleeping, and unsual vomiting. Anything grossly out of the ordinary should send up a flag. Absent symptoms, just be supportive. Good luck to you.\n\n",

I take plenty of showers, wear deodorant, perfume, etc. but the problem is still there. Its driving me crazy. I am in college but I really can't concentrate. I do have pains in my left and right side a lot. Sometimes a whole part of my body will hurt from my shoulder to my foot to a side of my teeth. My legs also hurt especially when it rains but that's been happening since my child. My stomach is kinda big, like its malnourished while the rest of my body is average. I also get gassy a lot. I have been to a doctor about this issue when I was 14, and she told me I had IBS with constipation. I was too nervous to talk face to face so I am pretty sure she misdiagnosed me.I was pretty upset when I talked to her. I would really appreciative it if you could help me with any suggestion. I have heard of TMAU but I don't smell like fish.  Does it sound like ICV? I would go to a chiropractor but I don't have health insurance. I've read that constipation can cause this but I don't think that's it. I have also had some extremely painful periods, they were so bad I couldn't walk and my period started when I was 12 so maybe there's a connection.  Thanks a billion. I don't know when I smell because I can't smell myself but i hear comments practically everyday. I just want to have a normal life. Please help me.\n\n",

It sounds like your abdomen has been distended for some time and there is a bad odor but not fishy odor...and no problem with constipation.  The question is what could this be and is it related to severe periods.    A thorough history and physical including xrays of the admomen and ultrasound of the pelvis would be in order...or abdominal/pelvic CT.  Possible diagnosis:  small bowel obstruction...cecal volvus (twisting of the intestine) IBS Inflammatory bowel disease. All the pelvic organ disorders (eg PID, endometriosis, PCOS).   I think the first thing to rule out is a volvulus and can be done so with a CT scan.  Take care and Keep us posted.\n\n",

At the time I didn't think anything of it , passing it off as a bug bite or something. I noticed tonight, it is still there. He says when I touch it, it is not painful but he gets pain around his ear and grabbed at his neck saying he had pain down his neck. He has not been ill recently and like I said it has been there for a couple of months. He has however been extremely moody the past 2 weeks or so. One day he is extremely happy and helpful, and another day he seems almost depressed and uncooperative. (Probably normal for a 4 year old) It is dime sized, relatively firm and does not seem to move.

    "content": "Hello dgonsioroski,  Elevated fevers and WBC's are most commonly associated with bacterial infections rather than something that is viral.  Im sure that your son had a full septic work-up performed, meaning that they collected lots of specimens to check for any bacterial infection. Sometimes,these results are negative initially, but once they are given time to culture and grow, something turns up. Also what can happen (although not so frequent) is that before we collect all the samples we need to test for infections, we give the antibiotic right away. When that happens, we may have started to kill any bacteria that may have turned up in our tests.   I would certainly follow up with a doctor and make sure that the appropriate tests (i.e blood cultures, urine cultures, CSF cultures if applicable) are done, and in the correct manner. Also, be sure to treat that fever. It does become a hazard to have fevers elevated to the degrees he has reached.  Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "This morning my 3yr old son woke up fine as usual about 15min later he told me he had a headache and didn't feel good. Said he was sick and wanted medicine. So, I gave him his morning meds along with some tylenol. He laid and watched tv, which is normal. Didn't say much else. After bout 30min or so he got up and went to play, walked about oh 6ft or so. He stepped onto this little skateboard, bout 2in off ground and next thing I hear is thud and him crying. Skateboard hadn't rolled or anything and our floor is carpeted so didn't think too much of it. Just comforted him. Well, after couple minutes I sat on the couch an he came with me. Laid on me for a bit then tried to get up again. Well, this time I actually saw him walk..He was wobblin all over, could not keep his balance. He has just been falling down all day. After him doing this for a couple hours I finally called his ped. who told me since he was acting otherwise ok and not vomitting to just watch him maybe he has ear infection and next time he complained of headache to ask where, that maybe he said head and meant ear. I know he doesn't have ear infection, and I asked him last time he said headache and he is showing me the back of his head. I can tell he just doesn't \"feel\" good today I just don't know why. I can never get this kid to take a nap and he was out for bout 4 hours on the couch. I don't know if he fell because he was unbalanced or is unbalanced because he fell. But, he didn't fall but couple inches from ground but did fall straight back on his back and head. But, like I mentioned earlier complained of headache prior to this. Doc says I shouldn't worry unless a new symptom occurs, like the vomitting to suggest concussion. I just don't know. I'm just worried about him today. The wobbling has gotten better but is still there a bit just not as bad as earlier. I just would like another opinion to what this possibly could be, is there anything else I should look for to indicate something else other than vomitting.  His health history includes..Systemic Mastocytosis, Eosinophilic Esophagitis, g-tube, bicuspid aortic valve, asthma, GERD, apraxia, develop/speech delays, sensory issues, dysphagia, hypotonia(face/trunk), hypertonia(arms/legs) epilepsy, also possible autonomic disorder, hypoglycemia & mitochondrial disorder(suspected) Too Many allergies and meds to list..

    "title": "Re: Extremely clumsy..just started this morning..",
    "content": "Hello -  Given your son's history of neurological deficits it's not surprising, from a strictly clinical standpoint, that he might have an episode of vertigo or, perhaps, loss of balance due to apraxia. However, two things stand out: one is the fact that this strikes you as unusual. You know your son's normal range of abilities and behaviors probably better than anyone. Also, he seems to be experiencing headache with this. Since he has numerous problems he is going to be more prone to new combinations of symptoms, and is young enough that it's difficult for him to fully articulate to you what's going on. While I can understand his pediatrician's casual approach, given the potential for this sort of thing to happen, on the other hand it concerns me that he doesn't seem to recognize your concern based on a marked change in what's been normal up til now. I think your son should be checked, at least; given an evaluation based on his baseline deficits. He could be suffering a simple viral infection with involvement of one or both  ears, certainly, but even if that's the case there may be something that could be done to minimize the hopefully temporary clumsiness. I'd be aggressive in having him seen if this new symptom continues,  even though he may seem \"otherwise ok.\" I put a great deal of trust in the observations of parents (or others who live daily with patients). These concerns are rarely baseless.   I hope this is helpful to you. I have no specific diagnosis to suggest, but would suspect, at best, a virally mediated vertigo which could be treated symptomatically, but I do feel he should be seen.  Good luck to you and please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  Your son should be evaluated for possible allergic problems, and, yes, the asthma he doesn't have (or may just hasn't had up til now). There is an often fine line between angioneurotic edema of the throat and the allergens which sometimes cause asthma.  He  should also, assuming no allergic cause can be found, have at least an echocardiogram to rule out any possible structural heart disease.  Hopefully this thing never recurs, but as you've already noted, once something has happened, if we don't know what it was there is that off chance it could happen  again. If it happens again at home, please  just dial 9-1-1 so supportive measures are available en route to getting this thing figured out. Hopefully this won't be necessary and he can have the abovementioned workups done at your leisure.  I wouldn't wait too long to have this explored, however. It's  really not a normal event.  Hope this is helpful. Please follow up with us as needed. Best of luck to you both.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello again,  Since these were simply \"routine\" screening labs, I suspect they are actually not particularly significant.  In general, these numbers are more significant when there is an associated issue.  It is likely that your son's iron amounts are actually normal from him.  We base \"normal\" values on a bell curve so a percentage of the population will have normal levels that are outside the normal range even though not abnormal.    I am not particularly knowledgeable about TD-DMPS treatments so I would recommend you discuss this with your son's doctor but I think it unlikely that these numbers would be a contraindication to such treatment.

Just this week he is now starting to heavily complain and advise that he no longer wishes to go to school. He says he doesn't understand and the work is \"so hard\".   My question is, is it possible that he may suffer any long term adverse effects by continuing at school here? For the majority of his day when he is with someone who speaks english I think he does ok, however with spanish only teachers I think he has a hard time communicating or understanding.   This week he was supposed to write a math test, as he did not know what to do he crunched up his paper and did not complete any of it. Please advise. Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, This is certainly not an unusual problem, even in an all-American school.  Sometimes children get frustrated for any number of reasons and do not want to go to school.  I would try to be supportive of him in searching for the issues he is having trouble with and speak to the teachers about how difficult it is for him due to the language barrier.  Encourage them to cut him some slack since he is still so young anyway and won't be in their school system for the rest of his education.  Because of this, perhaps they could modify their expectations.    Talk to your child about his fears and problems to be sure there is not another underlying concern that should be addressed.  If you deal compassionately with him and give credibility to his fears while conveying the importance of continuing to try and giving him confidence that he can do hard things if he doesn't give up.  It's OK if it takes him longer to learn a particular skill or subject.  The important thing is to be persistent and ask for the help he needs from your and/or his teacher.  Barring any really strange problem, abuse or other trauma, keeping him in this school should not have any lasting adverse effect.  As long as he doesn't feel a lot of pressure from you to be able to work beyond his ability and he knows you understand his feelings and that you support his efforts, chances are he will come out of this being much more empowered to tackle hard things in the future.  I would see this as a positive experience in perseverance - as skill that will help him his whole life.    If there is a school psychologist available, it is possible he could receive some help, sometimes through small pull-out social groups or other play activities that are positive and reinforce the fun elements of going to school.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, This may be viral but sometimes bacterial infection takes over with these tots and it can progress to something serious rapidly if bacteria spreads through the blood stream - even into the spinal fluid which can cause meningitis.  It is a good idea to have the child examined for ear infection, strep, pneumonia, etc.  Fever is a sign of infection and it can be difficult to know when it is run-of-the-mill viral respiratory infection and when it is secondary bacterial infection.  You sometimes have to go with your gut feeling.  Never underestimate a parent's ability to \"know\" their child - what is normal for them; what is not.  If you have an uneasy feeling, always check it out with the doctor, especially if the child seems to be getting better, then takes a turn for the worse.    Home remedies include a humidifier in the child's room, acetaminophen or ibuprofen for discomfort and fever (never aspirin) and saline nose drops to help loosen secretions.  Lots of fluids are important to replace what is lost through sneezing, coughing and nasal discharge.   Best wishes.\n\n",

After the fact, I went online to research it and there's so much out on the internet about recent research that says the vaccine can be secreted through breastmilk and concerns about autism and nursing mothers getting the MMR vaccine.

    "title": "Re: MMR Vaccine and Breastfeeding",
    "content": "Hello SSCHAI,  This is a good question.  The internet is full of information regarding the MMR and autism.  The problem is that most of the people posting this information have a misunderstanding of the actual science regarding the issue.  When looking at the link between the MMR and autism, there is a claim that the MMR is associated with autism due to a component of the vaccine called thimerosal (a mercury based preservative).  There was a very publicized study showing a significant increase in autism following the MMR.  This study almost single handedly pushed this issue into the spotlight.  What was not discussed, however, was that the people doing the study were extremely biased and it was in their favor to have the study show an association. So, this study can essentially be discounted.  Countless other studies have tried to reproduce their results and have consistently shown to link between the vaccine and autism.  As a safeguard, even with the studies showing no association, the FDA has removed thimerosal from essentially every vaccine at this point (the exception being the multidose flu vaccine vials).    As a pediatrician, I would have no concerns about a mother breastfeeding after receiving the MMR vaccine.  The amount that actually gets into the breastmilk is probably not significant and the risk of the baby being exposed the vaccine is low.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Viral exanthem (rash)...how long can this go on?",
    "content": "On Friday afternoon, September 12, I received a call from my son's daycare provider that he had a fever of 102.3.  He is 10 months old.  On Saturday morning, I took him to the clinic at our pediatrician's office and we saw his regular pediatrician.  He was diagnosed with a viral throat infection.  On Monday, I noticed some rash on his bottom and thought his eczema might be starting to flare up, so I put a little 1% hydro-cortisone cream on the rash and didn't think any more of it.  I took him back to daycare on Tuesday and received a call from the daycare and was notified that he had a rash.  So I went over and looked at it and sure enough he had broken out in a raised rash all over his trunk and back.    We had an appointment with his pediatric GI on Wednesday morning (he takes prevacid for acid reflux) and so I called her nurse to see if they could evaluate his rash and they said that they would do it at the appointment.  His GI asked me a few questions like had he had a fever or virus in the last few days and I told her that he had.  She said it looked like a viral exanthem and said that it would go away once the virus had run its course.    The next morning it had gotten worse, so I called the after hours nurse-line to see if he was contagious and after describing the rash, she told me that I should bring him in to the walk-in clinic at the pediatrician's office to make sure it's not scarletina.  So he was seen by another doctor (not his regular pediatrician) and she confirmed the GI's diagnosis and said it was indeed a viral rash.  She also noted 2 blisters on his throat.  Again, the instructions were to ride it out.  But me being the worrisome mother, took him back on Saturday again because of the rash getting continually worse and a new symptom had appeared...gagging on his baby food.  He saw his regular pediatrician again and he said again that it was viral and that it could last another week.  He said that his throat did look much better than it did a week ago and that the two blisters were still there, but they could last several more days.  He didn't seem worried at all.  This rash is BAD.  And while he's not gagging on vegetables anymore....He cries on fruit.  Maybe the acid is burning the rash or the blisters inside his throat???? Who knows...But I'm starting to go crazy here...The rash has also spread upward to his face and around his eyes.  It's red and raised all over his body down to the tops of his feet and arms....his bottom is bright red and looks worse because of the heat and moisture in his diaper....but he doesn't seem to itch.  He's just not his usual laid back self.  I'm wondering how much longer can this go on?  I didn't think a virus could last this long...and the blisters in his throat have been over a week...and the rash seems to be not getting any better at this point and it's been 7 days.  How long can these things last?    I would also like to know what distinguishes a viral rash from a strep rash like scarletina...and how can you tell by looking at a throat that it's a virus rather than strep throat (although I know strep is RARE in children under 3)....A swab has never been ordered for him, so I'm wondering what makes a doctor so sure...  I love his pediatrician....he's been wonderful to us.  I guess I would just like these questions answered because I always think of other things after we have left the office...go figure.  I haven't changed or added anything to his diet, nor have I changed detergents...The daycare has not done anything different either...  Thanks for taking the time to answer and read this long post....\n\n",

    "content": "Hello KYMommaOf2,  First, you are not the first, nor will you be the last parent to continue to worry after the doctor has said something is OK.  If you didn't do this at least a little you wouldn't be a parent.    Regarding your son's rash, I'll answer your second question first.  Scarlet fever (or scarletina) is a rash caused by an infection with a bacteria called streptococcus.  The rash is often very light and has a sandpaper like feel to it.  Often times you can feel the rash more than you can see it.  What you are describing does not sound to me like a scarlet fever rash.  Viral exanthems are quite variable in their presentation.  Some can last only for a few days (or even hours).  Others can persist for several weeks.  They may or may not be itchy.  They can look quite disturbing at times.  Generally, as long as as the child is otherwise OK, we just wait them out.  If it is persisting for more than a few weeks it is probably a good idea to have it reevaluated to be sure everything is still OK.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, This could all be related to the anemia and it is important you get a complete workup with your doctor to find out if you have any underlying problems that have not been picked up.  The doctor will likely start you on iron supplements but you would be wise to immediately increase your intake of iron-rich foods.    A few are:  Cream of wheat and other whole grains, red meats (other meats also), red kidney beans, pinto beans, lentils, spinach, peas, apricots, raisins, molasses.  Heme iron is the most readily absorbed by the body and this comes from animal sources - egg yolk and meats.  And, when you eat any of the good iron foods, it will help absorption if you will take vitamin C-rich foods at the same time (fruits, orange juice, tomatoes, etc.).    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi ,  I'm a mother of two , and my youngest is turning two in February. Right now , she has these symptoms, fever off and on , redness around eyes, can't sleep, sometimes hard stools, and whinning. She's always been a good baby never whines about anything so that and the symptoms is causing concern . She's experienced these symptoms three times now , the first time I took her to the E.R they said it was a viral infection and perscribed amoxilcillan, she was itching at one of her ears so they also perscribed ear drops for her, all though they didn't see an infection at all but they perscibed the drops anyways for a numbing solution just in case an infection was starting. The second time she went to the doctor they said the same thing and pretty much perscribed the same medicines. My youngest has only had two sets of shots , the shots she got at the hospital when she was born and then the first set of shots afterwards, her body did not react well to them , so her father and I did some research because our oldest daughter did fine with shots. So we continued our research and found that the immunization shots can cause such problems as Autism and loss of hearing and it occurs in 1 out of every 150 children and it is up to the parents if they want to risk that so we of course decided against immunization shots. I asked the doctor the first time these symptoms occuried if this could be why , the doctor said that had nothing to do with it , that it was just a common viral infection. I do not have the money to bounce around doctor after doctor trying to figure out why my daughter is expirencing these problems all I know is she and I both need sleep and I feel horriable I can't help my own child. I know this is not alot to work with in finding an answer but these few little symtoms are all she has. To add to this she interacts fine with her older sister and learning , sometimes these problems only happen at night , barely through the day only so often, but when these symptoms occur they last for sometimes 3 weeks. Please answer if you have any knowledge of what this could be.  Sincerely, WorriedMotherof2\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Was your little one experiencing these symptoms (fever, irritability, whining...) around the time that she was vaccinated?  If so, then I would not be overly concerned at this time. Your pediatrician may have advised you already, but in many cases, children will experience low grade fevers and a little bit of irritability during their vaccination period. This is a very normal occurrence, and most often just a dose of Tylenol or Motrin (if they are old enough) prior and post the vaccine can help with the fever and comfort.   There are some vaccines that are \"live\", very basically meaning that the immunization is made with some of the actual organism itself. But! Not to worry, it is completely deactivated and non-infective. Because we sometimes use these \"live\" vaccines (which I like to think of it as a \"dead version of the bug\" :), it still can cause a very mild reaction, as if we were coming down with something. Similar to how some people react to the flu vaccine.  I always recommend that you follow up with your pediatrician. If fever persists, or she is inconsolable, or even any general worsening of symptoms, see a doctor.  There is never any harm in being safe!  Good luck Mommy :)\n\n",

Of course you should discuss it with the child's pediatrician but I would not consider this an emergency situation by any means.  You do not have to worry about skin suffocating the penis or any other problem from that.  The skin is loose in the flaccid state and it allows the changing penis shape that occurs with erection.  Nothing special needs to be done.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  The list of lab tests is pretty exhaustive, and normally should expose the culprit agent. If C's doctors seem to carry a prejudice in favor of CFS this could possibly blur the distinction between that (a controversial finding) and Epstein-Barr virus, which is being looked for in the tests. One might hope EBV actually does come up positive, as it is a manageable, if sometimes difficult, infection which can go into long-term or even more or less permanent remission.  The one thing I think perhaps should be looked for is T-cell immunodeficiency, which can be part of an odd cycle of undernutrition leading to T-cell disability, increased vulnerability to infections, etc., cyclically. This is rare in the United States but not unheard of. What might seem improbable about it (and may well be) is the potential for undernutrition in an otherwise healthy American child. However, there is sometimes a heritable defect causing some other relatively minor problem which can lead into this cycle of undernutrition (such as colitis or celiac disease: The former should be ruled out by ANA testing; there is a specific test for the latter).   While celiac disease, by itself, wouldn't fit the profile of relapsing chronic viral disease, it could be an underlying cause and should be ruled out so long as all a lot of testing is being done now anyway. This would also be a relatively simple-to-manage problem, and while it is a long shot, most everything else is being covered.   Once you've received the results of the labs listed (a pretty exhaustive battery), we can look at the results and, if there is something which jumps out, that can be addressed. If not, I can refer this matter to the appropriate diagnostic team for further study here. First, though, let's see if this comprehensive battery of tests shows up something (it's not going to give anyone a result of CFS, which would be a default or \"we don't really know\" diagnosis). It would seem very odd for someone as young as C to have profound CFS symptoms, and the fevers and certain other symptoms just don't fit that. They do fit both EBV and a few other viral illnesses, as well as several immune-compromising ones that these tests should expose (if any are present).   Best of luck to you. I wish there were more I could suggest, but the important thing now is to see what the long list of labs yields first. Again, T-cells and celiac are the only two things I don't see covered directly in the list. These would be long reaches, but if nothing else comes up these could and should be covered.  Best of luck to you and to C with this ordeal. Hopefully soon you'll have an answer. Please update us when you do.\n\n",

    "content": "My son is now 4 but he has been anything but easy to take care of. When he was a baby he had Jaundice so bad his skin was orange but nothing was ever done for it. He also had horrible colic for the first year of his life. When his grandfather would hold him he would turn his head to the left mostly and refused to look at him at all. When anyone else held him he prefred to look around instead of at faces but he would at times make eye contact especialy with me. He skiped crawling he prefered to roll and then started walking at 1. His language skills were delayed, he prefered to use his own language and his understanding wasnt the best. Now he talkes well enough but I think there might be some delay still. He's smart he can read some and he loves to say his numbers and ABC's. Teaching him is not easy though because he cant sit still for long, and his attention is always drifting. I've noticed that he has a hard time holding a pencil correctly and preferes to hold it in a fist. Also since he was 3years he started tip toeing off and on and now its something he does constantly. When we ask him to walk flat feet he does for a few seconds but obviously preferes tip toeing. He is not fully potty trained, he has bad days where he can never make it to the bathroom on time. When he is having too much fun doing something he will not go to the bathroom at all. He refuses to have a BM on the potty, but instead will take it out of his pants and place it into the potty. He is stuborn, willfully disobediant. Tests the boundarys of every rule every time all the time especialy when he isnt home. At home he is more behaved. He loves to play with other children, when he sees kids walking down the street he races off to follow them home. As he gets older he seems to be more and more behaved, listens better, goes to time out without being dragged. Yet he is still super HYPER, bouncing off walls. He has night terrors. talks in his sleep very loudly, thrashes at times. His father does the same things. For the last 2 years my father has been saying my son is autistic, strangers say he acts autistic. I've resurched autisum and its true he had a language delay and he tip toes but he talks very well now and his understanding is miles better than what it was. I'm thinking the delay might be my fault because he is the first born and I'm not much of a talker, since he started watching tv in the mornings his understanding and talking have improved ton's. I think he is more ADHD, my husband and I were both diagnosed with that when we were young. My son is a sweet lovable boy, who loves people and calls everyone his friend. I'm being pushed by family to get him treated for autism, but I don't think he is, and neither does my family doctor. What can I do?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Autism or ADHD ?",
    "content": "Hello, I can certainly empathize with your frustration.  Parenting is hard work and not an exact science.    What makes it difficult to diagnose disorders such as ADHD and autism is that almost all the characteristics of the disorders can also be seen in neurotypical children.  It takes a trained observer to get a good handle on this.    With autism, there is a broad spectrum of autistic disorders.  In other words, you can be \"a little autistic\" or \"severely autistic\" and everywhere in between.    With ADHD, there is a timing issue.  At age four and five your son's behavior is actually quite typical.  I have seen children who appeared by all accounts to be very hyper and I suspected ADHD, only to have them enter kindergarten and have the teacher say, \"this child is no worse than the others.\"  So, at this age, you can expect a log of hyper behavior, difficulty sitting still, concentrating, staying on task and yes, even potty training and responding to adult expectations.  For this reason, an actual diagnosis and treatment is usually delayed until the child is older.  When in a few more years the child is standing out as quite different from his peers, they begin to think ADHD.  Until then, it's kind of a stab in the dark.  Normal behavior also runs the gamut.  Some children are more obedient and less obstinate or rebellious.  Your child's personality has a lot to do with his behavior and you have to love the energy exhibited.  Potty training can take quite a while.  The fact that your child is aware and takes his stool to the toilet indicates good cognitive ability and it will probably be just a matter of time.  Try to be patient and not draw too much attention to the behavior as this will reinforce it.  Reward the times he does it right (only).  Negative attention is still attention so try to extinguish the negative behavior by letting it die of starvation (for attention).  You may have some type of local service for preschool children where your son could be evaluated.  This might be in conjunction with the school district or local health department if you are in the U.S.  A trained professional might be able to identify behaviors that are consistent with autistic spectrum disorders and could suggest intervention if needed.  You might also read some books on how to deal with autistic children because the skills are similar to what you would use with all children to encourage good behavior.  If he does have Autism or Asperger's Syndrome, early intervention and education can help him to achieve.  If he does not, there is little to be lost in learning parenting skills.  Liane Holliday Willey has written some good books about Asperger's Syndrome, which is on the high functioning end of the autism spectrum.  It is not so important to get a label right now as it is to find ways to help your child.  Some services need a diagnosis so it can be helpful and knowing what you are dealing with can help you to learn what you need as well.  To complicate things further, a child with Asperger's, for instance, can also have ADHD.    Elizabeth Pantley has written some excellent books on parenting in general that might help with some of your issues, including \"No Cry Discipline Solution\" and \"No Cry Potty Training.\"  You might also enjoy receiving an email newsletter about autism.  There is a good specialist who does a weekly newsletter at http://conversationwithemily.blogspot.com/ and you might find this helpful as you work through the maze.    No matter what your child may be labeled with, remember that he is unique and both ADHD and Autism come with gifts as well as challenges.  Find the good and the brilliant that is your child.  Every child thrives on love so give plenty!  Good luck.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "thank you so very much for taking the time to answer. I just have something to add. My son is in a class or school of sorts but it only meets once a week for 2 hours. I have peeked into his class and I've seen that he doesnt usualy sit, he makes lots of noise, he doesnt like to focus on what is being taught but would rather play. He gets taken out of his class  for a time out just about every week for his disruptive behavior. Now there are days where he is really good but even then he has a hard time listening and sitting still. I'm worried that when he starts school he will be unable to learn because he cant focus or sit still! I do not want to put him on meds. I remember what happened to me when I was little, because I could not focus I was put into a dev. challenged class where the teacher thought it was ok to abuse the kids because they couldnt say anything or whatever her exuse was it wasnt right. I didnt stay in that class for very long because I wasnt delayed I was just ADHD... I was then put on meds that seemed to suck the life out of me. I lost all interest in friends and would rather be alone. I believe I was depressed, and even after they took me off the meds the damage was done and instead of being outgoing and full of energy I was withdrawn and prefered to be alone. I don't want to put my son on meds so I was hopeing that there were some tips or something I could do to help him with his hyper behavior and inablitity to sit still problems? He's a good boy and I don't want him to go though the same painful childhood I had...I will even home school him if that is what it takes! But I would rather he could go to school to make friends because he loves to play with other kids.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Again, he is still very young to be overly concerned.  Some children do have difficulties with behavior and time alone helps.  Kindergarten teachers don't expect all the children to sit still for long periods of time  - it is not developmentally appropriate to do so.    As for meds - if it reaches that point, they do have many more options now than they did in the past and if he actually needs them, there is likely to be something that won't have the negative effects you experienced.  Also, they do not cause permanent, long-term damage.  This is one of the advantages to treating ADHD.  The meds either work or they don't and you can find out very quickly which it is.    This is such a growing problem that professionals are also much better able to handle the condition than in the past which children were labeled troublemakers and disrupters.  Educators are taught how to better handle these variations in the classroom.  I would also recommend a therapist if needed to help self-esteem issues.    Good luck.\n\n",

I had a daycare so i knew that she was not like any of the other children.  Finally at age 4 they diagnosed her, only because she ran out in the street adn was hit by a truck.  She never sat still, bounced off the walls, did that tiptoeing things always.  It got to where I was afraid of her when  she got to close to me, I was afraid of her actions, she was so wild, I didnt know what to expect one moment to the next.  I developed anxiety because of her hyperness.  I totally understand and sympathize.  If you have any questions I would be more than happy to answer them for you.  I am not a docotr or nurse, just a parent who is dealing with an ADHD child.\n\n",

    "content": "The abnormal behavior you described would be classified as a \"parasomnia,\" a term which broken down could be translated as \"beside (normal) sleep.\"  The episodes you describe may well be night terrors.  Events such as this are most common in children; fortunately for you and the child, these episodes are usually outgrown.  The best thing to do in such a case is simply to gently direct the child to a safe environment--back to his or her bed or into yours--and ensure that no harm is inadvertently realized upon the child by the behavior.  If the child is awakened, confused or even combative behavior may be displayed, and so awakening the child is unadvised.    However, it is also important to note that other conditions may be present; while this forum may be informative, it is no subsitute for direct consultation.  If uncoordinated tensing of the muscles or urination occurs with these eposodes, a nocturnal seizure disorder might also be suspected.    In all likelohood, it is most likely that this is a run-of-the-mill parasomnia (insomuch as they are so); however, if you do notice any particularly disturbing symptomatlogy (aside from the screaming, movement) such as difficulty breathing, for example, it would be best to seek medical attention.    One further note:  daytime and nighttime are related, and some claim that this realtionship is quite strong.  Hence, some might also suggest that any stressors or frustrations in the child's like be addressed; though this one is too young for individual psychotherapies, it is most commonly focused on the parents and the environment anyways.  This is another point worth considering in your approach to dealing with these episodes; it may be more or less applicable.\n\n",

    "content": "I have two son's ages 12 and 13, and two nephews the same age. I noticed that they were all coming home from school appearing quite desperate, and when I asked them about it they said that they didn't like going at school because of several fights that happened in the school bathrooms. I thought that  it would subside with time, but even now that they have started basketball season and are gone for the best part of 12 hours, they still come home having not peed all day at school.   Recently I had all four of them out for the day, and after being gone all day, the two older ones appeared quite uncomfortable. I asked them, and they all said they hadn't gone all day \"because they didn't want to use the bathrooms.\"  I have tried talking to them about besides being uncomfortable, it's not healthy to force your body to hold it in that long. Can it all be attributed to the fact that boys become very modest as they enter adolescene? How concerned should I be? Will they eventually grow tired of the discomfort and take it upon themselves to use the available facilities instead of forcing their bodies to hold it? I don't want to constantly bug them about it and embarras them, but I don't want them to cause any harm to themselves either.\n\n",

They may be reluctant to talk about the actual reason but sometimes a therapist can get them to open up in a safe environment.  You might also check with the school to see if there have been any other concerns relating to reluctance to use the facilities.  Pre-adolescence and beyond can be a very sensitive time for children but usually they adjust to the public restrooms.  You could also discuss this with the pediatrician for ideas.

My question is a few days ago his neuro was doing his little check up and said aloud, \"Wow, you really do have a murmur don't you.\" So, I'm wondering is this something I should be concerned about. Does it warrant a call to cardio who told me didn't need to see him for 2 yrs when he was dx'd. I just wondered is it possible that his condition is worsening or since this is something thats usually found with his defect, should I just wait it out. I Just don't want to miss something.

Since this is a change from the status quo, I would just call the cardiologist and inform him of the neurologist's observation. It may not mean anything, since your boy is growing and that can make things sound different periodically, but when there is an anomaly and changes are associated with it, it's usually best to have this documented. I doubt it means anything functionally, but it's still better safe than sorry. Besides, just as a standard practice, all changes in the status quo should be documented to avoid errors or confusion later on.   I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you.

You might try calling your local health department to see what services might be available.  If you have a landlord, it would be their responsibility to fix the problem.  If you are a homeowner, you may should investigate the problem.    Sometimes, if it is mold and you are renting, the only solution is to move to another place.  Businesses that do disaster cleanup do specialize in treating mold properly.  I would follow up.  I can't say if this is the cause of your baby's problems -  he could have asthma or some other chronic condition.  Continue with your baby's doctor for proper follow up.  Best wishes.\n\n",

On the way she started her period for the 6th time in 9 months.  Stayed overnight, xray still showed most of the contrast in her bowels from ct.  They cleaned her out and sent her home saying it was combination of menstral pain (never had before) and a possible virus.  Three days latter, back in Dr. office.  Still in constant pain in low abdomen and back, Tylenol and Ibuprofen no help.  Sent for surgical consult.  Sent for 2nd Ct scan after exam, all normal.  One week latter still in constant pain but now with small swelling to right of navel.  Sent to GYN, had pelvic ultrasound, found a few small simple cysts (largest 1.8 cm) but no cause for pain.  Was given BC Pills for when she starts her period again to stop ovolation and production of cysts.  Daughter refuses to use and I back her up.  Main concern of hers is the possibility of stunting growth and other side effects.  Next week back at Dr. office with distended abdomen and pain worse, waking her up many times at night but only constant ache, pain level 6 to 8, no sharp pains.  Very tender abdomen and back. Urine still negative. Refered to Ped. Gastro Dr., seen her last week.  Took xray and she is all backed up with feces again only this time worse.  Told that this was the cause of all her pain and when she gets cleaned out, pain will go away.  She is now cleaned out, couldn't possibly have anything left in her with four days of miralax, senna-gen, Mollasses and Milk enemas 2X's pd and oral saline laxitives.  Abdomen no longer distended, only small swelling to right of navel but no mass.  Still complaining of constant ache in low abdomen in 4 spots, just above pubic bone, to the right and left of that, and to right of navel where swelling is and still aching in back.  Pain level 7.  Sorry this is so long.  My daughter is unable to function like an 11 yr old should.  Can't run, jump, play, makes pain worse.  Has been going to school, but has been unable to play BB with team for past 7 weeks and is fatiged, tired of the pain, tired of drs., frustrated that no one can help her get rid of pain. She doesn't see the Ped. Gastro. Dr. again for 3 more weeks.  I hate to see her suffer anymore but don't know what to do.  Does anyone have any insight as to what this could be?  How I can help her?\n\n",

    "content": "My daughter is 14 and has a very similar situation. This has been going on for years. Her back pain started when she was 7. Her stomach pain started a year or so after that. She does appear to have kyphoidosis, a curvature of her spine that gives her an \"s\" shaped posture on profile.  She has had upper and lower endoscopy, CT and ultrasounds of the abdomen and pelvis. MRI of the pituitary was normal. Countless blood and urine tests. She does have a polyp in her left sphenoid sinus. Still no answers except that we should send her to a three week pain clinic.  She has been on birth control pills for five months. She still has the pain and a persistent cyst on her right ovary. She is so fatigued now we had to withdraw her from school because she cannot walk to classes. With only mild exertion, she develops a cough. She does not have asthma, at least, not as far as any inflammation of the lungs. They say she \"may\" have some type of smooth muscle issue that affects her bronchioles.  She has three times had an elevated TSH and high to high normal calcicum levels, although PTH screens of the parathyroid were normal. She has insulin resistance, but the endocrinologist has assured us that this would not account for the extreme fatigue and weakness she is experiencing. Insulin does not really seem to help lower her blood sugar levels. We've had her on and off and either way, her high blood sugar seems to correspond with these pain episodes.  She has some redness of the antrum of her stomach. The gastroenterologist suggested it \"might\" be irritable bowel. She does not have problems with gas or cramping, just a localized area of epigastric pain just about her navel. Sometimes it is so severe it wakes her.   I am so sorry to learn of your daughter's trouble. I know how desperate you feel because I am dealing with the same fears. I am hopeful that by posting here someone may have an idea on what to do. They have tested her for autoimmune issues, carcinoid and a plethora of other things. I am wondering if she should have some type of neurological workup or a CT of her spinal column?  Please let me know if you are successful in finding any resolution to your daughter's symptoms.\n\n",

The doctor treated it with eye drops ( polymixin and gentamiicin).  my doctor said she is not old enough to have antibiotics yet.  My question is WHY cant she have antbiotics to kill the virus? and WHEN will she be old enough to have them.   My second question is she had what looked like a pimple on her ear a month after she was diagnosed, so I called the DR and she advised me to put the cream mupirocin on it to be safe than sorry. Im wondering if every time I see what looks like a pimple should I just put this cream on it?   Thank you for your time. Michelle\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Antibiotic resistance is one of the greatest concerns of our day.  While we have excellent antibiotics available now, the fact that for many years they were overprescribed and used incorrectly resulted in superinfections that do not respond to antibiotics.  In defense of the prescribing doctors, we did not know in the 50s, 60s and even 70s that this might happen.  We thought we had found the miracle cure for everything and so every time someone became ill they ran to the doctor who scribbled out a prescription.  Thus, we came to believe that was the accepted cure for everything.  When a virus is treated with an antibiotic, it does no good since they don't work on viruses.  We have to rely on our own body's antibody production to cure the illness.  If we take antibiotics for viral illness and then get better, chances are it was just our own body healing in spite of the antibiotic.  But the risk taken here is our body's germs become conditioned to the antibiotic (especially if we stop taking them too soon and the bugs grow stronger) and down the road they will not work for us even on a bacteria that should be susceptible.  For this reason doctors are more cautious about prescribing antibiotics unless there is confirmed bacterial infection.  By doing this, we can protect the usefulness of our medications.  I can't explain your doctor's reasoning about your child's age since even infants receive antibiotics when they are needed.  Perhaps there was a misunderstanding as to the reason for the treatment.    For the reasons above I would NOT recommend using a medicated cream whenever your child gets a pimple.  Let her immune system do its job and realize that these things are a normal part of her growth and development.  Persistent problems, fever, etc. should be checked with the doctor.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Even though there are many different types of childhood cancer, cancer is considered to be rare in children. For example, in the United States there are only about 150 cases of childhood cancer for every 1 million children.  The fact that your child has swollen glands doesn't mean that he has an illness; just that your child's immune system is at work.  Most of the time it is not cause for alarm and as your child has colds and other infections (even an ingrown toenail can cause a swollen gland) these will come and go.  Many times you will not be able to detect illness.  Even the gland itself can become infected and will usually subside on its own.  Usually a gland can be moved a bit and is fairly soft.    Whenever you are in doubt, discuss it with your pediatrician at your child's next visit or sooner if other symptoms develop.  Raising children does bring worry.  Try to relax and enjoy your child but it never hurts to follow your instincts about illness and behavior that is unusual for your child.  That's what the doctor is for.  Take care.\n\n",

It could be normal coloration variation since it doesn't seem to be bothering him but you would have to have the doctor look at it to be sure.  If there was a bite or something it seems logical there would be other symptoms - pain, swelling, and if there was an injury causing an actual bruise, it would change color as it heals and then disappear.  Perhaps it is a birth mark of some sort or mole?  Again, see your doctor to be sure.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "My 2.5 yo has fevers every 3 weeks.  The fevers range from  101 degrees to 104 degrees.  They started when he was six months old.  They happened a lot but we never really kept track of them because he was in day care and we kind of brushed it off as being around others kids that were always sick.  I quit work to stay at home last October and I started to keep track of them.  They came evey 3 weeks and he would be miserable.  I would take hime into the doctor and they would test him for strep and then give him and antibiotics because it would come back positive.  In June, we took him in again and they ran and ESR and Lymes test and the Lymes came back negative but the ESR came back as high.  So to be on the safe side they treated him for Lymes but before he was able to finish his dosage he had another fever.  I took him back again and our doctor suggested that we take him to and ENT because he felt that it was time to get his tonsils out.  Before we went he wanted to run more blood test to make sure that he didn't have some other kind of diesease.  They ran the ESR, Lymes, and a CBC.  The lymes came back as negative.  The ESR came back as high again and the lypocyte count came back as eleveted also.  When we went to the ENT she basically wrote off all our worries about him needing his tonsils out because it is not possible for a child to get strep at 6 months old.  And even though his tonsils are large and he snores at night, since he doesn't stop breathing at night then we shouldn't worry about his tonsils.  Instead she said that she thought that it had something to do with his ears.  We told her that he only had been treated for ear infection once and that was only because they couldn't find anything else that it could be.  I didn't really feel like she took the time to really listen to me and tomorrow we are going to talk to another doctor to see what he thinks.  I am just wondering what you thought that it could be and if you had any suggestions as to what it could be.  I want to make sure that I am not jumping to surgery as a quick fix.  What happens if he gets the surgery and then still has the fevers.  I need help I don't know what to do.  Thanks for any input that you can offer. wisconsinmomof2 p.s.- he has an older sister that is never sick except for once a year when she gets the common cold\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It never hurts to get a second opinion, especially when surgery is involved.  It is possible that a tonsillectomy (and adenoidectomy) will take care of the problem and if they are enlarged this is probably a good course.  If he is snoring, chances are the tonsils are a problem even if they are not the only thing going on.  But, the fact they have checked for other conditions as well is reassuring.  There is no way to tell in advance if this will definitely cure him.  Sometimes you have to take a leap of faith if you feel good about the doctor's care.    I'm glad you are seeing another doctor, if only to make you more comfortable with the diagnosis.    Best wishes.\n\n",

It can be handled very matter-of-factly along with all the other body systems and if no undo attention is put on it, he is likely to not be \"traumatized\" at all, but will recognize this is just part of his overall exam to be sure he is well and healthy.  Talk to him about the doctor just wanting to check everything out to be sure all is well.  It would require an exam to determine if this is anything of concern, but I do feel it is important to treat it the same as all other body parts.  It is likely just normal anatomy but only an exam can tell you for sure.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  While usually this sort of presentation and symptoms wouldn't be of too much concern, the fact that your daughter has lost 2 kilos and runs a risk also of dehydration causes some concern. She almost certainly has a gastrointestinal infection, and the question remains as to whether it is viral (treat the symptoms and supportive care til it runs its course) or bacterial (aggressive treatment with antibiotics, plus fluid replacement). The blood and stool tests should identify the type of infection and guide treatment. In the meantime she must remain properly hydrated with fluids, preferably those which contain electrolytes to replace those lost due to the very frequent diarrhea. This is of critical importance.  I hope this answers your concerns. Please keep us updated here.\n\n",

I thought i noticed her stool was slightly more softer and a shade lighter than. so got a stool test done. The stool was pale yellow and acidic. Except for the presence of starch granules all other parameters are normal. What does the presence of starch granules indicate? Hopfully its not an indication of some malfunction of some part of digestive system.  Some light on this will be assuring.  Thanks in advance\n\n",

    "content": "My 2.5yr daughter has only just started saying single words eg. mummy, shoes, up etc.  Previously it would appear that we had to call her several times before she would turn around and look at us. Her teachers at daycare say that she does not respond to instructions or when they are talking to her. She screams when my husband coughs really loud + when other children or adults talk to her expecting a response, she screams at them.  She is otherwise a very bright child - in fact she has an above average ability when it comes to music. She will sing along with songs, trying to say the words, She can learn a tune very quickly and has even started singing the tunes to hymns spontaneously.  Only this weekend I' ve noticed her babbling becoming more frequent - it sounds like Chinese. There are the few words sprinkled inbetween. She likes to read this one book about colours and will point out the colours and will repeat the colour easily after you have said it first.  Just this week her paed advised that her tonsils and adenoids were enlarged - she has been snoring, breathing through her mouth and been choking on a post-nasal drip for as long as we can remember. He advised that it would be best to remove them to make her more comfortable.  Will this help with her speech development and has it contributed the delay in any way. Also, she did go to an Afrikaans daymother from 5mnths-2yrs of age where they spoke mainly Afrikaans during the day - perhaps this may have had an impact on her speech?  She is otherwise a very bright and intelligent child and amazes us every day with her learning and playing.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Melani -  Your child's \"delayed\" speech is still within normal parameters, but at the far side of normal.  Your description of her problems suggests a possible hearing impairment.  Chronic tonsilitis could certainly contribute to a hearing deficit.  Her screaming responses may be frustration at being unable to hear or understand.  Her time spent with persons speaking Afrikaans could certainly complicate your child's speech development.  Children typically learn languages easily while very young; if no one in your household speaks Afrikaans, it could confuse your child.  She very likely uses some Afrikaans in her speaking efforts.  A second opinion regarding removal of her tonsils and adenoids would be ideal, as well as a hearing evaluation.  You might enjoy knowing that a recent small study concluded that children who are late speakers may have larger than usual cerebral cortex and higher IQs.    I hope the treatment that you pursue will address all of your questions.  Faye, RN, MSW\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Two year-olds are definitely exploring their world and discovering their independence from mom so it can be hard to tell.  I would recommend an evaluation by a child psychiatrist or therapist to see if there is something deeper going on.  If you have an early intervention program in your community this might be a good place to start for an evaluation.  Or sometimes there are psychologists through the school district or local health department that might to this.  I would also recommend a book on child development and toddlers such as What to Expect in the Toddler Years or something by Elizabeth Pantley.  She really understands small children and their behavior.    This is exasperating but remember your toddler is not doing this on purpose so punishment is not only ineffective but the child's development does not allow him to associate punishment with the behavior so it can become just abusive and hurtful psychologically.  Child development experts, your pediatrician and other health care providers might be able to help.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "My 2 year old little girl has red spots all over her.  She has eczema but this is not like her breakouts, which she hasn't really had in a while.  These spots are red circles, not bumps.  Her doctor seems to think they are flea bites but no one else in the house has them and I have not seen any fleas in our house.  She is constantly scratching.  I really don't think they are any kind of bite because they are not raised.  They are mostly on her torso and some on her legs.  She hasn't had any fever and seems to feel fine, other than the scratching.  When her eczema breaks out (which it doesn't that often) it feels like bumps and dry patches so I don't think that this is related to that.  I'm just curious if maybe it is an allergic reaction or some kind of skin problem other than the eczema.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Eczema can present differently at times so you may not rule this out altogether.  Try using a thick moisturizing cream like Cetaphyl or Eucerin - the cream in a jar; not the lotion.  Apply this a couple of times daily and avoid soap.  You can use Lubriderm or Cetaphyl cleanser instead.  Are there any white centers to the red rings?  If so  it could be ringworm, which is not actually a worm at all, but a fungus which can be treated with antifungal medication over the counter.  Scabies is another condition that causes an itchy rash, but usually this is raised and often noticed between the fingers.  It is caused by a mite and is transferred person to person.    If you don't get relief, you may need to see a dermatologist when the rash is present so it can be diagnosed properly.  If you establish yourself as a patient with a dermatologist, they will usually work you in on short notice when you need to present at a particular time, such as when the rash appears.  Best wishes.\n\n",

It's difficult to know for certain if an actual break or displacement has taken place without an exam and/or x-ray, and it's well worth the trouble, especially if there is  swelling or discoloration extending over into the area of an  eye. A doctor can determine if treatment is needed, and this could range from some home care advice to adjusting a displacement or adjusting and bracing a bend or break.   Hope this is helpful.

    "content": "Hello Black,  This is a very common issue (the part about doctors being stumped by an isolated elevated alkaline phosphatase).  Without examining your child I cannot definitively say but I suspect what is going on is a condition called benign transient hyper alkaline phosphatasia, also known as benign transient hyperphosphatasemia.  To translate this name, this condition is where the alkaline phosphatase level goes up into the thousands for an unknown reason but is not associated with any significant issues.  It typically will come back down with time.  Bone x-rays, and really all other tests, should be normal.  Before having the CT done, you may want to talk with your child's doctor about this condition.  Your daughter is in the classic age range for this condition (toddlers often have it).     We often call this a \"Ulysses syndrome\" because upon finding the elevated alk. phos. level, the doctor sets off on a wild goose chase trying to find a reason for it but are unable to find one.    I hope this helps.  Keep us updated.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "My friend has a 9 year old daughter who just started her period.  I did some research and have found other cases where very young girls have started as well so that is not so much the issue.  The reason why they are so worried about her is because 1 year ago she was in an accident in which she fell and bruised her private areas very badly.  She has told her parents that it burns sometimes when she pees but the doctors cannot find any signs of infection.  The doctor did say that she is still bruised from the accident.  They are worried that something more serious might be wrong with her since she is still bruised, it burns when she pees and she has started her period at a very young age.   Is this something to be worried about and should they take her to a different doctor?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, More and more younger girls are starting their periods earlier these days.  It is thought that there are environmental factors where estrogen is affected.  We do know there are contaminants in the environment that can have this affect so it is logical this could be at least part of the cause.  This is not something to worry about but the pain on urination should be checked thoroughly for infection or anatomic defect.  It might warrant a visit with a urologist if the regular doctor can't determine a cause.  It seems unlikely she would still have bruising pain after a year.  Best wishes.\n\n",

The route of exposure here is blood and deep body fluid exchange as with needle sharing or accidental punctures.  It can also be transmitted sexually.

In some there could be lingering weakness even when the paralysis has gone.  Rarely it can be permanent.

Concentrate on just loving and enjoying your baby.  I am glad she is getting the therapy to help.  Best wishes.\n\n",

They don't look like an itchy rash, they almost look like little bites. They don't seem to cause her discomfort, but I honestly am getting worried because how long they've been showing up. She got some stool tests done, also, she recently had a urine culture and nothing showed up there. Could it be that it's some kind of food allergy or allergy to carpet cleaning product? Also I took her to a wellness center and was told that she showed up having candida, and that since she's breastfeeding, she probably got it from me.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Candida is easily treated for both the nursing mother and infant.  But the bumps are not likely to be from that.  It is usually confined to the baby's mouth.  Rashes in babies are quite common and the fact that they come and go gives me even more confidence that this is nothing serious.  Skin often changes.  It is possible there could be sensitivity to a product (carpet cleaning, fabric, laundry cleaners, etc.) so you could try using only a mild laundry soap like those designed for baby clothing  (Ivory, Dreft) and if it was carpet cleaner, that should be very temporary.  If it isn't bothering her it is likely just normal, but sensitive baby skin.  If it gets worse or does not go away between episodes, talk to your pediatrician about it.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, First of all I would recommend that you stop washing his face constantly and definitely no scrubbing.  Use just light fingers, mild face wash and patting dry.  Extra washing is not necessary, it will not result in allergy reduction, and cleanliness beyond a normal daily face washing is not even a factor in teenage acne.  What your child has is probably not acne at all but some other skin condition (possibly allergy as you have suggested).  Excessive cleansing will only aggravate sensitive skin.    If the treatment ordered by a doctor does not work, it's best to return to that doctor.  How will the doctor know if it worked if he does not hear from you?  He cannot know for sure what is causing the rash but is giving it his best shot.  Trial and error are often the way things are treated.  If one treatment doesn't work, that tells us a few more clues to help us find the right one.  It is totally normal to sometimes miss the mark, especially in such things as this.  Another dermatologist just has to start over again.  I would go from where you are.  This doctor may ultimately suggest an allergist anyway but I would still go back to him/her first.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Abdominal pain is very hard to diagnose at home.  There are so many organs in the abdominal cavity that could cause the problem.  Most often in a child it is bowel-related.  There can be constipation which causes cramps.  The child's diet may not have sufficient fiber content.  He may not drink enough or exercise enough to keep his bowels working well.    Of course we worry about appendicitis so if there is no relief in a couple of days you should have it checked out.  Viral infections are pretty much run of the mill and everyone gets them at time.  They have to just run their course.    If he gets a fever, feels chilled or other symptoms appear, take him to the doctor.  Best wishes\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, my name is Mr. Kayode and I had a strange heart breaking experience last night with my 4 year old daughter. Monday morning I woke her to take her to school and I noticed dry blood stains on her nose and all over her bed, so I casually passed it off as a \"nose bleed\". However she never had those before. Last night while she was sound asleep she suddenly awoke with massive amounts of blood pouring out her nose. I was shaken out of my clothes and panicking as my wife took control of my daughter. My wife tried to stop the bleeding but it continued for over 20 minutes through arguments of me shouting \"PLEASE LETS TAKE HER TO THE ER!\".          Finally when my wife gave in, she took her to the ER but by then her nose stopped bleeding, so they (the doctors) sent them back home. An hour after returning home my daughter's nose started again, but by then (while they were at the hospital) I had already gathered some info on Nose bleeds over the internet, so I had an idea of what to do. Well I pinched the soft part of her nose bridge at the bottom and held it for 15 minutes, and it stopped bleeding.           My daughter has never experienced this before, she recently had a few changes in her life with regards to school. She just came out of pre K and is now attending Kindergarten at an elementary school 5 blocks away from the house. I opted to walk her to and from school everyday instead of driving. She has complained to me about being tired while walking from school. She has been going (walking) there for the whole of last week including yesterday, (Tuesday). I also place some pressure on her when it comes to school work, for example, reading and writing and even counting, as well as playing the piano. But she's been doing these things with me for 2 years so I'm inclined to think that that's not the problem. Can someone please help me and suggest a solution? I'm sorry to give you a \"book\" for a question but I feel like I need to express what happened in it's entirety.   Thank you in advance for your help.  God Bless\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Some children are just more susceptible to these and they are not usually serious.  Of course a bleeding child always causes alarm in those around her.  But, you should be able to get the bleeding to stop and even teach her what to do when they happen.  If you are in a dry climate, add some humidity to the air - especially in her room at night.  I have known some people with this problem to benefit by adding salt to their diet.  I know that sounds weird but it's one of those folk remedies that can help.  If the bleeding is frequent and profuse, of course you should take her to the doctor to see if there is a cause and to make sure she is not becoming anemic due to excessive blood loss.  Chances are this is just within the normal range.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Potential Dairy Allergy in 12 month old",
    "content": "My 12 month old son has been breastfed since birth.  At six months, we introduced cereal and then foods.  I have not excluded anything from my diet.  About two months ago, he grabbed an ice cream sandwich and licked his finger.  He only had a very small amount.  He broke out in red bumps around his mouth, like little hives.  They were gone in about 15 minutes and appeared no place else other than around his mouth. We talked to our pediatrician and she said it would be unlikely for him to have a dairy allergy since he has been getting it from me in breast milk.  I eat yogurt, cheese, and ice cream daily.  Nonetheless, we decided it would be best to wait until he was 12 months to try any more dairy.  Recently, we gave him some yogurt, two spoonfuls.  Within five minutes, he broke out in small bumps/hives around his mouth.  They again only appeared there and were gone in 15 minutes.  Our dr said he clearly has some type of sensitivity and it would be best to avoid dairy until he was 2 or 3.  The alternatives are soy or I guess I could keep nursing.  My question is - if I keep nursing, do I have to exclude dairy from my diet.  Again, he had no visible signs of a problem from what he ingests from my milk.  But, I would think that if he was going to overcome the allergy/sensitivity to dairy, he would need to be completely free of it for an extended period of time.  I'm a little apprehensive to go the route of soy just because there seems to be a lot of debate about whether it is truly healthy and he has the potential of being allergic to that as well.  Please advise.  He is now 12 months and 1 week old.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It sounds like a mild dairy allergy since your eating dairy isn't affecting him.  Most babies who are sensitive to cow's milk protein do fine with their moms milk and only rarely does the mother need to alter her diet.    If I were you I would continue to breastfeed the second year, in addition to the other solid foods your baby takes.  This will also help prolong his immune protection that comes from the breast milk.  A sensitive baby will especially benefit from this.  Many children who are sensitive to cow's milk are also allergic to soy so again, breast is best.  Most children do outgrow this however, as your doctor suggested.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Strep is a serious illness and it can take a little while for complete healing.  But, complications can occur so if she is not eating and drinking by now you should take her back to the doctor.  I assume this was a documented, lab-confirmed case and that the treatment is appropriate.  If it is another infectious organism involved it may require a change to a different antibiotic.  Sometimes a second \"bug\" can get in there when the patient's defenses are down.  Hopefully she is on the mend.  A fever of 102 in a child is not particularly concerning when she is ill.  She can have acetaminophen for the  pain, assuming she is not allergic.  This might make it more comfortable for her to drink.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm worried about my 7 month old son. He's in the top 95th percentile for height, but less than 25th for weight.  He hasn't gained any weight in more than 3 months. He has been constipated since he was 4 months old.  At first, his pediatrician told me that he couldn't be constipated, since he was exclusively breast fed. When I started him on solids, last month, I was told that this was the cause of his constipation. Three weeks ago, he became so constipated that he couldn't keep food down, and began choking on vomit. At the emergency room, it took two suppositories and two enemas before he could have a bowel movement. His bowel movement was firm and dark and the next day became black and almost flaky. After that, he stopped going again. They gave us two suppositories to take home, in case he became constipated again. So, a week later, I used one, with no effect.  I used the second one and twelve hours later, he finally had a bowel movement, and then several more that same day.  Now it's a few days later. He's less interested in eating, so my milk supply is waning. He's peeing fine, but no bowel movements.  He's spitting up more, which he always does - the longer it's been since a bowel movement, the more he spits up. He's trying to move his bowels, but it's not working. I've been told that he can't have an impacted bowel, because every few weeks, he'll have a very hard, pellet-like poo. He is primarily breast fed, with only 2 - 4 ounces of baby food or juice per day.  I'm giving him watered down prune juice and apple juice every few days to try to help.  I've tried Karo syrup, too.  I don't give him constipating foods, such as squash, carrots, or bananas.  The emergency room doctor advised me to discontinue his iron supplement and all iron-rich foods (including rice cereal).  He has checked out fine at all of his routine check-ups. His pediatrician seems concerned about his lack of weight gain, but doesn't seem interested in the constipation issue.  I think that they're related.  I\u2019m especially worried now that he is less interested in food, and my milk supply is affected. Please help.  Thank you!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Severe Constiptation in Breastfed Infant",
    "content": "Hello, I agree with the pediatrician that the constipation is not likely causing his low weight gain.  Did he start out on the low end and is the growth curve consistent or are you seeing a sudden drop or move to a straight line on the graph?  The important thing in weight gain is that it continue to be consistent along his own graph line.    If you continue to feed the baby as you are, these issues will probably resolve eventually.  He may have a sluggish response to the urge to move the bowels.  As long as he is able to have movements maybe 3 times a week, this can be fine.  pediatric glycerine suppositories can be used occasionally in addition to the other dietary treatments such as cereals, strained prunes, apricots, or spinach.     If there were blockage you would probably see some liquid leaky stool coming around the blocked bowel.  Also, if he seems to become lethargic, loses muscle tone or seems weak it could be a symptom of botulism. These conditions would be cause to take the baby to the doctor right away.  Patience is probably the most important thing here.  In time your baby's musculature will make it easier for him to push the fecal matter out through what may be a somewhat tight anal sphincter.  Unless he actually becomes impacted, constipation won't harm him.   Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Paternity Testing &Blood type",
    "content": "Hello Katebreeze,  In general, questions are not asked about the father during pregnancy/delivery.  Depending on the mother's blood type, the baby may be tested to look for any possible antibody formation issues (known as A,B,O incompatibility).  Often, at birth, features of the baby are indistinct and don't necessarily correlate with the mother and father.    If, mom's blood type is O, often the baby will be tested.  If dad happens to know his blood type there could potentially be a conflict that would indicate the father is not the biological father.  (E.g. mom is O and Dad is B, meaning the only combinations for baby would be O or B.  If baby were A, it would indicate there was a different father.)  This can be a difficult situation.  Paternity testing is available to help determine more definitively if you desire.  Depending on your relationship and the openness of this situation, you may want to discuss the issue with your husband.  Some couples decide not to test and to assume that dad is the dad without questioning it.  I certainly am in no position to offer advice in this area, though, since the internet is very impersonal.  Best wishes.  You may also want to discuss this with your OB.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello-  Your son would seem to have an unfortunate combination of incompetent lower esophageal sphincter, for which he is being treated, and a very strong gag reflex. The combination would be almost guaranteed to produce the result of vomiting with laughter or coughing. So  long as this is the primary way this result is triggered, there's probably no great danger of aspiration (which could cause a lung infection). Just be sure he gets his medication regularly. The tendency to vomit should moderate over time. The reflux problem will probably require some sort of care for a long time, although sometimes this, too, can resolve or at least go into remission.   I hope this is helpful.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: ASD with Thalasemia major",
    "content": "Hello -  To try and answer your questions, out of order, first a surgeon would best know what the desirable and safe ferritin level should be in order to perform surgery. I don't know the answer to that, but do know that it probably could be somewhat above normal. I am assuming that right now the doctors taking care of your son are performing chelation therapy in order to reduce the level of ferritin and I do know this iron overload condition is caused by the frequent transfusions involved in treating thalassemia major. Chelation is the most efficient route toward getting ferritin levels normalized (you probably already know this -- I am thinking out loud here).   Given the size of the ASD, I would think an umbrella or else a good-sized teflon patch, placed via catheter, would be the two most likely approaches rather than open surgery.   The syncopal episode was most likely caused by pulmonary hypertension, and once the other problems are addressed, management of this will be the over-riding concern unless, of course, it is being caused because of the large-sized ASD, in which case closure may resolve everything but the TM, which is manageable and compatable with a fairly normal life (and life span).   My thoughts will be with you  and your son. Please keep us updated as to how this all goes. My best to you.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 26 year old woman who was born with a severe case of congenital torticollis.  I am considering having a child.  I know that there are many possible birth defects that should--and do--concern me, but given my personal history with this one, I consider it to be especially of concern.  I would like information regarding whether my baby would be at an increased risk for the condition.  I realize that the condition is not as extreme as it was then.  In 1982, the year of my birth and of the diagnosis, the doctors told my parents that I would have to have surgery to correct the condition.  They said that if I didn't, I would suffer \"irreversible visual and neurological impairment, the extent to which we can't even begin to predict.\"  Terrifying for first-time parents, but that wasn't even the worst of it.  They also told my parents that the surgery had a 50/50 chance of quadrapalegia.  My parents took me to multiple doctors and received similar prognoses.    Then, my father's chiropractor said to bring me in and just give him a chance.  He worked with me, doing many of the stretching exercises that have since become a standard treatment for congenital torticollis.  Within three months, I showed a noticeable improvement.  I never had the surgery.  Today, I would have to go to the attic to look at my baby pictures to even know which side the condition was on.    So you see, the condition is a concern for me.  I have tried to find the causes.  Either there are different theories, or there are different causes:  the muscle in the neck develops too short, not enough space inutero for proper growth, injuries during childbirth.    Could the condition be genetic?  Would the baby be more likely to have it because I did?  If it makes any difference, my body-type is very, very similar to my mother's.  Could having this body-type put the baby at greater risk?  Are there steps I can take to reduce the chances of the child having this condition?  Any insight you may be able to offer would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

The heredity issue is also not well know.  There has been some case studies that are potentially suggesting an autosomal dominant pattern of heredity (meaning a 50% chance that a child of an affected parent would have the condition); however, this is far from being verified as true.  I suspect the issue actually will be a more complicated method of inheritance rather than a straight forward 50/50 chance.

I was told that it could be a Lymph Node but not sure since i was also told that they are usually hard to the touch and my sons is soft and moves when touched.  I cant get into his doctor until thursday the 16th.  It doesnt seem to bother him at all when it is touched.  There is no change in his behavior or eating pattern.  What could this be?

Percocet (containing oxycodone) is a fairly routine postpartum medicine.  However, there are some women that seem to excrete more opiate into the breast milk than others.  Rarely, but possible, enough opiate can get into the breast milk to cause some problems with the baby.  I would advise caution and ongoing discussions with her doctor about this to be sure everything is OK.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Mikefusion,  I'm sure your pediatric team is probably already thinking about the things I can think of.  I suspect the antibiotics are to cover a possible infection with a bacteria such as staph or strep that produce toxins disrupting the skin and causing blisters.  The antiviral is probably to cover an infection from herpes since this virus can produce blisters and can be dangerous.    If there are blisters in other places a diagnosis of epidermolysis bulllosa may be possible.  In addition to your pediatric team, an infectious disease consult and a dermatology consult may be helpful if they are available.  Best wishes and I hope you are able to figure this out.\n\n",

He was getting the formla at the hospitol as well but not all day cause I wasable to pump out most of his feedings. He strains all day long as if he is constapated. He does have at least one bowel movement a day.  But sometimes he actually will cry and then I will smell that he used the bathroom.  He is very gassy as well.  My concern is that he's gonna get a hernia or something.  Is this normal in preemies or should I take him for appointment?  He strains most during feeding. I appreciate any advice. Thank you.

    "title": "Re: preemie strains all day",
    "content": "Hello Daisypot,  Newborn babies, especially premies, will strain a lot when they try to have a bowel movement.  There are a few reasons for this but essentially it is because their abdominal muscles aren't quite as strong and their intestines still don't have the whole motility issue down yet.  Formulas tend to be more constipating than breast milk so constipation is quite possible, in fact relatively common.  The key to determining constipation, though, is not the amount of difficulty in having the bowel movement but the consistency of the stool.  If the stool is very hard and pellet like, constipation is the culprit.  If the stool is still soft and mushy your son is likely not constipated.  Having diarrheal stools can actually be a sign of constipation as well due to the more watery stool moving around the obstruction.  There are several home remedies that can be used for constipation as well as some prescription medicines.  Given the age of your son and his more complex medical history with the prematurity it would be inappropriate for me to recommend any of these without an evaluation.  If you believe your son is constipated I would recommend he be seen by his doctor.  If he is still having soft stool I would give it more time and this should get better as he gets bigger.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Katied,  This is a difficult question to answer.  Typically, IV antibiotics are used when there is failure of oral antibiotics, the infection is spreading quickly or too severe to respond to oral antibiotics.  MRSA is a bacteria that can live normally on the skin (termed colonization), particularly when there are items such as tracheostomies or g-tubes in place.  if cultures are continually positive without signs of infection, this may be colonization.  Often with colonization, repeated courses of antibiotics do not clear the bacteria.  This would not be a major issue except that the colonized bacteria occasionally can cause an overt infection.  If there is a significant infection that has been resistant to oral treatments it may be time for some IV antibiotics.  My best advice would be to discuss this with your child's doctor to see if IV antibiotics may be of benefit.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: 7yr old with bowel problems",
    "content": "Hello Cheny24,  This does sound like constipation; however, the question then becomes what is the cause of her constipation.  If she has not been evaluated for this I would recommend you discuss with her doctor about being tested for hypothyroidism, celiac disease and possibly hirschsprung's disease.  All these conditions (which are not particularly uncommon, with celiac disease reaching an estimate of 1 in every 100 people) can cause constipation.    Functional constipation (constipation where there isn't a problem such as those above) is also quite common.  It is often treated with osmotic medications such as polyethylene glycol (miralax or glycolax are common names of this).  I suspect this is the medicine that your daughter had previously used.  You may want to consider having your daughter evaluated by a GI specialists.  At this point, her constipation may be so significant that she may need more aggressive medications to help clean out her colon (such as enemas or a medicine called golytely).  It can take some effort but this issue can usually be overcome.  The point that failure often occurs is after the colon is cleaned out.  The problem with constipation is that the intestines are stretched and loose their ability to sense that they are full.  After the colon is cleaned out, the colon needs to be kept at a normal diameter for 6-12 months allowing the intestines to regain their sensations.  To do this, a stool softener and good bowel habits are needed to keep the stool very soft and the intestines essentially empty during this time.  It's a long process but this generally will resolve the issue (assuming one of the above or another illness isn't going on that needs to be corrected).  Best wishes.\n\n",

(As a precaution, it is always reasonable to consider abuse but I won't necessarily go searching meticulously for this.)  Most likely, if you simply ignore the behavior it will resolve itself.  If your daughter has questions, just answer them honestly in a way that a 3 year old can understand (without details that she doesn't necessarily need to know at her age).  E.g. \"that's another part of your body just like your arms and legs\".  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello-  There are so many possible causes of such a swelling, most of them quite benign, that it is impossible to do more than hazard a guess from a distance this way. However, it sounds very much like a swollen parotid gland, one of the lymph glands which lies directly in the carotid chanel beneath each ear. These often will swell (as will other lymph glands) because of a transient infection. Sometimes one is also just naturally larger than the complimentary one. Still, especially in the case of small children (who cannot offer their input) it is wise to have it checked by a doctor. While there are potentially more serious causes for something like this as well, if your son doesn't seem ill then it probably isn't a serious issue, but again, since the child can't offer much information (other than exhibiting a fever or other signs of infection) it's best to have the doctor look at him. Hopefully by now that's been done and all is well.\n\n",

    "content": "My 8 year old is addicted to sugar.  She turns 8 on sat. and weighs 42 pounds.  She also has ADHD.  She takes Metadate every morning and clonidine every night to help her sleep.  She the clonidine kicks in and she starts getting tired she has to have something sweet to eat.  She is constantly wanting something sweet.  Every single night she wakes up after midnight wanting some kind of sweet snack.  she cries that she is hungry and will only eat sugary things.  Could this be something physical that is wrong?  Is her body needing sugar for something?  Her therapist wants me to take her to her regular doc because of her excessive sugar need.  Should I be worried?  Misty\n\n",

    "title": "Re: 8 yr old needs sugar",
    "content": "Hello, I would agree that it is important to have this checked out with the child's pediatrician to rule out any glucose abnormality that might be causing the excessive desire for sweets.  Hypoglycemia can contribute to behavioral problems in children.  If nothing is found to be a problem, it may just require some conditioning.  You might try switching to a sugar alternative such as Xylitol or stevia.    It won't hurt to start immediately giving your child fruit when she craves sugar.  Dried fruit sometimes is more readily eaten by children and can be a tasty treat with nutritional value as opposed to sugar.  Give her 100% juice in place of soda and begin by mixing the sweetened cereals with equal parts non-sweetened (add corn flakes to  half a box of frosted flakes for example).  When you bake banana bread, cookies, etc. decrease the amount of sugar you use.  Start with cutting back a little and each time decreasing a bit more until you find a satisfactory low-sugar alternative.    Do not keep highly sugared treats in the house at all, and satisfy her cravings with other foods that have value.  If you feel you must have candy, find something designed for diabetics, possibly sweetened with splenda, stevia or xylitol.  If she screams for sugar-laden foods, it is not out of hunger and she will not die without them so it's OK to limit her choices to healthy foods.  Eventually, if physical problems are ruled out, she will likely develop a more normal eating pattern and not crave the sugar, but withdrawal may be part of the process - psychological if not physical.  If your doctor determines no physical problem, you might also benefit from a consultation with a registered dietician to find a good food plan for your daughter.        Good luck. Debbie\n\n",

You can probably get the child weaned off sugar and once the body gets used to it, the cravings decrease considerably.

    "content": "When my son was 8mon's old he had a double ear infection and was put on antibiotics. 1week after that he got black tongue and the doctor said that it was because of the antibiotics and that it would go away on its own. It did go away but here 2 months later he has it again but this time he's not on antibiotics. He's not taking any meds other than the occasional tylenol and simethicone for teething and colic. Would his antibiotics from 2 months ago still be causing this problem? I'm worried because in my web search I've found that black tongue is also seen in people with a lowered immune system, but my son is not sick. I think perhaps I should take my son to a pediatrician instead of a family doctor. Am I just being paranoid? (I sure hope so) Should I ask for blood tests or something?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  Black, often also hairy, tongue is remarkably common. Since your son already had it once because of antibiotic use (which is a very common cause when a cause can be found -- so is bismuth as in Pepto Bismol) it's not really surprising it might recur, since that door was opened by the initial episode. While this is one of many signs seen in people with a depressed immune system, there are so many other, more likely causes (including those that are never discovered) that in a healthy child it would likely be pretty far down the list. Candida albicans is a possibility, but still unlikely. If that's the cause it is easily treated and not serious.   I  hope this puts your mind at ease. Please do follow up with us here.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Typically an abscess is associated with pain and you have not described that so I would say it may be something else causing the bump.  Since you cannot afford a dentist, perhaps you can investigate a dental hygiene or assistant school where students do xrays and cleanings for a minimal fee under the direction of experienced and licensed personnel.  If anything is of concern, you would be referred elsewhere.  Some communities have dental clinics created to serve people at low cost.  You might inquire through your local health department about whether or not there is such a program in your area.  You could also call local colleges and trade schools.  It may take a little digging but perhaps you can be seen by someone.  Good luck\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I need some guidance, please... I am not sure what step to take next or if my son should just learn to live with his pain. He has 2 very different complaints - could they somehow be related?  He is 7 y/o.  He recently had an endoscopy & was diagnosed w/reflux esophagitis, lactose intolerance, nervous stomach (all in February) & h.pylori (treated in December).  He takes prevacid 15mg 2x/day (for 2 more months - at that time we will stop to see if he will be OK without it).  He also takes lactaid with dairy.  He sometimes takes Mylanta if the pain/nausea get bad but he claims that it does not help.    The pain/nausea has not gone away with these treatments.  He complains daily.  We taught him techniques to help if it is a nervous stomach (counting to 10, deep breathing) but I don't think it is this since he complains at random times and not at times when I think he should be nervous (before school, before tests...).  Several biopsies were take & the doctor does not think it is anything bad (cancer).  Over the last 2 years or so he has complained of leg pain (mostly knee).  Left leg only.  The specialist couldn't find anything (we thought it was Osgood-Schlatter's... but now we are not so sure).  He said the next step was an MRI (which we did not do since the pain subsided).  He is now complaining of leg/hip pain (in his left leg) and he is almost in tears on a daily basis (last few days).  We also thought it was growing pains, but I don't know since it is one leg only, happens throughout the day, meds & ice don't help it.   Could these somehow be related?  I certainly don't want to let this go any further if I should be taking him for second opinions or following up with the Ortho Doc.  He has had \"shoddy nodes\" for as long as I can remember (our Ped. mentions it at each visit but is not too worried about it).  I, on the other hand, see the lumps in his neck & worry!  Could this have anything to do with his other problems.  He also has mild Asthma (he does not take any meds for this (at this time)).  He is small for his age and lost about 3-4lbs... that is what prompted the Gastro visits & endoscopy.  He has since gained most of the weight back.  Bloodwork from last November came back normal (aside from h.pylori).   I am hoping you can ease my mind or tell me what direction I should head!  Thanks for your time... It is most appreciated!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, You are certainly having challenges that would try your patience.  I'm sure your little boy will be a very strong man one day, having endured these difficulties with such courage.  I am glad that he has been seen by a specialist for the leg pain.  This suggests there is not a serious underlying condition.  I doubt these two problems are related unless it is cramping due to calcium and potassium irregularities, perhaps caused by dietary restriction.  Lab values were normal so it is probably not a significant lack.  Consulting with a dietician to be sure he is getting all the necessary nutrients would be advised.  I would not rule out growing pains.  These can occur asymmetrically, though most typically it affects both legs.  Basically it is a severe cramp. Simple daily stretching exercises often help and you can try applying moist heat to the affected area as well.  You can encourage him to try gently flexing his leg so the foot points up toward the knee if he gets the cramping.  Massaging can help too.  Another possible cause might be arthritis, but I suspect your specialist has already ruled this out.  If you don't get relief with the above measures, return to your doctor for further studies.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you so much for answering me!  I thought I would update on the leg & ask another question about his tummy troubles!  My son has stopped for now complaining of leg pain (it is probably growing pains... just not the typical pains that most kids get).    Now it is all about the tummy pain & nausea.  I thought we were nearing the end and resolving this... but it seems to be getting worse.  He complains daily.  I don't think it is nervous stomach mainly because it is not related to an event that would make him nervous.  It is completely random and sometimes seems almost constant when he complains.  For example, today was a very relaxed day after school & he complained for most of the afternoon on into bedtime (bedtime has never been a struggle or a stressful time).  Could the doctor have overlooked something?  Are we missing some other cause?  I feel that I should pursue this further but I am not sure where to begin (his Gastro Doc seems confident in his diagnosis - I don't know if I should get a second opinion or just accept the pain that he is in as the new \"normal\").  He drank 4.5 glasses of milk without a lactaid (well, actually he took the lactaid chewable over an hour before this happened at his grandparents house).  Could that have lingering effects?  The milk incident happened Tuesday evening (today is Thursday evening).  Directions state to take another chewable if you anticipate eating dairy after 45 minutes.    I do so appreciate any help that you can give me!!! Thanks so much!!!\n\n",

    "content": "I would consider an elimination diet since it could be some foods that he is reacting too.  At least try eliminating milk - rather than taking the pill, try giving him Lactaid milk (lactose free, there are other brands too).  This might work better for him.  Often allergists prescribe an elimination diet where you start with a very minimal diet and gradually add foods.   Often you can identify those that cause distress.  If I were to get a second opinion, I might try an allergist.  Rashes are easy to spot but some children react through the gastrointestinal system instead.  Different people react differently.  In addition, try to use foods in their most natural state, fresh fruits, veggies, etc. and avoid additives.  Many people are sensitive to preservatives and other substances (like dyes - especially yellow # 5, reds, and blues) added to convenience and packaged foods.  Read the labels.    Good luck.\n\n",

I know it is normal for her hair to fall out once before the age of two. The other thing is that her hair does not grow.  It take it a year to get her eyes. Could her problem be her thyroids or her white blood cells?  Those are the only two things that I now of that would make her hair fall out.  Her diet is fine.  She eats enough fruits,veggies, meat, dairy, and breads. I saw a dietrishion and she said she is fine because she is getting all the vitamines. What do you think that is causing her hair to fall out.\n\n",

I know it's normal for children on their first year of school to be sick all the time.  I just want to know if this is really the norm.  I've gone to her doctors I don't know how may times since Sept.  The doctor has done some culture test for strep but nothing else.  Should I presure for her to do more test?  What should I be looking for in my daughter signs wise that should concern me.  She's already been off two days last week and she will again miss school tomorrow because she's got a fever now.  We are in Ottawa, Canada if our location helps.  I have no idea what else to tell you, I am just very concerned that we may be missing something that staring us right in the eyes.

    "content": "Hello, First of all it is critical that you have a good relationship with your daughter's pediatrician.  She may not have anything except just a very susceptible body with perhaps a weakened immune system, but it is important you feel comfortable talking with her doctor.  If you don't feel you have this relationship, seek another opinion.    I don't recommend telling your doctor what to do, but rather, I would encourage you to explain very clearly your concerns, identifying all factors you know about, including the school days missed, any symptoms, whether or not they seem to be related to her asthma, if anything seems to trigger the illnesses or if there is a pattern.  Keeping good records can go a long way towards helping the doctor to diagnose her properly.  If the doctor feels there is something suspicious, he/she will know what tests would be indicated.  I'm sure some blood work will be involved as well as urinalysis and general physical exam.  Sometimes in spite of all our best efforts we still are unable to find a name for the condition but if the serious concerns are ruled out, at least we know it is probably just a propensity toward frequent viral illnesses and her body is developing the immune system as it fights these germs.    Make sure your daughter eats a balanced and healthy diet, rich in fruits and vegetables for their vitamin C and other valuable contributions.  She should also be well-hydrated.    I cannot overemphasize the importance of communicating with the doctor.  Mothers know a lot and need to be heard.  Labs and tests are only part of the picture and they do not answer all the questions.  If she has an immune disorder of some kind, you might be able to help your daughter to avoid situations which spread infection easily.  I wonder if you might consider trying home schooling for a time to see if her health improves without the daily exposure to the other children.  This alone would be insightful information for the doctor.    I'm sorry I can't help any more than this.  Good luck on this journey.  I do hope you are able to get answers or at least find out there is nothing in particular wrong and you can adapt the best you are able.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "My 9 year old daughter has developed this problem over the last year or so.  When she stands still for more than a minute she says her legs start itching like crazy.  She can't even stand still while she's brushing her teeth because her legs bother her so much.  She says the itchy feeling is just from her knee down (in both legs) and it immediately goes away when she starts walking again.  I can't think of anything that could be causing such an odd problem.  Any idea?  She does have pretty bad allergies and takes Zyrtec and Singulair everyday.  She's also on a steroid cream called Lidex (Fluocinonide) for her eczema, but she only uses it once every few weeks or so and mostly on her arms.  I know she gets itchy from her allergies but I don't think it has anything to do with this weird leg itchiness when she's standing still.  Thanks in advance!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I understand your concern.  Rectal prolapse in children is not uncommon, especially between the ages of one and three years.  Sometimes rectal prolapse is associated with an underlying medical condition so your doctor should do a work up for any problem such as metabolic disorders that might be associated with this.  If no problem is detected, in many children who experience this the problem resolves on its own, typically by the time the child is six years old.  Sometimes surgery is done but this is not the rule.  What you can do:  Push the prolapse back into place as soon as it occurs. Use a latex glove (available in drugstores) and lubricating jelly such as KY.  When she is potty training, use a small potty chair that puts her low to the floor to avoid straining the muscles.    Everything you are doing with her diet and fiber supplementation is exactly right.  Keep up the good work!  Best wishes.\n\n",

It's been a while since I was that age and from what I do remember, my cycles weren't regular.  Is it normal to have two periods so close together? Her growth and development have been normal, considering her having been on medication for several years (she was on Metadate for a year before the Adderall and on Ritalin for a few weeks to begin with). She is of average height and weighs about 94 pounds.   I appreciate any feedback you can provide me with.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Erratic periods are the norm for a young woman just starting to have periods.  This is nothing to be alarmed about.  The classic situation is the girl going to camp for two weeks.  She just had her period before leaving, thinking she is safe, only to get her period again while at camp.  Of course she didn't pack supplies because she was sure it would not come.  This happens frequently.  The hormones just aren't yet regulated and typically she has enough estrogen to give her periods but is not yet ovulating (not in every case, but often) so the typical phases of her cycle with progestrone after ovulation is not happening.  Her body is likely to do this for a couple of years, sometimes coming frequently and sometimes missing a period altogether.  Best wishes\n\n",

    "title": "Re: was taking medications until 4 weeks pregnant",
    "content": "Hello, I certainly understand your concerns but I think you have reason to be optimistic.  Drugs are not tested in pregnant women so we often don't know what to expect when a woman becomes pregnant while taking them.  Often we get information anecdotally, which means after many women have been exposed to these medications information was obtained and sometimes there is cause for concern; other times not.  We actually don't know enough about these and the large majority of pregnant women who used these went on to deliver healthy infants.    Often the studies in animals such as rats point to potential problems but usually it is at a dose much higher than humans take and rarely do animal studies predict how a human will respond so they are of limited value.    Your doctor is right, since you stopped taking these early, you are likely to have no problems.  There is a certain percentage of babies who are born with birth defects even without any exposures to drugs at all.  We advocate the safe course - taking medications only when the benefit exceeds the risk - in pregnancy because it is always best to err on the safest side.    One thing all mothers can do to help prevent birth defects is to take a daily multiple vitamin containing at least 400 mcg folic acid.  When the mother is at high risk for birth defects the doctors often recommend up to 10 times that amount.  The benefit of the vitamin in preventing birth defects may help balance out any potential risk from the medication.    Try not to worry.  At this early date the primary risk would be of miscarriage and there is nothing you can really do to prevent that from happening.  It is a common occurrence in around 20% of pregnancies.  You should just wait and see but meantime take your vitamins, eat a healthy diet and if you have other unhealthy behaviors such as smoking, drinking, illicit drug use, don't use your seat belt, etc. this would be the time to make those changes to help insure your safety and that of your unborn child.  Take care of yourself by continuing with your therapist to find safe ways to control your bipolar disorder too.  Best wishes for a healthy pregnancy.\n\n",

The reason is that these viruses are a little different than other viruses.  They are live virus vaccines in which the virus has been altered to be weaker so the virus can be fought off by the body without causing the disease.  The concern about giving them separately too close together is that the body may be distracted by the first vaccine while it tries to fight off the virus and may not react strongly enough to provide good immunity.

    "content": "Hello Newbrunswickgirl,  This is a very good question.  There are lots of new studies suggesting that infants that get higher levels of AHA/DHA have significantly improved levels of brain functioning/cognition as well as several other beneficial effects.  This effect has been demonstrated well enough that now the recommendation even includes having breast feeding mothers take a supplement of these fatty chains to help increase their levels in breastmilk and while the baby is developing before birth.  Does this mean they are essential?  Probably not, since children had the formulas for a long time without these supplements and did well.  While the data is pretty convincing, it certainly is not rock solid.  Given the choice, I generally recommend using the supplements but would not object to someone not wanting them.  When your son begins to eat more foods, having him eat some foods rich in these fatty acids will be just as beneficial.  Probably the biggest factor is that he eat a healthy balanced diet.  So, I hope I didn't leave this too unsettled, but I did purposely not directly answer it because I think it ultimately comes down to parental choice.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Mercys,  Constipation can be a considerable cause of abdominal pain.  If your grandson is this impacted he likely needs some medicines to help clear up the constipation, including enemas and medication by mouth.  There are other causes of abdominal pain as well, such as celiac disease, ulcers, and several other GI problems.  I would recommend your grandson be evaluated by a GI specialist.    Regarding the pain at night there are a few reasons that this may be.  First, and probably most likely, kids tend to slow down at night and are less distracted by other things so the pain becomes more obvious and more focused on.  Also, there are some hormonal changes that can change the perception of sensations including pain.  Follow up with his doctor is important.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Immunizations-Autsim Link",
    "content": "Hello Acacia80,  This is a very understandable concern.  Really, there are two different issues here.  First is the autism-vaccine issue.  There was a large study recently showing that certain vaccines were linked to increased risk of autism.  The untold story about this study was that it was paid for by they lawyers suing the vaccine company.  This makes it very risky to trust the outcomes because there was a vested interest in finding a link to support the lawsuit.  Several other very well done studies have looked at this link and have not found it to be true.  Additionally, the concern was about a mercury compound in the vaccines called thimerosol.  As a precaution, thimerosol has been removed from almost every vaccine at this point.  So, when comparing the risk of getting one of these diseases versus the risk of autism, the benefit of protection very strongly outweighs the risk.  The second issue is, is it safe to be revaccinated?  Receiving extra doses of the vaccines is not dangerous.  If there is not enough immunity, the extra vaccine will help boost immunity.  If there is enough immunity, the vaccine will only serve to strengthen the immunity.  If there is concern that the vaccine this child received I would strongly agree with revaccinating him.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Austinlogan,  Cystic fibrosis can present as \"failure to thrive\" (basically failure to grow) well before it begins to manifest with lung problems.  I would agree with the sweat chloride test to evaluate for CF.  You are correct that generally problems with the pituitary (growth hormone, etc.) have a delayed bone age.  The difficult part is that bone age x-rays give an age plus or minus several months.  So if the bone age is read as 3 yrs 8 months with a span of 8 months his bone age may actually be more like 3 years which may be considered delayed in that age.  Seeing the endocrinologist is important to help sort this out.  It may be that your son should have a growth hormone stimulation test to see if he is making enough.  The endocrinologist will help sort all this out for you.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Sarabeesara,  It may be that she is feeling a sensation of increased pressure from an elevated blood pressure.  As you probably know, exercise can increase the blood pressure some.  This pressure transmitted to the tongue could cause a feeling of pain.    The other possibility is that she is getting a bit dehydrated causing some decreased blood flow to her tongue.  This could cause her to have the feelings of burning.  Increasing her fluid intake may help with this.  If this gets worse or isn't getting better I would recommend she see her doctor just to be sure everything is OK.  It is unlikely anything bad is going on but a check up will help be sure.  Best wishes.\n\n",

He has tonsilitis at the same time, mild bronchitis we think, and is sneezing, caughing and has a ton of mucus.

TOnight my wife says that his stomach is swollen and is bigger then ever, and this is strange as he is refusing to eat, he is drinking a ton of water, but prior to this event he was eating really well.

    "title": "Re: 15 month old, fever for over two weeks",
    "content": "Hello Newdaddy26,  The most common reason for children of this age to have a prolonged fever is because just as they were getting over the first cold they got a second one.  The tip off for this is that the fever actually did go away for a day or two in the middle of the illness then returned.  If your son has had a fever every day of the 14 days it is time to see his pediatrician again.  A daily fever for 14 days  without a known cause meets the criteria of fever of unknown origin and should be evaluated further to determine the cause of this illness.  With the respiratory component, it may be that initially your son had a viral illness and now has a superimposed bacterial pneumonia.  Sinusitis is less likely since most of the sinuses are not developed yet but 15 month olds do have some sinus areas that can become infected as well.  The stomach issue is a bit concerning so if this is persisting I would recommend your child be evaluated by a doctor to see what is going on.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "My son's step-brother (9 months old) was recently diagnosed with RSV. (Respiratory Syncytial Virus)  My 6 year old son has been around him extensively before and after his diagnosis. My son doesn't seem to be plagued with any symptoms of RSV, is in great health, no cold symptoms, not even a runny nose.   I, however, have a 3 yr old niece, a 2 yr old niece, and a 5 month old nephew, and the three of them have been spending time with my son.  They have been sick, but that was before spending time with him.  The baby has also been tested for RSV, but that was before the step-brother was diagnosed.   Now that you know all the facts, my question.....  Is there any possibility for my son to have no symptoms of RSV, to seem perfectly fine, and not be affected by RSV himself, to carry the disease and transfer it to my young nieces and nephew?  (They have no contact with the diagnosed baby)  and  If he doesn't give it to THEM, is it possible for him to carry it to myself, and for me to carry it to them?   I just keep reading everywhere about highly contagious the disease is, but there doesn't seem to be information as to whether you have to be infected yourself to spread RSV, and I'd hate to think my young nieces and nephew could get infected.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: RSV Question - Possibility of \"Carrying\"",
    "content": "Hello Frog_Lover,  RSV is a very common infection during the winter months.  In fact, I would estimate that during its peak months it accounts for probably 1/2 or more of my daily patient visits.  RSV is quite contageous but it does not really have a \"carrier state\".  It is most easily spread by someone that is infected by it since it is spread in the secretions (mouth/nose, etc.).  RSV can be a severe infection in infants.  The severity of illness tends to lessen as age increases such that children by the age of 5 or so often have only a minor cold from an RSV infection.    It is possible that your son can contract the virus and be only minimally affected or even without symptoms but still spread the virus.  If he doesn't actually contract the infection but gets it on his skin it could be spread for a very short period of time until the virus died (probably only a few hours or so).  Most likely if your son is healthy with no symptoms it is less likely that he will be spreading the virus.  Handwashing and covering the mouth with coughing is a very effective way of reducing RSV spread since it is not spread through the air (like the flu is).  Best wishes.\n\n",

There are other reasons for increased fluid intake as well, such as water regulation problems.  The difficulty is figuring out if his increased urination is because he drinks so much fluids or if he drinks so much fluids because he is trying to compensate for the urination (sort of a chicken and egg issue).  I would suggest you have your son evaluated by his doctor.  Some screening labs, such as a urinalysis are probably a good idea.  Best wishes.\n\n",

But, if you are already eating too much, you obviously would not need to add this many.  Most non-dieting Americans are already getting enough that they don't necessarily need to add extra calories.

    "content": "Hello Dpiercedpierce,  What you are describing actually sounds pretty normal in terms of colds that children get.  When children get sick it lowers there immune system (basically distracts it) so that they are more likely to contract another illness.  This is the reason that young children often seem like they are constantly ill.  As the summer arrives, most of the respiratory illnesses begin to subside so it gives a chance to recover.  Regarding the tonsillectomy, there are only a few true indications now for removal of the tonsils.  Be sure to discuss with your child's doctor and the surgeon about the indications for the tonsillectomy and if it really is needed.  (I'm not saying it isn't but be sure to inquire about this since most of the time the illnesses you have described would not necessarily be an indication for a tonsillectomy.)  Best wishes.\n\n",

This amount of weight loss, while dramatic, may still be due to a simple viral infection.  I would agree with you that this should be evaluated rather than just waiting to see what happens.  The bump may be from some trauma as you initially suspected.  Often, the initial bang isn't even noticed until the bruise/bump shows up later.  It may also be a lymph node or a small fat cell tumor (non-cancer) called a lipoma.  Having your son seen by his doctor is a good idea to be sure everything is still OK.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Jctmom,  The Body Mass Index is a helpful tool to assess weight but it is not without its flaws.  Health status is a multifaceted issue that is only partially dependent upon weight.  This certainly is not to downplay the issue of truly being overweight.  For your son, I would emphasize the overall goals of being healthy including a healthy diet and proper exercise plan.  His body fat percentage (14.6%) is likely an appropriate percentage for him.  If there is concern I would suggest he see his pediatrician to get a full evaluation and be sure that all is well.  Best wishes.\n\n",

She has also complained ALOT of stomach pain (which has actually been checked by her pediatrician with no explanation for it) She goes through spells of not wanting to eat at all because her \"tummy hurts\"   Could either of these issues be caused by the garlic supplements??

    "content": "Hello Jmb6685,  Actually, there is not solid proof that garlic helps with infections in adults.  There are some indications that it may help but the studies are still limited.  This is the case with many supplements.  The issue is that supplements in the herbal category are not regulated by the FDA so there is no requirement to actually back up they claims they make.  Essentially they can say anything.    The other issue with supplements is that when taking garlic or any other substance in the pill form these, again, are not regulated and there is no guarantee that what is claimed to be in the pill actually is.  One recent example is a supplement pill for selenium that was supposedly safe but was found to have high (toxic) levels of lead in it.  These things absolutely do not mean that the supplements don't work but caution should be used.  With regards to your question about children using garlic, there is little data to answer this question.  It may or may not have an effect.  If it does, I suspect it is not a particularly significant effect based on the findings that most other supplements in children don't have much effect.  Adding some natural garlic to foods is probably a safe way to give garlic and get any benefits that may be present without risking getting any of the tag along substances that may be in the pill supplements.  I would not recommend using large (more than typical food intake) doses at this point because we simply do not know the effects or side effects yet.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: 8 year old low iron",
    "content": "Hello TiffanyPDX,  There are a few possible reasons for this.  First, it may be that his anemia was from something else.  This is probably less likely since iron deficiency is by far the most common cause of anemia and his iron levels are low.  It may also be that he has received enough iron by this point to make new red cells and recover from the anemia but not enough yet to restore his iron stores.  In this case, he simply needs to remain on treatment dose iron for a bit longer.  The other possibility is that he is continuing to loose iron.  The most common reason for this situation would be blood loss from the GI tract.  There is a simple test to look for blood in the stool that may be a reasonable test to do.  Follow up with his doctor will help assess this further.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Typically, ear pain will improve and an ear infection will clear within 24-48 hours in about 80% of cases.    If your daughter's ear does not begin to feel better in the next day or so it would be a good idea to have her evaluated to see if there is a different treatment, or less likely a different antibiotic she may need.

Usually it takes up to two weeks to resolve.  The most important thing you can do is be sure the baby is getting plenty of feedings, preferably at the breast.  He excretes the excess bilirubin in the stool so he must have nutrition coming in to get it out.  Newborns need to feed frequently - as often as every 1.5 to 3 hours with up to five hours at night.    Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Ansvarma,  This is an excellent question that is actually still being studied to see which methods are the most effective.  The goal of taking the prophylactic antibiotic is to prevent renal damage from repeated urinary tract infections.  This basically asks two questions, then.  1) Do children with grade 1 reflux (mild reflux) get more infections and renal damage than those without reflux and 2) does prophylactic antibiotic therapy decrease the rate of UTI's and renal damage?  There is some newer data suggesting that the answer to both these questions is actually no.  Grade 1 reflux is actually fairly mild and essentially all children will \"grow out of\" this problem.  As the child gets older and bigger, the ureters get longer and the vesicoureteral valve tends to become better functioning, thereby decreasing the reflux.  Many studies support that grade 1 reflux, in itself, does not increase the risk of renal damage.  Similarly, there are several good studies that show that antibiotic prophylaxis for grade 1 reflux does not decrease the rate of UTI's or renal damage from infection.  In children with higher grades of VUR (grades 4 and 5) prophylaxis benefit is more likely but still somewhat in question.    The issue of risk must be weighed in terms of benefit.  I would recommend you discuss this with her doctor.  The risks of long term prophylactic antibiotics is basically that there is a small risk of developing resistant bacteria that can result in more significant infections.  This risk must be balanced against not taking the antibiotic and potentially developing many infections that could damage the kidneys.  Basically, if there is a high risk of infection, the antibiotics may be more beneficial than the risk of developing a resistant bacteria.  I cannot say that your daughter should or should not be taking prophylactic antibiotics since I cannot evaluate her and review her chart.  Often, grade 1 reflux does not need prophylaxis antibiotics.  You may also want to consider having your daughter evaluated by a pediatric urologist (urinary tract specialist).  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Mello77,  There are a few possibilities.  It may be that your son is a little dehydrated causing the blood vessels in his hands to contract down some.  His recent illness may have caused him to not drink enough fluids resulting in this.  There is a condition called Raynaud's phenomenon that can do this (although it classically affects the finger tips more than the fingers).  It would be very unusual for  Raynaud's to present in a child this age so this is much less likely.  If this continues I would recommend your son be evaluated by his pediatrician.

    "content": "Hello DeLovelyEmma,  It may be that your daughter did have a GI bug that was causing her emesis and diarrhea initially.  In some cases when children get a GI bug and diarrhea for several days, the enzyme that breaks down milk (lactase) gets washed away due to the diarrhea.  It can take about a week for this enzyme to replenish.  Sometimes it is helpful to avoid dairy products during this time.    It may be that this has happened to your daughter and the milk gave her an upset stomach again.    If she is not getting better in the next few days I would recommend she be seen by her doctor.  If diarrhea is continuing for more than a week the chances of there being a bacterial infection or other cause beyond a virus begin to go up.  Best wishes.\n\n",

The area you are describing has many lymph nodes in it and the recent ear infection may be the initial cause.  As the body begins to fight off an infection, the lymph nodes will often enlarge.  This is a normal reaction.  After the infection has resolved they often will reduce back down in size.  If this lump becomes painful or if it continues to enlarge I would recommend that you have your son evaluated by his doctor.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Is the snoring that your son is doing more like a whistling sound or an actual snoring?  Also, just to be sure, it is present on both inhalation and exhalation, is this correct?  If it is present at both times, is it louder during one or the other?  Does your son make this sound while awake or only while asleep?  Thanks.\n\n",

My son makes these sounds both when he is awake and asleep, but it is louder when he is awake. When he first falls asleep it starts out really loud and eventually it gets lower as he falls deeper and deeper into his sleep. Still, when he is asleep it is louder when he inhales. Just to be clear, he never stops making the noise, it just goes from high to low depending on what he is doing.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi again,  Sorry for the delay in getting back to you.  From this description it sounds like your son likely has a fixed obstruction or compression of his trachea or larynx.  Laryngomalacia or tracheomalacia (floppy airway) typically are dynamic obstructions that occur with inspiration but not expiration since the air pressure helps hold them open.  Since it is worse on inspiration there may still be a component of one of these floppy airway issues.    I would recommend that your son see either a pediatric pulmonologist or a pediatric ear, nose, and throat doctor.  The sound your son is making is called stridor.  Possible issues include tracheal rings or (less likely) lower tracheal slings, vocal cord dysfunction/paralysis or other external issues compressing the airway.  Some of these issues, notably the laryngo and tracheomalacia will get better with age (although they may get worse first), others may not resolve without intervention.  This may get better as he gets older but it sounds like it is fairly severe and should be further evaluated.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "How do I stop my 7 year old from deliberatly wetting his pants? My kid wets his pants on purpose. If he does not get his way and has tried everything else he will threaten to wet his pants. It has gotten to the point where he does not always threaten but simply wets himself when he does not get his way. Sometimes he threatens othertimes not.  When he does not get his way he simply wets his pants. He will do this anywhere. If he gets mad he wets his bed on purpose.  The wet bed is always when he is mad.   If he is somewhere that he is tired of being and wants to go home he will wet his pants. It has gotten to the point that when we are going to be out somewhere for the day I feel like making him where a pullup or something else. If he was wearing a diaper/pullup he might not wet because it would not ruin the day. I am at the end of my rope.  I tried asking on another parents forum and some people told me that I should make him where a diaper when he does this.  So when he wet his pants I put a diaper on him for the rest of the day.  A few days later he got mad and thretened to wet his pants so before he could I took him too his room and put a diaper on him.  I told him that if he was going to act like a baby then he would be treated like one.  I also told him that from now on if he wets his pants he won't get dry pants he will get a diaper for the rest of the day and night.   Before I tried the diapers I tried not changing him when he wet his pants.  Letting him spend the rest of the day in wet pants like on a zoo trip.  That did not work.  I have only tried the diapers a couple of times so I don't know if it will work.   I figure a 7 year old is not going to want to have to where a diaper out playing with his friends or going shopping.  Is there anything else I can do?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Maryjane123,  It sounds like you have a very strong willed child.  At some point, he has figured out that he can manipulate you into getting what he wants by wetting in his pants.  So, now when he wants something he knows to do that.  Basically the solution is two-fold.  One is that he must not get what he is wanting when he wets his pants, under any circumstances.  This must be very consistent from everyone involved in his care (mom, dad, sitters, etc.).  This way he gets no benefit from using this as manipulation.  Second, it needs to become \"not fun\" for him to do this.  Wearing a pull up is one option if he dislikes this.  Often, making him responsible for cleaning up the mess can help as well.  If he wets the bed, he is responsible for changing the linens.  If he wets his pants, he is responsible for washing them.  There may be some other things such as removing privileges from him.  If he enjoys playing video games, for example, he may loose the privilege of playing the game for a day if he wets his pants.  Basically, you need to make this not profitable and not enjoyable for him.  Consistency is absolutely key.  If he gets his way even occasionally by doing this he will continue to do so in hopes of this being the time he gets his way.  If he never gets what he wants he'll stop doing this eventually.  Be forewarned, though, that this may get a little worse and he may begin to act out more initially but if you are consistent, eventually he will realize that it is better to obey than to try to manipulate.  Again, everyone has to be on board with this.  If even one person is letting him get away with this without discipline your whole plan will be undermined.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear doctor,   my daughter is 6 years old right now. About a year ago I noticed that she has some kind of a lump on her nipple that looked like a breast bud. I took her to our doctor and he said that there is nothing to worry about, it happens to some children and can go away after some time. She was often itching her breast. I always asked her not to do that. A week ago I noticed that her breast bud grew into a bug irritated blister.  Since I was able to schedule an appointment to our physician only in 2 weeks I took my daughter to a walk-in clinic. The doctor said that it's an infection, prescribed my child antibiotics novo-lexin and told me to do apply hot compresses to her nipple.            When asked him why she always had an urge to itch her breast, he said that he has no idea. I am going to our doctor in a week but meanwhile I would like to hear a second opinion. She also has the following symptoms lately: 1) tiered by the end of the day 2) wakes up almost every night (happened very rarely before) 3) sometimes she is cold All symptoms above can be also related to viruses going around.   Thanks, concerned mom.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Lola-bart,  Based on your description it does sound like your daughter has a skin infection.  Cephalexin (the generic name for the antibiotic you were described) is a good antibiotic for skin infections; however, a bacteria called MRSA is becoming an increasingly common skin infection bacteria and is resistant to cephalexin.  If this infection does not begin to improve in the next 2-3 days, or if it begins to get much worse, I would recommend you have your daughter reevaluated to see if there may be need to change antibiotics.    I'm unable to answer the question about itching.  Perhaps she has noticed the lump and it has become a bit of a habit to itch it.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I have an 18 month old son who has had multiple health problems since birth:  Severe reflux, DGE, swallowing problems, frequent infections (URIs, ears, throat, etc.-more than other kids his age), thrush, strep...and others I'm sure I'm missing.  He has had his adenoids removed due to severe hypertrophy and bilateral ear tubes.  He was also born with a Linear Epidermal Nevus on his left thumb/wrist.  When biopsied, showed no connective tissue effects.  Blood testing has revealed nothing other than a mild Class 2 allergy to egg whites.  He's been tested for celiac, immune deficiency, wbc, RAST, etc.  He went for a sleep study last week due to severe difficulty falling and staying asleep.  It showed mild Central Sleep Apnea, which, quite honestly, doesn't really surprise me.  I had a feeling that was why he was waking up.  We've been to (almost) every specialist - GI, allergist, ENT, Dermatologist...  So, I have a couple of questions:  What is the next step with the results of this study?  What kind of specialist or other doctor should we go to next?  What other testing should we have done?  Is it likely, between the results of this study and his multiple health problems, that there is an underlying condition, such as a heart or brain problem?  He is currently taking Prevacid (15mg/day), Carafate (2ml every 6 hrs), Erythromycin (30mg 3x/day) due to the reflux which is STILL very severe.  We haven't slept well in months (with is constant waking) and he is really becoming irritable due to his lack of sleep.  I am willing to test to the limits to find out what is wrong, and fix it!  Thanks.\n\n",

The first 2 nights the fever would not go down, even with Tylenol, Motrin, wet cloths on the forehead, and luke wram baths, so we took him to be seen. He also had a cough and congestion and told us that his legs, head, and back hurt. We thought it may be the flu.  They told us to keep doing what we were doing, and that nothing serious was wrong.  A night later his fever rose above 105 and he started vomiting so we took him back in to the emergency room.  They said that he has an upper respiratory infection and an ear infection, and gave him antibiodics for it, and told us to continue giving him Motrin and Tylenol for the fever.  This was on the 3rd day, and it is now the 6th going on 7th and his fever is still rising to 102 and once more to 104.9.  The Motrin and Tylenol are reducing the fever, but when they wear off it starts climbing again, and we don't feel comfortable giving him the Tylenol, Motrin, and antibiodics constantly and for so long.  Is this common in children or do you think there is some other problem that is being over looked? He had low blood sugar when he was born and had to be put on an IV for a day to regulate it, and he had to have out patient surgery on his circumcsion when he was 1, but after that he has had no other serious medical problems other than a fever here and there, but never lasting this long, or being this high (105).\n\n",

The antibiotics should help this if he has the right one.  Sometimes it is necessary to try a different one if he doesn't respond.  Do you have a regular doctor or pediatrician for him?  It would be best to have him in the care of one doctor rather than a different one each time.  I would have him seen by a pediatrician again.  Don't worry about the Tylenol and Ibuprofen.  In correct pediatric dosage, these will not hurt him even after a week or more of continued use.  Do not give more than the recommended dose however.  Good luck\n\n",

    "content": "I am wondering about some puberty concerns. I am 16, male, 5 foot 3 about. I am currently taking a ssri. Can ssri's cause problems in puberty? I am falling/ already fell off the growth chart and I am wondering if there is anything I can do. I am going to see an endocrinologist but I was wondering if treatments are safe.   I have had, bad bad bad experiences with my old doctors and my depression problems. I moved to a new state about 2 years ago. In my old state, my doctor put me on a ssri. I wasn't tested or anything really. I answered like a sheet of questions and they threw me on medications. I started with different ones and ended up on the one I am on currently. I had a family member that died and I was just having some emotional problems, but nothing severe. I am just worried that I never really needed the medication that badly and now it is \"potentially\" causing problems. I am not having any problems now, and I am not sure why I am still on the medication.  I have read on many sites and I know all about ssris. I know the side-effects, what they do, ect. I have read on webmd that they do not exactly know too much about ssris. They have been used for years, but there are still no tests to see if a patient needs the medication by testing chemical imbalances. I am just concerned because I have read that ssri's cause the brain to slow down in producing brain cells. This is not good since I am just starting/going to start puberty.  My current family doctor now runs my prescription on zoloft (100 mg). I am taking the medication because of anxiety of death after my family member died. He says that if the medication isn't causing problems, why stop it? My case is that I am not even sure if I needed the medication, how do I know it has more pros than cons for me? I have been on the medication about 4-5 years. I have been taking the same dosages. I have never had thoughts about killing myself or harming others. I am confused as to why I am on the medication and what are the benefits and problems that can occur from it. Do people usually get off the treatment? i   ------------------ So yes, I already mentioned that I am going to see an endocrinologist. I have personally requested to see the doctor. I am not sure if I am a late bloomer or not and I have not had an xray done of my left hand. I am hoping that I can get some answers about my stage in growth/puberty. I am currently playing hockey with 18 and under kids and also on a varsity hockey team. My height and speed are a problem in the sport and it is very difficult for me to deal with. I want to know if there is a connection between zoloft/puberty/growth, ect. I mean if zoloft can cause weight gain ect... how do they know that it does not effect a persons system differently. I mean ssri's effect each and every person's system differently and I am wondering if being a late bloomer/ having growth problems is a side effect to my medication. I have asked my brother, dad, and grandfather, all about when they started puberty, ect. They all started on the normal path and were on the normal path on a growth chart. This is odd for me since genetics usually causes a person to be a late bloomer.  Would you recommend me taking hgh or some shots or patches under my conditions? I do have some pubic hair on my penis but no other signs of puberty. Shots have been known to have some extreme side effects, and I am wondering if it is worth it. Can shots or other forms of hormone therapy have any problems with my current zoloft treatment.  Do late bloomers usually end up at a shorter height than those who start on a \"normal track\"? I know that growing in men has been know to go into early twenty's. I have also heard that those who start later usually proceed on a quicker puberty track. Is this bad?      THANK YOU IN ADVANCE. I REALLY APPRECIATE IT!!!!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Icetea,  SSRI's can potentially have some effects on height, although it is more common for it to cause problems in women from what I was able to find.    To better answer this question you need some more work up to see if you are \"a late bloomer\".  One of the best ways to do this is to have an x-ray of your hand to see what \"age\" your bones are at.  If they are \"younger\" than your actual age this would support delayed puberty or you being a \"late bloomer\".  If they are the same age or older than your actual age there may be a problem somewhere else, including possible growth hormone deficiency.  The endocrinologist will be able to help you sort this out.  Regarding ending height, those that have delayed puberty due to being a late bloomer, termed constitutional delay, actually tend to end up being taller than average.  This is because once puberty hits and the growth spurt occurs the growth plates in the bones close and any significant growth stops.  With constitutional delay, there is more time to grow in height before the pubertal growth spurt allowing an overall increased height.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 14 year old female, but it feels like I am 40. I have bodily aches throughout the day and occasionally during the night and I'm not sure what is going on. During the day, my back feels \"irritated,\" not like it's itchy, but like I need to stretch and pop my back like my life depends on it. My knees, ankles, shoulders, elbows, and wrists sometimes feel like that too. During the night, my calves cramp up and it causes unbearable pain. I read somewhere that sometimes overworking your leg muscles can cause them to cramp up like that, and I think that's the reason why they do because during the day it's like I can't stop moving my legs and I constantly toss and turn and it\u2019s like my legs don\u2019t get any rest at all. If I sit still for a long time, or even just for a short period of time, my legs get that \"irritated\" feeling and I just HAVE to move them. I sometimes get the same feeling in my arms. When I\u2019m walking around, I sometimes get a sharp pain in my hip, my knee, or in the arch of my foot. When someone grabs my wrists, they quickly feel swollen or numb and it feels like the circulation is being cut off no matter how tightly the person is or isn\u2019t holding my wrists. During school, when I am writing, I get something like a writer\u2019s cramp, but then when I try to use my hands or wrists afterwards, I feel a sharp pain in my wrists. Sometimes when I\u2019m not doing anything, just sitting around, and I am not using my hands, my palms get really itchy and it\u2019s like I cannot stop scratching them; I get the same feeling in my leg, but it usually starts off with a bug bite feeling like a bug just bit me, but none actually did, and when I scratch it I can\u2019t stop. When I walk up the stairs in my house I feel really exhausted and I feel like I just can\u2019t do it anymore. Sometimes when I am carrying my one-year-old sister, my arms tire quickly and I have to pass her on to someone else; it\u2019s not that she\u2019s overweight either. When I try to fix my hair, I have difficulty, even when I\u2019m doing something simple like putting it up in a ponytail. When I have my  arms up above my head and I am trying to fix the ponytail, my arms feel exhausted and I usually give up doing my hair because it feels like my arms can\u2019t take it. In the classroom, sometimes when I accidentally drop my pencil and I am sitting down, I bend over to the side to reach for it, and my hip or my back will cramp up really bad and I\u2019d have to ask someone else to get it for me. I don\u2019t play sports, and I am occasionally inactive. My mother says that the reason all this has been happening is because I am lazy and that I need to exercise more, but the more I try to exercise, it seems, the worse I feel. I think I do my fair share of exercising when I am walking about, running up and down the stairs, and having to move my legs nonstop. Just to be sure I am getting enough exercise, I do jumping jacks and go out for walks on my spare time. Is there any explanation for any of this? Thanks.\n\n",

Less commonly, problems with the muscles can present with symptoms such as this, including muscular dystrophies.  Thyroid problems can also cause some muscle weakness.  I would recommend you see your doctor about this.  A complete physical exam will be helpful.  Also, you may need some screening labs such as electrolytes, thyroid levels and some muscle enzymes.

He's been fine in the morning and early afternoon, then about mid afternoon suddenly his temp spikes and his whole body gets red/flushed.  Tylenol did not bring it down at all, ibuprofen slightly.  He's not sleeping well or eating very well either.  He's also very constipated.  By sometime in the middle of the night, his fever goes down to completely normal, and upon checking in the morning (rectally) it's 98.7.  I find this odd...any thoughts?\n\n",

I'm not exactly certain of the reason but I suspect it has to do with daily fluctuations in the body's hormones.  If he begins to develop other symptoms, such as joint pain or red, irritated looking eyes I would recommend he see his doctor since there are a few other things that can present with fevers and rashes in the evening, such as systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis.

Some boys will even develop some breast tissue.  This tends to resolve with time.  As long as the lump is not painful or continuing to grow in size it is likely nothing to worry about.  If it begins to get larger or painful I would suggest having his doctor take a look at this.  Keep in mind that breast buds can get larger and become a little tender but there are other possibilities if these occur so having it evaluated is best.  Best wishes.\n\n",

My best advise is to make sure he stays very well hydrated.  If possible he should drink 1 and a half or even twice what he would typically drink (but not just straight water).  Some water is good but make sure he is getting some electrolytes also.  Also, for the first day or so it is a good idea for him to just rest and not get too active so he doesn't get too out of breath until he acclimates over the first few days.  If he does begin to get sick I would recommend he see a local doctor for treatment.  Best wishes and enjoy your trip.\n\n",

    "content": "Where do we go from here? My daughter started loosing teeth at 18 months due to infections and bone loss in her mouth.  After a long process it was discovered that the cause must be an extremely low ANC (<100) at which point she was put on the drug Neupogen. After starting the drug her blood counts have been in a good range (2500) and there was no longer bone loss in her mouth, so after gradually reducing the dose she is now no longer on the drug.  3 months ago the x-rays were fine, 2 months ago she completely stopped the drug, however now she has more bone loss with no infection this time. (She has already lost or had pulled 8 teeth and now the dentist says it looks like she will loose 4 more).  Any ideas on what could be going on with her?\n\n",

I would suggest that the next step is to determine what the cause of her neutropenia was if it has not been determined yet.  There may be more that is needed for treatment of this to help every thing heal appropriately.  I would also recommend that your daughter see an oromaxillary specialist.  There may be a treatment that can help prevent any further bone loss.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Did your hematologist mention cyclic neutropenia?  If the bone marrow aspiration was done while the neutrophil count is normal I believe that the bone marrow aspiration being normal does not rule this out.  If, by chance, the bone marrow was done just before a neutropenic episode the marrow would show decreased amounts of neutrophil precursors.   This is a little outside my field so I would certainly differ to a pediatric hematologist but I believe the only way to make a diagnosis of cyclic neutropenia is to do repeated CBC's to look at the neutrophil count two to three times per week for four to eight weeks.  This allows evaluation for the cyclic dips (which occur about every 3 weeks in the majority of patients).  The frequent sampling is needed because the neutropenic period may only last for a few days so it may be missed if the CBC's are done too far apart.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Amerbeauty,  Most likely your daughter has some lymph node enlargement due to an infection (probably viral).  All the areas you are describing have many lymph nodes in them. The augmentin may be the source of her diarrhea.  This is very common.  If she was tested and found + for strep, treatment is to protect against rheumatic heart disease.  Unlike most infections treated with antibiotics, treating strep throat prevents the heart complications but does not actually shorten the course of the illness.  The infection will clear on its own generally over the course of 10-14 days.  If these bumps become painful or are getting larger/not going away she should see her doctor.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Doctor/ Healthcare professional, My 3 years old daughter, healthy otherwise, alert and active; she has started to have 5 -6 times NORMAL bowel movements daily since one week ago.  She did complain a little bit of tummy ache, but otherwise, she looks fine.  Her stool is normal, usually more at the first time and afterward, it's just some small stool. All these years, she usually has her bowel movment once a day or once in 2 days.  I am afraid of any type of colon problems: Cohn's disease or Ulcerative Colitis?? I do plan to take her to the doctor if this is continuing. Thanks ahead for your suggestion/answer! Anna\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Anna,  At 3 years old, an inflammatory bowel disease like Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis is very unlikely.  These tend to start occurring in the teenage years.  If her stools are normal and not diarrheal it is most likely that everything is fine.  It may be that she has had a bit of a stomach bug that has caused her intestines to be moving a bit faster than normal.  It may also simply be a learned habit to go to the bathroom more frequently.  I suspect that this will resolve itself over time.  If she begins to have any other symptoms or if this persists it is certainly reasonable to discuss this with her doctor.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Because she had recently also had a tick there. They pretty much laughed at me and said that there is no lyme tick disease in Missouri. They said it was ringworm.Put her on antibotics (took make me feel better) and some like jockitch medicine. Well that spot went away kinda. This was several months back,and the rash behind her ear would come & go but it was never as bad as the first time it appered. Now all of a sudden she has 2 of these spots on her back, 2 on her legs,1 on her stomach, & 2 on her face. I have tried getting her into the doctors but they keep cancelling my appointments. I just do not know if this is something serious or not, but it really starting to scare me.\n\n",

If this does not do the trick you may need to see a dermatologist.  If it has a bit of a center that is not red (hence; the name \"ringworm\") it is likely that this is the cause.  Do see the doctor when they are able to get you in but very likely you will be able to get it in control.  There are other skin conditions such as eczema or psoriasis but these are also rarely serious.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Vyvanse for ADHD",
    "content": "My daughter is 12 1/2 and was diagnosed with ADHD when she was in the third grade. She took Ritalin for two weeks and then switched to metadate because the Ritalin caused a zombie effect, no matter what the dosage and she wasn't eating. For a while, she did great on the Metadate but that eventually caused her to have severe anxiety at school. We then switched to Adderall XR and after gradually increasing her dosage to 25 mg, she seemed to be doing okay. Her weight has been steady (she's 80 pounds) and she is developing appropriately for her age.  We recently found that she was socially withdrawn on the weekends, to the point that she would get anxious at the thought of socializing with her friends and she was having some difficulty at school in terms of handling abstract thinking and following social cues.  Her pediatrician is an expert in ADHD and I trust him and his judgement. After trying two weekends off of the medication and seeing a positive change in my daughter's personality (being more social, making eye contact), we agreed the next step is to stop taking Adderall altogether (as he feels it causes the social anxiety and it's run its course for my daughter) and take things one day at a time. Though I'd love to think that maybe my daughter can do without the medication altogether, I worry about the implications it will have on her in terms of social and academic success. The reason she was put on medication was due to impulsive behavior (calling out in class, hurting other children), fidgeting with her hands and legs, being easily distracted...the typical symptoms of ADHD. Though she might have \"outgrown\" the ADHD, I'm not as confidant but I am giving this a try. So far, the weekend has been fine for her and she has been more social and she seems not to be showing any impulsive, extra hyper behavior. The pediatrician suggested Vyvanse as the next step if we feel the need to switch medication. He mentioned that it lasts longer than Adderall and doesn't have the side effects of the social anxiety, etc.  I was wondering what you have to say about Vyvanse. Do you think it's possible for a 12 year old to outgrow the ADHD? I certainly hope so, in our case.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, In the past it was believed that most children would outgrow ADHD.  More recently however, it has been shown that many adults continue to struggle with this, though it manifests itself differently, leading people to believe it has been outgrown.  In many cases they have just learned to cope with this challenge in their lives.  So, I would not expect this to be the case.  Some people do learn ways to deal with it without medication or in addition to the meds.  You may get some ideas through the CHADD organization.  ADHD is their focus.  Some people benefit from biofeedback programs available on computers but these tend to be quite costly.  Some benefit from dietary changes and feel there may be some subtle allergies involved.  Counseling is also helpful for many people.  But, the medication change might also be a good option.  I think it would be worth a try and have not seen anything to suggest dangers involved, beyond the usual cautions that come with medication use.  It is important to get the symptoms in control since the inappropriate behavior they often exhibit can result in self-esteem damage and depression as a secondary condition.  Of course the impulsivity also can result in dangerous behavior.  I'm glad you have an informed and trusted doctor to work with.  I think he has your child's best interest at heart.  Good luck with this.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I assume your baby is keeping down feedings well enough to be gaining weight.  There is a concern about pyloric stenosis which can result in projectile vomiting and usually requires surgical intervention so you should report to your pediatrician or family doctor that this is occurring.  The medications can help the acid which causes pain and can damage the esophagus with reflux but it won't solve the underlying problem if your baby has this defect.  Even the sphincter at the top of the stomach can be quite weak with babies and they usually outgrow this so the medication won't cure it; just help reduce the damage while the baby's body matures.    Good luck.  I know this is very frustrating for a new mom.  Please monitor the baby's weight if you haven't already been doing this and see the doctor about your concerns.  Best wishes.\n\n",

A year ago he was diagnoised malnursihed and failure to thrive.  Shocked me he eats all the time. He was then put on Neocate to supplement his diet. Allergy testing was done, doctors took eggs, milk, soy, and wheat out of his diet.  Less stomach achs and sleeps better at night.  He has had a scope w/biopsys done and a flex sig.  Everything was normal.  He was put on Previcad at 18 months.  Now my son is off the Reglan.  He still has bouts of vomiting lasting about 2 weeks at a time (4-7 times a day) the bouts come every couple of months.  He has developed a limp that comes and goes with his right leg.  He gets rashed around his thighs and face.  In the last two months he has lost a little over a pound.  THe doctors have done blood work and nothing comes back.  We have tried appitite stimulants and they have not worked.  The doctors said they are going to have to put a feeding tube in if he does not gain weight.

    "content": "Hi Xrats,  Failure to thrive is a difficult thing to figure out sometimes.  It sounds like your son is getting a proper evaluation.  If they have not been performed I would recommend he have testing of his urine organic acids and plasma amino acids.  These are good screening tests for many of the metabolic disorders.  I would also recommend he be tested for celiac disease if he has not been.  Generally this would be seen on the endoscopy if they did biopsies of the duodenum but in rare cases it may not be seen.  Eosinophilic esophagitis and eosinophilic gastroenteropathy could cause this but should have been evaluated for by the endoscopy and biopsies as well.  I would recommend he be tested for cystic fibrosis as well.  This is done with a sweat chloride test.    Follow up with a GI doctor is important.  In some cases a gastric feeding tube (G-tube) is necessary, if even for a short period of time, to reestablish good weight gain and growth.  G-tubes are a relatively simple device to insert.  They can be removed and heal well after removal.  If it becomes necessary to have this done, be sure to talk with your doctor and the GI specialist or surgeon that will be putting the tube in to be sure you know all the risks/benefits to be able to make an informed decision.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Blood pooling in hands and fingers",
    "content": "Hi Dpye111,  There are a few things that may be contributing to this happening.  First, with taller people, the blood must travel further to get back to the heart.  When the arms are hanging by the side, the blood is more affected by gravity making it harder to get the blood back to the heart (slightly).  This can cause some increased pooling of blood in the hands.  This is not particularly dangerous since most people don't have their hands hanging completely still for prolonged periods.  Any movement will contract the muscles and help \"squeeze\" the blood back to the heart.  Also, with the hyperthyroidism issue, the vessels may actually be dilating some to help reduce the body temperature and keep it cool.  This can cause the blood vessels in the hand to hold more blood and give them the red color you are seeing.  I suspect that in your son's case it is likely a combination of the two.  This is not a dangerous thing, only a cosmetic issue.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,   I am 15 years of age and weigh 145lbs, I have a blood pressure of 187/86 which is not ideal considering \"normal is 120/80 I have a major health concern and I am not quite sure how to go about asking my doctor. I will start with my breathing trouble. If I lay on my back the pressure on my heart  and lungs is so great that I cannot breathe and I have to quickly turn over and gasp for air. Commonly when I wake up in the morning breathing is a painful excersize for me because the pressure is so great. Another thing is I have a very difficult time taking full breaths and when yawning I am deprived of oxygen and cannot get enough in. I have to try with all of my power to get that air into my lungs, and once its in it doesnt stay long. Even when doing physical activity when I breathe in the air it is like standing outside when it is -35 degrees because the air feels so cold going down my throat. My doctor at first believed it was indigestion and prescribed prevacid but that did nothing for me.  My other problem is extreme heartburn to the point where I need to throw up. I am not sure what the best medication is for this.  My other concern is that sometimes when I talk, to me it almost sounds like I am underwater. It is only occasionaly but trying to talk when it sounds like your underwater is not easy. It is most commonly in my right ear but sometimes in my left. I also have an extremely hard time hearing what people are saying and it becomes embaressing having to say \"what?\" all the time. At the same time though my ears are very sensitive to sound, we have assemblies at school and I can just feel my ear drums bouncing all over in there. I have always had bad but sensitive hearing. Like I said, it occurs at random throughout the day and sometimes never in a day.  Finally, this may be common but I don't know. My mouth produces unbelieveable amounts of saliva and I have to swallow every 5-10 seconds. Swallowing is very difficult for me as well. Swallowing saliva is more of a task and I have to think about it before I do it and time it just right. It is embaresing because when I swallow it causes me to shake slightly because thats how mych force it takes to get it down. I had to go to the dentist today and it took double the time it should have just because of the saliva. Swallowing food is even worse for me, I have to plan exactly when I do it and how I am going to.  Even as I yawn now I am having an extremely hard time getting the air I need and I feel as though I cannot breathe.  There is no way I will feel comfortable talking to my mom about this, so I would like your advice on what you think this could be. I have begun thinking that I may need a shunt (spelling?) put in to drain the fluid out of my ears that is there. Now that you have heard half of my problems please help.  I would prefer you send what you think to kshamrock12@yahoo.com for me to read. Thank you for your time.  Kodie, age 15\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Kodie,  Breathing problems should never be ignored.  They can signal asthma, pneumonia, heart problems and other conditions.  You do need to have all your symptoms evaluated.  They may not be related but should all be addressed.  You definitely need to talk to your parents about this.  Because teens are so independent it is easy for a parent to not realize there is distress and pain going on.  Please talk with them and be totally open and honest about all your symptoms.  I'm sure they will help you seek the medical attention you need.  If they do not respond for some reason, speak to a trusted relative or school counselor or nurse.   Ears can become plugged with earwax deep in the canal.  This can be removed by a doctor's staff and it might be all that is causing the hearing difficulty.  Your serious heartburn should also be treated because serious damage can occur to the esophagus due to acid reflux if it is not controlled.    I wish you luck in dealing with these perplexing problems.  Let us know what you find out.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "My 10 year old son has been diagnosed with chronic constipation 3 mths ago & Xray showed he's 100% impacted on both sides of his bowels and entrance out.  Doctor said that taking Miralax once a day for 6 months to a year should cure him but that he should feel significant improvement in a few weeks.  He said to give him adult fleet enema anytime he does not move his bowels in 2 days.  My son saw some temporary relief in the first week but then after nothing.  He also vomits because of the pain & misses alot of school.  Now he is mentally affected by it.  We saw the doctor again but he said to give it time.  I've upd the dosage per the doctor but doesn't seem to help. He does get diarrhea every so often but I have not seen a real bowel movement in weeks.  I can't understand if adults are cured by Miralax then why doesn't it help my 10 year old son?  Can anyone suggest anything else?  I am scheduled to take my son to a specialist for a second opinion but am at my whits end because my son is in agony.  pjrome1@comcast.net\n\n",

    "content": "Hi A060201,  Chronic constipation is a difficult issue to resolve.  As your doctor has suggested it takes six months to a year to completely resolve the issue.  The problem is that when the intestines are impacted for a long time they loose their ability to recognize the sensation of being full.  When this happens the stimulus to go to the bathroom goes away, making the constipation even worse.  The cycle is broken by keeping the intestines normal sized for six months to a year to let them regain the ability to recognize when they are full.  This is done by keeping the stool very soft, almost diarrheal, for the several months.  Miralax is a good stool softener and works well.  A standard dose is 17 grams per day.    In patients where there is already impaction from hard stool filling the colon, miralax takes much longer to work if it works at all.  The reason is that the hard stool is much more resistant to stool softener effect.    In your son's case, if the fleets enema was unsuccessful I would recommend that you talk to your son's pediatrician about using a medicine called Golytely.  Golytely is a medication similar to miralax but much more powerful.  For it to work it takes a large volume, often a rate of 300 ml's per hour into the intestines is needed for a total of 4, 8 or sometimes even more liters of the solution.  If the person is able to drink this amount rapidly enough it will work; however, often children are unable to drink this much so they may be admitted to the hospital and the medicine may be given by a nasogastric tube until the stool is clear so that the intestines are cleaned out.  Then the miralax can keep the stool from becoming impacted.  Seeing a GI specialist will be helpful in managing this problem.  The key is keeping the stool soft and establishing regular bowel habits.  Without these things successful resolution will be very difficult.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi abcdabcd,  Wearing shoes that are too big can cause alot of the same issues that occur when you wear shoes that are too small.  Wearing shoes that do not fit can lead to blisters, lost toenails, bunions, and hammertoes.  Shoes that do not fit properly can also cause the child to trip and lead to other foot problems.  Shoes that are too large will bend in the wrong place and put stress on the wrong parts of the foot.  I would suggest making sure your sister has her feet measured in a shoestore by a trained person.  This will assist in finding the proper size footwear.  Thanks for writing in and good luck.

He has no cavities and was recently seen by the dentist.  Any thoughts or ideas?  He has no pain, no symptoms - but its horrible!  It is always possible he could have what I have, (celiac sprue) but he has no real symptoms of it and was tested already.  (but would that cause the terrible breath?) The only thing that is not normal is his stool has never been formed, like my other sons (or ours).  It is soft, light in color, and looks like theres air in it and mushy. It does take him a while to have a bm but he has never cried of pain or menitoned pain and I have asked him.  Nor has it ever been very bad smelling.  He did have a large belly button at birth, an outy that finally went in, but other than that, he has had normal yearly checkups and in good health.  Thanks for any thoughts, ideas etc.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Momneedshelp,  There are several possible causes of chronic bad breath (halitosis).  These include chronic sinusitis, gastroesophageal reflux, dental cavities/abscesses and some really rare genetic diseases.    Conditions like celiac disease or other digestive problems could cause changes in the stool but are less likely to cause bad breath since the issue is beyond the stomach.  I would recommend you have your son see his pediatrician for an evaluation of this issue.  This way the multiple reasons can be narrowed down some and a solution can hopefully be found.

If you have access to a pediatric neurologist, it would be great to have her seen.  At any rate, you should explain to your family doctor that the headaches continue and that she was unable to tolerate the prescribed medication.  Take a log of her headache history with you and give the doctor a complete history and description of what happens with the headaches.   At least you could maybe find a pain reliever that could help relieve her suffering.  Good luck.  Please let us know what you find out.\n\n",

Thyroid hormone replacement, when provided in proper dosage level, crosses into breast milk in only minute quantities, and has no adverse effect on the baby.  It is important that you take your medication as prescribed because if you had too much - in an amount to give you HYPERthyroidism, more would be passed to the baby.  But, if your dosage is keeping you in the therapeutic range, you have nothing to worry about.

    "content": "Hi there,  I am having some trouble finding sources on this subject, as I think the occurance is not common.  My 5 year old niece ( female ) will show psychosomatic symptoms when she hears or observes anyone ill or injured. A recent example:  At the hospital visiting a friend whom had recent triple-A repair, the attending was talking in a consult room about the surgical procedure of the lower aortic repair ( nothing too verbally graphic ).  My niece started to get agitated, pale, diaphoretic and she requested we stop talking about the procedure.  We exited the room and she no sooner vomited.  She will experience these symptoms anytime someone is sick, or even if we talk about medical things ( to include dental procedures or simple normal conversation as anyone else would have )  The only thing I can figure out as the origin, is that when she was 3-4 years old, she observed a family member vomiting and feeling ill from the flu.  My niece watched for a minute, just staring.  We tried to get her attention during this, and ended up physically removing her, as if she was mesmorized.  Ever since then, she would react negatively from anyone who is ill.  Otherwise, she is a normal acting 5 year old.  All history is clear, no medical or developmental issues, typical household, nurturing family environment.  Which, makes this confusing for me. We plan on discussing this with our pediatrician in the next appointment  Any ideas, links or resources to help us understand this would be wonderful!  Happy Holidays, and be safe out there!

Some children simply are very empathetic and can react in the manner you are describing to disturbing information.  Your niece may simply find medical information unpleasant and react by getting ill.  Many people have basically this same reaction and pass out (for example, at the sight of blood).  The reaction is basically identical.  Most likely she will get better with this as she gets older.  It may be helpful to talk with her pediatrician about this to see if there are any other medical concerns, although it doesn't sound like there are.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Molly12,  What you are describing sounds very much like a breath holding spell.  There are two types of breath holding spells, cyanotic and pallid.  In the cyanotic type the child turns bluish.  In the pallid type the child does not turn blue.  In both types the child will \"hold their breath\" which is a bit of a misnomer because 1) it happens after exhaling not after taking a deep breath and 2) it is an involuntary action.  The breath holding may last for up to one minute and may result in the child passing out.  These are not dangerous in that they resolve spontaneously and do not cause any damage to the brain (even if they pass out).  Spells are often triggered by fear, crying, anxiety or pain.    They are unusual (but not impossible) before about six months of age, though.  For this reason I would recommend you have your child see his doctor to be sure nothing else is going on.  There is some evidence showing that iron deficiency anemia can trigger these spells so having him tested for anemia is a reasonable idea.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I was a single parent her entire life until recently and I found myself getting very angry and yelling at her for little things from about the age7 or 8 and it was occassionally when she was 5yo.

ALso she tests on the aims and other tests nation and state wide in the top 5th student very very smart... she started reading and writing at 2yo fluently...she is creative with objects and writing.... she has friends..... although she will tend to bark or meom like a cat when she feels threatened.... she is still voiding in the night.... I think its because she cannot tell... when she does not get caffeine at night befor ebed she does not have accidents.... What do you think??? I had a psychologist look at her when her fathers mother tried for 2yrs to get custody of her... she had not seen her in about 5 years and she has not seen her dad in 10yrs.... they psychologist stated it was the grandmother causing her to act that way.... I just don't know what to think... We ar enow having to transfer from another school because the charter school says they don't have the resources... I went and spokje with the other school and thye also disagree with her autism dx... they want to kjnow why she needs help... I said she didn't she just needed a push with doing her work.... again a manipulative thing....\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Just Us Two,  From what you are describing I would say that there are a few possible things going on.  First, you may certainly be correct that your daughter has decided that the way she will get attention is through negative behavior.  This can lead to some very destructive behavior.  This may not be the only thing going on, though.  From what you have described autism doesn't come to mind; however, the diagnosis of autism is fairly complex.  It's diagnosis should be made by someone with experience.  If there is one in your area the best person to have evaluate your daughter would be a developmental pediatrician.  Developmental pediatricians specialize in disorders such as autism.  Autism itself is in a spectrum of disorders known as the autistic spectrum and ranges from very mild symptoms to very severe symptoms.  Asperger's is in this category and tends to be a bit milder than classic autism.    One of the hallmarks of these disorders is social issues.  For example, autistic children tend to not interact much with anyone unless it serves their needs.  They tend to not have a desire to share emotions with others or involve others in their daily routines unless they need them to accomplish their goal.  If a developmental pediatrician is not available, seeing a psychologist is a reasonable approach.  If one is available with experience in childhood disorders like autism this would be better.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, my son is 5 and a half years old.  He had gross motor and social/emotional delays caused by an unknown reason.  He was born very large, 10 pounds 8 ounces and 22 and a half inches long.  He is now about 68 pounds and over 4 feet tall.  Every year around this time he goes through about 2-3 months of weight gain and night sweats.  A month ago he weighed 65 pounds and is now about 68 and a half.  He sweats terribly at night and wakes frequently throughout the night.  After a few months it all goes away.  Every year I go into a panick about it and this year I am keeping in mind this is his usual.  He has been tested by an endocrinologist and everything was normal.  Do you see any reason to worry?

    "content": "Thank you for responding.  I will be calling my doctor tomorrow.  I just have one more question.  When we went through this weight gain and night sweats last year, I was sent to an endocrinologist who did not seem concerned at all.  He ran thyroid tests and they came back negative.   After that my pediatrician didn't seem concerned either and eventually the weight gain stopped as did the night sweats.  My son had a physical at the end of July and he weighed 61 pounds and was about 3 feet, 11 inches.  I weighed him yesterday and he is now 70 pounds.  He has gained 9 pounds in 5 months with no change to his diet at all.  He is not a junk food eater, by choice, he prefers healthy foods.  He does eat a lot of pasta in his diet but no more than he was before the weight gain.  I believe he has grown an inch or so in this same time but not enough to substantiate a 9 pound gain.  He was born 10 pounds 8 ounces and was 22 and a half inches long.  He has always been big, his head, hands and feet are huge and because of this along with his hypotonia and developmental delays a family friend who is also a pediatritian suggested the possibility of Sotos Syndrome.  I am just concerned that my pediatrian is over looking something that might be wrong and not taking my concerns seriously.  At the rate he is going he will 80 pounds before he hits 6 years old.  Any suggestions on a different approach to this that I haven't tried?  I feel confident that it is not his diet as he eats less than any other child in our family and is more than twice their size.  I would appreciate any help you can offer.  Nicole\n\n",

I just assuming since it goes away for 5-7 days it can't be bacterial, but everytime his \"cold\" starts up again he gets thick green snot right away.  Everyone i know says green snot usually means sinus infection or something that need antibotics.  My mom keeps insistanting it must be the same sickness and it ihasn't compeletly going away.  But it seems like it is going away for the 5-7 days.  With each virus sometimes he has a low grade fever and once he had a fever of 103 and then another time no fever.  Anyway, does this just sound like viruses or could the green snot be a clue it is something else?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Llm8221,  Children your son's age get an average of 12-15 viral infections a year-almost all of which are in the winter time.  So, children very frequently get one cold after another.    It used to be widely believed that green mucous was a sign of a bacterial infection (as opposed to clear mucous).  Studies now show that color has little to due with the cause of the infection and both viruses and bacteria can cause green discharge.  If your child gets symptoms that are not going away or are getting progressively worse he should be seen to make sure everything is ok.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Mom123,  Generally, the vocal cords will spasm closed when water hits them causing actual inhalation of water to be minimal.  However, if he's choking when doing this he is causing at least a temporary occlusion of his airway.  There is a possibility that water could get further down into his lungs and cause some problems, or more concerning, it could potentially more significantly block his airway.  The risk is probably low that anything severe would happen from this but it is best not to take the chance since the consequences of such severe things is high.  I would advise against letting him do this.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I have a 3 year old son who in the last month or so has begun having up to 5 bowel movements a day. They are not watery, but completely foul smelling and usually pretty loose. It is generally happening shortly after he eats.   He has recently been tested for various problems due to behavior issues, and wonder if this might be related. His tonsils & adenoids were removed in March, he is on Allergy meds, and currently being evaluated for ADHD. He refuses to potty train, so I am changing diapers with this.   I have tried to figure out if this is all related. Any thoughts?  For additional background, I have had problems with my digestive system all my life - starting with reflux, then dx with \"nervous stomach\", and finally IBS. I know these things can be inherited.   He also had reflux as a baby. Also, over the last couple of weeks, a few times he has said he doesn't feel good, and when I ask where it hurts he points to his chest/upper abdomen area.   I've been thinking maybe celiac? He has lost some weight, but his older brother really thinned out at this age too.  Any help would be appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Kimmad,  There are a few things that can cause these symptoms.  First, and easiest to fix, would be to look into the possibility of your son having too much juices.  This is quite a common cause of loose/diarrheal stools in children.  No more than six ounces a day is recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics.  Assuming this is not the issue, Celiac disease certainly can present with loose stools.  It is also quite common, with some estimates of 1 in 100 people.  Checking for this is certainly reasonable.  I would suggest he see a gastroenterologist.  Ultimately, it may be necessary for him to have an endoscopy to see what is causing his symptoms.   Also, if he is thin it may be worth while checking for cystic fibrosis.  This condition cause cause problems with digestion and result in foul, loose stools.  Follow up with his doctor is important.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "So, my 2 year old is sick with what appears to be a cold. A few weeks ago he had a cold with a low grade fever for one day. He never seemed to feel too bad. Then last week he was cold free. He did have a cough last week, but it was dry cough and i am 99% sure it is from our house being too dry. I was coughing like it too and do not feel sick at all. Anyway, after his week break he got sick again with another cold. Although this time he had a fever yesterday and today, but again low grade. And he woke up this morning without the fever when the fever reducer should have worn out a while ago. The fever today did not kick in until 11:30. I know you will probably tell me to call his doctor and i'm sure i will if he wakes up tomorrow like he was today, but i just know so many doctors are like here it is a sinus infection have an antibotic(sorry, no disrespect)   I wanted to add, that he got lots of viruses last year and his ped said that it is common to get another viruses after one is finished when they are so young. And my son still puts EVERYTHING in his mouth\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Llm8221,  You are correct that it is very common for children to get one infection right after another.  In fact, children his age get an average of 12-15 colds a year, almost all of which are in the winter.  This basically means that just as they are getting over one, they get another one.  The good news about this is that children who get a lot when they are young get sick less when they are older.    So, should you call your doctor?  Maybe not.  If your son has a mild fever but is otherwise OK it is very reasonable to give him some time to get better.  Reasons to call your doctor or have him seen would include: high fevers, continued symptoms for more than 5-7 days, signs of dehydration (decreased urination, return of color in the nailbeds taking more than 2 secs when they are pressed), or if something comes up that concerns you.  Best wishes.\n\n",

If this is the case you may just need to explain this to him.  If, by chance, he is saying that his foreskin balloons up when urinating and takes a while to go back down this may be a sign of a tight foreskin that may require treatment.  The concern would be that the opening of the foreskin may be tight and get trapped behind the head of the penis causing the blood flow to be cut off.  If this happens an emergent circumcision is needed.  Treatment for this condition includes circumcision or a topical high potency steroid can be applied twice a day to the tip for about a month.  This can soften the skin and allow it to stretch normally.  Best wishes.  Best wishes.\n\n",

We have tried milk, crackers, water, pedialyte, breast milk and a pedialyte popsicle.  All came right back up.  I'm worried about her getting dehydrated, as she can't keep anything at all down.  She's only vomited 2 times before tonight, and both times it was a one shot thing and she could nurse without an issue.  There is no fever present, in fact, everything seems rather normal other than the fact that she hasnt really left my lap since about an hour before she started vomiting. But she's not really fussy, and I checked her tummy, she didn't react as though there was any tenderness or pain.  Is there anything I can do, and when should I call her doctor.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Athenahollow,  These vomiting illnesses are very common in children.  Most likely it is due to a virus.  It may also be possible that she also has a bit of food poisoning.  Typically the vomiting part of these illnesses only lasts for a day or so.  Diarrhea may set in after this also.    For your daughter, I would recommend she not take anything by mouth for about 2-3 hours.  After this, begin giving clear fluids like pedialyte or juice but only in small amounts, even as small as 5-10 mls (1-2 teaspoons) every 10-15 minutes.    For an average sized 16 month old, taking in about 2 ounces an hour will prevent dehydration so it doesn't take much.  As she is tolerating these amounts larger volumes may be given.  In some cases, even this small amount isn't enough.  if she is unable to tolerate this volume I would recommend you take her to her doctor or the emergency room.  She may need some IV fluid to help her get through this.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Suzanne,  This condition is referred to as encopresis.  There are a few possible causes.  Most commonly, this occurs due to chronic constipation and stool leaking around the blockage.  The intestines have stretch receptors that signal the need for a bowel movement.  With constipation, the intestines get stretched persistently and the receptors become insensitive.  This is treated by  using stool softeners to keep the stool very soft (almost diarrheal) and having regular bathroom time to keep the colon evacuated.  The softeners often need to be continued for about a year so the colon becomes used to being small again and the receptors begin working once again.  Then the stool softeners can be stopped slowly.    It should be kept in mind that with chronic constipation, often the bowel movements aren't particularly hard because the more liquid stool is leaking around an impaction so that the hard stool is not being evacuated.  In this age, another possible cause is simply that the child is too busy to decide to stop what he's doing to go to the bathroom.  This can be treated by having regular, set bathroom times.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I know this is a frustrating problem, especially since at one time she was sleeping better.  Given that information, I would first rule out any physical ailments such as teething or ear infections.  Room temperatures can also affect her sleep.  Ideally a baby's room would be about 70 degrees F (21.1 C) for optimal sleep.  She should not be overly dressed, but wearing a blanket-type sleeper that won't cause her to become tangled as she wiggles.    Once you are content that there is no physical problem, I would recommend a couple of good books that address the problem because it can be an intense process that will require determination on your part and the knowledge of techniques that have been shown to help.  The No Cry Sleep Solution by Elizabeth Pantley and The Happiest Baby on the Block by Harvey Karp are both good resource books.  I would not recommend any advice that advocates strict feeding schedules, never picking up a crying baby, etc.  You need to get in tune with your baby and just like adults, they have their own individuality.    As a rule babies do best at night when they have adequate sleep during the day.  Don't wait until the baby is exhausted or you pass the prime moment.  As soon as baby seems to be getting tired, go for the nap.  Good napping makes for better nighttime sleeping, even though it seems opposite of what you would expect.  Adults may sleep well when exhausted but with babies that is not the case.    I would expect your baby to need approximately 4 hours of daytime naps (most likely broken into two separate ones) and a total of 14 - 15 hours sleep including day and night.  A typical bedtime based on baby's usual patterns would be around 6:30 or 7:00 PM.    It is possible your baby could be having a growth spurt and requiring more feedings.  While you don't want your baby to become accustomed to sucking herself to sleep regularly, she may actually need to nurse.  Put her down when drowsy but not totally asleep.    Some of these things might be helpful but I realize I cannot give you an absolute answer for the problem.  Patience will be needed as you work towards better nights and it will take a while to establish patterns so don't expect immediate results.  And keep in mind this is temporary.  Before you know it you won't be able to wake her up to go to school (Just kidding - it won't take that long).    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Child with severe back pain - gastroenteritis",
    "content": "HI,   This is a bit of an unusual one I think (and sorry a bit long also)  For the last 6 months or more my 3 year old son has now and again complained about his back being sore. Usually it's just a fleeting moment and then he goes back about his business. On a few occasions when he's been ill (e.g ear/ throat infections) he would tend to mention his back more than usual and even more so than the supposed infected part!  Last Thursday he became ill quite suddenly and was screaming in agony with the pain in his back and head and then vomited after which he perked up a bit. i took him to our GP who didn't even look or feel his back or tummy but rather looked in his ears and throat, diagnosed an ear and throat infection and precribed anti-biotics. By the next morning the little one had sever diarrhoea so I stopped the anti b. For the next few days he continued to have V & D and back pain. By Saturday he was screaming (and screaming and screaming!) about the pain in his back and arching his back constantly so we took him to another GP who gave him a thorough check and diagnosed gastroenteritis. She said the back pain had her stumped and just considered it to be an unusual presentation of the GE.   He has now recovered thankfully but I am concerned about this back pain business. How could a child have severe V and D for 4 days and not once mention a pain in his tummy? I could literally feel his tummy go into spasms that would have anyone else doubled over and yet he arched his back and screamed about the pain there!   I am wondering if he has some strange pain perception pathways...or something ... I'm stumped to be honest! This child has never ever mentioned a pain in his tummy. Even this morning he said his back was sore just before he went to do no2. Is it possible that his normal internal pain perception is referred to his back in some way?  Should I pursue this medically and if so in what direction? I am worried that this could cause problems if there were something more serious going on e.g appendicitis and was missed because of the unusual presentation. If there is something amiss Should it a least be in his notes so that it is taken seriously next time. Though GP2 (on call doc) did a good job GP1 (our family GP) was incredibly dismissive. Time for a change I think.  Thank you for taking the time to read this.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Mr. Palumbo,  The area that you are describing does contain lymph nodes.  Your description is consistent with this.  Lymph nodes can fluctuate in size over time.  In particular, if there is an infection they can increase in size dramatically.  Usually following enlargement, lymph nodes will shrink back down but they may remain slightly enlarged (often about pea sized).  They are generally mobile (move from side to side relatively easily) and non-painful.  If the lump continues to get bigger it is very reasonable to have your new pediatrician evaluate it once you find one.  If the lump becomes painful she should have it checked out sooner.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Sassykitten480,  This is a very common difficulty in pediatrics-when does a fever mean something more serious than a simple cold virus?    The answer to this really lies in the fact that a fever is a symptom of something else going on.  Usually, the causative factor also causes other symptoms.  If your daughter is doing ok except for the fever it is probably reasonable to continue using the anti-fever medicines and have her seen by her doctor if she isn't getting better in a few days.  If she is more ill or concerning to you then it is absolutely reasonable to have her seen in the emergency department.  Even if it turns out to be a simple cold, no one would fault you for taking your daughter in if you are concerned about her.  Often, a big difficulty with ill children is dehydration.  If you feel your daughter is becoming dehydrated she should be seen.  Symptoms of dehydration include: a decrease in urination from normal, increased heart rate (checked by feeling the pulse in the wrist, normal for her age would be less than 140 or so), or an increased capillary refill time of more than 2 seconds (checked by compressing the nail bed of the finger and counting how long it takes for the blood to refill).  One other reason to have her seen would be continued fever in the absence of other symptoms (no coughing, etc.).  Best wishes.  I hope your daughter feels better soon.\n\n",

    "title": "Recurring Ear Infections 6 year old",
    "content": "My son is age 6 years and has already had 3 sets of grommets, the first being at age 2 and the last being August 2006. In the last month he has had a few ear infections and completed 2 x 5 day course of Zinnat. The ears are not that much better. The grommets have come out naturally. Today I had 2 different ENT's tell me 2 different things.  The first one: Not a bacterial infection, prescribed 5 day course of Predeslone 3ml x 2 per day, and Garasone drops , 2 drops 3x per day. The leaflet in the drops says that there are no tests done on children under 8.  The 2nd ENT: It is bacterial as there is puss and brownish/black puss from the ear. Prescribed Zithromax 7.5ml x 1 per day for 3 days and Ciprobay HC Otic, 2 drops, 3 times per day. This dr said that Garasone should not be given to children, especially with grommets due to the toxicity.  Please can you advice. My son has a low grade temperature and it spikes in the evening to over 38 dregrees celcius. I give him Lotem for the pain and fever.  He does have allergies and has Aerius 5ml at night and Nasonex nasal spray.  Many thanks Concerned mother\n\n",

    "content": "Hi MamaT,  You are correct that garasone is not approved for use with children less than eight years old.  Unfortunately, many medications that are used in children are not approved by the FDA because there are not many formal studies on medications in children.  Garasone contains two medicines, gentamicin (an antibiotic) and betamethasone (a steroid).  This is a common combination for ear drops, an antibiotic and a steroid.  I have used gentamicin ear drops frequently.  Betamethasone is a relatively strong steroid.  In ear drops for children I have not used this medicine.  Instead, I tend to use hydrocortisone, a much weaker steroid.    Azithromycin (Zithromax) is an antibiotic that may or may not be an appropriate choice for ear infections.  Most ear infections are caused by a bacteria called streptococcus pneumoniae (about 75% or so).  In many areas, azithromycin is only effective against strep pneumo about 50% of the time.  This is dependent upon the statistics for your area.  I would recommend you talk with your doctor about this.  If resistance is not an issue in your area then azithromycin is a reasonable choice.  Unfortunately, I cannot give you any solid information.  My advice is only based on my experience, not good evidence.    I would recommend you discuss these two options with your son's pediatrician.  This will allow you to get some perspective from a doctor that knows your son and his history.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Kimmad,  I'm not exactly certain why this would be happening but I have a thought.  The nerves that supply the penis with sensation (the pudendal nerves) run through the pelvis.  It may be that due to the constipation the nerves are being pressed on during a bowel movement giving the sensation of pain in the penis.  The other possibility is that your son has a urinary tract infection.  Constipation can increase the risk of getting a urine infection.  If this pain continues it would be a good idea to have your son evaluated to be sure there isn't a urine infection.  If there isn't, treating the constipation would be the next step to try to resolve the pain.  Best wishes.\n\n",

He has noticed for about 7 months now like a air raised bump on the head of his penis on top of the rim. He has no pain, and the bump is the same normal color as the rest of his head and it is a part  the head not on top of it, but like just as if it  were air underneath the bump. When he touches it or pushes it he says it feels just like the sensitivity like the rest of his head. No pain what so ever. It is just troubling his mind cause it is always there and doesnt grow bigger or smaller but just shows more when erect. No other rashes, it looks completly healthy. Please give me your thought on what it might be and if its anything to worry about. He says he has only had oral sex once.  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Annette07675,  It is very likely that this is a simple variation in the skin, such as a skin tag.    If STD's are of any possibility he should be tested.  Really, the only STD that sounds like it would fit this is molluscum contagiosum (which is not necessarily contracted via sexual contact).  MC is a virus that is spread by skin contact.  In the genital region it is commonly an STD but can be spread by other skin contact.    Typically MC bumps are small and have a central dimple.  If it is an MC bump it can be treated to get rid of it.    I'd suggest your son have his doctor take a look at this when he's in the office for his next check up.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I am at the end of my rope with my 3 year old. I'd questioned before about his allergy problems, but he is exhibiting other symptoms that are literally making him impossible to deal with - very much like ADHD.  However, I'm wondering if there is some other medical issue causing his problems, and hope you can point me in the right direction.  Symptoms:  ~frequent bowel movements, up to 5 per day, usually after eating (not watery, but very bad odor) ~Extreme hyperactivity - cannot sit still for more than a few minutes ~Extreme irritability and oppositional behavior - this is getting worse. ~Poor sleeping - has difficulty falling asleep and often wakes up in the middle of the night.  Also a very early riser.  He is also a very restless sleeper, moving around constantly in bed. ~Lots of nasal discharge, often colored.  Again, he had his tonsils & adenoids out, plus tubes in ears, in March.  We are going to the ENT on Wed for further evaluation.  And I've started the steps to evaluate him for ADHD.  He's also been to the allergist, which was not very helpful.  We had his blood and urine tested - all came back normal (checked for lead, diabetes, cbc etc.).  Could there be some other underlying medical problem?  Another specialist I should see?  Could it be endocrine?  Gastrointestinal?  We are really losing it with his behavior, it's become that bad, but if it's medical, I'd want to get that taken care of.  Any insight would be greatly appreciated.  thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Kimmad,  I suspect most pediatricians will be very reluctant to diagnose a three year old with ADHD.  The reason for this is that diagnosis needs the hyperactivity/attention deficit behavior in two settings.  Basically, for children this means at home and at school.  With your son's symptoms I do think there are some other issues that should be investigated.  I'd recommend he see his doctor and have his thyroid levels evaluated.  Also, you mention that he has trouble sleeping.  This may actually be the underlying issue as well.  Children who don't sleep well at night often will have problems with hyperactivity and ADHD like symptoms during the day.  You may want to talk to your doctor about doing a sleep study with your son.  I think you are correct to look for something other than ADHD.  Follow up with his doctor is important.  Best wishes.\n\n",

This acts as a lubricant but could also take care of any slight infection that could also be starting.  As the ear holes heal, there is some scar tissue and sometimes re-insertion of earrings can be a little bit difficult, lining up the hole at the front of the lobe with the one at the back.  Get into good lighting with hair moved aside so you can visualize the back of the lobe as the earring pokes the skin.  This will allow you to see and aim for the proper place.    Of course if you have signs of infection she should see a doctor. Good luck.\n\n",

It was a test that used a radioactive material in food and the transit was monitored.)  Is there a risk of radiation exposure directly from the person or from objects in the house?  This is a great forum. I appreciate the time you put into answering these questions, Dr. Lowe. I read through the old questions and learn a lot. Your patients and their parents are lucky to have you as their dr!\n\n",

The amount of radiation used in the test is very minimal.  It is safe for the patient and is not a danger to those around.  Your baby is in no danger from this study.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Sssz03,  This would be a little unusual for appendicitis.  Appendicitis pain usually starts near the belly button and slowly worsens as it moves to the right lower quadrant of the abdomen.  It also generally does not get better.  Instead, the pain slowly gets worse.  It also does not sound like an allergy to penicillin although penicillin can cause some stomach upset.  These symptoms sound most like it is probably a stomach virus.  Viral gastroenteritis is a very common illness.  It is often fast onset and can cause fever, vomiting, abdominal pain and often diarrhea.  If her symptoms continue or her pain does not continue to improve she should see her doctor.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Anyhow, what we thought had caused it was a halloween costume but we took her out of it as soon as we noticed it but it is now 9:10 at night and the rash has gotten worse. The other thing that is different is that all last week she had bronchitis so she was on amoxicillin. we stopped giving her that medicine yesterday evening and she hasn't received it all day and I was wondering it that could be the cause. She does not seem irritated by it but it has spread over her back, stomache, and her face. it is almost completely covering her legs up untill the diaper area. i called her doctor and they said to wait 24 hours and if it hasn't cleared to take her to the ER or call and make an appt but I wanted a second opinion. Thank you for taking the time to read my question and I hope to hear from you soon.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Kendrasmommy1218,  There are a few possibilities.  I am a little suspicious that this may actually be a rash from the amoxicillin.  If this is what is going on it isn't an allergic reaction to the amoxicillin and it is ok for her to have it in the future.  Amoxicillin can react with some viruses to cause a pink rash that quickly spreads to involve much of the body.  It may be itchy but generally is not.  It can take several days to resolve.  Many viruses can also cause similar rashes on their own without the amoxicillin.  If the rash is not improving, or if she begins to have other symptoms that are concerning to you she should see her doctor.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi StarShine3,  Magnets can be dangerous if swallowed for the following reason.  If more than one magnet or a magnet and a metal object are swallowed they may magnetically stick together in the GI tract.  When this happens they may pinch the bowel or even become attached through two separate areas of bowel causing the bowel to become smashed.  This smashing can cut off blood flow to the area and lead to potentially serious/life threatening situations.  There is at least one case of death reported from this.  If is was for certain only a single magnet and nothing else it should pass just fine.  If there is a chance that there was more than one magnet or another metal object swallowed I would recommend taking the child for an x-ray as soon as possible.  If you are certain it was only one magnet and nothing else that may have been swallowed it is reasonable to wait until tomorrow to get an x-ray.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I would recommend that you consider seeing a counselor as well as consider family therapy.  It is unlikely that simply buying gifts is going to be effective although this can be a first step.  The biggest thing that children want is approval from their parents.  I would suggest that the best thing you can do is spend time with your daughter and tell her how much you love her and how you think she is the greatest daughter ever.  Being able to do this also means recognizing that you may not have had this happen to you in your past.  This is where the counseling for you comes in, to help you recover from this lack and develop mechanisms to cope with this.  If you continue to work at this you'll see dramatic results but it does take time.  Having someone to talk to that can help you recognize issues (i.e. the counselor) is very important.  Now is the best time to start on making this better.  Best wishes.\n\n",

First, it is very likely that your daughter has a viral infection causing her lymph node to be big as well as the inflammation of the eyes.  Based on your description I would agree that your daughter does not meet criteria for the diagnosis of Lupus at this point; however, this is something to continue to monitor as she may develop further symptoms.  Lupus in children may take a year or two to fully develop.  The American College of Rheumatology has developed a series of 11 factors.  4 of 11 is considered fulfillment for a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus.    Follow up with her rheumatologist is important.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Yet, there are times he actually looks like someone punched him in the eyes, and his nose is always stuffy with colored discharge.  He always has a cough (post nasal drip?), does not sleep well and is extremely irritable.  He is on allergy medicine, but it does not seem to be doing anything to help.  About 6 months ago, at 2 1/2 years, he had surgery to remove enlarged tonsils and adenoids, and tubes were placed in his ears due to excessive fluid.  He is currently experiencing many of the same symptoms he had before the surgery, and I know that sometimes adenoids can grow again.  Could this be causing the issues with his sinuses?  Is there anything else that could be going on?  Should he have further testing on the allergies?    Thanks for your help.\n\n",

You've almost described a text-book case.  I would recommend you talk with your pediatrician about  increasing the treatment for his allergies.  3 year olds don't have a fully developed sinus system yet so it makes chronic sinusitis less likely; however, there are some sinus systems that are advanced enough to become infected.  It may be worth a course of antibiotics to treat this and see if he improves.  Treatment for chronic sinusitis is usually 3 weeks of antibiotics.  Adenoids can grow back so this also may be causing some problems.  Given all this, I think that it is definitely worth trying to increase your son's allergy control.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I can certainly understand your worry and concern.  The problem with a diagnosis of cerebral palsy is that it is not something that usually happens over night.  It often manifests in subtle ways which could also be indicative of other problems.  So, health care providers are usually cautious in jumping to the term of cerebral palsy.    Parents, like yourself, who have had other children are usually quicker to pick up on unusual behaviors in a child or even just little \"quirks\" that may be nothing to worry about.  In your case it is even more apparent when you have another child at the identical age and stage of life to compare.    Keep notes of the little things you notice that concern you so when you see a doctor or other specialist, you will remember all the symptoms you have noticed.  This can be easily forgotten once you are in the office or clinic.    Keep in mind that babies can be amazing in their ability to compensate for certain neurological glitches.  This is another reason that one usually doesn't jump right on a diagnosis of CP.  A baby's brain can repair itself much easier than an adult brain can.  While the child may have some motor impairments it may be very mild and compensation can be made resulting in great progress in other motor skills.  Also, a baby's nervous system organizes over time  If you are in the U.S. you should have access to services through Early Intervention or other such programs to help in a diagnosis and in treatment. Check with your local health department to inquire about such a program, sometimes referred to as Baby Watch or some other similar sounding name.  You asked if it could be normal.  I would say, yes, this is entirely possible.  As mentioned above, your child's system is still coming together and you may find in time, things will just work out to be fine.  No problem with you being concerned, however.  You are obviously an alert and caring parent.  Getting help early can make a difference in the outcome should there be any delays.  It's always good to check out these subtle behaviors when you see your pediatrician so point them out.  You are with your baby much more than he/she is so you are the expert in her symptoms.  Good luck.\n\n",

He's been on 15mg Prevacid per day since 2 months (7.5 mg BID) as well as Zantac 3x/day.  This has seemed to control the acid, and he no longer has a stridor.  Consistently, he has been congested, and has been diagnosed with sinusitis & AOM several times.  Each time he was put on an antibiotic, the congestion clears, he has less mucus, and I have a happy baby.  Consistently each time he completes it, the congestion returns full force.  Other illnesses:  pink-eye, which turned into yeast diaper infections, RSV, which turned into bronchiolitis with wheezing and required a nebulizer, severe adenoid hypertrophy which required surgery at 10 months (he also had tubes put in his ears at that time), allergies, gross motor delay (because of the GERD), Gastroparesis, Coxsackievirus, tonsilitis.  He also has dysphagia and can only tolerate and swallow purees.  Today, he developed oral thrush.  I'd like to get an outsider's opinion.  Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Kimmad,  Initially in hearing all these illnesses my first thought was that this sounds like a normal 1 year old.  1 year olds get an average of 12-15 infections per year.  The infections you are describing sound like typical child illnesses.  You may want to consider having him evaluated by a developmental pediatrician for his gross motor delay to see if there is anything more to this.  The surgeries he's had (tonsillectomy and ear tubes) are quite uncommon for a child of this age.  Because of this I am presuming that these infections have been fairly severe.  If there is concern about a possible immune problem I would recommend he see an immunologist.  Also, if your child's primary care doctor is not a pediatrician I would suggest you consider changing to a pediatrician if possible.  Pediatricians have more experience treating chronic illnesses in children.  In general, my recommendations are to be conservative with children at this age since most problems they'll grow out of.  We don't want to do harm to them while treating something that will go away eventually anyway.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Dr. Lowe, Thank you for your quick reply.  We do see a pediatrician only, believe me, I've seen more of them than I care to!  I probably should have mentioned that he received PT for the motor delay and is now right on track, and beginning to walk.  We are working on OT for the swallowing problems.  He only had adenoidectomy/tubes because his adenoids were completely blocking his airway, causing him to have problems breathing through his nose.  He also had a great deal of fluid in his ears, and the infections were becoming antibiotic resistant.  Obviously, we saw a pediatric ENT for that, and did agree that while he was young, it would help.  Unfortunately, haven't seen much help yet (although he has only had one ear infection since the tubes).  The thrush bothers me because I know it's uncommon for babies over 6 months or so to get it.  I have always associated this with an immune deficiency.  We just had some blood drawn for RAST testing and immune testing, after seeing the allergist/immunologist.  We're waiting for the results.    His file at the pediatricians is larger than both of my other boys combined.  I have been in and out of all kinds of specialists offices trying to figure out why he is always sick - ENT, GI, Allergy, etc.  He's been poked and prodded so many times, he's actually used to it.  I didn't know if there was something I'm missing.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Mom32,  Pectus Excavatum is relatively common.  For most people it does not get worse.  It simply remains as a small indentation.    For some it can progress, and in some cases it can be quite severe.  When the indentation becomes severe enough to start causing problems there is a surgical procedure to help fix the problem.  Basically a metal bar is inserted under the rib cage to hold it back in the correct position.  This surgery is fairly major and generally is not done unless it is really needed.  I would recommend you continue to follow this.  If the pectus begins to deepen you can discuss it with your doctor again.  Odds are that it won't.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "3.5 year old boy  Had several ear infections when 9 months to 18 months.  Did NOT get tubes.  This is his only history.  Since turning 3 (Feb), he has had recurring fevers with headaches.  His fever normally runs between 101-102 without medication.  We normally cycle him through ibaprofin (sp?) and tylenol (both children's form).  This almost always brings down his fever for a spell.  Once the fever is down, he normally acts as if he is not sick, only rarely complaining of the headache.  Over the past 7 weeks he has been affected by this 3 times.  He was sick for about five days; better for three weeks; sick again for six days; better for six days; and is now sick again.  He went for a CT scan two weeks ago.  It came back clear.  His pediatrician believes that it is allergies.  He put him on Nasonex and another allergy pill (it escapes me) two weeks ago.  I cannot find anywhere online where it says that fevers are common with allergies.  Do you have any other ideas as to what could be going on here?  I'm going to take him back to see his doctor tomorrow and would like to have some ideas to bounce off of him.  thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Sdmcmonkeymcbean,  You are correct that generally allergies are not associated with fevers.  The most common reason for children your son's age is that the child gets recurring viral infections.  Children his age get an average of 12-15 colds per year, mostly clustered in the winter time.  This means that often just as they are getting over one cold they get another one.  If these fevers continue it may be worth doing some screening labs such as a CBC and CRP.  If there is concern for a possible immune problem (although this history doesn't make me particularly suspicious of one) there are some initial simple screening labs that can be done for this also.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Also, the cough is a protective mechanism to help clear the lungs of all the gunk that builds up in them with an asthma exacerbation.  Her continued cough may actually signal insufficient control of her asthma (reactive airways disease).  That being said, sometimes the cough can be so significant that it makes it difficult for children to sleep, etc.  The cold and cough medicines are basically safe so it can be worth a try of these medicines.  If you find that they really aren't helping I would recommend not giving it anymore.    If her cough is not continuing to improve I would recommend she see her pediatrician again for a reevaluation of her asthma.  Best wishes.\n\n",

This is not dangerous and typically resolves with age.  Seeing a rheumatologist is reasonable but it is very unlikely to be a rheumatologic problem at that age.  I don't think seeing a cardiologist will be of much help either; however, the specialist's job is not just to figure out problems.  They are also a very valuable source of reassurance that everything is OK.  So, if you are concerned I would say it is very reasonable to have the cardiologist see your son.  Best wishes.\n\n",

When he is sleeping  or relaxing his hand, I am able to straighten the \"bend\" at the tip without difficulty, but is seems to favor staying  a little flexed.   Do you think this is a problem?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Monica2980,  The urine test for blood sugar is an indirect measure of blood sugar levels.  When the blood sugar levels rise above a certain level (variable but usually around 180) the kidney is no longer able to reabsorb all the filtered sugar and sugar begins to rise in the urine.  The tests are quite accurate.  There are other tests that can be used to look for rising blood sugars.  These include fasting blood sugar levels and a test called Hemoglobin A1c.  The Hemoglobin A1c is a long term measure of blood sugar levels.  If they are generally elevated this test will show an elevated level.  Typically, diabetes begins to present with increasing thirst, increased urination and increased hunger.  Type 2 diabetes (insulin resistance) that commonly goes along with obesity can often be somewhat asymptomatic so occasional testing is reasonable.  The urine test is nice in that it doesn't need a painful blood draw and can be done rapidly in the office.  One may also notice a darkening of the skin around the neck and on the knuckles.  This would be an indication of insulin resistance and can be an early indicator of developing diabetes.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Archiebald,  There are a few possibilities.  Most commonly, this will be due to reflux.  All babies reflux to some degree.  Some will be more severe than others.  Doing things like keeping her upright for about 30 minutes after eating, frequent burping during feedings and elevating the head of her bed when she sleeps can help this.  In some cases the reflux can be severe enough to require medications.  This time of year is also viral gastroenteritis season (stomach flu).  If she also has diarrhea or a slight fever she may have  a virus causing her to throw up more.  One other thing that doesn't sound like it fits as well but should be kept in mind is a condition called pyloric stenosis where the muscle of the stomach outlet (the pylorus) becomes swollen and blocks of the ability of the food to exit the stomach normally.  When this occurs it classically produces projectile vomiting where it appears that the baby vomits and it shoots across the room.  If the vomiting gets worse she should be evaluated by her doctor.  Best wishes.\n\n",

If you believe these are infected she should see her doctor as soon as possible.  If it is just red from the bite you can try using an over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream (0.5% or 1%).  It can be applied 2 or 3 times per day for a short period of time (no more than a few days) to help the itch some.  This cream is a bit weak but it is the strongest that can be bought without a prescription.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Concentrate on changing his diet by encouraging lots more fluids (water, juice; not soda or milk).  If he is even a little bit dehydrated, constipation will result.  To encourage this you might give him some popsicles or frozen juice bars.  Try to increase his dietary fiber.  Don't allow him white, refined flour bread, but give him whole grains only.  His cereal should consist of whole grains such as oatmeal, cream of wheat, granola; not sweetened \"fun\" cereal.  You can also add bran into some of your cooking to increase his fiber. Make bran muffins and add little treasures such as dried fruit and raisins.  Top the muffin with some fruit jam, honey, or cream cheese to make it fun.  Fresh fruits and vegetables should be provided abundantly.  Try to make these foods fun and appetizing with dips, etc.    Then work on the bowel training by making some fun potty time.  Create a positive atmosphere with books to \"read\" or something to listen to while he tries to perform.  Give him a footstool and help him be comfortable without pressure and stress.  However, you do want to do this at regular intervals following a meal.  Even if he doesn't feel the urge, getting this habit going will often result in a more relaxed experience with less \"holding.\"  Try to be mostly matter-of-fact about this, not saying anything that adds more pressure and stress to the situation.  Just explain that this is what he needs to do to feel better, just as you might let him know he must take a bath, etc. - just part of life, but it can be made pleasant.  I know this is frustrating but it can be overcome with patience and creativity.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I am really confused as to what my next step should be.  My daughter will be 3 in October, and was born at 24 weeks premature.  She weighed 1# 10 oz, and stayed in the level III NICU for 165 days.  Durring that time she had many many issues but the ones most relevant would be: Left IVH Grade 3: onset 10/10/04, self resolved 01/13/05 and Venticulomegaly-Post-Hemorrhagic: which was supposed to have a follow up MRi, but never did.  Currently she has been displaying numerous developmental delays, including a 18 month expressive language delay, receptive language delay of 16 monthes,  Adaptive skills, personal social skills, and cognitive skills delays.  She has also been recently diagnosed with sensory intergration disorder.  All of which she recieves speech, developmental and occupational therapies for.  Her current doctor has not been her doctor since birth, but does have all of her medical histories.  And is not specialized in any subfield of pediatrics.  Before I took it upon myself to have my daughter tested for developmental delays I brought up the concern 4 seperate times to the Doctor, but always got the same reply of, \"oh she's fine, some develop slower than others.\"    Now my concern is that even though she was premature she is showing numerous areas of huge gaps in development.  I am really concerned that the IVH has left some sort of damage that we don't know about because no one has followed up on it since we left the NICU.  When I voiced my concerns to the doctor over this, he told me not to worry and wait it out and things will get better.  Could her current \"issues\" be due in part to a larger underlying problem from the IVH?  From what I understood in the NICU there could be varying degrees of damage from the IVH, was this understanding correct, and if so what steps should myself and my medical team be taking to access the outcomes and ensure she is recieving all the help she needs?  Or all these symptoms classic of something else tottally not IVH related?  Sorry for all the questions... Sometimes this whole thing can be overwhelming! Thank you!\n\n",

I would recommend that your child have a formal developmental screen.  If there is a developmental pediatrician in your area this would be an excellent resource.  Continuing the therapies will also be important.  It is possible that her development is slow but normal; however, there is a good chance with her prior IVH that her development may not be normal.  Formal testing is the best way to determine this.  If a developmental pediatrician is not available or there is no way to have a formal evaluation done, there are developmental scales (such as the Denver II developmental scale) that can be used by your regular pediatrician to get a better sense of her developmental status.

    "content": "Hi BATCThomas,  Prednisolone is a very common medication to use for an asthma flare.  It typically is dosed at a range of 1-2 millograms per kilogram per day.  Some pulmonologists will push the dose up to 4 mg/kg/day.  Double check the strength of the solution to verify that I am correct but typically prednisolone syrup is a concentration of 15mg/5 ml's (or 3 mg/ml).  If this is correct 6.6ml would be 19.8mg.  I don't know your daughter's weight so I'll leave the rest of the calculations to you.  Pounds can be converted to kilograms by dividing her weight in pounds by 2.2.  I hope this helps some.  Let us know if you still have questions about this.  Also, if you are concerned the dose is too much you should contact her doctor to verify it.  Medication errors do occur occasionally (despite the multiple safety checks) so it is always wise to verify dosing.  Best wishes.\n\n",

It is thought to be caused by pressure, typically from a shoe strap, essentially causing a callous to form on the bone creating a prominence that can be quite painful.  An 18 month old would not be expected to be experiencing such an irritation to cause this.  There are some other bony anomalies that can occur in children that can present similarly.  You may want to request a referral to an orthopedic specialist for further evaluation.   Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Momof2K's,  Oral ulcers can occur for a few reasons.  Testing for herpes was completely appropriate.  How was this done?  To accurately test for herpes a swab must be taken of the bottom of an ulcer, not the fluid.  If this was done properly and the culture was negative it is unlikely to be the herpes virus.  Also 2 months is a bit of a long time for herpes ulcers to remain.  Other possibilities include a condition such as Crohn's disease or a rare disease called Behcet's disease.  He is pretty young to develop Behcet's but it is still possible.  It would also be a good idea to do some screening immunology labs to make sure his immune system is OK.  If the lesions are not resolving I would suggest he see either an infectious disease doctor or an ear, nose and throat doctor.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "My girlfriend and I are concerned about her 1/2 brother and very concerned that his parents have not taken him to see a doctor. He is 3 years old and still not speaking. He does not speak at all besides occasionally saying \"dadadada\" or \"bababababa.\" He is normally silent.  He rarely ever cried, even as an infant. He is in a bilingual house. He can identify some animals, and some letters by pointing to them when asked. (Pointing is his main mode of communication.) He demonstrates that he can hear and that he can understand despite not verbally expressing himself. Still, he responds abnormally to loud noises; he does not acknowledge them. He does not blink, flinch, or otherwise seem to notice loud noises and ignores his name when called. He was slow to walk, he first walked at 26 1/2 months, and never crawled. His father was in his late 50s when he was born. He does not like to drink water, his main source of liquid is watermelon, which, thankfully, he loves. He is not potty trained (no real attempt made thus far), but still rarely urinates. He has always been a chubby boy. He is very social. He loves to hug and rough-house. He seems to lack fine motor skills. He runs somewhat clumsily with his arms held high and tensed. He has been around children, but not regularly.  We have tried bringing up the subject of his slow development before, to no avail. We agree that if we could provide some suggestions or insight his parents would be more likely to seek help.  any suggestions as to what may be wrong?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Kutya,  This is a situation where I would recommend a developmental evaluation.  If it is just that he is not speaking the first step is a formal hearing evaluation.  Even if he is reacting to sounds, it may be that he is hearing muffled sounds and not correct pronunciation causing him difficulties in learning to speak.  It sounds like he may have some other delays as well.  Often, when presented with these cases, the parents will ask me if I believe the child has autism.  It sounds as if this child is very socially interactive.  This argues against autism, although it does not formally rule it out.  My best recommendation it for the child to see his pediatrician to specifically address the concerns about development.  There are scales, such as the Denver Developmental Scale, that can help formally evaluate developmental milestones and if there is a delay.  If there is a problem, seeing a developmental pediatrician may be helpful.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "End Fluoridation, say 600 Physicians, Dentists, Scientists,",
    "content": "In a statement released August 9, 2007, over 600 dentists, physicians, scientists and environmentalists urge Congress to stop water fluoridation until Congressional hearings are conducted. They cite new scientific evidence that fluoridation, long promoted to fight tooth decay, is ineffective and has serious health risks. (http://www.fluorideaction.org/statement ... .2007.html)  Signers include a Nobel Prize winner, three members of the prestigious 2006 National Research Council (NRC) panel that reported on fluoride\u2019s toxicology, two officers in the Union representing professionals at EPA headquarters, the President of the International Society of Doctors for the Environment, and hundreds of medical, dental, academic, scientific and environmental professionals, worldwide.  Signer Dr. Arvid Carlsson, winner of the 2000 Nobel Prize for Medicine, says, \u201cFluoridation is against all principles of modern pharmacology. It's really obsolete.\u201d  Paul Connett, PhD, Executive Director of the Fluoride Action Network (FAN), announced that an Online Action Petition to Congress in support of the Professionals' Statement will soon be available at FAN's web site, http://www.fluorideaction.org.   \u201cThe NRC report dramatically changed scientific understanding of fluoride's health risks,\" says Connett.  \"Government officials who continue to promote fluoridation must testify under oath as to why they are ignoring the powerful evidence of harm in the NRC report,\u201d he added.   An Assistant NY State Attorney General calls the report \u201cthe most up-to-date expert authority on the health effects of fluoride exposure.\u201d   The Professionals\u2019 Statement also references:   -- The new American Dental Association policy recommending infant formula NOT be prepared with fluoridated water.  -- The  CDC\u2019s concession that the predominant benefit of fluoride is topical not systemic. -- CDC data showing that dental fluorosis, caused by fluoride over-exposure, now impacts one third of American children. -- Major research indicating little difference in decay rates between fluoridated and non-fluoridated communities. -- A Harvard study indicating a possible link between fluoridation and bone cancer.   -- The silicofluoride chemicals used for fluoridation are contaminated industrial waste and have never been FDA-  approved for human ingestion.   The Environmental Working Group (EWG), a DC watchdog, revealed that a Harvard professor concealed the fluoridation/bone cancer connection for three years. EWG President Ken Cook states, \u201cIt is time for the US to recognize that fluoridation has serious risks that far outweigh any minor benefits, and unlike many other environmental issues, it's as easy to end as turning off a valve at the water plant.\u201d  SOURCE:  Fluoride Action Network   http://www.FluorideAction.Net\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Sirs,  My son who is 10yrs and 9 months now, has had recurrent tonsilitis for about 7 yrs nows. The frequency is 5-6 in a year and only antibiotics help him get better. His fever then is high grade. most of the doctors ask me to go for tonsilectomy but i am not in favour. He develops pus in either tonsils or both. His strep test was done and there was heavy presence of group G. His ASO is normal. Then again his strep was done and there was no strep growth.  Can any dr. suggest any vitamins etc. that can help be more immune to infections. We have stopped his ketchup. I though the cat home maybe a problem for him but her removal did not work either. I am his father and asthmatic too.  Thank for your suggestions in advance.  Best Regards  Khan\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Khan71,  There are a few things that come to mind when I hear a case like this.  The first, and probably most common, reason I can think of for this is that the tonsils are colonized with strep.  In this case, when a child gets a fever and is tested, the test comes back positive but the bacteria is not actually causing infection.  Instead it is just living there peacefully.  Another possibility is that your son is getting real infections and he is not building up immunity.  This in itself is not particularly concerning; however, if he is getting other infections, particularly with other forms of strep, it may be wise to have him tested for an immunodeficiency.  These are fairy rare.  It was once thought that only Group A strep was concerning for developing rheumatic fever; however, there are now many case reports of other types of strep causing rheumatic fever (although less commonly than Group A).  Strengthening the immune system is generally accomplished by ensuring good nutrition over all and staying physically fit.  Taking a general multivitamin may help, although I am not familiar with any studies supporting this.  Immune studies in children are even less common.  Follow up with his doctor is important.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "My son is 4 years old and up till now has been a perfectly healthy, and active child. This morning I noticed he had a swelling on his chest through his shirt. He took his shirt off and I saw a very large, raised lump. It is not red and is not mushy. It is very hard and feels as though his rib cage has pushed out and feels bone-like but not at all smooth. He is not complaining of any pain and he is acting normal.   I called his pediatrician and he has an appointment soon but I am very tempted to take him to the ER.  Do you have any ideas of what this could be and why it came up overnight??? I am naturally freaked out. There is no sign of brusing and I am with him all the tme and know he has not injured himself.  He does drink tons of milk, could it be a calcium deposit? Any advice or ideas are appreciated as I am going nuts with wondering!!!!\n\n",

He could be having some type of contact dermatitis with sensitivity to some kind of irritant or it could be hives from allergy or unknown causes (called ideopathic).  Sometimes you can treat the symptoms with something like Caladryl lotion but if it doesn't resolve on its own you may need to see a doctor for a prescription treatment.  If the rash is itchy, try to treat symptoms and cut his fingernails to prevent infection due to scratching.\n\n",

At times my right arm will hurt so that it hurts to move it or lift it. It is not muscle pain, it is more of a deep ache in the bones. I told my doctor this but she says muscles are in these areas and I did something without noticing. It has been going on for about a month but worse last two weeks. In the past few weeks I have been getting little red dots on my arms which have spread, I also have some on my legs. They are small and flat like I jabbed myself with a sharp toothpick. My doctor forgot I told her about them and when she looked said she could do a blood test but that they were probably just freckles, maybe from the sun. My mom looked and said they weren\u2019t, especially because I haven\u2019t been out in the sun barely any this summer, I am pale, and have these dots on my thighs and I don\u2019t wear shorts higher than my knees. I also had this purple like rash on my right arm made up of bigger purple flat dots that lasted for awhile, didn\u2019t hurt, and came about for no reason. I have been really tired lately, and have bruises on my legs, one which I have had for three weeks and isn\u2019t going away. My mom is thinking of switching doctors, any advice?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Neverland,  I think you need to have more work up done.  I suspect that the spots you are seeing do not loose their color (blanch) if you push on them.  If this is the case, you likely have petechiae which are really very tiny bruises.  This may be because your platelets are low.  I would strongly recommend a CBC to evaluate your platelets and your red blood cell levels.  There are several things that can cause the platelets to drop.    There really are many different possibilities of what is going on given your symptoms of the rash and the arm/leg pain.  It is a bit too long to discuss in depth.  I would recommend you see your doctor and have some more work up done because some of the things on the list are more severe.   Please feel free to post follow up questions and I'm happy to continue to help give you information.  If you happen to have a few more specifics about what you are experiencing or any lab results I can probably give you some more specific information.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I have a 21 month old boy who does not speak.  He does not say any words.  He understands everything, for instance when I tell him to sit down or not to do something.  He does not know how to wave Hello or bye.  When I say things like, \"Can you say Mamma?\"  He gets mad and grunts at me. He cannot id objects by pointing.  But then again, we have not been teaching him this.   He seems very frustrated and screams and makes his body very stiff when he gets mad.  He can cry a lot. On the other hand, he likes to play peek a boo, laughs, hugs and gets very happy when he sees my husband come home.  He runs to my husband to hug him.  He is in a bilingual home (Italian and English).   And we have not had a normal routine almost since his birth- meaning we travel a lot.   He does not seem to have a hearing problem because he understands my commands.  At the same time - just today I tried making very loud noises - and he didn't turn around.  I don't know if that is because he didn't hear or just because he didn't care.  I try to read books with him - but he won't sit still to even look at the colors.  He just wants to jump around.   Do you have any thoughts on his behavior?  Thank you very much for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "I have some similar concerns about my girlfriend's brother. I feel uncomfortable bringing my concerns to her family, as they were very offended when I mentioned something earlier. Their apparent lack of concern has driven me here. He is 3 years old (Tuesday) and and only occasionally babbles (dadadadada, or bababababa). I've been told he has, on occasion, said his sister's name when he gets excited about her coming, though I've never heard it myself. He is in a bilingual house as well. His only mode of communication is pointing.  He seems to understand some of what is said to him, though he seems to ignore much of what is said to him. He also almost completely ignores loud noises. Yelling his name or loudly clapping just out of his visual field elicits no response -- not even a flinch or a blink. He likes to have books read to him. He turns the pages (by pushing them with his index finger) one at a time. He points to the pages as well, but he doesn't seem to follow the stories. He can apparently distinguish the different languages and brings the books to the appropriate reader. He did not walk until approximately 22 1/2 months and never crawled. He loves to horse-play and does not avoid touching. He is not potty trained. I believe a fragile X test was performed shortly after birth, and it was ruled out. He has a developmentally disabled (maternal) aunt. His father was 55 at the time of his birth.\n\n",

Of course if you see any signs of dehydration or she becomes lethargic, her eyes and mouth become dry, etc. it could be a sign she needs to drink more.  But, considering a scantily dressed person who exercises and sweats a lot without becoming dehydrated, it is unlikely that she will be in danger.  You did not give her age and the younger the child the more the concern about possible dehydration.  Babies can become dehydrated very quickly with diarrhea but adults do not.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Sasha1245,  There are many causes of enlarged lymph nodes.  Most commonly it is due to a recent infection that the lymph nodes are helping to fight off.  The infection may be in the arm or possibly in the chest (a pneumonia or other infection).  If your son is otherwise well, it seems reasonable to continue to monitor the nodes.  If they are enlarging or not going away over the next few weeks to months further testing should be done.  This may include a biopsy of the lymph node to see what is causing it to enlarge.  A repeat ultrasound may or may not be helpful depending on how well the lymph nodes can be felt by direct examination.  Best wishes.\n\n",

So, it is still a possibility that there is a cancer.  That being said, I think the chances are quite low.  Most likely your child may be feeling a lymph node or possibly a lipoma (a benign fat cell tumor).  The ultrasound should be helpful in better characterizing the mass.  If there is still suspicion, a small biopsy can be done to definitively determine what the mass is.  Best wishes.  Keep us updated if you don't mind.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Lovely, I certainly understand your concern, and your confusion.  As your mother learned, sometimes the undescended testicle does come down without intervention, often by one year of age.  If not, there are hormone injections of testosterone that sometimes help encourage the descent.  You could inquire about that.    It is recommended that if it does not descend on its own by one year of age, it should be evaluated.  Sometimes the missing testicle can be felt but often surgery is the only definitive diagnosis.  The purpose of this would be primarily to determine if it is truly an undescended testicle as opposed to a congenitally absent one.  Obviously if there is no testicle there, no further worry.  A man can function fine with only one.    But, on the other hand, if it is present and remains undescended, literature suggests that he could be at higher risk for cancer and the chances are it would be nonfunctional anyway if left untreated.  If the testicle is brought down surgically, it improves his chances for normal function, including fertility.    I hope you will be able to get the care you need for your son to be evaluated by age one.  Good luck and best wishes to you and your son.\n\n",

    "content": "My daughter is 1 1/2 yr old. She had a high fever over 103 for 2 days. We thought maybe teeth so we purchased some infant IBprofun here (We are in Belgium for the next month.)  Later that night (day 2 of high fever) she began breaking out in a red rash which grew to cover her entire body- face, legs,arms,bum,back,ect. The bumps eventually grew to be big bright red spotches and her fever continued. She also has a swollen lymph node on the right side of her head/ where her skull and neck meet. Today is day 3 of the rash and it has started to turn a purplish color and look like she is bruised all over. Her fever has reduced today and she is drinnking again. We took her to the ER here (not easy in another country) on day 1 of rash breaking out and the Dr said she had an ear infection (causing the lymph node to swell) a reaction to something, but advised we see a pediatrician.  He prescribed Augmitin and a nose spray called Nesivine. Today (day 3 of rash, day 5 of fever) we took her to the pediatrician. He said she has no ear infection and advised us to take her off of the Augmitin and also said her rash looked like an allergic reaction. (All this was before it started turning purple), but didn't say anything about why her lymph node would be swollen. We would like to make sure it is nothing more serious... have you heard of anything like this? Would an allergic reaction cause a high fever too? She vomited a few times the other day, but that hasen't been persistant. Any help is VERY appreciated!!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Lipsforchrist,  If I am understanding correctly she has had 5 days of high fevers now.  She has swollen lymph nodes and a rash.    Does she have any redness of her eyes?  Does she have any redness or dryness/cracking of her lips/mouth?  Does she have any redness or skin changes of her palms and soles?  I am concerned that she may have a condition called Kawasaki's disease which is a vasculitis that needs to be treated with a medicine called IVIG.  This disease can cause problems with the coronary arteries.  Early treatment can help prevent these complications (sometimes).  Based on what you have said, she has 3 out of 6 criteria for the disease (fever for 5 days, rash, lymph node swelling).  One generally needs 5 out of 6 to make the formal diagnosis although there are some incomplete forms of the illness.  I am unfamiliar with Belgium's healthcare system but I would strongly recommend she be reevaluated by a doctor and specifically evaluated for Kawasaki's disease.  There are other possibilities of what may be going on but Kawasaki's jumps to the forefront of my mind.  An allergic reaction would be unlikely to cause a high fever.  Best wishes.  Please keep us updated if you are able and let us know if we can be of further assistance answering any questions.\n\n",

These outpouchings are the branchial arches (the inside is the branchial cleft).  During development, normally these recede and develop into other bodily structures.  Occasionally the clefts may not fully close leaving a small fistula.  While having one on each side is less common it occurs via the same mechanism.

He even used to walk ON his toes, currled under!!Since 3 1/2, it has progressively gotten worse and has just recently began to turn into such pain, that it radiates to his calves at times, and he screams in agony. Sometimes to the point we have had to pull the car over and tend to it. The episodes are varried in time. They can occur when he is in the car sleeping, they have occured when we have just put him in the car from being out, they have even occured on the T-Ball field while he is just standing in out-field. A few months ago, he had 3 out of 4 reflexes diminished. At one point his blood count that they said they use for neuopathy tested high, but the subsequent test was normal. Today we had an EMG/Nerve Conduction Study done and it was negative. We were told he clinically had the symptoms of neuropathy, but now that he tested neg. on the EMG, they said no, and have given up helping us.  in fact they tried to suggest it was just psychological, or growing pains. We have had people witness this with us and would beg to differ. The neurologist used to blame it on sensory issues, but the OT said it has nothing to do with sensory, and has witnessed an episode herself. He does have epilepsy and is taking Keppra. The dr's tried Neurontin, but he began to vomit with it. They said he suffers from partial complex seizures. He did have a subdural hematoma that they said was from birth, but it has gone down. Please help. They ahve given up on us and it feels as though noone  believes he suffers this pain.  It is killing us to see our son screaming in pain and noone is helping us figure this out!!!\n\n",

    "content": "I have heard of similar cases before.  Unfortunately, I really don't know that much about it.  I can offer you what I do know, though.  With a normal EMG it makes many of the bad things I can think of (such as spinal muscle atrophy or peripheral nerve degeneration) essentially out of the question.  I would recommend he have is B12 levels, thyroid levels, and general electrolytes be tested.  I would also recommend an EEG and follow up MRI of his brain to see if there may be anything centrally that is causing his pain.  There is also a condition known as reflex sympathetic dystrophy that can be quite painful.  The exact cause of this is unknown as far as I know but it often is seen in conditions associated with stiff muscles or cerebral palsy.  Treatment is through physical therapy.  There are other cases where children are much more sensitive to stimuli than \"normal\".  In some cases, the sensations are so severe that the children can't put on socks due to pain.  I am not familiar enough with them to know how best to treat or diagnose this but I know such conditions do exist.  I would recommend you consider getting a second opinion from a pediatric neurologist or neuromuscular specialist to help guide his work up.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Good afternoon,  My 7 yr old daughter is healthy and ave weight/height for her age. She has had grommets inserted twice in her ears and her adenoids removed. She has been suffering from on/off tummy aches for the past 2 yrs. We have found she is lactose intolerant and so keep her milk intake reduced. She has normal bowel movements and has no hesitation in going to the toilet. We have been keeping a food dairy but nothing seems to be consistent when the ache flares up. It can be morning, evening etc. She describes it as being hit with a basketball. We have dewormed her, and tried antacids to no avail. Heat and junior paracetamol seems to work. Would you have any suggestions as to what we might try from here? I appreciate any suggestions of things we could try as she is a dancer/swimmer and this tends to slow her down. She is in a happy stable home (spoilt if anything) so stress does'nt seem to be an issue. Thank you for your time in reading this\n\n",

    "content": "Abdominal pain in children is very common and often difficult to determine exactly what is causing it.  Often it will be a food allergy as you have suspected.  Lactose is a common food intolerance.  The other foods that cause about 80% of allergy problems are: soy, wheat, eggs, fish, shell fish, peanuts, and tree nuts.    There are a few ways to proceed.  One would be to try a strict elimination diet where all these foods are taken out of the diet for a month to see if the pain resolves.  If it does, the foods can be added back in one at a time to see which was causing the problems.    The other way would be to see a gastroenterologist.  The GI specialist can do a few tests.  I would recommend she be tested for celiac disease.  The GI specialist may also want to do an endoscopy where they use a small camera to look in the esophagus, stomach and first part of the intestines.  They'll look for any inflammation and causes of pain as well as take biopsies to see if there is any pathological changes going on.    If the biopsy doesn't show changes consistent with allergic reactions then the food elimination may not be necessary.  Also, the food allergies are not the typical allergy pathway so using things like benadryl generally does not help.  Because of the different pathway the allergy skin testing, which is often recommended, is actually not helpful so I would recommend against having that done.  There are a few non-GI causes as well but the first place to look would be the stomach.  The key to figuring these problems out is persistence.  It can be a long trail sometimes.  Also, keep in mind that almost 100% of the time this pain will go away eventually even if a cause is never found.  Best wishes.  I hope this helps some.\n\n",

She said that the dog was up to date on all of his shots but couldn't provide any proof.  He didn't have any open sores but I'm worried that he might have put his hands in his mouth.   The dog was known to escape the yard and wander but he seemed perfectly healthy for about a week afterward, then she gave the dog away.  I was wondering if he would need to get a rabies shot from simply coming into contact with the dogs water and are there any other potential illnesses I should be worried about.  This happened about a week ago and he doesn't act ill at all. Thank you\n\n",

This essentially is no different. Transmission of diseases such as rabies is typically through a bite that breaks the skin. The risk of disease and occurrence of transmission would be much higher in a wild animal. Again, don't be concerned. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "My 12 1/2 year old son since December has had 5 stomach bugs, bacterial pneumonia and 2 cases of the flu. His doctor did a full met, lytes and CBCD (I think I got the names right) blood test. His Creatine was a little low at 0.5 ml, his chloride was a little low at 100 ml and his alk phosphate was high at 520. A week after the first blood test we decided to do another alk phos. test. This one came back at 518 so we did a bone scan which came back normal. We did another alk. phos. test a week after the bone scan and its now up to 534. He thinks that my son might be going through a growth spurt. My son is not a sports player, but he is on a swim team. Our doctor wants to wait another 2 weeks to do the test again. Should we be checking his liver for disease or proper function? Or am I just getting nervous for nothing. Any suggestions?   Sincerely,  A Concerned Mom p.s he also had his appendix out when he was 10.\n\n",

    "content": "Really, his creatinine and chloride levels are normal for his age.  I would not be worried at all about those.    I would recommend testing a GGT level with his next alkaline phosphatase test.  If the GGT is elevated, the alk. phos. is coming from his biliary tract and he should be evaluated for gallstones, etc.  There is another entity called benign transient hyperphosphatasemia.  This is when the alkaline phosphatase becomes elevated for an uncertain reason and remains elevated for 8-12 weeks then returns to normal.  The alk. phos. levels can become quite elevated (in the thousands).  No real problems are noted other than the elevated lab value.  It is often preceded by a viral illness but the cause is not known.  This condition is more common in infants and toddlers but can be seen into adulthood.  It is sometimes called \"Ulysees Syndrome\" because it leads doctors on a long journey to find the answer during which time the alk. phos. often returns to normal.  If his liver enzymes are normal except for the alk. phos. and he is otherwise well you may want to consider not checking it again for a month or so.  Best wishes.

However, I read that this condition is usually called from steroid creams and affects women aged 20-45. Not 16 months!  I don't use any kinds of creams on my daughter's face. I just wash her face with Johnson & Johnson's baby wash in the bathtub every other day and wipe her face with mild baby wipes or a wet washcloth after meals. I read something about fluoride toothpaste causing this also. The toothpaste I use on her is non-fluoride toddler toothpaste, but I'm wondering about the fluoride levels in our city water supply. I developed fluorosis as a small child growing up in this area with my mom mixing formula with the city water. Is it possible she is getting too much fluoride from the water, and drinking water throughout the day from a sippy cup is causing this?\n\n",

These are very subtle pinpoint red marks (about a dozen at a time) that fade within a few days and don't blanch with pressure.  The only other history he has is of food allergies.  He has urticaria with exposure to milk and eggs.  He gets inadvertently exposed to milk occasionally with resultant hives.  He is also allergic to peanuts although has never been exposed.  Could the petechiae be related to the accidental milk exposures?  The pediatrician said, \"We see this in healthy kids (the petechiae), \" and diagnosed it as \"local irritation\" from his car seat perhaps.  I am not 100% satisfied with the explanation and worry a lot about this child.  He is happy, healthy, eating, sleeping, otherwise.  Thanks so much in advance.\n\n",

    "content": "It is unlikely that the petechiae are related to the milk exposure.  There are several conditions that can cause recurrent petechiae.  Most of them are ruled out in your child since the CBC was normal (specifically the platelet count was not low).  It may be that your son had a recent infection that has left his capillaries a little weak.  Then trauma, such as from a car seat strap, could cause small breaks.  It is also possible to get some petechiae with significant coughing or straining (such as with constipation).  There is a condition called Henoch-Schonlein Purpura that can give petechiae without a low platelet count; however, it generally is focused on the legs and buttocks and the petechiae tend to coallesce into larger areas called purpura.  Based on your description, I would not be suspicious of this.  If your son continues to get petechiae you may want to have him seen by a hematologist to get some platelet function testing, although since he is not having nosebleeds, etc. I think his function is probably normal.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I can asure you that it was not from crying or the pain of the shots, this is why I have been so consurned. As we no all children react differenty and something happened to my child that shouldn't have and I no it was from the six shots. Yes next time I will allow two shots at a time weather it effects my work or her going to school.. The end result of all this taking place to begin with was unnessary because of an office that hadn't loged in her shots and my paper meant nothing to them. What is loged into the system is what counts. I thank you all so much for writing me and I will tell all moms about your site.\n\n",

The rash that you are describing is that of what my daughter had it was on her face, mainly all over but worse on her buttox. I was not convinced viral but the doctors wanted to watch her so they did. Two days after her fever went down it came back and there were more symptoms she didnt want to walk her ankles and her knees were bothering her so i rushed her to the er scared out of my mind. Come to find out the rash on her body was purpura, perticki how ever you spell it. Basically tiny spots of blood pooling under her skin. They checked her white blood count and that was high. She had blood in her urine and she was pale and looked awful. The er doctor knew what it was he diagnosed my daughter with henoch-sholiens-purpura. Its RARE but it can be serious i would watch you child and go with your gut feeling. Thankfully my baby escaped with out any kidney damage and she is currently ok, even the athritis like symptoms went away and her counts look better. If its this then if it is bad then your child would be bad off if it was a bad case. Im not by any means trying to scare you, but HSP is often started by a virus and i think that your child needs to be looked at more closely. Good Luck!\n\n",

I would recommend a pediatric mental health specialist.  Since I don't know your situation I don't know what options you have but you could see a therapist.  I would recommend someone who deals with children.  Is there any possibility your son may have ever been abused?  Keep in mind, these things sometimes happen even in situations you believe are perfectly safe.  Ask your child if he has ever been touched by anyone in the area covered by his underwear - that kind of thing.  Don't act shocked, but keep it as matter-of-fact as you can.    Your parenting should not be called into question unless you have done something to harm your child (if you have any issues, you could also seek mental health care).  If there is an adult or even an older child who is abusing your child, authorities should be notified but just because your child has behavior problems doesn't mean you are a bad parent.  These symptoms can indicate some psychological problems but these things often have a physiological or psychological basis and are not the fault of parents who are trying to do their best.  Your therapist might also be able to get you in touch with some possible classes, etc. so I do hope you will be able to find this resource.    There are behavior therapy units associated with children's hospitals, schools, and clinics.  Something like this might eventually be helpful as well.  Let us know if we can do more.\n\n",

If you don't get the answers you need, keep going up the chain until you find someone who will address your concerns.  You should have some choices.\n\n",

My daughter is generally well-behaved and obeys when prodded.  I am worried that she might progress slowly and she might imitate undesirable behavior.   Your advise enlightened me and I think I really should insist that since my child's case is only \"mild\", she should be in a vertical or mainstreaming group.  The nearest SPED school from us is not a very big school, that is why I think they cannot afford to strictly segregate children according to their individual cases.  Anyway,  I appreciate your spending time in giving your opinion.  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "This is concerning my 6 yr. old daughter. She has has problems with her bowel movements since she was an infant. At first it seemed to be constipation. Her doctor had us try a few different things at home to help her but the only helped for a little while. As she got older, I noticed she was having very infrequent bowel movements. Again, we consulted the doctor and she advised us to try a variety of other things (mineral oil, Metamucil, suppositories) The suppositories were the only thing that seemed to help and, once again, only for a little while and they were very painful to her and very large. Presently, we have been giving her fiber supplements and they also seemed to be helping the first couple weeks. Now they don't seem to be helping at all. She has a bowel movement maybe once a week. She was just up crying in the middle of the night because of pain in the intestinal area. I don't know what else to do. My husband says that it is probably gas because we haven't exactly eaten great over the weekend. I think that it's something more serious than that. We also have a 4 year old son who does not eat as well as his sister as far as eating the healthy stuff and he has a bowel movement at least once a day. I am at my wit's end about what to do. Please, please help!\n\n",

    "content": "As long as your child is constipated and having large stools, she is likely to withhold to avoid the pain, until she has no choice and by then, of course, there will be more pain.  So it is critical that you get the constipation under control.  Here are some suggestions.  Make sure she is getting a minimum of 3 glasses of water or juice daily.  More won't hurt.  Give her a special take-along water bottle to help encourage her to sip constantly.  You take your own water bottle along too so you can model the behavior you want her to learn.  Make sure all her cereal choices contain plenty of bran and fiber.  Encourage lots of fresh fruits and vegetables.  Try to make them more interesting, add a dip or try something new.  Kids can sometimes enjoy a new taste and texture.  Don't offer these only as a choice with other foods she likes better.  Who wouldn't choose the brownie over the carrot?  Take a bag of good choices along in the car for snacks so it feels like a treat.  Dried fruits make a tasty snack (not the packaged \"fruit\" snacks which are not real fruit).  Avoid too much rice, low-fiber bread, bananas and cheese.  Some children can't handle cow's milk for this reason.  You might try switching to a soy based milk for a time to see if it makes a difference.  You can get this in a chocolate flavor which may make it more palatable.  If you find milk is an offender, you should give her supplements to replace the calcium and vitamin D she may be missing but some people become constipated with some types of calcium or iron so care should be taken in selecting the right supplements.  Suppositories are sometimes the only thing that will \"unclog\" but hopefully you can do some prevention with other treatments so the suppository use can be decreased.    You should encourage your child to have regular bowel patterns. Have your child sit on the toilet for about ten minutes after meals 1-2 times each day.  Provide books to browse or other tactics to make it a positive experience and to encourage enough time there to get things moving.  The use of simple rewards or a daily calendar with stars or stickers for days that your child takes her medicine and has a bowel movement may be helpful.    This is not a problem you will be able to cure over night but with patience and perseverance she may get good results.  Good luck with this frustrating problem.\n\n",

I felt I should also mention that sitting 10 minutes a day did not begin to work until he was on a gluten free/dairy free diet.  Alot of people (even a doctor I saw) did not connect constipation with Celiac Disease or gluten intolerance.  Most people associate diarrhea and wasting with it.  Also, even my pediatric GI , who I loved, never suggested dairy as a possible offending food.  He has been gluten free for 2 years but only dairy free for 2 months.  He still tries to withhold, I believe out of habit, but when I force him to sit, he does go.  Good luck.\n\n",

For cases with severe symptoms, treatment can help shorten the course.  Erythromycin is the drug of choice but there are other alternatives if your son cannot tolerate it.  Regarding mixing the medicine, there are several different forms of erythromycin, some can be mixed and some cannot.  I would advise you to contact your pharmacist to get instructions for your particular prescription.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "HOw do I know if I got a nipple yeast infection. My  nipples resentlly became deep pink color and itch. I noticed pain while pumping milk only once, maybe a week ago, and once I had some shooting pain without breastfeeding or pumping. What can this be? Docotor told me it's nipple thrush, my baby has no symptoms, my only symptoms are red nipples and itching. My mother tells me there is no such thign as nipple thrush. My docotor told me to treat myself and the baby who has no symptoms. IS this the right thing to do. What else can be causing this. I pump most of the time, because my kiddo has a hard time at the breast, but this is the first time my nipples got this bad. IS this nipple thrush for sure? HOw to I treat it properlly, how soon will this go away, how do I knwo my child is not infected or is infected if he has no symptoms?\n\n",

    "content": "Thrush in a baby presents as white spots or patches often on the tongue and cheeks that don't easily wipe off.  If a baby is breast feeding the mother should treat her nipples when the baby has thrush.   It is absolutely possible for a mother to get a thrush infection on her nipples. Often the symptoms are described as a cracked or burning feeling.  Some have described it as pins and needles.  Treatment is relatively simple.  If one is not breast feeding, over-the-counter clotrimazole can be applied 3 times per day until 3 days after the symptoms have resolved.  If the mother is breast feeding, nystatin shoud be used and the baby should be treated orally with a nystatin solution until both mom and baby are symptom free for 3 days.  If you're unsure about the diagnosis you should see your doctor.  Your symptoms may also be due to a slight bacterial infection of the breast.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I break out in all these little red dots that are all over my body, back, legs, neck, chest, and arms. Some times they have a white dot in the middle of them. When they come on they feel like thousands of needles are poking me. When i come in side and eather get a ice pack or jump in the shower with ice cold water it goes away. No more poking and no more red dots. I also noticed that when i get hot i do not sweat. I feel my arm and there is no sweat on it what so ever. I have tried prickly heat powder and it was doing beter but now it is back and worse then it was. I shower at least once every day and some times i shower 2 times a day. I went to our local hostpidal and all they said was \"I don't know what to tell you.\" I have been on a antihistamine and it doesn't seem to help any.  Thanks for your time\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Johndeerefan, Sounds like you are afflicted with anhidrosis - an inability to sweat.  The symptoms you describe are commonly called \"heat rash\" or \"prickly heat\". The description you give is exactly how these bumps appear, and the manner in which you eliminate them also the easiest way to do so.  I would however suggest you discuss your concerns with your physician, because the cause of your anhidrosis may lead to more serious concerns than simply a rash, and needs to be identified.  Also, the inability to sweat means you have the potential to become severely dehydrated and overheated, since sweating is our primary way of eliminating excessive heat from our bodies. Your family physician can tell you what tests are necessary to identify the source of your problem. In the meantime, as we approach summer, please guard yourself from becoming overheated, and be sure to be drinking enough water to support toxin removal and hydration.\n\n",

The kidneys are protected by the ribcage so the pain of a kidney infection would probably not be as low as you describe here, though pain can radiate to other parts of the body besides the point of origin.  Of course it could be viral but if the fever spikes to 104 I would think more testing should be done to find out why.  I assume he isn't suffering from a stiff neck along with this (which could indicate meningitis).  I think I would either return to the doctor who saw him or get a second opinion.\n\n",

Occasionally, one PPI may work better than another-although generally they all work well.  Your daughter may need to have a 24 hour pH probe evaluation done to better characterize how severe her reflux is.  Also, if she is still having problems with the ulcers a medication such as sucralfate may help.  This medicine binds to the irritated areas and helps them heal.  A surgical procedure known as a fundoplication (commonly of the type called a nissen fundoplication) can be helpful but often surgery is avoided in children.  She should be tested with H. pylori as well.  This is a bacteria that can cause ulcers and gastritis.  Treatment for this is typically with 3 medications, one of which is a PPI.  Follow up with a GI specialist will be important.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi I have a 17 yr old daughter that up until a year and a half ago was very healthy.  Never sick other than colds and such.  A yr and a half ago we found out she had Interstitial cystitis (IC).  then in late december of this year she developed a very sever DVT that started 3 inches below your right lung and ran down the right side of her body to just below mid calf.  At the same time we also found out that she has (PID) Pelvic Inflammatory Disease, four diffrent types of blood disorders that affect cloting and that she has cysts on her overies.  Now last monday we found out that she has Polycystic Ovaries really bad and may not be able to ever get pregnat even with fertillity drug theropy and fiberious cysts in her breast and they are also checking her thyroid to see if her levels are low.  Also she has high cholostrol, this is strange since I have always provide a very well balanced diet for all my children, and suffers from low blood sugars now also.  My main question is why is she so sick all of a sudden and if all these diseases could be symptoms of a something else.  She is just about to the end of her rope and on monday broke down crying because she can't take much more.  She is starting to have some depression about all this.  Also her dad and I were wondering what type of doctor we could take her to that could help us find the causes of all the illness.  Right now we are seeing 4 diffrent doctors and they don't really communicate with each other.  Any help would be appreciated. Thanks\n\n",

Sometimes, especially with gynecological problems they do not show up until the hormone levels from puberty are well established.  Diet is not usually a major contributor to the many problems she seems to be having.  As to seeing one doctor for all these issues, that may not be the best course.  Your daughter is dealing with so many different body system problems that she may do better with specialists in those areas rather than trying to find a physician who may not have the expertise in all these areas.  Because of the issues of being so young and dealing with so many life-changing diseases, I really recommend she receive couseling to learn how to adjust her life to be able to cope not only with how the disease affects her but in how to live  a full life in spite of them.  Learning to cope with illness is hard, even for an adult, and she may greatly benefit from support and treatment from a counselor or therapist to help her to deal with these issues.   I wish you both well, Carolyn LPN\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I'm writing regarding my 18month old son.  He had a normal, healthy  pregnancy and birth.  About two months ago, my son became ill with what  seemed to be a cold that would not go away.  After three weeks of a  cold it turned into RSV, followed by 2 ear infections.  My son was treated  with Amoxicillin, which he has taken for his past 5 ear infections,  with no complications.  Three weeks after the ear infection he began  vomiting.  The vomiting started off as once a day. He then began vomiting  several times a day.  He vomited for 11 days.  He ended up losing 3 pound  over this month and a half period.  The doctors were stating that the  vomiting was antibiotic associated.  Although he had not  had any meds  for over 3 weeks.  Following my gut I took him to the ER for a second  opinion.  They found a \"poop ball\" from a x-ray. They prescribed an  enema.  The vomiting continued with diarrhea, for a total of eleven days.   We wer ethen refered to an ENT specialist for possible large  abnoids, chronic ear infections.  The ENT feels that the vomiting was  NOT caused by any ENT problem.  So that is why I am writing you.  I  have exhausted the doctors looking for an answer.  However I read  something on your site about milk consumption iron deficiency anemia.  My son  LOVES his milk.  AT our WIC appointment, his iron was low.  This now  leads me to believe he might be anemic.  Do any of these symptoms sound  like milk consumtion iron defieciency anemia.  Please write back with  your response.  Concerned Mother,    Amanda Branham amanda-branham@sbcglobal.net\n\n",

    "content": "It would be unusual for iron deficiency anemia to cause these problems.  Most likely he has contracted a viral stomach illness.  Children his age typically will have around 10-12 viral infections per year (mostly in the winter season).  This means that they basically go from one infection to the next.  Large amounts of milk consumption can cause iron deficiency which leads to anemia.  Unfortunately, the screening used at most WIC centers only tests for hemoglobin levels.  This method is very inaccurate for diagnosing iron deficiency.  I would recommend that your son see his pediatrician for a CBC that will give much more information regarding whether or not he is anemic and if it is likely from iron deficiency.  Amoxicillin is well known to cause diarrhea but generally doesn't cause much vomiting.  Best wishes.\n\n",

She is not sick, fevered, and has no other symptoms, her eye is not red, and she is not complaining of it hurting or being bothersome.

    "content": "First off I would like to say thank you for your help. My question is about my 18 month old. I have read through all the posts and didn't see anything like this...  Let me get into a little history of mother and dad for my son. My husband the father has torrets(ticks) and add or adhd I don't know which one. I have depression and hormonal imbalences. My 18 month old when he wakes up or gets woken up (EVERYTIME) he shakes... and I don't mean like a seizure but not light either. Its his whole body but mainly from belly botton up. And it doesn't only happen when he wakes up its when he drops something or gets mad or fustrated and other times. I can't for sure say everything that makes him shake. because it happens so much we have all gotten used to it and don't pay any mind to it.. unless he starts really bad.. I hate to see him get woke up though because he shakes so bad it makes me freak out. I have taken him to his doctor and she said it was normal. Now I have asked around to other moms and they said their kids have NEVER done it and it is not normal. I have never known of this happening. He gets a lot of sleep and is active like a normal 18 month old. I don't know how else to explain it. I thought it might be torrets pasted down from his dad and I asked the doc about that to and she said torrets is a clinical diagnosed thing not a specialist and the shaking is normal. I just need help. I know its not normal and I want to make sure He will be okay! Thank you\n\n",

    "content": "It is unlikely that these are seizures.  I say this because seizures that involve both sides of the body essentially require the patient to be unconcious.  This would not be possible while standing (he would fall to the floor).  Also, it would be extremely uncommon for Tourette's to develop at this young age.  It is possible that it is a learned behavior to certain startle conditions.  It is also possible that he has an exagerated startle response.  These are both relatively normal things.    The main thing to notice are: 1) Are they becoming more severe? 2) is your son continuing to meet his developmental milestones? and 3) are there any associated findings such as after the episode he seems unresponsive is he complaining of other neurological symptoms such as headaches, difficulty walking, etc.  Continued follow up with your doctor is important to ensure normal growth and development continues.    If there is concern, you may consider requesting an evaluation by a developmental pediatrician.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Your doctor is quite likely to be correct.  The most likely explanation of this is a normal reactive lymph node.  Occasionally, nodes will swell during an infection then never fully shrink back down to their original size.  The location of the node makes me think it is much less likely to be a cancer (though this is not a one hundred percent guarantee).  If there is concern, a biopsy will give you the answer but this may not be necessary.  The ultrasound will help confirm it to be consistent with a lymph node versus some other structure.  Hope this helps.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Lissa, I hope your intercultural communication class will enable you to find ways to appreciate the marvelous variety of cultures represented in our immediate and extended world!   Whether you are a healthcare professional yourself, or in a business entity other than healthcare, you will find the ability to communicate accross multicultural lines not only a saleable asset, but an incredible adjunct to fulfilling your own tasks ever better than you could imagine!   Always frame your questions of discovery in a deliberately friendly tone of voice, with acceptance throughout the body language and wording.  Recognize that every one on this planet is a stranger in another stranger's land, and that everyone on this planet deserves to be accepted as they are, with all their inherited biases, values, and even prejudices.  After all, we all have them.  We make all our choices for life based on our basic princilples, and sets of moral principles that we were either raised with or that we have adopted to our own base electively. There are so many cultural variances, that to try to spin them down to an easy set of discovery questions is impossible,     On the immediate side of a reply, I can suggest that you read all you can of the myriad of books and internet material that offers quick \"at a glance\" side by side comparisons of religious specifics, death and passage beliefs, and health and healing viewpoints.  Just recognizing that everyone has a slightly different spin on the subject will allow you in all circumstances to seek to understand the other's perspective before pushing your own.  The extent to which certain major cultures are adamant about being true to their beliefs regarding health, diet, and dying, is in some ways merely an expansion of a single individual bonding with others with like views.  To acknowledge that everyone has a right to his and her own perspective is the mark of a true professional.  Sometimes to know that  one's beliefs are not the object of derision, is sufficient for that individual to be equally open to entertaining a different point of view.  After all, we will defend the \"who we are\" al all costs - if we do not feel threatened, we are all more likely to consider other perspective.  And, once the doors of communication have been opened by the keys of acceptance, then the process of  ddiscovery has begun. I will be happy to assist your further if I may.  Marceline\n\n",

Fungal rashes often resolve spontaneously but may need some treatment for the underlying infection.  Eczema, etc. often have specific treatments to help them improve.

    "content": "Hi,  C-dif can recur.  Various statistics report it to be about a 20% risk.  Generally, however, recurrence would not happen four months later after an appropriate treatment.  This does NOT, however, mean that it can't recur.  Symptoms of C-dif enterocolitis are generally severe cramping abdominal pain, possibly fever, diarrhea and elevated white blood cell count.  It typically does not cause emesis.  If his sister had a similar illness it is probable that this is a viral gastroenteritis.  Additionally there are some bacteria that can cause these symptoms, such as salmonella and shigella.  The bacterial diarrheas tend to have many (upwards of 10-15) stools per day where as viruses tend to have less, but this is far from a universal rule.    As long as he is staying hydrated and able to drink enough fluid to keep up with the diarrhea it is OK to watch him for a few days to see if he starts to get better.  If he is becoming dehydrated, or if he is not getting better he should be evaluated by his doctor.  At that point, stool cultures for C-dif and other causes can be done.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

Is there anything I can do to combat the smell?  Could this be a symptom of another problem?  When we're home he goes without shoes or socks, I usually only put him in light colored cotton socks and sneakers when we go out.  During the summer I try to get him to wear sandals.  Thanks in advance, Kim\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, sorry for the delay in replying.  Body odor is typically a result of androgen hormone action.  Typically, before puberty androgen levels are low in both boys and girls.  Thus, body odor in young children should warrent evaluation.  The presence of body odor may indicate an increased androgen level.  Other signs that this may be occuring are accelerated growth (I.e. your son seems to be taller than most kids his age.) and axillary or pubic hair.  I would suggest that you discuss this with your pediatrician.  There are some blood tests that may be useful.  These would include an electrolyte panel to look for abnormalities that may be indicative of a partial congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), TSH/T4 to test the thyroid, and various tests to look at androgen levels directly.  If all these end up normal, it is likely that all is well; however I would suggest continuing to follow with your doctor and monitoring for any accelerations in growth, etc. that may occur in the future.  Basically an annual well child check.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "title": "6 yr old with \"epidsodes\" of abdominal pain",
    "content": "My 6 year old daughter has been having episodes of abdominal pain off and on for a year. She has had no previous illnesses nor surgeries. Family history is my sister had RTA and one kidney died when she was two. Her episodes have grown more frequent since December. In one month time she had 4-5 of them. Sometimes the pain is so bad she cries and she will just lie there. Sometimes the stomach ache is accompanied by a fever ranging from 99.0 - 104.0f and sometimes she will vomit once or twice after hours of pain. Her stomach aches have gone from a couple of hours to 1-2 days at a time. Sometimes the pain isn't so severe but she will get quiet. She was on prevacid now we are trying stool softeners but she has a bm at least every other day and they aren't hard and small looking. She gets very pale with the aches and very cold. Only one round of blood tests done and a ultrasound which came back normal. Stomach aches come on at various times sometimes in the middle of the day, beginning or even when she is sleeping. Any advice is appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to answer me back.\n\n",

    "content": "Abdominal pain can be one of the most difficult and ellusive things for a pediatrician to diagnose.  So many of the illnesses have essentially the same symptoms.  I do have a few thoughts for you along with a few questions.  Has she lost any weight?  How is her appetite?  When she does vomit, does she vomit any blood or dark green color?  Does she ever have diarrhea?  Does she have any blood in her stools?  If it has not already been done, I would recommend evaluation for celiac disease.  This is essentially an allergy to gluten which is found in many foods.  Celiac disease (also known as celiac sprue) is much more common than previously thought-even upwards of 1 in 100 people.  It often presents with vague abdominal pain that can be severe.    Also, food allergies can be quite painful.  Unfortunately, GI food allergies are caused by a different mechanism than are \"hay fever\" allergies, so the routine skin testing that is done for other allergies is NOT helpful in these cases (despite their persistent usage by doctors).  The best way to determine these allergies is by doing elimination diets.  There are 9 main foods that cause about 90% of food allergies: milk, eggs, dairy, wheat, tree nuts, peanuts, soy, fish and shellfish.  If you are able to eliminate all sources of these foods for 2-4 weeks and the symptoms go away, this is likely the cause.  At that point you can add the foods back one at a time very slowly to see which one was the cause of the pain.  Gastritis is possible but the prevacid should help with this.  It does take a few weeks for prevacid to have its full effect.  If sufficient time has gone by and the symptoms persist gastritis is unlikely.  Testing of a bacteria called H. pylori is a good idea as this bacteria can cause quite severe gastritis and even ulcers.  Treatment for this involves a proton pump inhibitor (such a prevacid) as well as an antibiotic and either an additional antibiotic or a coating agent.  If none of these things are helping I would suggest that you have your daughter seen by a gastroenterology specialist.  At that point, she may need an endoscopy to use the camera to look at the lining of her stomach, etc. and take a few biopsies to look for the cause.  Hope this helps.  Keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Eye color is determined by the amount of pigment in the iris (the colored portion of the eye.  Typically light skinned babies will be born with grey or blue eyes.  Darker skinned babies may have brown or dark colored eyes at birth.    Eye color begins to become a more adult color around six months of age typically.  Often by about one year of age the eyes have taken their adult color; however, in some people eye color can continue to change-even into adulthood.  Typically the eyes are the same color but not uncommonly the eyes will have different colors.  It appears that your son did not read the textbook and his eyes continued to change after one year of age.  They may or may not ultimately stay their current color.  It is unlikely that your son's eye color change is related to his behavior.  During this age children often will attempt to reexert their independence by being disobedient.  Consistency is crucial during this age.  This way he learns that what is no today is still no tomorrow.  It can be quite difficult but ultimately the rewards of discipline now pay off in the future.  Best wishes during this time.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, sorry for the delay in answering your questions.  How old is your son?  It is not uncommon for viral infections to cause fevers for several days.  Most viruses are getting better by about 7 days.  Another important question is: Did your son have a fever every day for the past five days or only a few out of the 5 days but continues to get them?    There are a few syndromes that are important to recognize that present with high fevers for at least five days.  The most well known of these is Kawasaki's disease.  If your child has a high fever (>102 degrees F) for 5 days in a row, it's a good idea to have him checked by your pediatrician for other signs of Kawasaki's.  Having said that, viruses much more commonly cause fever than does Kawasaki's.  I hope your son is feeling better.  Let us know if you have any other questions.\n\n",

    "content": "After they turn purple, do they turn any other colors?  What you are describing has a few possibilities.  First, it is quite common for hands and feet to get cold and become bluish in color because the blood flow to those areas is decreased to retain body heat.  This leads to some venous congestion and \"non-dangerous\" decreases in oxygen levels that give the bluish color.  If severe enough this can cause the extremities to feel numb/tingly.  This is considered a normal response to cold temperatures and some people have more pronounced responses than others.  Another thought is a condition known as Raynaud's syndrome.  This is very similar to the above described situation but is dramatically more painful and decreased circulation can be more severe.  It typically affects the fingers and toes the most-even to the point of causing them to appear white from significantly decreased circulation of blood.    Treatment of Raynaud's (as well as \"normal\" cooling) is primarily by preventing the extremities from getting cold.  If Raynaud's is more severe there are some medications that may help also.  Hope this helps.  Let us know how things go.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, my 3 yo boy has been having trouble with speech and social skills. I have been dealing with Help Me Grow and have tried speech therapy, which he refused to participate in. I had his hearing tested, which he passed with flying colors. My next step is to get a referral to a neurologist.  He can speak in full sentences, but only at his leisure. He now will give us hugs, but only when he wants a hug. He makes eye contact, but again it is at his leisure. I know he hears and understands, but he doesn't usually try to respond. When I was in labor with him, his heartrate dropped into the 30's and 40's for about 10 to 15 minutes. Then, during delivery, his heartrate again dropped into the 30's and 40's for about 10 more minutes.  Could his heartrate dropping (due to cord compression) have contributed, or even caused, his delayed speech and antisocial behavior? If so, what could be wrong and who would I take him to to find out a diagnosis for treatment? Does this sound like autism to anyone else? I don't want to make it worse on him by taking him to a neurologist for testing if it isn't something that I should be concerned with. Any opinions on this would be greatly appreciated. We have been dealing with this issue for about a year and a half now. I need to figure this out. Thank you very much!\n\n",

    "content": "I've never heard the term \"glue ear\" before so I'm not exactly sure what you're referring to.  However, speach problems should almost always be first worked up by testing hearing.  Children learn to speak by copying what they hear.  If the hearing is not normal, even though they may be able to hear they may be hearing muffled sounds (for example, an underwater sound).    If your son is having trouble with speech I completely agree with testing his hearing.  Also, he should have a tympanogram performed to determine if his ear drum is moving properly.  This can generally be done by your pediatrician and is very similar to looking in the ear except that instead of using the otoscope with a glass view, it has a computerized tester on it.  I would suggest having this done before you have his hearing tested.

    "content": "I've never heard the term \"glue ear\" before so I'm not exactly sure what you're referring to.  However, speach problems should almost always be first worked up by testing hearing.  Children learn to speak by copying what they hear.  If the hearing is not normal, even though they may be able to hear they may be hearing muffled sounds (for example, an underwater sound).    If your son is having trouble with speech I completely agree with testing his hearing.  Also, he should have a tympanogram performed to determine if his ear drum is moving properly.  This can generally be done by your pediatrician and is very similar to looking in the ear except that instead of using the otoscope with a glass view, it has a computerized tester on it.  I would suggest having this done before you have his hearing tested.  If he does have some fluid behind his ear drum or retraction of the ear drum, he is likely to not pass his hearing test and be referred back to his pediatrician to deal with this before he can truly have his hearing tested.

    "content": "While it is relatively common practice to prescribe antibiotics for \"strep throat\" without doing a throat swab, it may not be the best method.    Studies have shown that clinicians are not very accurate in visually diagnosing strep throat.  Often, we think it is strep and it turns out not to be, or we do not think it is strep and it turns out to be.    Add to this that treating strep throat caused by group A streptococcus bacteria prevents rheumatic fever from following the infection but treatment does not shorten the course of the illness at all.    Given these things there are several reasons that your son may still be having fevers:   1) He may actually have a sore throat from a virus or other type of bacteria called an atypical bacteria (formally known as mycoplasma) that is not susceptible to cephalexin (Keflex).  In this case, the antibiotics are not treating anything and the infection will run its course.  Fortunately, viruses and mycoplasma are not followed by rheumatic fever and generally run their course then go away.  2) He may, indeed, have strep throat and the illness will still run its course-even though the antibiotics are protecting him from rheumatic fever.  Symptoms of true strep throat include high fevers, very painful throat, and general lack of a cough.  The cough really is the thing that separates strep from other causes.  Viruses generally can cause a bad sore throat but often cause a cough (as does mycoplasma).  Unfortutely, this is not 100%  If his fevers do not improve in the next 1-2 days, you should have him reevaluated to see if something else may be going on.  Hope this helps.  Keep us updated on how he's doing.\n\n",

    "title": "5 1/2 Yr old Boy with Upper Respiatory problem",
    "content": "My son is 5.5 years old.  He has allergies to animals and a few environmental allergens and has been seen by an allergist atleast once a year.  He takes Zyrtec sporadically and until today has had one severe breathing episode that resulted in an ER visit when he was three.  This was after being exposed to a dog.  Although there is a family history on both sides of Asthma, he has never been diagnosed with asthma.   He came home from pre-school with cold symptoms (including a tight somewhat phlegmy sounding cough) on Thus. and last night went to bed with a slight wheeze.  He woke up at 3 AM this morning (Sat) having a lot of breathing trouble.  He had a fever of 100.2. I had an inhaler left over from his ER visit at age 3 and gave him to puffs and some Benadryl.  After a warm shower, a warm drink and about 30 minutes he got worse.  We took him to the ER.  Upon arriving his Oxygen sat. was at 92.  They gave him 3 brething treatments and one dose of oral Prednisone.  A Chest x-ray seemed to show nothing.  We left with a prescription for Zythromax and a new inhaler.  The Zythromax was for an ear infection and what the doctor considered an upper respiatory infection.  After going home and sleeping he woke up in just as bad shape as he was before we went to the ER.   Rather than return to the ER we visited the pediatric office that was covering today for our pediatrician.  His Oxygen levels were still at 92. They did one regular breathing treatment and a second one with an inhaled steriod mixed in (primacort).  Seconds after the second treatment the nurse took another oxygen level.  It stayed at 92 for a minute and then bounced from 93 to 94.  We left with a home nebulizer and both the regular breathing treatment and 3 more vials of primacort.  We were instructed to do breathing treatments every 4-6 hours, but he has been unable to make it more than two hours.  His chest sounds very tight and he occassionaly gets up some clear phlegm, but it hurts him to cough.  Is there anything we can give him to loosen his chest? Something like Muscex  for kids? Can that cause more harm?  The pediatrician has not reuturned our call.  Also, should we have insisted on a prednisoone prescription to bring home?  We are not used to dealing with breathing problems like this and my husband and I are both concerned about making it through the evening with him.  Its so scary to hear him struggle with this.  We don't want to unneccisarily bring him back to the ER (which was not the best experience).  Any suggestions?\n\n",

If he is needing albuterol every two hours I would strongly recommend he be evaluated in the emergency room or your pediatrician again.    Children needing albuterol every 2 hours often will need to be admitted to the hospital for close observation.  Additionally, an oral steroid burst is likely indicated.  Please do not consider this as a formal recommendation as I cannot evaluate him in person.  However, is sounds as if he's fairly sick.  Until he can be reevaluated, I would continue the albuterol and pulmicort (the inhaled steroid).  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "There are several possible causes for your fatigue but first, let's examine your shaking.  Hypoglycemia is a very common cause of tremulousness.  If eating helps you, I suspect that occasionally your blood sugar is getting low.  This is a common thing, especially among teenagers.  To help this I would suggest keeping some little snacks around to eat-healthy snacks are best.  Try to eat more complex carbohydrates and avoid simple sugars.  Proteins can also be of help.  Contradictory to what is generally encouraged, fats are an important part of the diet.  It is important to make sure that you are getting a little fat in your diet also as they are an important source of energy-just don't get too much.  If doing this doesn't help alleviate your tremors I would recommend you be evaluated for this to see if you have something else going on.  Regarding your fatigue, there are several possible causes including hypothyroidism and anemia.  Teenage girls are especially susceptible to anemia due to monthly blood losses.  Taking a good multivitamin with iron is important.  Testing for hypothyroidism and anemia are quite easy and involve a simple blood test.    Do you take any medications?  Medicines often have fatigue as a side effect.  In addition, staying on a set schedule is important.  Try varying the amount of time that you sleep.  It may be that you are sleeping too much.  Try adjusting the time by about 15 to 30 minutes every few days and see which time lets you fell the best.  Then try to stay on that schedule.  Days when you can get up later, try not to get up much later as this throws off your internal clock.   A direct examination is important and some simple blood tests can check for lots of issues.  If you are unsatisfied with your doctor you may be able to see a different physician.  Finding a doctor you like is important.  Keep us updated.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "Anemia most often is assymptomatic.  It is picked up on a routine screening.  When there are symptoms they are often vague, such as fatigue and easy shortness of breath.  As anemia becomes more significant one can begin to look pale.  With more severe anemia one may feel as if they are starving for air.  I would recommend a screening CBC to look for anemia.  At the same time they can check for thyroid problems with a TSH and Free T4 level.  Regarding immunizations, typically teenagers need a booster tetanus/diptheria at age 16 or 17.  In addition, there are a few \"new\" vaccines for teens your age you may want to consider.  These include a meningococcus vaccine to help prevent meningitis, and an HPV vaccine that can help prevent infection with the HPV virus.  The HPV virus is known to be a major (if not essentially the only) cause of cervical cancer.  Hope you feel better.  Keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Do you know the total WBC count at the time the lymphocytes were 66%.  A lymphocyte percentage of 66% is really only a little elevated.  Generally, lymphocyte elevations do go along with viral infections.  The one thing I would be a little interested in knowing is what was his neutrophil count during this time?  Was it low?  When you mention that he has been getting sick every 2 months it brings to mind a condition known as cyclic neutropenia.  This is a rare condition and presents with the neutrophils (a type of white blood cell that helps fight off bacterial and other infections) dropping to very low levels in a cyclic pattern, usually about every six to eight weeks.  If his neutrophil count has been normal during these episodes it is very unlikely that he has this but it may be something to consider.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "There are an endless number of causes of a cough in the winter time.  Winter is the season of the respiratory illness.  A few infections come to mind when discussing severe coughs.  It is possible that he has been infected with RSV, a virus that causes bronchiolitis and is known to cause a prolonged cough.  Generally this virus is associated with significant congestion but not always.  Also, if he seems to be having coughing \"fits\" where he needs to take a deep breath in between to keep coughing, he may have pertussis also known as whooping cough.  It gets its name as a whooping noise is often heard when the child takes the deep breath in.  If the cough is not getting better after about 7 days (not gone, but getting better) or if he seems to be getting worse I would recommend that he be seen by his doctor for evaluation.  He may need a chest x-ray to look for pneumonia.  If he develops any severe respiratory distress, including having his skin be pulled in underneath his ribs or at the top of his breast bone, rapid breathing or flaring of his nostrils he should be taken to the emergency room for evaluation as soon as possible.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "There are a few things you can do to help him.  Reflux can certainly cause cough.  When he sleeps, I recommend that you elevate the head of his bed to about 30 degrees.  This can be done by putting some pillows or sheets under his mattress or some bricks, etc. under the legs of his bed.  This way, his entire mattress is elevated. It makes it safer for him than just putting a pillow under him.  Also, you can add a small amount of rice cereal to his formula to help thicken his feeds (Say 1/2 to 1 teaspoon or so).  You can add more if needed to give the feeds just a little bit thicker consistency (without making it a solid mush).  Keep in mind that his nipple may become clogged easier. You can modify this if needed by making the hole slightly larger.  There are some formulas marketed as antireflux formulas.  I've never been particularly impressed with the results of these but you may want to try one.  If these things fail there are some medications that can be used.  The good news is that essentially all babies reflux when they're born and almost all of them grow out of it.  Unfortunately it can take a good several months to see any improvement.  At night, as long as he's still gaining weight well I would let him sleep as long as he can.  You'll both be better off.  However, if he stops gaining weight well he may need more frequent night time feedings also.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "Diaper rashes can appear fairly rapidly.  30 minutes is a bit fast for severe rashes.  Often, the rashes start out mild and not too concerning.  Then before you know it they're flared up and severe.  If the rash has small spots at the edges of it, he may have a fungal diaper rash that needs an antifungal cream.  If not, it most likely is an irritation diaper rash that are best treated by coating type creams, such as zinc oxide.  Keep a thick layer on.  Apply with each diaper change.  Try to avoid having dirty diapers on for too long.  And while the rash is severe you may want to avoid the chemical baby wipes as they can irritate and worsen the rash.  Soft cloths work well.  Disposable ones without chemical additives can be purchased.  Hope he gets better soon.\n\n",

    "content": "My 18 month old son just recently got C-diff immediately after a round of Omnicef for an ear infection.  Our doctor says that it is fine to give him antibiotics whenever he needs them because the C-diff did not come from the antibiotic, instead he had ingested it.  (My 5 year old had C-diff 3.5 years ago and the pediatric gastro told us that antibiotics should be used with extreme caution.)  My question is what do you do for someone in this \"catch 22\" prone to C-diff and chronic ear infections?  Thank you in advance, Worried mother\n\n",

    "content": "This situation can be difficult to manage.  There are a few things to keep in mind.  First, regarding the ear infections.  It is now thought that about 80% of ear infections will resolve on their own without antibiotic treatment.  The generally recommended method now is to give the ear infection 24-48 hours with just pain control.  If the pain is not resolving, or the ear infection does not appear to be resolving antibiotics can be started.  Also, for persistent ear infections that are failing treatment the recommendation is to give three doses of ceftriaxone (intramuscular shot).  If you mean chronic as in the ear infection is not clearing this may be what is needed.  If you mean chronic as in your child gets frequent ear infections, you can try to get through them without antibiotics.  Having your child blow his/her nose frequently can be of help (theoretically) as this will help \"force\" the eustachian tubes open and allow drainage of the fluid in the middle ear.  (This has never been studied to my knowledge, so in reality it may or may not help.)    Regarding the C. difficile infection, the infection method is thought to be that the bacteria c. difficile is in the GI tract already, but cannot \"get a foot hold\" due to the presence of normal GI flora.  When a child takes antibiotics, the \"good\" bacteria die, letting the C. diff. bacteria take hold and cause infection.  Treatment for this is generally with metronidazole.  Things that can help prevent recurrence are avoiding antibiotics if possible.  This is not always possible, though.  Also, eating foods such as yogurts with live cultures of Lactobacillus and other \"good\" bacteria can help encourage repopulation of the helpful bacteria and force out the C. diff.  Keep in mind that one infection does not mean that with each use of antibiotics the C. diff. will come back.  Some antibiotics are more prone to allowing this than others.  I would discuss with your doctor when antibiotics are needed to see if they can be held or not.  If needed, there may be antibiotic choices that are less inclined to being followed by C. diff. enteritis.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you Dr. Lowe for responding.  I am in agreement with how to manage this situation.  I have been giving him Lactobacillus GG every day since this occurance and even through the Omnicef treatment.  I believe the probiotics were curative for my daughter's case of C-diff, but she has never been a child to need any antibiotics (no ear infections, strep only once etc..)  The pediatrician we see happens to believe in treating all ear infections (no wait policy) because of mastoiditis or something like that, but I believe my son's case definitely warrents a waiting window.  He doesn't have the case of one chronic ear infection that won't go away, instead he gets them accutely without having a cold or anything, just randomly, and they are getting less frequent now so I am hopeful and thankful.   I am so thankful that you responded -- I appreciate it very much.\n\n",

    "content": "Generally with kids who get frequent ear infections, the infections decrease dramatically after a summer.  Usually the problem is that children get so many upper respiratory tract infections that they are chronically congested, leading to many ear infections.    As far as the concern for mastoiditis, this is a known complication of middle ear infections.  However, I'm not aware of any cases of mastoiditis that have developed if the ear infection is resolving, only if it persists.  I've not done an extensive literature search to verify this, but in general, the cases of mastoiditis that I've seen have been with unresolving ear infections.\n\n",

    "content": "The likelihood of developing a brain abscess is extremely low following an ear infection (although it is possible).  Just given the odds, I would say that it would be more likely to get a C. diff. infection than a brain abscess.  Ruptured ear drums do occasionally occur with ear infections.  Generally, the ear drum heals without a problem.   The IM shots are generally considered third line choice for ear infections, or first if it is a chronic ear infection.  The IM antibiotic generally used is ceftriaxone which is less likely to be followed by C. diff. than are the more common oral drugs; however, most people can take the oral meds. without any problem except for some diarrhea occasionally (not caused by C. diff.)  Ceftriaxone does get into the GI tract some, even though it's a shot.  You should discuss treatment options with your doctor regarding whether to use orals or the shot.  I generally recommend avoiding the IM's unless necessary.  Hopefully, his ear infections will decrease and he won't need anymore antibiotics for a while.    Also, if he has allergies, you may consider making sure these are well treated.  This can alleviate some of the congestion and reduce the chances of an ear infection some.  Hope this helps.  Happy new year.\n\n",

In doing so, it has also become slightly more prone to causing skin infections and a few other infections.  Other than this, it really is just a common staph bacteria.  In my area, about 50% of staph is MRSA.  The prevalence rate varies from place to place, but MRSA is becoming much more common than it used to be.  About a third of people will be colonized with staph aureus (i.e. it grows normally on the skin and in the nose most commonly).  Of those, some have MRSA.   There really is no special safety precautions that need to be taken and it is safe for your children to be around your family members.    Occasionally, if a person seems to be getting recurrent skin infections from MRSA one can attempt to irradicate the MRSA from the skin using some skin washes and nasal antibiotics.  For most people colonized with MRSA it is not a problem.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

Sometimes, following infection Lymph nodes remain permanently enlarged, though they should be non-tender, small (less the 1 cm), have a rubbery consistency and none of the characteristics described for malignancy or for infection. These are also known as 'Shotty Lymph nodes'.   Children with history of recurrent upper ear, throat infections tend to have clinically palpable lymph nodes. So, the probability that the lymph node you have noticed is due to previous infection in the area drained by this lymph node group is highly possible.   Nodes are generally considered to be normal if they are up to 1 cm in diameter.  Of  significance, an increase in nodal size on serial examinations. Hence nodes that continue to grow in size are important and those that regress in size tend to be more reassuring.   I advise you to follow with your doctor for proper examination (to confirm if it is LN ) and further management accordingly.  Keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

These lesions could be due to one of the following causes:  - Friction and fungus are very likely to be the causes of these symptoms since it occurs in an area where skin rubbing against skin is highly frequent.  Skin rubbing against skin generates heat and sweat,  fungal growth in turn lead to , redness and , painful Itchy patches (tinea).  The Itch may progress into inflammation and becomes more complicated.   - Contact Dermatitis occurs due to skin contact with a substance that causes an allergic reaction (allergic contact Dermatitis)  or with an irritant substances (irritant contact Dermatitis).  There are many causes for contact Dermatitis some involve irritants such as soaps, certain creams and some may be due to allergy.  Avoiding the causing substance is the mainstay of prevention in addition to medications prescribed by your doctor.   The other new small swelling could be a lymph node, which occurs as a reaction to the inflamed skin lesions that may be also affected by secondary bacterial infection.  I advise you to follow with his doctor for proper management. Keep us updated. Best regards.   -\n\n",

    "content": "My son is 29 mnths, he has slept through the night maybe 30 times, I have brought my concerns to ped and they tell me some kids do not sleep well, he will learn,  I could try Benadryl for a week to try and establish a sleep cycle.  I was not comfortable with that so I decided to bring him to Neuorologist for evaluation because I notice he twitched a little after falling to sleep and wondered if that could be the problem, they advised his twitching was just part of sleep cycle and he was perfectly normal and it was safe to try Benadryl for no longer than 7 nights.  I still have not given him th eBenadryl I feel guilty givining it to him so I could get a good night sleep, Can I have your opinion on the Benadryl use?  Will it help him establish a sleep cycle?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Archiebald, The use of Benadryl for a short time to assist in establishing a more regular sleep cycle in children is not an unheard of practice. Using Benadryl for a 7 day period along with establishing a regular bedtime routine establishes consistency. You may want to look at this a little differently. You know how you feel when you don't get a good nights sleep, children are no different. Sleep is necessary to rejuvenate the body and is important in immune system function.

    "content": "Benadryl can be helpful in getting children to sleep, but as your doctor has recommended, it is best to not use it more than a few days because benadryl makes kids sleepy, but gives them poor quality sleep so they often wake up tired.  Other important things to do are to set a firm bed time as well as an established time to wake up.  At this age, kids may like to sleep with a teddy bear or some sort of comfort object, but don't put too many toys in the bed with them.  Keep the room dark (a small night light is OK) and as quiet as possible.  Also, once the child has been put to bed try to minimize physical contact and allow the child to fall asleep on his own.  Another thing to try if he is waking up in the middle of the night frequently is to put him to bed about 30 minutes EARLIER than he has been going.  It seems counterintuitive but can often do the trick.  There are some very good books to aid in establishing helpful sleep practices.  Your doctor may have some literature for you as well.  I hope you are able to sleep through the night soon.\n\n",

The final results of his autopsy have not come back but my sons doctor said that it was most likely caused by the picc line that he had.  He said that the baby had fluid around his heart which had constricted his heart from beating and he died very suddenly and unexpected.  He said that from what they could see,  the picc line was in the right place.     Is fluid around the heart a typical risk when using the picc line?

    "content": "I am sorry to hear of your loss.  I did a search of the literature for this and found that pericardial effusions (fluid around the heart) can occur with PICC lines in premature infants.  From the data I saw it occurs about 1-2% of the time.  While this may seem like a lot, keep in mind that this means that 99 out of every 100 premies with PICC lines will not develop such a complication.  Infants are routinely sent home with PICC lines to complete medical treatment.  Pericardial effusions are a rare complication of PICC lines.  Unfortunately, there isn't much to watch for, and the fluid can become constrictive quite rapidly.  The treatment is to drain the effusion quickly with a needle. Unfortunately, at home, drainage is often not possible in time.  I hope this helps, and I send my best regards to you and your family.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Although there is nothing abnormal or unhealthy about masturbation from a medical point of view, some people have strong religious, cultural or moral objections to the practice. For those who hold these values, choosing not to masturbate is normal, too. There is nothing weird, odd, or unhealthy about this choice.  In most cases, masturbation is a normal, harmless sexual activity. Masturbation won't cause undo fatigue. Sex is not strenuous.  Although there is no simple rule about how much masturbation is too much, it is generally considered to be compulsive if masturbation becomes time consuming;  interferes with a person's daily routine, work or social functioning; continues despite no longer being pleasurable or gratifying; places the individual at risk of physical harm, or has legal or personal consequences.   This obsessive masturbation may be just one of several different compulsive sexual behaviors, including sexual promiscuity and a compulsive fascination with pornography. In adults and adolescents, compulsive masturbation can also be a symptom of addiction to cocaine or methamphetamine.  You should seek an appointment with a psychiatrist, psychologist or sex therapist. If no clear trigger for the behavior is found, some doctors will treat the patient with psychiatric medications called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) although this is not appropriate for everyone. This family of drugs includes fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft) and paroxetine (Paxil).   Best regards.\n\n",

For those of you not familiar with costochondritis it is inflammation of the cartilage of the ribcage.  Over the years it has come and gone(attacks weekly or monthly) but over the past week her attacks (daily)of stabbing chest pain have been unbearable, even to the point of passing out. After another visit to the hospital 2 days ago, we came home with the same diagnosis and a recommendation of more rest, heat, and ibuprofen.  I have asked for a second opinion many times and always get the same answer.  I don't know what else to do.  She is a very atheletic young girl and this is having a huge affect on her life.  Last week she walked to the corner store and was brought home by some strangers who found her lying onthe side of road reeling in pain.  I'm afraid for her to be alone anymore and her school has been less then understanding.  She can't even play her trumpet anymore.  I have a hard time believing that she has been suffering from this for 8 years and nothing can be done.  Please, any advice would be appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Costochondritis can be a very painful condition.  It does tend to come and go.  Some physicians believe that once a person has costochondritis it never really goes away and can flare up again.  costochondritis characteristically has pain that can be reproduced by pressing on the area where the pain occurs.  If a similar pain is produced with pressure, it almost certainly is costochondritis.  For acute pain, anti-inflammatories such as ibuprofen can be helpful.  Heat and rest are also helpful.  My experience with this is that it does tend to get better over time, but it can be a long, long time.  If you are concerned that this is not the cause, it is always reasonable to ask for another evaluation.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

The symptoms you describe are concerning, and should be looked into further.  While cancer, such as lymphoma, can present with swollen lymph nodes, there are other infections that can do this as well.  A few include coccidiodes imitis, tuberculosis, and histoplasmosis.  I would strongly recommend a medical evaluation.  Your son may need a biopsy of one of the nodes to get a better idea of what is going on.  Keep us informed.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

No treatment is needed as it is a benign condition.  What you should do is: - follow with your doctor every 6 months to see if there are any signs of precocious puberty (early puberty) which mandates further investigations.

Your symptoms are not classic for any specific thing at this point; however, there are many possibilities including inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatologic diseases.  Some autoimmune disorders can produce symptoms like these as well as the knee pain.  My best advice for you at this point is to be evaluated by a doctor and emphasize your symptoms including the weight loss and the chronicity of your symptoms.  If a general evaluation is not revealing of anything specific, you may benefit from evaluation by a GI specialist.  Other info that will be helpful for your doctor will be a family history.  Does anyone in the family have GI problems or autoimmune disorders?  This may help guide your work up.  Keep us posted of how your doing.\n\n",

When I informed the doctor of the hives my son had the day before he told me they were not related to the sinus infection.  Also,  I have not changed our laundry detergent.

It is very likely your son was already infected 1 day before the appearance of any symptoms related to the sinus infection, and that the appearance of the hives then, was the only sign of this infection.\n\n",

    "content": "Friday afternoon - I visit a drop in medical clinic because I have a sore throat. I received 2 days worth of penecillin to take while doctor #1 awaits the swab results to see if I have strep throat.  Friday evening- I get a high fever.  Saturday Day and Evening- Several sessions of fever and my sore throat gets worse. I'm taking tylenol extra strength along with the penicillin.  Sunday evening- I can't stand the fever so I go to the ER. I tell them that doctor #1 suspects that I may have strep throat but the test results won't be back for atleast another day. The doc#2 prescribes Amoxicillin, T3's and morphine for me.  Mon+ Tues- I take all 3 meds. I continue to have really bad sore throat and sessions of high fever.   Wed- I go to another medical clinic and see doc #3 because I'm not getting any better and its been awhile already. The doc suggests that I get a monospot. The fevers stop but I still have the sore throat. At night I started having chest coughs and started sweating.  Today- I go back to see doc #1. He says he got the results for my swab and it was negative. So I don't have strep throat. He also suspects that I have mono. So I go and get a blood test done. The results should be available tomorrow. He takes another swab because my throat is white and pusy not red like it was on Saturday.  So it looks like I have mono? What if its NOT mono? What do I have then? I hear its unlikely that I have mono because I'm 28yrs old.  Anyways, I'm currently just taking tylenol cold for the cough. I haven't had any fever since yesterday afternoon. I do get a rush of temperature change to my body though. Cold then hot then I sweat a lot.  Thanks for your time!\n\n",

    "content": "Several things can cause a sore throat such as you describe.  Strep throat is the one that most people think of right away.  It tends to cause a very severe sore throat and fever without much of a cough.  (If you have a bad cough, it's probably not strep.)  Mononucleosis, an infection caused by Ebstein Barr Virus, can cause a very severe sore throat also.  At age 28 it is less likely that you would get mono, since most people have already been infected with EBV by that age; however, it is possible.  Blood tests should easily confirm this for you.  A test called the monospot test is a good one for you.  Several other virus's can cause sore throats as well.  The important thing is to stay hydrated and continue to follow up with your doctor.   One thing I wasn't sure about from your post.  Are you taking both the penicillin and the amoxicillin at the same time?  If so, this is not necessary.  Your doctor can decide which one is best for you, but if you don't have strep, you may not need either.   Hope you feel better soon!\n\n",

Menarche (the first episode of the menstraul cycle) is considered delayed if girls have not started by age 16 or within 2 years of beginning breast development.  The best indicator of when a girl will start having periods is the age at which her mom had her first period.  If mom was older, it is likely the girl will be older as well.  Delayed menarche can be associated with several factors.  Obesity may or may not be related.  Obesity can be seen in a syndrome called polycystic ovarian syndrome that can have delayed and irregular menstrual cycles.  I would recommend that she be evaluated by a physician to determine the cause of her delay.  Hope that helps.\n\n",

If she has had a fever, it is likely that she has an infectious cause-although lack of a fever doesn't rule this out.  Your doctor may want to do a stool culture to look for bacteria.  There are other causes as well, particularly a disease called celiac disease (AKA celiac sprue) that can cause diarrhea.  Additionally, dietary intake can cause it.  Does your granddaughter drink a lot of juice?  The sugars in the juice can draw water into the intestines and cause diarrhea.  I'm assuming that the cream was for a diaper rash.  I try to never question another physicians care as I was not there.  So, take this comment with a grain of salt.  The triamcinolone/nystatin cream is a combination cream with a steroid and an antifungal respectively.  Generally it is best to use one at a time.  If the diaper rash has a red, spotty appearance (especially around the edges of the rash) it may be caused by a fungal infection and will need nystatin or a similar medication cream.  If it's just red without the spots, it may be just an irritation diaper rash and needs some barrier type cream (zinc oxide for example).   Hope this helps.\n\n",

Valley Fever is very prevalent in the southwest (Arizona, Northern Mexico, and the San Jaquin Valley in California).  Outside of these areas it is much less common.  If you live in one of these areas, this is certainly a possibility.  Testing for cocci is a bit complicated.  Almost always, during an acute infection, the person will test negative.  The test needs to be repeated in 4-6 weeks to see if it becomes positive.  This is because it is an antibody test and the body takes a few weeks to make antibodies to cocci.  A negative test now and a positive test in several weeks is considered evidence of a recent infection.  There are a few other things that can cause these symptoms as well.  Most specifically pneumonia can cause this.  Your doctor may want to get a chest x-ray to look for these.  Sometimes cocci can show up on an x-ray, sometimes not.  Hope that helps.\n\n",

I've been to the doctor and she said she didn't feel anything abnormal minus a little swelling.  I'm wondering if these symptoms could be related to the tobacco and if i should be worried?  Is it possible to develop cancer after trying something like that only twice, and if so is it possible for it to develop in like 3-4 days?  Could i be overreacting to a worsening in my cold?

A culture performed by my parents (who are doctors) was positive for Staphilococus Aureus.  No fever, good general state, good feeding.  Two pediatricians (including pediatric surgeon) consulted there have recommended conservative approach and observation.  Everything I read in the literature suggests that aggressive approach is warranted with IV antibiotic combination for both Gram + and Gram - germs.  Should we get up in arms with the local doctors and demand that this be done or should we follow their advise and wait and see? What accounts for the radically different opinion to what is found in the literature? One of the doctors says the vessels are closed by now and the risks of septicemia or other complications is minimal. Is this so? Is it really worth waiting? What is the relative risk of aggressive antibiotic treatment?  Please Help!!\n\n",

Should it be continuously wrapped or does it need some air?  The bandage came off last night - should I be worried about infection?  The blisters have not yet broken.  Are there any questions that you can give me to ask my doctor?  Or any advice you can give me.  Will he need therapy or plastic surgery?  I know he needs to move it... but it is hard to move when bandaged (and he is very hesitant to move it when I change the bandages) - should I move his fingers for him?  I try to encourage it when bandaged.  Thank you for any advice/help that you can give.  I am worried so much about long term problems... but also worry about short term infections... I just worry :) ~Gina\n\n",

Generally speaking, antibiotics may be prescribed as a prophylactic measure. As for plastic surgery or physical therapy, that's dependent on the severity of the burn, ie., damaged structures, nerves, etc. are affected. According to the picture, this appears like a significant burn and it is certainly hoped the healthcare providers have followed closely. We hope the recovery has went well. Best wishes. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

I have a daughter that is 2 years old and sometime last week I noticed a small hard knot (no bigger than the end of an eraser on a pencil) on her left collar bone, when I touch it and push slightly just to feel if I can move it she says it hurts (but just to be sure it really hurt I touched the other collar bone and asked her did it hurt she said yes too, so I don't know if it really hurts or not...)   Could this just be a cyst or a calcium growth? Should I take her to the doctor about it? I don't know whether to be worried or if it's normal...Please help  Thank you very much.\n\n",

She also said that because she isn't or hasn't been sick (or even if she was...) then it is odd for her lymph node all the way down by her collar bone to be swollen and that if the antibiotics don't help then they will have to think of something else. What else could it be? Something serious? I didn't ask because I didn't want to think that it could be something serious...but now that I'm home I got thinking about it and am very curious.

Lymph node enlargement may occur for even seemingly mild insignificant infections and may wax and wane (enlarge then decrease in size) and may not return to their preinfectious state. If the physician is concerned about the nature or causative factor related to the enlargement, you may want to inquire about diagnostic studies, ie., ultrasound, prior to a more invasive procedure.

At first it was just the right side, but now both sides hurt. It would come and go, but for the last 2 days it has been pretty constant. It feels like someone hit me, and sometimes there's alot of pressure. It doesn't hurt per say, but it's uncomfortable. I had a urin test and it can back fine. I didn't have a bowl movement for 3 days, but then I had two in a day and became regular again. I was also at the rumitory arthritis doctor and he said he though it was muscle pain. I'm not sure I agree because I have a lot of muscle pain(being an athlete) but this just feels different. Do you have anysuggestions? Thanks.\n\n",

No, I don't believe I have frequent constipation per say, but sometimes it takes me a while to go. It's not often, maybe two to three times a  month, but it's been that way for years. I just wait and go later. My bowls are regular. They're once a day with a couple exections here are there; it might skip a day. No I haven't had a fever. The pain hasn't been as bad lately, but it's still noticable. It's mostly on the right side of my stomach. However, sometimes when I go to sleep if I lay on my left side it's feels like ther's a ball of pressure/pain that moves from my right side to my left side. And I don't feel the pain on the right. That pain hurts worse than the pain did on the right side. It goes away thou if I lay on my stomach. (I'll feel like I did before I layed down.)

The symptoms you've described go along with the presence of marked congestion in your abdomen and pelvis, but the source of this I cannot tell, since I haven't examined you. A congested uterus would result in heavy menses, a congested bladder could be the cause of frequent urination. Congestion also causes constipation. But there has to be a source for congestion, such as a mass lesion or inflammation of any of the abdominal or pelvic organs that would then result in the entire area of the abdomen or pelvis becoming congested.  Newly formed ovarian cysts is still a possibility. There are many other possibilties, but again it's difficult to localize the source of this pain since I cannot examine you. You need to discuss this again with your doctor, and please tell me what he/she thinks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello again. Sorry for not replying in such a long time. It\u2019s been a year and no one can seem to find the reason I am experiencing this pain. I still have the pain; I have just learned to live with it. At school I can\u2019t even lean my books agaist my side because it hurts, so I carry them in a book bag or against my chest.  I went to a pediatrician at children\u2019s hospital that specializes in hard to diagnose cases. She prescribed birth control. This was a great help although it did not rid me of the pain completely. It did lessen the pain and make it not so uncomfortable to be touched around the waist. My periods \u201ccleaned up\u201d (the blood returned to a bright red instead of a dark, dirty red color, and the extreme cramping went away. There was still pain but less by far. Around the third month of taking the birth control, however, I began to suffer from irregular heartbeats. My heart would race, for a few seconds, or skip a beat. It was mostly noticeable at night but I did notice it during the day as well. However, I have suffered from occasional heart palpitations but this was different. I never had experienced them during the day before. I finished talking the last 4 pills in the pack, and didn\u2019t renew the prescription. I was fine for about 3 months then I was back where I started again. The pain was back in full force, like I said I can\u2019t carry my school books against my side.  \tI have been thinking about what you said about congestion and PCO. To push against my sides it feels like the insides are bruised. They are extremely sensitive. If it is PCO do I just have a blood test done to see if that is the case? I looked up some of the symptoms and one that stood out was the hair growth. In the last 2 years I have noticed a path of dark hairs just below my belly button. I shave them as they are darker then the rest of the hairs on my stomach. Also, I find myself plucking dark hairs from the underside of my chin. Just an observation. Thank you again for your time and advice.\n\n",

They are the size of nickels or larger. She acts fine no fever or any symptoms and nothing previous like a virus or anything so wandering if this is common?Since being born premature I worry about everything with her but her Dr. never does! I called and he said not to bring her in that it is very common in babies and to watch her for several weeks.Common or uncommon? Worry or not?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi shnncof, Sometimes lymph nodes enlarge due to seemingly insignificant bacterial/viral infections that may present in such a way that doesn't actually produce symptoms, ie, fever, obvious infection etc. These types of enlargements typically decrease in size over a short period of observation time, 3-4 weeks. Depending on an evaluation, symptoms, Increasing node size, etc. antibiotics may be recommended. If after a period of observation, persistence is encountered, further diagnostics are also recommended. Regarding the location that you have described, the suboccipital lymph node is located at the junction between the back of the head and neck. It drains the scalp and head. Common causes of enlargement include local infection. Your child's physician is most likely unconcerned at this point because of the most common cause of swelling in the area. However, I would still recommend that a clinical evaluation be completed, so that there is a basis for noting an increase or decrease in size. Call the physician's office back and request an evaluation. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "Three days ago my six year old  daughter complained of headache. Her cheeks looked very flushed and she ran a fever.  Her symptoms lasted about 24- 36 hours.   Last night I noticed a light red rash covering her neck, stomach, back, and groin area, but not her arms and legs.  It is almost hard to see, but it is visible.  The rash feels rough to the touch, like  goosebumps.  I haven't changed detergents, nor have we eaten anything out of the norm.   I am wondering if maybe it has something to do with her not feeling well the other day.    I am somewhat reluctant to make an appointment with her pediatrician since she feels just fine now.  Any suggestions on what the rash could be? Thank you very much for your input.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi I was wondering if someone could give me some insight into my sons blood test results. My son has had lymphadenopathy *sp? for the past 6 months which is unilateral. Started with one large node now consists of several which are gradually getting larger in size and number. At time of noticing first lymph node son was fit and well.  Previous history is dialted renal kidney at birth - result after mag 3 renal scan was sluggish system and lower quadrant scarring of left kidney.  My son is now \"apparantly\" having one viral infection after another although the only symptoms seem to be raised temperatures and rashes that come and go. This has been present for the last couple of months.  I am currently waiting to see the pediatric consultant at the hospital but they have given me a waiting time of two months.  My sons blood tests results are as follows:  Basophil count 1.9  10*9/L Haematocrit 0.362 1/1 Target cells ++ occasional stomatocytes occasional smear cells lymphocyte count 6.69 10*9/L  all the other values are within normal range.  My question is that do these results show anything that i need to push the hospital for an earlier appointment or is it safe to wait till my appointment in late January?  Many thanks\n\n",

He just made me feel like a over concerned mum and said they would go on their own in time and discharged him.  Anyhow the follow up now is my son is now 20 months old so has now had these enlarged nodes for 14 months and my doctor has reffered me back to the pediatrician.  The lumps are quite hard and rubbery, there is one large one which is visibal when he turns his head - it is on the left side of his neck right in the middle and about 2.5cm long and 1.5 high. There are other nodes surrounding it one which is about half the size of the biggest one and the rest are just shotty.  My son has recurrent high tempatures of +40 with no other signs of illness and he seems and looks tired a lot of the time.  Is there anything I should ask the pediatrician this time, should I push for any tests?  Thanks Sammie\n\n",

However, my younger 2 who were at good weights at birth (4yo was 8lbs10oz, 3yo was 7lbs11oz) are now much smaller than their peers.  In both height and weight, they are both under the 10th percentile for their ages.  I had some worry when my 4yo was born because his PKU came back abnormal from the test at the hospital but subsequent testing ruled it out.  They also did h&h and iron because his skin was so fair that you could see his veins through the skin.  They are both very fair with blue eyes.  Neither seems to have any other development problems.  My 4yo was born by CS due to a semi-transverse position and my 3yo was born by repeat CS.  Should I worry about their small statures?\n\n",

Some children just like adults are smaller compared to their peers.  You said they are doing well developmentally- and that is very reassuring to me.  Other than size are they generally healthy.  Have you addressed your concerns with their pediatrician?   Were you told what specifically was originally abnormal with the PKU.  Sometimes it has to be repeated for other reasons like if it was done prior to 24 hours after the fist feeding. Sometimes it has to be repeated because of an error with the sample itself.    When your son had his H/H done were the results reassuring?  Are the children much more fair skinned in comparison to you or their father?\n\n",

    "content": "As far as genetics go, I would say yes, both my husband and I are somewhat on the shorter side (my being 5'3\" and he 5'8\")  whereas my previous husband was a bit taller (5'10') so that might account for the differences.  The two youngest children are not exceedingly fairer than us, but there is a noticeable difference.  At their last well-check, the doctor was slightly concerned about their growth but just adopted a wait and see attitude.  I failed to mention that they were both found to have slight murmurs, but these were classified as innocent and they are expected to outgrow them (I also had a benign heart murmur as a small child).  Otherwise, their doctor has no concerns about their development and their health appears good.   My 4yo has recently started a growth spurt so I am not as much concerned as I was (he's finally wearing size 4 clothing, though he is nearly 5).  I expect my 3yo should do the same in time.  As far as nutrition, they are both receptive to a wide variety of foods and thankfully not picky eaters, so I have no concerns there.  As far as the PKU, I believe I do remember that it was mentioned that the sample was insufficient.  The early H&H did show a low hemoglobin at that first check but after being supplemented on iron-fortified formula (doctor actually discouraged breast milk), subsequent tests were fine.    Thank you for your responses and reassurance.  I'm sure they are both as healthy as they appear to be, just sometimes a mother worries when her children are not like other children.\n\n",

I have changed the brand of diapers, changed her every hour, stopped feeding her any food with spices or salt or acid in them, and I can't make it go away. Her little bottom is bright red and she cries like it is unbearable when she pottys in her diaper.

I know it's a stretch but have you tried cloth diapers- I know it's a hastle- but may be worth it in your case.  I'd also try to keep her diaper area open to air as much as possible.  Try to limit acidic foods.  Use cloths to wipe instead of baby wipes, and rinse with water using a peri bottle before you wipe at all.  Keep the area as dry as possible, and a nice coating of Desitin after cleaning and patting dry.  I have a feeling she will be potty trained quite early.  If she has open sores have it looked at by the pediatrician- she may benefit from an antibiotic ointment such as Bactroban.  If it is yeast she should have responded to the NYSTATIN.      When your time permits give me an update on the situation\n\n",

She wants me to go to physical therapy, but I don't thnk it will help because I don't see it related to movement. It hurts when I walk but not because I walk. Also the day after I went to the doctor I noticed a bunch of tiny red dots that are spreading on my feet and legs under my skin. I don't know what to do because my doctor is saying it is nothing but it hurts too much to just be nothing. Any advice on what to do would be great.

Weight check was yesterday and he'd only gained 1 oz in one week, so at 22 days old he's still 9 oz. below his birth weight.  Nurse who did his weight check said any weight gain is good and just to \"keep doing what we're doing\" and bring him back for his 2 month checkup.  He has a weak suck and my daughter is also concerned that her milk supply has diminished since she began supplementing w/ forumla. He's alert and doesn't seem distressed, other than some gagging and strangling but very little vomitiing.  He's only had five or six bowel movements since birth but seems to be wetting normally.

Breast fed babies do not gain as much weight, as quickly as their formula fed peers.  La Leche League is a non-for-profit agency specificall for breast fed babies and I think they can really help support your daughter.  If your daughter pumps her breasts that might help- she should pump for every supplemental feed. Only six bowel movements and the weak suck does concern me- and needs to be addressed by the pediatrician.  Also helpful to me with this question is how many wet daipers a day.

Turns out she had borderline thyroid issues causing low milk supply, plus Sam's little mouth was too small to nurse properly or even bottle feed effectively.

The premie nipples are great for the babies with a weak suck for sure they enable the milk to come easily- but for the babies with a strong suck it allows too much milk with little effort- and they gag.  We usually realize this in the newborn nursery- but when mothers want to breastfeed only- we aren't able to try out the various nipples on them.  Given the choice the babies will also prefer a nipple over breast feeding because they realize they have to work harder for the breast- once really used to the breast they'll prefer it.  Sometimes when the mother becomes too frustrated with the breastfeeding, the babies are cranky and hungry- it's not good for either one of them.  His percentiles are great, you and your daughter are relieved and thats wonderful!\n\n",

Some people say no VSD would not cause these symptoms but what else is there?She is gaining weight fine she weighs 12 pounds now at 2.5 months old.Can VSD get worse and if so what are the symptoms?  Also I am worried at how high risk she is for RSV? I am terrified of her getting it since I know how bad it can be.The NICU  gave her the Synagis shot but local Dr. refused said if she got it she would be like \"normal\" baies getting it .Does her heart not make her higher risk plus the breathing problems she still has? I HAVE already spoken to my Dr. several times and he just seems to think nothing bad is happening her hear defect he never brings up and when I do I am told to not worry and that is it and then the Synagis shot he just said she did not need it.Any input,informaion, or advice I greatly would appreciate.

    "content": "Dear Shannon,  You have a lot of legitimate concerns.  Almost all babies are born with VSD, but it closes in some almost immediately -some as soon as the very first breath!  Because yor daughter was born early- her's may take a while to close.  It also seems the physicians are contradicting one another- and this can be very frustrating.  Synagsis In my opinion- and I am sure most would agree could only benefit your daughter- not only because of her cardiac condition but more so because of her respiratory condition- especially by the way you describe her respiratory status- which many other premature babies have- keep in mind they weren't meant to be born just yet so it puts a lot of stress on her.  Her pediatric cardiologist will know when the VSD becomes a problem- if your baby can wait given the circumstances, and her condition heart surgery should be put of as long as possible - and again lets hope the VSD closes up on it's own- this would be best for her.  The average healthy newborn sleeps for 18 hours- she may sleep more because of her prematurity- and other factors as well.  When it comes to high risk babies we were taught (at a level one trauma center- with a level 3 NICU -highest care avail) to handle these babies with \"professional neglect\"- sounds harsh but it's not-  the less you stimulate these babies  the better for them in more ways than one. I hope this was of help to you- how is she doing now?  If your time permits please give me an update on her condition.\n\n",

    "content": "I think it's wonderful that you are even considering a career in medicine.  It takes years, but if you are unsure you can change your mind along the way.  First thing is college and pre med.  Then medical school itself.  Once you have your bachelors degree which you will need you'll have many options such as medical school or law school.  A Doctor can't actually pick a specialty until they become a resident which is after being an intern.  I think it's during internship that most doctors decide or get accepted into a residency program.   So after you graduate from High School go on to college and your experiences will lead you to the direction you want to be.  Ask your guidance counselor if they know of any local programs where you can observe Doctors at the hospital, office, or clinic.  Most hospitals have volunteer programs, staff may allow you to interact/ observe  the children.   Maybe try that in your spare time.  Call Human Resources at any hospital and ask about the volunteer program.   It is hard but can be done!  I wish you much success.\n\n",

    "title": "2 month old with RSV in hospital",
    "content": "My 2 month old nephew was taken to the hospital last night. After a spinal tap, blood and urine tests they decided he has RSV. He was a full term baby weighing 9.6 at birth and now weighing over 13 pounds. He was diagnosed with reflux last week. But he has not yet been put on meds for the reflux.  Anyway, I am confused because they were only going to keep him over night to watch him in case he had a sleep apnea episode. His temp was 102. They said the RSV had not yet gone into his chest but, of course, they expected it to.   His white blood cell count was slightly low last night but they didnt seem too worried about it. Said he was fighting an infection so that was normal. Today they are worried about it and did cultures although I don't know what kind. They arent letting him go home either and his temp has only gotten higher.   Why would they be worried about his white blood cell count today and not last night (cancer?!) and what cultures might they be running? What else could be wrong? My whole family has been sick the last week so it isnt suprising the baby got sick but since I have a 6 year old son (he was a preemie and never got rsv thankfully) and we havent been exposed to them we havent gone to visit or anything. So my information is sort of limited.  Any help or information would be greatly appreciated!!  Mary Jo\n\n",

    "title": "RSV",
    "content": "Hello.  I know this reply is a liitle late, but maybe it could help someone else.    The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all infants under 4 months old presenting with fever, with out a known sourse of infection be admitted to the hospital for what we call a septic work-up, or rule out sepsis.  The sepsis work up usually consists of routine labs, along with blood, urine, and spinal cultures.  If the doctor has a known sourse of infection they may not do a full septic work-up.  For example if your 2 month old nephew has a sibling or another close contact who was known to have RSV, and your 2 month old nephew presented with RSV symptoms, the doctor may not choose to do a complete septic work up, and just treat the RSV.  RSV presents a lot like pneumonia (diagnosed by chest x-ray, and listening to the lungs), and RSV can turn  into a pneumonia.  RSV can also lead to an episode of Apnea.  Babies with RSV tend to vomit up the thick mucus caused by the virus so the doctor might have wanted to hold off starting reflux medications so see if it was true reflux or just caused by the virus.  We test the nasal secretions for RSV, so it's fairly easy to know if a baby has it or not.  However we'll see babies who are RSV negative and present the same as those who have it- yet they may just have another virus like the flu, pneumonia, or less likely a chronic respiratory disease like Cystic Fibrosis.    It sounds to me that your nephew was sick admitted for a septic work up, and was found to be RSV positive.  Now when treating a patient you don't just look at lab values, or even radiological tests- the most important thing is the infants respocse to the treatment!  How do they look, are they responding well to treatment?  As for your concern about the white blood count- it changes in responce to infection- can go either way (high or low) but not uncommon to be normal or on the lower end for a virus.  It is usually elevated with bacterial infection.  You didn't say the number so I don't know how low it really is- but you said slightly low so it dosen't sound alarming to me at all.  The cause for concern with a low white blood count is troblle fighting off infection.   Now you asked why did they worry about the white count today and not yesterday- and probably because the fever went higher, and we tend to repeat blood cultures during a high fever because that's when they will be most accurate, and if bacteria is in the blood (which is true sepsis) it will be detected in the culture.  The negative thing about cultures is they take a  while to get the results back.  A Microbiologists looks at the cultures every day and gives a progress report on what he sees- if he see's nothing it's negative.  They won't call it negative until no groth has been seen for a few days.  So the cultures done originally may be negative- if they even know the results of it( takes 2-3 days), and on repeat during a high fever they could come back positive- which needs to be treated with IV antibiotics and the specific kind to kill the bug that grew on the cultures.  If it's just fever from virus you nephew dosent need antibiolics, it wont hurt him (aside from possible side/adverse effects or allergic reaction) but it wont help him either.  The doctor has to weigh numerous factors to decide how to treat.  With RSV we are most concerned with their breathing.  I hope this was able to address your concerns.  I hope your nephew made a complete recovery.  This past winter RSV presented earlier and we saw late cases- at least in New Jersey we did.\n\n",

    "content": "Good morning,  My daughter is 7 and had walking pneumonia 3 weeks ago.  Since then she hasn't really been eating much and just keeps saying she is not that hungry.  She has had on and off illness all year.  She has no interest in food at all.  My question is, is this normal behavior for a 7 year old?  She was never a \"great\" eater but did eat and wasn't too picky but now it seems that she doesn't have an interest.  This week Sunday she had a fever of 101 again and that nasty cough, the fever went away after a day or so but she still has a cough.  I chalked it up to a cold.  She also has a preoccupation with her weight and will ask if her dad and I think she is fat.  She is a healthy 60 lb girl, she is pretty tall and doesn't look her weight at all.  I just worry that she could be starting on a path of poor self esteem even though her father and I tell her all the time how much we love her and how beautiful she is.  I think she looks at her friends her age that weigh 45-50 lbs and feels inferior in some way.  Should I be concerned?  Does she need to she a doctor about her eating and on and off sickness this year?  Just confused about this all!!!  Thanks !!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi rybakgirl, There are so many influences in the world today, many negative, which affect childrens self esteem, ie, peer pressure, magazines, television, etc., which portray the \"perfect image\" and it is so very incorrect to most of the worlds population. Children can be incredibly cruel and maybe someone is making particular remarks that she is finding hurtful. For one thing, you may want to have a meeting with her teachers to express your concerns and find out exactly what's going on in the classroom and on the playground. You could also bring up subjects with her regarding how her day has went, if anything in particular happened in school, essentially, communication. You and her father promoting encouragement is of course a great thing and certainly should be continued. You may also want to see if she is interested in becoming involved in certain activities, as this will promote self esteem, a sense of accomplishment, etc. Also, take her in for a follow up, and have the physician express the importance of a healthy diet. I hope this has been somewhat helpful. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

Get an explanation, that you understand, of what the test is that he wants to do. How is it done and what will it tell the doctor.  Cataract surgery is usually very quick to do, done by laser now, and fairly painless. If the tests show that your son has a vision problem with that eye, I would suggest having the cataract removed. He may be able to do all of the things that you stated using the vision of just one eye. Children can adapt rather quickly and easily to vision problems. At his age, he probably does not realize that he is not seeing well and thinks of his vision as normal. Which by the way, it is for him at the present.  Best of luck to you both and keep a good thought.\n\n",

I think I'm overly sensitive to these things because my father had a brain tumor and my nephew an anurism.\n\n",

    "content": "I have a 6 week old girl that I have just noticed a small growth on her belly button.  She also has torticollis, which my son also had for about 3 months after birth, but we are treating it.  She was 4 weeks premature, but is doing great.  She shows no signs that this is painful for her.  It is about 1/4\" around and is a reddish color.  She weighs about 7 1/2 lbs now and this could have been there before, but we just noticed it tonight.  The bottom layer of skin under her belly button covers it up and you have to pull it away a bit to see it.  Now that she is getting fatter, it is easier to see.  I have searched the internet to find any information on this, but have found none.  It looks like a smooth wart, or a blister.  Any information would be great.  We had a tough pregnancy-high blood pressure, lots of bleeding once a month 3 months into the pregnancy, bed rest...The baby had trouble gaining weight her first week, until the doctor had us supplement her with formula.  Her neck has a lump on it...anyway I would like to know how to tackle this, but I don't even know what this is.  Thank you.\n\n",

She is fairly certain it is a Epigastric Hernia.  Because my little one recently thinned out so much, it has just become more noticeable, however, if I am correct she would have had this since birth??  The Dr said she thinks that all of the straining she has had to do because of constipation causes it to bulge.  It seems to go in and out at different times.  I am worried about this.  I have a call in to the surgeon and I am waiting for an appointment.  I really know nothing about this type of thing so I would greatly appreciate it if you could shed some light.

She she very seldom eats breakfast and at lunch and dinner she takes a couple bites and then says she is not hungry.  She doesn't snack during the day either.  This has been going on for a few months now.  She is very healthy and has has no serious health problems.  She seems small for her age though (36\" tall and 31 pounds) i don't know if this is average size for a three year old but she is smaller than a lot of other 3 year olds we know. She is very active throughout the day so it seems like she would need more calories.  She isn't on any medications that would alter her appetite and everyone keeps telling me she'll eat when shes hungry but it seems like she's never hungry. Could this just be a phase she is going through?\n\n",

My daughters Dr said repeatedly she'll eat when she's hungry and to just let her eat what ever she wanted. It took awhile for me to relax but when I did there were days when she wouldn't really eat but a few bites here and there but there were others when she would just chow down. If her Dr isn't worried then take a deep breath and relax she will eat. Figure out her favorite foods and offer them frequently but don't stress out about it.don't let others pressure you or her to eat more. Even if she wants pizza for breakfast give it to her remember her body will use any food to it's advantage.( don't you wish we were kids again so we could eat anything we wanted) Don't let others pressure you or her to eat more.The more she is pushed to eat the less she will eat.

    "content": "Hi, My son is just over 2.5 years old.  For the past 1.5 months (give or take) his right eye has been pooling with tears.  Sometimes I can see a stream of yellow fluid in the tears.  It dries leaving crusty stuff.  I would guess his eye has extra fluid in it 50%-75% of his waking hours.  His eye is not red and he seems to be in no pain.  His eye is not crusted shut in the mornings.  Sometimes I notice his cheekbone is red (at one point I wondered if he had a sinus infection & the redness/warmth was coming through? - he has a fair complection).  This redness does not happen very often (2-3 times a week?).  I am not even sure this is a blocked tear duct - our primary care doctor thought it might be (over the phone by my description).    I can't find much information on blocked tear ducts in a 2 year old and what the treatments are... can you offer any information or suggested home treatments?  I found one site that mentions surgery with some drastic measures (like breaking the nose) or probing.... I don't want to panic prematurely... but I am starting to stress :)  We have an appointment with an ophthalmologist next friday.  Thanks for any info you can offer!  (no past diagnoses, no surgeries, no meds, & no known family history of anything like this).  Thanks :)\n\n",

Repeated trauma to those already traumatized bleeding vessels by irritation resulting from a cold or exposure to any of the allergens you've mentioned, can make things worse, so it's best to avoid these factors. If nothing works, and things are just as bad, go back to your doctor, and let him/her try to find out what went wrong.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I have a 16 year old son who had a osteochondroma removed from his hip last year.  Following surgery he had chest pain and his neck swelled which lead to a catscan of the chest.  The results showed slow flow through the superior vena cava vein, a mediastinal mass or a very prominent thymus measuring 3.0x2.0.   We then had a petscan which showed low tymic uptake suv 2.8.   The doctors decided to watch it for one more year since thymoma's are not very common in his age group.   We just had the follow up catscan done which showed that it had grown and now measures 3.9x 2.6.  The doctors would like to watch for one more year, but we are hesitant because it has grown.  His spleen is slightly enlarged, striations in the kidney(striated nephrogram), terrible bone pain and a non ossifying fibroma in left leg.   He has fatigue and cannot finish his workouts anymore.   I forgot to mention that he had gone through puberty by age 12 and his growth plates had closed by 12.  He had an advanced bone age test of approx 7 years advanced maturation.  Have you ever seen this in a young adult.  Thank You, Mary\n\n",

Since my last post we had a new catscan done to follow up on the kidneys and spleen that is now questioning whether or not this is benign or malignant  etiology.  The test showed new nodules in the left lung and enlarged lymph nodes near the spleen.  W e are worried now.  Have you ever seen this in a patient.  All of sudden it seems that whatever is wrong is spreading.  I am flying our son to Indiana to see an oncologist that specializes in the thymus for a second opinion.

    "content": "Hi Dr.  Ismail,  We just returned from our trip to get an opinion on our son's very rominent thymus and are now more confused than before we went.  He said he does not think it is a thymoma or lymphoma right now because of the shape. It measures 3.9 but has not taken an oval or round shape.  The location is behimd the chest cavity so is risky to do a biopsy.  The doctor said if it grows more or change size then come back, but in the meantime not to be concerned.   Do you think we should go with this opinion and just scan it again next year?   Also none of the doctors there have ever seen striations in the kidneys.  What could a striated nephrogram indicate?  The radiologist that read the catscan urged us to see an ocologist for the kidneys that it could be benign or malignant.   What do you recomment we do?   The nodules in his lungs were not addressed either so I am not sure where to look anymore.  We are exhausted from watching our son suffer with bone pain and not having reasons why these things are occurring.  Is there anywhere  I could send these catscans that would have seen  all of this before in one person?  I hope you can help me figure out what my next step should be.  My email is lucky52003@hotmail.com Thank you, Mary\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Dr.  Fouad, Thank you for responding to my post.  Sine my last post we have seen another oncologist and are now scheduled for another petscan this Friday.   The oncologist that we are seeing requested that we get the slides from the pathology department that diagnosed the bone tumor last year as a osteochondroma.  The doctors want to be absolutely sure it was  not an osteosarcoma since there has been too many new findings since that tumor was resected.  Is an osteochondroma and an osteosarcoma similiar in appearance?  The area that it was removed (femoral neck) now has infiltration.   Here are the details from catscan. The catscan on December 21 showed growing enlarged thymus 3.9 x 2.6  appearing solid with linear bands of fibrosis adjacent to major fissure in right lung.  On January 18th showed  lung nodules in the lingula and lower left lung, slightly enlarged spleen since December which  is a little concerning since mono and viral infections were ruled out.  There are mildly prominent mesenteric lymph nodes also present since december.  The low attenuating bands of foci in the kidneys bilaterally are of unknown etiology.  Our son has severe chronic bone pain, pain in hip and flank pain.  We are trying so hard to help him, but all are puzzled and hoping going back to the bone tumor may give them answer an begin to treat him.  Also he has a non ossifying fibroma that seems to be stable in his knee.  Could you recommend anything we should be doing or maybe help me with questions to ask at the hospital on Friday?  Is it possible the tumor  was an osteosarcoma and is causing all that is happening? I realize that you volunteer your time and understand you have many posts to read.  I appreciate any help.  Sicerely, Mary\n\n",

    "title": "Illness Unknown, Please Help!",
    "content": "I would like to ask a question concerning my daughter.  She is 12 years old, has been sick since the end of September, and missed at least 8-10 weeks of school.  She started out with a sore throat that wouldn't go away, even with antibiotics.  She then started having pain in her upper chest and shoulders.  Her voice sounds like she has laringitis, but there is nothing wrong with her throat at all.  She has had mononucleosis sometime in the past, but not now.  She sometimes runs small temperatures around 100-101.  She has had cultures for strep, nothing found.  She has had a scope down her throat into her stomach, normal results.  She has had a scope down her nose into her throat, normal results.  She has had a catscan of her brain, and xrays taken, normal results.  She has had an eeg, normal results.  She has had a MRI of the brain, normal results.  She has had numerous blood works done up, including systemic rheumatic diseases, lyme, epstein barr virus, hepatitis, cytomegalovirus, lupis, thyroid, sugar levels, etc.  All blood workup was normal, with a very borderline anemia.  She also had a xray of her chest, which was normal.  She has seen a rheumatologist at a adolescent clinic, a ENT physician, gastrointerologist, psychiatrist, and her primary care physician (pediatrician).  No one can figure out what is wrong with her.  They say that it could possibly be chronic fatigue, and anxiety disorders.  Her primary care physician put her on 25 mgs of Zoloft per day, which has increased her ability to stay up for the past 8 days on the med.  Her symptoms  that started on the second week of October have gradually become severe, which is a severe case of amnesia.  She doesn't remember some family members (such as aunts, uncles, etc.), friends, and other people including her physician.  She doesn't remember how to do mathematics, including counting to 10, and her spelling has letters doubled up. (example:  throat hurts, spelled throaeat huratese).  She was an honor roll student last year, and did fine the first three weeks of school this year.  Things are just progressively getting worse in her ability to remember things.  She says that sharp echoing noises bother her ears, so she cannot go to the mall anymore, which was one of her favorite things to do.   She cannot stand blue and green lights, and loves Christmas lights, but they hurt her eyes.  Her vision has changed since June, and so has her hearing.  Tomorrow we are due to take her to a neurologist, and are hoping to get some answers.  We live in a more rural area, so don't have many places to turn for information.  For myself, this has been a very difficult ordeal watching her just go downhill, and feeling totally helpless in being able to help her.  Her older sister who is almost 20 has severe Cerebral Palsy, with a collapsed lung, feeding tube, and a harrington rod in her spine, and requires 24 hour total care from the state. My ability to watch my younger daughter go downhill scares me very much, because I don't want her to end up severely disabled, and not be able to have an independent life.  Can you please help me?  Thank you very much.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Dr. Ismail:  Thank you so very much for replying to my message.   My husband and I appreciate the help very much!   We took our daughter to the neurologist who had read the MRI of the brain she had done on 12/06/05.  This MRI was completed on 11/09/05, and the appt at the adolescent clinic with the rheumatologist in Seattle  was on 11/17/05.  Her memory loss began approximately 10/10/05, and the illness began around the end of September.  The neurologist could see that there were a lot of difficulties in her memory, but didn't think any of them were related to a neurological problem.  He said that her MRI came back normal, and although he would recheck the MRI itself, didn't think that was the problem.  He did want to help, and try to figure out what was wrong, and said he would look into it, and we probably wouldn't hear anything for a couple of weeks as it would take time for him to go back through it.   She also had an appt with her pediatrician (PCP) on 12/07/05.  Her pediatrician(PCP) says that it is believed at this time  that our daughter has a conversion disorder along with chronic fatigue, and that this is the diagnosis unless something changes with what the neurologist says or the pediatric specialist.    She(PCP) wants our daughter followed by  the developmental behavioral pediatric specialist, and her Zoloft managed  as well.  Our daughter's pediatrician (PCP) increased her Zoloft from 25 mgs to 50 mgs per day.  Our daughter's pediatrician (PCP) also wants her to be counseled, and followed through with physical therapy as well.  She (PCP) wants her to return to school slowly to begin with, but to be increased to full time as her condition tolerates.  She(PCP) said that school is known to be beneficial to patients who have chronic fatigue, and conversion disorders.    I do notice that her energy level has improved so much by the Zoloft.  She was able to go into a mall the second day upon the Zoloft increase, which was 12/09/05.  This is the first time since 10/23/05, that she has been able to go into the mall, which made her very sick on the October date.    My question is: Does this sound like a reasonable diagnosis, or does the possibility of a neurodegenerative disorder still exist?  Should a follow up MRI still be performed, and if so, I wonder how I should go about asking the physician for one?  Our daughter's pediatrician (PCP) is pretty set on not involving any more physicians or clinics in our daughter's case anymore, as she feels that our daughter  has had a full evaluation already completed at this time with all test results normal.  She said that the anemia was very borderline, and that could be the results of our daughter's menstrual cycle.    Thank you very much for all your help, and it is appreciated very much!\n\n",

You must remeber that they definitely have a better chance at evaluating her condition since they can examine her thoroughly. If it's just a memory loss and fatigue with no neurological affection, then the possibility of neurodegenerative disease is now remote.

    "content": "Dear Dr. Ismail:  Our daughter is still on Zoloft at 50 milligrams per day, and she will see a pediatrician who specializes in diability and mental health related issues.  She is having her hearing evaluated, and also her vision as well, since her school recently tested her, and has seen a severe change in both.  We are having a new doctor take a look at her as well, and he has ordered a lot more blood workup done, and is sending them off to California, as well as other labs for evaluation.  The Lyme test he sent off to California, and the results will be in around next week.  Her thyroid test came back, and he said that it shows she has a thyroid deficiency.  He wants me to monitor her temperature with a Basal thermometer morning, and evening until we see him on January 12th.    She is still about the same, with some days being better than others.  She went to a Christmas Party one evening with a lot of excitement, and the next morning could not recall any of the last evening's events. She does not appear to be depressed, and is able to make fudge,  did the entire family decorating, and enjoyed Christmas very much!  I cannot understand if this is a somatoform anxiety disorder called conversion disorder, why doesn't she show any signs of anxiety related issues, or depression?  She seems to be happy, unless she gets exhausted and worn out physically.  I have also asked her pediatrician about hypnotism, as I read  on the internet that this is a good tool to use with conversion disorders, and have not heard back from her yet about this.  I really appreciate your help on this, and am sorry that it took a while to get back to you, as it has been the holidays and have been busy.  Thank you !\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Dr. Ismail: Our daughter was diagnosed with Lyme disease earlier this month.  The doctor who we took her to was more of a homeopathy type of physician who did a lot of blood testing, such as a hair analysis for heavy metals, a lyme test from Igenex Labs, hormone profile, thyroid, sputim test, and also a urinalysis.  The results from this found that she was low in a variety of items, and has been put on a variety of drugs.  She is now on Armour Thyroid meds, cortisone, is now on Tindamax, an anti-infective drug to fight the Lyme disease.  Although our daughter had been tested twice before for Lyme, they came back negative.  The new test showed positive on a IGM  Western blot.  We have put her on the drugs per doctor's orders, and she has improved a lot.  She is getting counseling, and last week we started a neuro-psychological evaluation to be done by a psychologist in a nearby town that has a vast amount of knowledge of Lyme disease.  She is scheduled to start physical therapy also, and we are hoping that this will improve her problems.  I read  an article from Reader's Digest, which said that Lyme disease is one of the top ten diseases that are most difficult to diagnose.  I am hoping that there will be more information available to the general public, and to educate professionals about Lyme disease.  There is a website called Turn the corner.org which gives a lot of information about Lyme disease, and that it is all across the nation.  I am amazed by all the information that a person can receive about this disease.  Everyone is at risk, if they are unprotected against ticks.  We went to a Lyme support group in our area, and have been told that it is now being found that mosquitoes can give Lyme disease as well.   I am very glad that we now know what is medically wrong with our daughter.  We now need to focus on getting her treatment which will help her, and hopefully she will regain her memory.  She is joining an adolescent support group online, and I am hoping this will give her some added support that she will need.  Thank you very much for all your help so far, and I will keep you updated on her condition.\n\n",

I am hoping that there can be a lot more education available to the medical professionals and public  about the treatment of Lyme disease.   There appears to be two different approaches to the disease, and I got this information from a National Lyme organization.  There are some websites that I thought would be helpful information to anyone, and I wanted to give them to you.  They are:  http://www.lymenews.com ,   www. lymenet.org ,  http://www.ilads.org ,www.lymediseaseassociation.org ,  http://www.lyme.org , and anyone in Washington State there is http://www.walyme.com.  Some states have support groups, and also websites.  There are places for children to get support as well.    Thank you again for all your help, and I will let you know how my daughter is doing.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Dr. Ismail:  I wanted to update you on my daughter's condition.  She had a MRI of her spine a week ago.  We were contacted by her pediatrician with the results, and there was arthritis found in her spine, as well as some issues with her disc by her upper neck.  This explains the pain she has had in her neck, and back. She apparently has some beginning problems with Koliosis also.    I asked the other doctor that we had an appt with two days ago, if this could be caused by the Lyme.  She showed me where that the changes occurred after December, and this was most likely from the Lyme disease.  We are taking her to a Lyme specialist in California who also sees some other people we have met through a Lyme support group.  I am hoping that he will give us some valuable information that we need.  We are also taking her to a children's hospital for an evaluation.  This seems that her medical help in California will be ongoing for quite a while.  It is a long ways to travel for help, but we hope worthwhile for the course of action it needs.    Thank you!\n\n",

Thoughts of certain things make him sick too.  I was the same and so was my dad.  There are times when he throws up after every meal and other times when he won't eat because he feels like throwing up.  There has to be an answer to this.  The doctor was baffled (those were his words) because it is not consistent (ex. lasts for a week and stops for two).  I look forward to a response and thank you for your time and help in creating this forum and helping people like me.\n\n",

    "content": "Well Lisa, There is a condition known as 'cyclic vomiting' which is a form of migraine. There is a pattern for vomiting which usually occurs in clusters every 3-4 weeks. It is also more common in males. But you've also described that anything that upsets him starts him vomiting, which could also happen with an exaggerated gag reflex as a result of stress. If these options have not already been put forward, then discuss them with your doctor and see what he thinks.\n\n",

He sometimes complains that his chest hurts and I asked what kind of hurt, he said like a burning/hot feeling.  I have been trying to keep track of what he eats when he throws up, how he feels before he throws up and what he dirnks.  I don't allow him to eat chocolate anymore because according to the article I read, children with GERDS should avoid it, as well as pepperoni pizza.  Thank you again!\n\n",

Sometimes he wakes up nautious other times he is fine, sometimes he gets the chest pain, sometimes he doesn't; sometimes he gets a stomach ache before vomiting, sharp pains, and sometimes he is feeling perfectly fine and then he throws up.  Since I have started limiting the kinds of food he eats, am seeing a difference.  I am allowing him to eat pasta but no more than once a week (a week can pass without him eating it).  The food portions are smaller and less juice intake.  I am trying to get him to drink more water.  He loves Pasta Alfredo but I notice he vomits every time he eats it; yesterday was the first time he didn't but I gave him a small portion.  He doesn't like milk at all; not big on ice cream either so I don't push it.  Thank you again.  Lisa\n\n",

    "content": "I had my almost 4 year old daughter to the Er on thanksgiving night with a high temp 102.6 and stomach pain. They did blood work (CBC, differential, renal studies), straight cathed her and a chest x-ray. The Er doc said that on the chest x-ray there was possibly something on her lung that looked like pneumonia but wasn't sure. She treated it as pneumonia though even though my daughters' lungs sounded clear. Today I got copies of her blood work and urine results and the Dr. report.  The blood work was alright except her MPV was 7.0 ,RDW was 11.4, NEUT was 95.9, LYMPH 5.8, ABS NEUT was 9.7,sodium 134, CO2 17, Creatinine .3. Her urine test results were fine except for the ketones were 40 glucose was 85. The x-ray report in the Dr report reads \" Chest x-ray demonstrated an area next to the right cardiac border where there is some obscuring. This possibly suggests of an infiltrate. X-ray was interpreted be me in the absence of a radiologist, and there are 2 views. Should I be worried about diabetes with her urine showing ketones? There is a long history of diabetes on both sides of the family. Would you please explain the blood test results I posted.\n\n",

But a radiologist has to have a look at those X-rays, or she may need a re-ray, if the first one is not clear. In addition, pnuemonia should also be diagnosed by auscultating the chest with a stethoscope. As for the lab studies, the differential count needs to be interpreted in terms of the percentage of each in relation to the total WBC count. Her sodium and creatinine levels are normal.

I always keep track of what she eats and so far can find nothing that causes it. We have had her to a gastroenterologist who found nothing to physically cause her to vomit. Also Her Dr is having us take her to speech therapy the beginning of the year he thinks her speech center is not developing properly.  With the way her blood work reads am I being unnecessarily worried or should I be more pushy with her Dr?\n\n",

There is no fever, cough or headache and she usually is fine after vomiting.

Now I'm really worried as the chest x-ray was normal. What would cause her blood work to be what it was if it wasn't pneumonia. Also another thing about my daughter it is taking for ever for her hair to grow back (long story short about 7 months ago she tried to cut her and her brothers hair and both had to be shaved) My sons' hair is already about 1 1/2 inches long my daughters' is only about an 1/2 inch. Her hair is really brittle and breaks easily. When her hair was longer there were times when she would have a hat on that when she would take it off  there were clumps of hair.\n\n",

He said that alot of people with only one dose of ibprophen can have stomach problems. Next week my daughter goes for an upper GI test. He also said that if she has another bout of vommiting while on the prevacid to call them and they will schedule her for an endoscopy. I'm hoping for the best. I'm hoping that finally we are on the right track. I'll let you know what the results of the upper gi are. Also something I thought about this evening was could possibly part of my daughters stomach be pushing through her diaphragm and would the upper gi show this. I will be contacting her Dr tommorrow about the possibility\n\n",

    "content": "I do not have growth hormone feficiency, bbut the doctor has nonetheless allowed me, if I so wish, to be injected with HGH. However, my father, an orthopedic surgeon, has suggested an alternative known as KIMI. Growtaller.net offers Kimi for 50$ and MFIII for 160$. Now I know that it may seem like a scam, but they have free 1 on 1 phone consultations, a lifetime money back gaurantee, and people on message boards talking about their success with it. They have the most scientific backing of any site I've ever seen. So I have a new question, do you think that insoles based on the principle of reflexcology can stimulate natural hormone production? Also, the package comes with revolutionary pills called MFIII, filled with young sheep cells wich are supposed to revitalize growth plates and bones, basically unfusing bones, which is a treatment used in Switzerland. I'd appreciate it SO much if you could quickly glance at these two pages and tell me if they are legit:  1. http://www.growtaller.net/device.html                  -  kimi 2. http://www.growtaller.net/supplement.html           - MFIII\n\n",

I must say I'm not a great fan for new products, until they've been used long enough to exclude the possibility of long-term side effects. But, that's my opinion! I've searched the net for opinions on these two products, and found, I hope, a useful forum, where many with similar questions to yours, share their experience with each other and with the experts. May be you'd like to check it out: http://www.network54.com/Forum/189510\n\n",

    "content": "Im Peter. The KIMI products are very much a SCAM. I have not tried them myself. but I know stuff about them.   They have a repution/proof of not answering letters, no working products, painful products, products that don't contain what it says to contain AND check this out, they even call customers losers and other names that are generally not considered nice when the poor people wants to send them back. They are currently running 8 diffrent companies with similliar scams, how do I know that? those companies boxes and packages have the same producers, generally looks the same and really are the same. Some of the there companies have fake, hidden or the same adresses as some of there other companies. That is what I know about KIMI, yoko and all the other names they have. some of there companies have been shut down though along side 10 other companies a couple of weeks ago by the royal canadian mounted police. that should make one suspicious of KIMI.  The network54 forum: http://www.network54.com/Forum/189510 I don't think the content there is to be taken to serious, there are a few tips and hints, suspiciously enough though is that the forum in question is written by one and same person which works for a heighboosting company. so that doesnt seem to nice of them to mislead people. NOTE: I can be wrong about the forum. But I know KIMI good.  I wrote this to assist davecraze101 in his search with the little information I have. I have investigated height gaining stuff for some time now and I love to share and help. I hope it helped.  //thanks\n\n",

    "content": "some working things is the growth hormones under controlled circumstances ( doctors help or other professionals and alternative amateurs). also hypnosis can be good. some folks laugh at hypnosis, but I don't. I think thats one of the safe ways of growing. There has been serveral documented attemts with hypnosis induced height gaining and they have worked. In germany a docotr in the sixties sucessfully hypnotized his subjects to grow taller, documented it with video and photographs. My favorite exampel is the guy Hans who grew 32 cm (1 feet 1) in three months , hans was 25, now that is an extreme subject but what I am trying to say is that it worked on many people, the catch is that the subject has to have the abillity to be hypnotized. Diffrent theirys have said that people who have a low IQ is harder to hypnotize and others suggest the opposite. so that can be worth trying.  I have the same problem with short stature I am 5'4 \u00bd (167cm). hypnosis don't work on me though as I am not able to get hypnotized by any of the hypno docotrs I have been to.  hope this helped to. if you want to give me more questions my e-mail   EccentricEye@hotmail.com  //thanks\n\n",

Is tjhere any chance for maybe 2 more years at a bone age of 17. My height based on parents should be more like 5\"10 or \"10.5, so this is very dissapointing.

After that, a combination of solid foods and breast milk should be given until your baby is at least 1 year old.  The usual first food is a little rice cereal mixed with the liquid your baby is most used to: breast milk or formula.  Then gradually introduce vegetables and fruits,or plain whole-milk yoghurt. Start with a few small spoonfuls, and work up to approximately an ounce of each food. There are some foods that are generally withheld until later and include egg whites, cow's milk, citrus fruits and juices, and honey. They should be withheld until after a baby's first birthday.\n\n",

The risk of having more than one child with a hole in the heart is very low.  I think my geneticist said like 2%.  If your child is growing and breathing normally, they usually just wait to see if they outgrow it.  The doctors can hear more than just the murmur when they listen to the heart.  They can usually tell the location of the murmur as well as other abnormalities.  Of course if you have any reason for concern, doctors are not offended if you seek a second opinion.  Rather, I think they are reassured of their diagnoisis  if things come back as they expected.  Nikky,PCC\n\n",

Well my daughter falls a lot when walking. From what I see of other 2 year olds, she falls a lot more then they do. Its worse when she has shoes on but regardless of wearing shoes or not, she still falls quite a bit. She is able to climb and do every thing else without any problems but I do worry about her falling so much. Should I be worried? Does my daughter need braces even though her current Dr. thinks other wise? Is there anything I can do to help her walking? If she doesn't need braces, is there anything I should be doing to help??  Any and all advice is much appreciated!\n\n",

His suggestion was let her go bare foot as much as possible and that she would grow out of it. At the time I thought he should do more but he was right she did grow out of it. My suggestion is take her to your pediatrician and ask him about it and ask for a referral to a pediatric orthopedic and follow their instructions. It will be rough for awhile you will want to do everything to protect your child but remember all kids fall and bounce back. Don't you wish we adults were as lucky.   :)\n\n",

Two years ago she had 2 surgeries to remove cervical lymph nodes on the opposite side and a different area that were atypical mycobacterium.  All the doctors say it is impossible to have it a 2nd time but don't offer what the other possiblilties are.  She has had ongoing medical/lab issues since after the original infection but never thought to be related.  The lymph node now is about the size of a .50 cent piece, is not painful, and is movable.  It is not hard like the one before.  She has no fevers but has lost just over a pound and hadn't gained any in a year.  Basic labs last week everything was normal except her lyphocytes were high but they have always been high everytime she has it checked.  What are the likely diagnosis? Any ideas would be helpful.  Thank you Tammy\n\n",

For the past year, he has been on antibiotics 8 times.  He had 5 episodes of strep throat and finally had his tonsils and adenoids removed in November.    In October, I noticed he had a swollen lymph node on the right side of his neck.  Both our pediatrician and ENT said it was from his bouts of strep throat.  It is now the middle of January and he still has the swollen lymph node.  He had some bloodwork done last week.  His WBC was slightly low.  The only thing that was really off was his sed. rate.  It was 30 (I was told that normal was 0-10).    We are repeating the blood test next week to see if it is still elevated.  I try not to worry, but I am concerned about all of this.  Does this sound like anything to be concerned about?  He will be seeing his immunologist for his regular check up on Feb. 1, but I'd like to have more information before then.  Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "This is a difficult situation. Are you a first time mother?  I am not a Pediatrician but I have been a nanny for 6 years and specifically with newborns for the past 4 years, and I am now pregnant with my first.  I can give you some very valuable advice.  First I would have to start but asking you some questions.  How many times a day is your daughter breast feeding and have you begun to give her water in her bottles inbetween feedings?  When you start her on solids, in 2 weeks, aim for high fiber choices particularly fruit and vegtables. Specifically Prunes. I have a strong feeling if you were to try it you would have great success.  Avoid too much applesauce; carrots and bananas because they are known to increase constipation.also solid white rice when you get to that stage for finger food at 8 months.   My next point is, always get a second opinion!!!!!!!!! Do not wait two months if you feel this needs to be taken care of now. Get on the phone with your pediatrician and demand a list of referals until you get an appointment inside of 2 weeks.  On an ending note, what is your family history, if possible make a call to your mother, and mother in law and find out the history of infants possibly carrying these symptoms.  Use all your resources and don't take NO for an answer!  Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Going directly to Drinking from a cup is not uncommon for breast fed babies. A girlfriend of mines son (breastfed only), went directly to a straw in a sealed cup. If she does well then I would definately continue giving her water but still, try to continue once giving her a sippy cup.  What I am confused with is that in addition to feeding her 6 times a day you are having to get up and feed her 2-3 times at night? Thats 8-11 time in 24 hours???!!  Breast fed babies  4-6 months only need  28 to 32 ounces per day which is 4-6 feedings.  Dry Infant Cereal : 3 to 5 tbs. single grain iron fortified cereal mixed with water or breastmilk.  *^And remember to make cereal feedings at this level very soupy.    Fruit : 1 to 2 tbs., plain, strained /1 to 2 times per day  Vegetbles: 1 to 2 tbs., plain, strained/1 to 2 times per day  If she is waking up 2-3 times per night it is probably a combination of hunger for solids and dehydration. Try giving her just water at night and longer feedings during the day.  The only other thing is if she is oversleeping during the day beyond 2-3 times a day. I hope this helps you.

Often he must stop what he is doing immediately and lay down \"curled up\" until the pain subsides.  It does not seem to be made worse by any particular activity or food intake and meds (Prevacid, etc.) do not relieve it.  The durations of pain are daily, random and last approximately an hour or so.  Once the pain passes, he resume normal activities but the pain returns on a regular, daily basis.

Nothing relieves the pain,it gets worse in the evenings, and is just as bad when lying down as standing up or sitting. I am wondering what exactly i should do to help her realize this is something I think needs to be looked at because before this got bad i have gone to her and she usually just brushes it off? What should i ask her, and tell her? Would you recommend any tests? Do you know what this might be caused by?                                      -Thank you :)\n\n",

    "title": "My 5 year old wont sleep!!!",
    "content": "Hello, my doughter is 5 and she has adhd.  She taked dexedrine once a day.  Usually around 7:30 - 8:00 am.  The meds work great throughout the day.  When she gets home from school around 3:30  the meds are wearing off.  This drives me nuts!!  The doctor is getting ready to up her dosage.  They want to get an ekg on her  and then prescribe a sleep aid.  This is really bothering me.  If a med is so strong or whatever that you have to have an ekg first, i don't know that i want her on it.  I don't know what the med is they want to put her.  I have been putting off the ekg for months now.  She doesnt sleep until around 2-3 am.  and doesnt sleep later than 8 am.  She aslo has inherited from her dad, some kind of sleep disorder, she talks in her sleep and grits her teeth, and just seems very disoriented if woken up.  I don't know if this will have any effect on whatever meds they want to put her on.  I have tried everything.  Its to were now she lays in bed with the door shut light off and talks to herself for hours.  What should I do?  I am in desperate need of advise.  Any suggestions are welcome.  Misty\n\n",

My wife and I have talked to our pediatrician and he told us to not give her a suppository and to sit her on the potty for 15 minutes a day.  This has not worked so far.  She has held it for so long now that she will sit on the toilet screaming and crying for an hour or so and not let it out.  We think she has developed a small hemmoroid and a bladder infection.  She says it burns when she urinates now.  She will hold her urine for a long time as well.  We just don't know what else to do to get her to realize that she must go to the bathroom.

    "content": "Obviously it's become painful for her to defecate as well. It may be due to the hemorrhoids or due to anal fissures from prolonged constipation where the stools become very hard and so cause injury to the rectum and anus. First of all, try to make her diet mainly a soft diet with plenty of fluids in order to loosen those stools.  Then there are local anaesthetic creams which your doctor can consider. He may also wish to consider laxatives, at least temporarily until the pain disappears. She will need a urine analysis to exclude infection. Urine retention may accompany constipation and predispose to bladder infection. Lastly, you may need to see a pediatric surgeon for the hemorrhoids.\n\n",

We are usually in the car for at least ten or fifteen minutes before she starts feeling bad.    Often times she feels so bad, she can't enjoy where we are going. As an example, the other day I drove her to a favorite playground.  She was very excited to go. She started feeling bad on the way, and by the time we got there, she didn't feel well enough to get out and play.  Is it possible she is suffering from motion sickness?     She is a happy, easy going child and is otherwise very healthy, except for occasional headaches.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you very much.\n\n",

If, however, the lump is not at all related to trauma and it was incidentally discovered, it could be due to some benign hormonal changes that cause premature breast enlargement, which is common.  There are, of course, other causes, but a thorough examination by your doctor should identify the nature of this lump.\n\n",

We moved to a new country 3 months ago and he has been having quite a few colds since we arrived, and just got over one a couple of days ago.  I don't remember him breathing like this so much before we came but it is possible he was.  I asked him to close his mouth(as a game) for about 20 seconds, and he was able to breathe through his nose, it doesnt sound stuffed up, but it doesnt sound 100% clear either.  What could this be, is it something to be concerned about?  I remember hearing things about life long mouth breathers and the other complications that can develop but im not sure this is the same thing. thank you so much for any input anyone may have! kagan\n\n",

    "content": "The 3 1/2-year-old daughter of my friend is having some very strange speech problems. She still cannot speak in a way which is characteristic in her age, which is 3 years old. When you ask her something such as \"Where is mommy?\", she just stares at you and/or repeats what you have just said. We are suspecting that she is an autistic child. A male autistic friend of mine, now 16 yrs. old, behaves the same way when he was 3 years old. We are comparing this 3 1/2 yr. old girl to a 2 1/2 yr. old girl. The 2 1/2 yr. old girl behaves in a very lively way, interacting with people she sees and talking to them, with a friendly manner. It seems to us that the 2 1/2 yr. old girl is actually more developed than the 3 1/2 yr. old.  Do you think this 3 1/2 yr old girl is an autistic child? We are having problems due to her parents being closed to such a possibility, even not consulting a specialist to clarify matters. Or is it just because the 3 1/2 yr. old is a \"slow learner\"?  Any help will be greatly appreciated.  Clarence\n\n",

    "content": "My 3 year old son was born a bit pretern with an undescended testicle. It did eventually drop down. 2 different pediatricians have confirmed that it was down at appointments. Everything I have read makes me certain it is a retractile testicle. Often when looking at him, you would think he only has one testicle, It does typically rest high, sometimes even up in the groin area. When he is warm or in the bathtub, both are down. Our pediatrician referred us to a ped Urologist who felt around for about a second and ordered an orchidopexy. He said that it seemed tight and probably \"wouldn't come down on it's own\" at this point. I tried to explain that it DOES come down and is not always up in the groin. I know what 2 testicles look like when they are both down, I am an NICU nurse. I have to check for this very frequently. I don't know if he just wasn't listening or if he cared. He was in our room for a total of 5 minutes and I did not feel like I really got to explain the situation or that I received much info from him-- if we do need to pursue surgery, I will not have this guy do it. It just seems to me that it is not a true undescended testicle and from what I know and have read, surgery isn't really indicated at this point. I absolutely want to do the right thing by my son, so can someone else offer some advice. If it is retractile, can't we just hold off on surgery? What do you think would make the urologist make such a quick judgement? My family has a history of bad reactions to anesthesia and I don't want to put my son through surgery unless it is absolutely necessary, Please offer advice!\n\n",

    "content": "I am sorry this post is so long, there is a lot of information and data collected over the last 8 months, which help to paint the whole picture. Please help!! Any suggestions would be appreciated! In late March, my daughter (2 years old at the time) developed a high fever (102-105). She continued this fever for a little over a week. Her only other symptoms were sore throat and stomach pain. When her fevers dropped, they were 100-103 and continued in that fashion for two more weeks. She would run fevers at least twice a day and usually in the afternoons/evenings or nighttime. It was during these two weeks that we had her first ultrasound and CBC. The ultrasound was of her abdomen and showed \"multiple lymph nodes in right lower quadrant\" these ranged from .4cm to 1.4cm in size. Her CBC abnormalities were as follows: C Reactive Protein (High)2.2 SED Rate (High)87 RBC (Low)3.73 MCH (High)29 Neutrophils (High)75 Lymphocytes (Low)16 At the end of the three weeks of fever, she had lost 4 pounds (she was only 28.5 lbs to begin with, so this was a large drop). They decided to admit her to the hospital. At the time of admission, her RBC had continued to drop (3.34) and her SED rate had elevated to 94. While in the hospital her fevers would spike so quickly that by the time the nurse would get the thermometer, she would be drenched in sweat. After four days in the hospital they released us with a possible juvenile rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis. She continued to run low grade fevers (99 to 100)for the next 4 weeks. At this point her blood work was taken again. Her new counts were as follows: SED (High)26 RBC (Low)3.99 MCH (High)28.5 Everything else was normal. Six days later, I came home from work to find a golf ball size lump in her neck. They redid blood work and did a subsequent ultrasound and CT of her neck, as well as an x-ray of her chest. The repeat blood work showed (6 days after previous CBC): RBC (Low)3.97 MCH (High)29.2 Lymphocytes (Low)39 A few atypical Lymphs were noted by the reviewing doctor (not sure what that means) No SED Rate test was done The ultrasound showed a mass, without \"necrotic phlegmen or abscess\". There was some vascularity in the mass (not sure what this means). The CT showed that the adenoids and tonsils were somewhat enlarged, but did not cause an obstruction. The mass measured 3.8 x 2.1 x 3.0 cm. It was suggested that the inflammatory process was probably matted lymph nodes. It was suggested that it was possibly a thyroglossal duct cyst. The x-ray of her chest was normal. The first ENT we saw (who was not a pediatric ENT) felt that it was an infected thyroglossal duct cyst. After about a week, the mass started leaking brown fluid through her skin. The fluid was cultured and no infection was found. Our second opinion was a pediatric ENT, who felt that it was not a thyroglossal duct cyst, but was not able to give us an alternate diagnosis. After about two weeks of draining (tree weeks after initial appearance) it seemed to be resolved, leaving only a gas pocket in it's place (noted by a repeat CT).  About two weeks later, she once again started fevering. It was a Monday morning and we weren't able to wake her up. She seemed a little warm, but we thought it was the heat (we live in Florida). She then sat up and opened her mouth to let out a brown frothy liquid (about a cup). She didn't really vomit, it was just kind of there. We ran her to the doctor. She \"vomited\" once more on the way there and twice at the office. By the time we go there, her fever was 103. They gave her two phenergan suppositories and one FeverAll suppository. The FeverAll didn't even touch the fever. By the time we got home it was up to 105. We gave her Motrin, followed an hour later by Tylenol. only then did her fever come down a couple of degrees. She continued with these fevers (102-105.5)for about a week again. Then she started with the lower grade fevers of 100-103. After two weeks of fevers, the doctor redid her blood work. I am in the process of getting a hard copy of this report, however I know that it showed an elevated CPR and her SED rate was back up to 51. A week later, I took her to the ER where they did more blood work and another CT scan. Her CT showed no regrowth in her neck. That blood work was as follows: SED Rate (High)60 Elevated CRP RBC (Low)4.27 We seemed to be fine for about 7 weeks. Then she started fevering again. This time the fevers reached 106. Although, they did not last as long (about 7 days) before turning to the fast, drenching sweats, they were the highest her fevers have gotten so far. About five days into the fevers this time, she developed a hard, immobile mass about 3cm in diameter behind her left ear. They put her on antibiotics and it went away about 2 wks later. This time we did an immune panel along with SED rate. Her blood work was as follows: SED Rate (High) 82 CRP (High) 4.61 RBC (Low) 3.60 MCH (High) Neutrophils (High) IgA (High) 191 IgG (High) 1268 Also there are some misc. symptoms which have developed over the last seven months. Our daughter started sucking her thumb - she never did this before (ever) and never even took a pacifier as a baby. Her memory seems to come and go - some days she is fine (can identify all letters, write her name, etc), other days she can't remember what a toothbrush is called (has known this for 2 yrs now). She is constantly irritable (not the happy, easy going little girl I have always had) and in between fevers is either whinny and clingy or extremely hyperactive and manic. With the last two bouts of fevers, she had several occasions where the fevers were preceded with her lips, hands, feet, and nose turning blue (they were freezing cold despite her 102 or higher temp). She also seems to get very thirsty before her fevers strike. She is still at only 27 lbs and is often pale in the face with dark circles under her eyes.\n\n",

    "content": "This is very troubling! Has there been any blood, urine or stool cultures performed?  Also, has TB been excluded? You've mentioned that juvenile rheumatoid arthritis had been suspected at a time, so was there any joint affection, and what lab studies were done to confirm or exclude that diagnosis? As for your child's abnormal behaviour, it is expected that she act irritable and agitated with the constant illness and fever. The thumb-sucking is a sort of auto-protective and soothing mechanism where she would regain that sense of comfort she once had whilst suckling and breastfeeding. As for the bluish discolouration, this can very well happen with any rapid rise of temperature, sometimes also with shivering and rigors.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you so much for responding. There are times where my husband and I feel so alone in all of this, and aren't sure where to turn. It was wonderful to find this web site and even better to have someone respond with some direction.  The blood cultures performed were mostly CBC's, SED and CRP rates, and finally an immunoglobulin panel. Oh, she also was tested for cat scratch, and a couple of other similar fever inducing diseases. All were negative. She has had many urine cultures, all which came back neg. She has NOT been tested for TB. Should we have her tested for TB? As far as the JRA goes, she has not really had any known joint swelling, or any other joint related symptoms which would lead us to believe that that is what this is. The only tests related to JRA are the SED and CRP tests (which both come back high during the fevers, and never completely return to normal between fevers), and the RH(?) test, which came back negative. Thank you again for your time, thoughts, and help!\n\n",

    "content": "Let's see what we have here and examine the possibilities. I can understand why your doctors thought of of JRA, as there is a type known as 'systemic onset JRA' which presents with similar symptoms and signs. Joint affection may not occur early. But I also believe TB needs to be excluded because of a CT report which mentioned 'matted lymph nodes'. TB can also present with a similar clincal picture. The presence of atypical lymphocytes in one of the CBC reports could point to some viral infection as cytomegalovirus or Ebstein Barr virus. Discuss these points with your doctor and see what they think.\n\n",

It has been about 6 weeks without incident, but Thursday she started running a fever again, on and off. This one has not been as high (about 103.5). She did start complaining of a sore neck around the same time. Friday, I thought I could feel a small mass, but wasn't sure. The mass is just to the left of midline. Saturday and Sunday, the mass seemed to get slowly larger. I took her to the ER Sunday night because she was very uncomfortable (her neck hurt).  Although the doctor only gave us pain medication, she did say that the lump did not have a very defined border, and suggested that at this point we demand a biopsy and possibly a consult with a hemotologist/oncologist. What do you think?\n\n",

Some kids seem prone to them and they seem to last forever. If you are concerned then I'd say sit down with your pediatrician and talk with them make sure your concerns are being heard and ask them to run any tests that might help figure out what type of infection is causing this it maybe that it is a very antibiotic resistant strain. Here's somethings I've done with my little ones when they have had ear infections. Lay them down with a warm heating pad or warm hot water bottle(not hot so as to avoid burns). another thing try giving the little one a lolipop or something else to suck on to try to open the ear canal to allow it to drain(just like chewing gum while on a plane trip. I hope this might help Good luck and remember like everything else this to will pass.\n\n",

Also, fungal infections are common and never respond to antibiotics, but need antifungal treatment, so make sure that this has been excluded. Always remember to feed your child while he's in the upright position, and maintain that position for a while after feeding, as in laying the child down, it is very likely that any regurged feeds may pass into the ear tubes (Eustachian tubes) predisposing to ear re-infection.\n\n",

    "content": "My 9 year old son has been having strange head and tongue sensations. He says that he gets a pain in the upper right side of his head (towards the top) and little behind his ear. That's the best I can describe it. He says this pain then heats up and while this is happening he says that he feels like a hole opens up in his tongue.  These symptoms last a few seconds and are gone. He also says that he has been getting these for a long time maybe since he was 7 or 8. He can't remember exactly when they started.  He says this only happens once or twice a month sometimes every couple of months. Recently he has been getting headaches he says across his forehead right above his eyebrows. I took him to our pediatrician and she what she called a very extensive neurological exam on him and said that she found nothing abnormal. My fear is a brain tumor but she says that she sees nothing that would suggest that that is the cause and she doesn't see any reason to run out and get a brain scan however she did recommend making an appt with a pediatric neurologist which I did. He won't be seen until Dec. 22. I am still terrified. Can you rule out a brain tumor from just a neuro exam? What if it is in early stages? If big enough to be causing headaches would it affect you neurologically also? Also, would symptoms of a brain tumor come and go. Wouldn't they be constant because the tumor is always there? I am losing sleep and worrying about this so much. It's all that I can think about. I am scared to let my son out of my site for fear that something will happen to him. Please answer. Maybe I just need some reassurance.\n\n",

Early manifestations of a brain tumour in children is usually in the form of behaviuoral changes. Later, the pressure inside the head builds up gradually and the child starts vomiting, especially in the early morning, has blurring of vision, and a severe headache that could awaken the child at night. This headache also characteristically is worsened by coughing or straining, and relieved by vomiting. A brain tumour could also manifest in the form of neurological deficits such as squint or paralysis.  It's a good thing you've taken your child to the doctor. I'm sure she knows what she's doing. The headache you're describing sounds like a migraine, but there are many other causes for a headache.\n\n",

He could not walk, he hallicinated, and still had the attacks very intensely.  The doctor ask to continue his normal activities so we went to Basketball practice.  He could not stay due to the pain being so strong while playing. About 7mths ago a CT scan from something else found an enlarged spleen.  No one was really concerned about this at the time.

He is in the day treatment program for stress related issues.  We are again still trying to see if this could be causing everything.  The doctor is recommending Prozac for depression.  Maybe stress is what is causing some of his pain, but  what I can not understand is when he  is watching TV or playing on the computer he still has the pain.  Thank you for your advice.\n\n",

    "content": "I am reposting this ONLY because I first posted it under the psychiarty topic and my reply from Ilovepatients was to take my son to a psychiarst.... and then she locked my question from any replies.... If she had read this thouroghly, she would have seen that my son IS seeing a psychiatrist..any additional comments wouuld be appreciated. Thanks   Hi my son is 3.5 yrs old... he is 3ft 5 and 48 pounds. He goes to daycare during the day and in the evenings he is with myself or his father or both. He has a 10 yr old sister.  He is a very bright and imaginative child..my opniion and the opinion of his daycare givers. Problem is he is very disruptive at daycare... screaming, yelling, telling teachers no! and purposfully doing things to annoy people.... like singing loudly at nap time when he knows to be quiet. He is very violent as well, he will hit shove or throw things at other students and his sister and me. He has gotten into biting himself when he is angry, and when I see it I try to restrain him from biting himself and tell him he can not hurt himself. I have taken everything from his room until it only had a bed in it and when I asked him how he liked that he replied... yes he liked it. He saw a psychologist for the first time last week, where he was bouncing all over the office , not minding and yelled some.. the dr said he was too young to diagnose, but he was writing down review of adhd... although he is capable of sitting down and doing his classwork, and he enjoys having books read to him... he's got some memorized which he repeated to the psycologist. He told the dr and myself several time in the past and during his appointment that he just wants to be left alone. this was a reason why he smacked a child across the face before, because she looked at him and he just wanted to be left alone.... we are having his blood draw this week to check for any medical problems, and I am to make an appointment with a pediatric neurologist and he is being tested by the early childhood center in August. If anyone has any suggestions on how to help control him, or any ideas why he would be like this please let me know! Thanks...\n\n",

    "content": "Although my son doesn't sound like he was as extreme as your sis, he did do many of the same behaviors. Some worse (trying to hurt his siter who was younger and never showing any remorse for anything). Sad  to say I was a bit frightened of him, I actually thought he could harm me or my daughter as we slept. I took him to a child psychologist who was wonderful. He taught me several parenting \"tricks' or techniques that worked. Very very simply my son was fighting to be in control (there was more to it than that).  I was told that he would have \"cycles\" when his behavior would begin to spiral downward (this has been quite true). The cycles have been emotionally draining  but have become fewer and fewer (I hope this offers some hope) OI tried to always have a good child psychologists number handy (we have moved a few times over the years) he has had to go back a few times and visit the dr  periodically through the years but he is now much better adjusted (he is 12 now).  I guess ultimately I can only say try to find a good doctor whom you like and follow his or her advice. Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear splume, I am not a child psychiatrist, but would like to offer a few suggestions you may find helpful: Know what triggers him: Knowing that your child becomes easily upset under certain circumstances allows you to avoid or work around these situations and be prepared for them. It might be helpful to keep a journal to figure out. Avoid physical punishment: Be cautious of how you express your feelings, because  children are always watching and learning from you. Yelling or hitting an already angered and destructive child seems only to up the anti. If you expect your children to act responsibly and calmly, be sure to do so yourself.  Know your child's temperament: Knowing your child's personality allows you the advantage of foresight. If your child does not do well with unexpected occurrences, try to keep his or her day routine. Use the insight.  Be a role model: Being a role model not only involves controlling your own emotions, but also teaching your children how to express theirs, both good and bad, appropriately. Reward good behaviour: This can work wonders. The key is to inform them of what is first expected, to reward them soon if not immediately after they obey, and to always withhold any and all rewards if they do not obey. The best kind of reward is praise. Children need to know their parents are proud of them.  Always remain calm: No matter how agitated, upset, or aggressive your child becomes, it is much easier for them to relax if you are also calm. Despite your own concern, do not try to rationalize with them until they have calmed down. The more aggravated your child sees you become the more power he has gained over you and the more likely he will be to repeat the behavior.\n\n",

    "title": "Adhd",
    "content": "Hello, my name is Misty and i don't know if this will help you but they told me too that my daughter was to young to diagnose.  At as early as 18 months my daughter was showing signs of adhd.  Not sleeping,  hitting thowing, I know 18 months is young and they are still babies but i had a daycare and have watched many infants and toddlers and none were like her.  She would play in her own feces especially when she was disciplined or in trouble.  She was constanly bouncing off the walls.  As she got older it got to were we rarely left thge house because i also have another child older than her adn it was impossible to keep an eye on her. We would walk right outside the door and she was off, she would get down the block and across tthe street before i could catch her.  I mean talking constantly, very loud, very disruptive, interupting everyone, hitting, throwing things, you name it, then she started with little habits like wanting to bath 10 times a day and biting the skin off her fingers and getting infections, many little obsessive traits.  Still at age 3 doctors were saying shes too young.  Mind you, I have slept in like a year in half,  Several months after her 3rd birthday she was ran over by a truck after darting off and running across the street.  That is when the doctors finally tested her and she has been on the medication since, she will be 6 in april.  It is still hard, the medication doesnt make it all better.  She has been on all kinds of meds and again is getting ready to get her dosage upped.  And she is still not sleeping, shes up until 2-3 am  and never sleeps past 9 am.  The meds don't help a bit with the sleeping, it makes it worse.  If you seriously think this is what your child needs and you are willing to put your child through the constant med changes and sleepless for not only you child but for you too, then keep at the doc, find all the documention online that your child identifies with, and you know everything there is to know about ADHD and the common meds for it then make copies of what you find and go back to your doc with the complete knowledge and show them you know what you are talking about and you fully believe this is what your child had, they will give in and test your child, let them know you know what your in for and have done your homework on it.  I hope this helps out, if not sorry for rambling on.    Good Luck\n\n",

    "content": "I have an almost 4 yr old who is showing some of the very same traits. One that really bothered me was the biting. I watched her very closely but did not stop her from doing it as she was only biting herself. She stopped doing it when I would watch her do it but not stop her all I would do is say you are only hurting yourself. She has not bit herself in several months. It seemed like it was a way that she was trying to get attention when she would get angry or frustrated. I have since then been reinforcing her using words to tell me and my husband what she is feeling and giving her an outlet to express her anger and frustration.  Also how is your childs speech and does he know how to say I'm angry or I want to be alone when he has those feelings. When he acts out like that seperate him from the situation he is in and show him that it won't be tolerated. Also work with the daycare to find out his triggers maybe the things he is doing are not geared towards his intelligence. He may be more advanced than the other kids. Also give him an outlet and a safe place and things to do when he gets angry( ie: punching a pillow or stuffed animal.) I'm not saying don't follow up with a therapist but these ideas are worth a try. I know they helped my daughter.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there.  I have an 18 month old with a cough that has now lasted 3 months.  At first he came down with a cold, and then he started coughing which sounded 'barky'.  We took him to our pedatrican who said his lungs sounded clear, and to come back if it was still happening.  He did not stop so we took him back. At this point, our pedatrican ordered an x-ray and based on his symptoms, (coughing at night, running, etc) pointed to asthma.  Chest x-ray showed infection and she said 'asthma'.  We put him on anitbiotics for 10 days, and Flovent for 4 weeks.  The barking cough stopped even before we put him on the  medication and same with the night cough. Three weeks ago we went back and she said to take him off the Flovent, and we  would try Zantex, as maybe he has reflux.  It has not worked at all.  He sounds like something is irritating his throat, and is not productive.  It does not happen at night, and is not barky.  He will cough for 1-2 seconds when he begins walking and running, (not all the time though),but can conitnue to do these for hours and not cough.  He will alwaysl cough when he first starts to laugh.  After that, he can laugh forever without coughing.  I am to take him back next week if it isn't resolved with the Zantex, which I am doubtful will begin working after 3 weeks.  My question is, what could this possibly be?  It really sounds quite harmless, and doesn't interfer with playing, running for hours or anything, (doesn't always stop to cough, he just keeps going most of the time)  He does not have any signs of allergies, and is very tall for his age.  He was 1 month  premature and had wet lung for a total of 10 days in the hospital, came home and had no other problems.  Two ear infections and two colds since he has been born.  He eats very well, although has only gained about 1-1 1/2 pounds in 6  months, (we have not had him weighed in a month now though).  I am concerned as this has lasted so very long, and truly appreciate any advice  you may have.  Thank you,  Rhyanna  --------------------\n\n",

There is a cough known as ' habitual cough' that could be the cause of your child's cough, especially that it now disappears on sleeping, which is very characteristic of a 'habitual cough'. It commonly continues after the resolution of a pathologically-based cough. My advice would be to just observe for any change in character or worsening of cough, or the appearnce of any associated symptoms. Otherwise, don't think about it.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there.  Thank you for your advice. I took my son into the pedatrican's office yesterday, they do not think that it is a habit cough.  She sent him for another x-ray.  He had one in October and it came back with infection and 'asthma'.  She said this should be cleared up now.  Also, she said she does not think it is serious, but he shouldn't be coughing anymore.  On the x-ray form it said; atelertsis vs infiltration what does this mean?  What are other reasons for a cough like this?  He doesn't have a runny nose, etc., he does not get short of breath, etc. and Flovent didn't do a thing?  He is 26 pounds and 6 oz, and 33.5 inches.  He is very very active and happy and eats well.  Could he have a serious lung problem?  What about CF? Thank you for any info Rhyanna\n\n",

I don't believe this is serious, since he is improving, and is in a good general condition. In some situations a cough may take a while to clear up, so let's just wait for some time. If, however, it exacerbates or becomes disabling or distressing, seek immediate medical advice.\n\n",

    "content": "Can someone please help me. My five year old son has been very lethargic for the past couple of months...he is very pale and very fatigued. He has been seen by his Peadiatrician who only ran an EKG and a Chest Xray..no other tests were done. I took him back to school only to have him cry and cry and not wanting to stay. I spoke with his teacher who is very concerned that Bailey is not well at all....she said he is headachey, very pale at times and cannot concentrate. I took him straight back to the medical centre and demanded a full blood count and any other test they could perform on him just to rule things out. The doctor we saw asked to check Bailey's urine and it came back showing leukocytes....yet he has no symptom of an infection, no fever, no soreness when urinating, he is physically ok apart from the paleness (which the peadiatrician did note) and the fatigue. We are awaiting his urine results and he gets his bloods done tomorrow morning. Should'nt Bailey have symptoms such as fever or pain if it is a bladder infection? Thanks in advance....Bailey's mum.\n\n",

If there does not seem to be an answer to Bailey's problems in the labs already done, I would ask the doctor what other tests could be ordered to help in  making a diagnosis. If he/she does not have an acceptable answer (acceptable to you), perhaps another doctor could be recommended for a second opinion.  Be certain that you have communicated with your pediatrician that you are seriously concerned about the changes in Bailey's behavior and his physical appearance. Working together you should be able to find the source of the problem.  [/b]A parent usually knows when their child is ill and needs the aid of medical professionals. If you are not comfortable with the first doctor's opinion, it is always acceptable to seek the opinion of a second doctor.\n\n",

His bloods are'nt being done until tomorrow morning, (Friday) so we probably wo'nt get those results back until next week. He is at home with me and goes back to school on Monday. When I ask Bailey why he does'nt want to go to school, he keeps saying its because he's too tired, yet he sleeps all night. This is a child who 6 to 8 weeks ago jumped out of the car to go to school without any problems..loved school, and his teacher. He is having his CBC, thyroid, liver and kidney,  iron and mono and a couple of other things tested tomorrow morning. Will update as soon as we know something...thanks\n\n",

All the nurse would tell me is that his bloods were abnormal but only minimally indicating to them Bailey has an infection going on somewhere in his body. They also said the thyroid result is a little low. Yet Bailey's only symptoms are paleness and fatigue. They are not going to repeat his urine test, they want to wait for four weeks, see if the antibiotic gets rid of the infection and retest his bloods again. Not sure what else we can do but wait. What are your thoughts on this diagnosis? He is back at school today, is on the antibiotic...hopefully things will be ok. Thanks for your help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello again. I hate when samples are \"lost\" before they make it to the lab.   Cannot tell you how many times in 25 years I had to collect samples a second time due to this. Anyway, Bailey is back in school and I will be anxious to know how he is feeling in about 72 hours. In that time period one should be able to see changes in his demeanor if the antibiotic is doing the trick.    As a mother, I would ask for copies of Bailey's lab tests. I would also ask that the doctor sit down with me and explain the abnormals in his CBC, Chem Panel and whatever else they ran. As for the thyroid panel, I would definately want more information on those numbers and thoughts from your doctor on why they are abnormal and what they plan to do to follow-up on this.   I do not know what is meant by his thyroid \"is a little low\". Dependent on what number they are talking about or if it was even a number that was being referred to. Did they mean that his TSH ( Thyroid Stimulating Hormone) was low, or did they mean that his results showed that his thyroid is trying  harder and the TSH was actually high? A hormone 'deficiency' or a HIGH TSH generally will leave a patient tired, cranky, etc. I have suffered from this and am on medication. On the other hand a LOW TSH will tell you that the thyroid gland is overactive. This is generally characterized by hyper activity, loss of weight, etc. So they are direct opposites.  Hopefully you have a good enough repoir or relationship with your pediatrician that he/she will sit down and explain these things to you. If not, then an RN should sit and answer your questions. I am not familiar with your laws, but in the USA you would be entitled to copies of all of these lab reports. Let me know how Bailey, and YOU are doing in another couple days.  Take Care.\n\n",

She eats well, but she will just not go. She dances around and holds in in as best as she can but she ends up letting out about 3 tablespoons worth of soft poop about 2 to 3 times an hour. The poop smells absolutely horrible because it's been inside of her for so long. Her little bottom also gets so sore because we have to wipe her so many times during the day. Nothing we have tried has worked.  I think she is just to scared to poop. Needless to say, her mother and I, as well as her, are just so frustrated. Any suggestions?[/b]\n\n",

    "content": "Bambino, Many medications over the years have been given rectally/ by suppository. This is done for a variety of reasons from prevention of a person throwing up said medication to the fact that many medications work faster when given in this fashion. As a nurse of 25 years, I assure you that I have given suppositories to the very young all the way to the very old. Very few patients ever preferred to insert them themselves. Like you, they would not easily be talked into it. Is it strange or perverse for a parent to administer this type of medication to a child of 10 , I would say definately not. If the child is ill and it is a medication being given, do not hesitate to give the medication to your child.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Peters, High dose oral L-arginine has been shown to induce release of growth hormone and a hormone called prolactin, but no studies have been conducted to see whether this could have any meaningful anabolic effect. Body distortion occurs when high levels of HGH in the blood, whether exogenous or endogenous, act on bone where the growth plate has already closed.  It is important to keep in mind also, that growth hormone is not effective at increasing final adult height if you have no hormonal abnormalities. You may want to have an X-ray done on your left hand and wrist, to see what chances you have at growing taller.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Peters,  You would still have a chance of growing, only if the growth plates in your bones haven't closed yet. As for the L-arginine dose, this is usually the average recommended dose. Again, I would like to remind you, that no studies have been done that have proven any growth-inducing effect of L-arginine administration. It may only increase the HGH level in the blood, but that doesn't necessarily mean it has to produce an effect on the bones. If you decide you wish to try it, make sure you have no contraindications to taking it, and beware of the signs of drug side effects.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Peters!  Im wriiting to you cos i believe u can def. grow taller!!! i can promise u will!!!! by atleat 2 inches!!!  Why i say this because without wanting to grow taller at 23! i started lifting weights and i only weigh 71kg and im 171cm tall!! ( i never knew u could grow taller)  Here's my story... i love pushing weights! and i decided to gym and get myself some extra pump to look really good! So i spoke to the guy at the drug store in the Gym supplement section, and he recommended NO (i hear u guys in the states call it this, Nitrox by me) Arginine Alpha Keto-glutarate Tablets with Di-calcium phosphate, i think the DCP is just a binding agent! to make it into a chalk like pill!!   So i took this stuff like the box says... '3.5 grams, 3 times a day, half hour before meals on an empty stomach or before a workout' i didnt even take this when i went to sleep!  GET THIS BRO!!!... i noticed im looking my gym buddies in the eyes almost... and they telling me \"dude uv grown taller\" 3 cm in one month! if thats not CRAZY then i don't know!!! ive been trying to spread my msg to everyone! thats when i hit the net and searched for \"growing taller with Arginine\" on google and came across ur Q.  I did hit the gym 5 times a week! ate lots of chicken. lots of Basmati rice! i really ate alot!!! (lots of protein and spinach) stayed away from sugars! took HMB (beta hodroxy and Beta methylbutyrate!!!!) with the Arginine! which u take with your meals!!! i never did streching exercises and i never took this stuff before bed time like all these websites say u must!!!!!  So at your age im sure ull grow atleast 3.0inches with arginine! but remember to eat well, drink lots of water and most of all.... EXCERCISE!!!! cos thats what makes this stuff work!!!!  Get an amino stack and HMB that u can take with Arginine! ive currently started this cycle again (these things can get expensive) and in a week im up by 2mm! not much but my goal is 180cm! it takes time! ( apparently males growth plates close on avrg. 25 years! so i aint got much time left!!  this is no bullsh*t cos ive really taken the time out to write u this! I hope u find it usefull! actually i know u will!!  Go to the gym, be active, enjoy life, don't drink alcohol, don't smoke! ur amino acids wont work, be serious about it!  Be positive and enjoy the experience! most of all be HAPPY and start smiling cos it will work!!! it worked for me and i hadnt grown for years.. i never knew u could.   Keep well  Rudi van Blerk (South Africa)\n\n",

The presence of red spots and its appearance since birth leads me to think it is a 'hemangioma', which is a benign but abnormal growth of blood vessels.  If it turns out to be so, there is no need to worry at all, as some may disappear spontaneously, and if persistent, can be either injected with a material to collapse these vessels or can be surgically removed.\n\n",

    "content": "Diabetes is often precipitated by any acute stressful condition, such as an appendicular abscess as in your son's condition. Also, diabetes may have appeared first but was undiagnosed causing a suppression in your child's immunity and thus allowing the abscess to form.  Type 1 or juvenile-onset diabetes is known to occur without a positive family history, although certain gene factors do play a role. As for the nausea, it is common if blood sugar is not properly controlled, in addition to, in your son's case, the prolonged oral antibiotic medications irritating his stomach. Now, you must understand that a viscious circle has been created here. Uncontrolled blood sugar will predispose to infection, and uncontrolled infection will worsen blood sugar control and so on. The low WBC count is probably due to prolonged antibiotic use, as diabetes would impair the function of WBCs but would not decrease their number. I suggest tight control of blood sugar, and if the fever does not exceed 38.5, to control it with antipyretics only. A normal ESR is usually against the presence of a serious bacterial infection requiring antibiotics. I also believe new cultures need to be drawn from blood, urine and stools.  Also, the possibility of a fungal infection has not been excluded as I see from the lab studies done. Discuss these points with your doctor and please keep us informed with the updates.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I am very concerned about my 5 year old daughter. A while back she developed an urgent need to urinate but when she would get to the bathroom she would just sit there. Sometimes she would go, other times nothing, or just a drible. I had her to a doctor who did a urine test. He said it was inconclusive but treated her for a tract infection anyway. Things did not improve so I had her to another doctor. Another urine test revealed no infection. He checked her over and deemed her healthy. He said she seemed to have a nervous bladder and explained that in situations that cause anxiety she would feel the need to urinate. Alot of the symptoms subsided and she can play all day long without this problem. However, as soon as we try to get her on the schoolbus she freaks out and needs to pee. Even if she's the bus aproaching this happens. it's the same after school on the way home, and to a lesser extent when she gets in any vehicle. I believe she is thinking about it obsessivley and the thought of being trapped in a vehicle with no bathroom is aggravating the issue. Please, I desparatley need advice. She's missing school and this is becoming a very difficult issue to work around.  Thank you in advance. Regards,  Jason\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Jason, If it's become an obsesive thought and she has started missing school, then you may need more than just advice, you may need professional help with her. A child psychiatrist would help her through  by deconditioning and behavioural changes. However, if that is not immediately possible, you may try the following: First of all, do not be angry with her or tell her off when she freaks out. Accept this behaviour as normal for children her age. You can even tell her that, and tell her that she'll eventually grow out of it, as most of us have. Try first taking her on short trips in a car or bus, then gradually lengthen the trip. The more she sees herself not needing to rush to the toilet, the more self confidence she'll gain. Try also positive re-inforcement when she doesn't freak out. Buy her a chocolate or take her to the park, whatever she likes doing.\n\n",

Now, there are several causes for headaches, most of which can be excluded by simple clinical examination and tests, before requesting an MRI. These include measuring blood pressure, examination of visual acuity, and examination for sinusitis and ear problems. Headaches are considered serious when it awakens the child while asleep, is accompanied by early morning vomiting and blurring of vision. It is also markedly worsened by straining such as during coughing. These symptoms warrant the need for an MRI. However, if an MRI has already been ordered, then well and good. It is definitely safe for children of all ages, and would exclude the possibility of any serious underlying cause.\n\n",

    "title": "double vision and throat clearing",
    "content": "Hello,  My 7 year old son developed double vision (one eye and only when looking to the right).  It was detected at an eye exam, and wasn't there the previous year.  He is off to have a full pediatric work up in about a month.  I also noticed he tends to cough once or clear his throat after swallowing food.  It seems to be worse in the evenings and is not due to trying to swallow large amounts of food. I noticed it a few months ago, but did not mention it to the eye doctor.  I will be sure to mention at the next appointment. Could these conditions be related? Are there any disorders related to weakness of the eye and throat muscles?   Also does anyone know what kind of tests they would be doing to find the underlying cause of double vision?  Thanks for any insight!\n\n",

    "content": "Well, they could be related. If we try to relate these symptoms, then several neurological conditions which affect the centres of the nerves supplying the muscles of the eyes and those of swallowing could be the cause. In that case, your child may need a full neurological evaluation, but I would prefer to wait and see what the results of the ophthamology tests are. Tests to be done, would try to locate where the problem lies, whether it's in the muscle responsible for eye movement, whether it's in the nerves supplying these muscles or whether the problem lies within the eye itself or vision causing the eye to deviate.\n\n",

    "title": "one yr old boy, chronic pneumonia",
    "content": "My son will be one yr old on Tuesday. In two months he has had pneumonia three times. Once requiring two antibitoics. He has had numerous double ear infection and been found to have fluid behind his ear drums likely requiring tubes. He has had abdominal problems since birth, and bowel problems as well. He was diagnosed with bronchiolitis at 2 months of age and intermittedly wheezes and coughs even when not sick. He was admitted to hospital for losing over 2 1/2 pounds in 3 weeks and dehydration. He has neurofibromatosis type 1, clear mri. Is his chronic abdominal, bowel and respiratory problems just spontaneous, a result of his neurofibromatosis or is it related to something else? I am afraid for him as the bouts of pneumonia seem to get worse everytime. I am scared that one of these days it is going to get so bad he will not make it. Please help!!!\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for your reply. Reflux was ruled out a few months ago as his abdominal symptoms do not fit the bill for it.   The paediatrician is talking about testing for cystic fibrosis and asthma. However, there is no known family history of cf and limited of asthma. I have asthma due to environmental factors and one of my cousins had asthma as a child which he outgrew. Could one of those be the immune defiencies you talked about?  Could asthma or cf have anything to do with a build up of fluid in his ears causing chronic ear infections that requires tubes or sleep apnea which may require his adnoids out? Sorry for all the questions, it has been a long year of dr and hospital visits and I am anxious to get to the cause of my sons problems so it can be treated and he does not have to be sick anymore. He has been on antibiotics for over 20 days straight, is this safe for a baby his age?  Thanks again, Angel\n\n",

An abnormality of the mucociliary system as 'Primary ciliary dyskinesia' should also be ruled out. As for the antibiotics, it depends on the nature of those antibiotics he's taking, some can be taken safely for up to 4-6 weeks.\n\n",

This is probably a muscle pain, since it usually improves or disappears with movement. The tingling and numbness may result from low calcium levels, so you may wish to check your serum calcium level. The headache, fatigue and insomnia could be the result of stress, which could also be the explanation for all of your symptoms.\n\n",

If you are uncomfortable with amale doctor, you can request a female, but remember, this is what the doctor does, this is his job, he sees naked woman all the time, and he is used to it.  As for the exam, you will lie back on an exam table, with your feet in stirrups. The doctor will insert a spectulum into the vagina. This kind of looks like a curling iron and it is to open the vagina so they can see into it to locate the cervix.This is not painful.  The doctor will take a swab of your cervix, this is called a pap smear. It is to test for cervical abnormalities. It will pinch a little bit, but it is over in a second. Then the doctor will insert a finger into your vagina, and place a hand on your stomache. This is to feel the ovaries to see if there are any cysts.This should not be painful. The doctor may also take aditional swabs of the vagina to test for STDs if you request it.  The doctor may also perform a breast exam to feel for any lumps. This is not painful. The whole exam does not take very long at all, and although uncomfortable, it is a nessessary part of being a healthy woman.\n\n",

    "title": "Need Advice, Mobilty Problems with 13 year old",
    "content": "Hi,       I posted a problem with my daugher who was then aged 12 back in May, who had chronic pain in her legs and was finding it difficult to walk.  I received a response from the Dr and we started on the road of trying to get help for her.                Since May she has simply got worse. She was seen by a Pedatric doctor who was baffled and thought it would get better.  He organised physio therapy sessions which she has been having twice weekly since June.  Although walking slightly better it is still painfully slow and she is still in the same pain.  The Physio has stated that she really doesnt think that she is helping our daughter despite the tiny improvement in some muscle tone.   We saw the same doctor again  in September who told us that he thought our daughter could have M.E. but admitted that he didnt know much about that so has referred her on to a Consultant who has a special interest in children with M.E              However, since then our daughter has developed Scoliosis of the spine with a hump to the left hand side of the spine.  Her right hip also seems to be a tad higher than the left.  She was  assessed by the Physio team as scoring 9/9 on the Beighton scale for Hypermobility  and she suspects that most of our daughters joints are hypermobile including her hips which sublaxed the other week putting us all into panic.  her physio team couldnt believe that our daughter has not had an xray or MRI scan on her body or that they have not noticed how hypermobile she is.    Her symptoms are these: Cracking and popping of all joints  Walking difficulties, painful to walk Hypermobility, she can twist her arm backwards for instance. Very painful thigh muscle hypertonia? Stairs are impossible for her to do as are certain exercises.  Sleep disorders, day and night, sometimes she cant sleep other times she can sleep for 24 hours straight Stomach pains/worse with her mentrual cycle Soft velvety stretchy skin Large stretch marks despite being very slender Long thin spidery fingers and feet/toes A family history of double jointedness. Mostly without pain however there are two, including her older half brother who has a history of problems with his hips and scaring.   I am at my wits end as she seems to be getting worse not better and no one seems to know what is wrong with our daugther.  My instinct says she doesnt seem to show the symptoms of M.E but would ME cause all these symtoms?   I would be grateful for any advice what so ever, how small it may be.    Thanking you in advance\n\n",

    "content": "The diagnosis of ME or myalgic encephalopathy is very difficult to make. There has been several trials at setting diagnostic criteria, but have not been universally accepted.  The most accepted definition is that it is a clinically evaluated, unexplained persistent or relapsing chronic fatigue that is of new or definite onset (i.e., not lifelong), is not the result of ongoing exertion, is not substantially alleviated by rest, and results in substantial reduction in previous levels of occupational, educational, social, or personal activities. This together with the concurrent occurrence of four or more of the following symptoms: substantial impairment in short-term memory or concentration; sore throat; tender lymph nodes; muscle pain; multi-joint pain without swelling or redness; headaches of a new type, pattern, or severity; unrefreshing sleep; and post-exertional malaise lasting more than 24 hours. These symptoms must have persisted or recurred during 6 or more consecutive months of illness and must not have predated the fatigue. Inspite of there being no diagnostic test, there are a number of lab studies which may be helpful in the diagnosis and include: hemoglobin, WBC count, ESR or CRP, liver function tests, thyroid function tests, kidney function tests, electrolytes, creatine kinase, urine tests for sugar/protein and, in some cases, investigations should also include checking female hormone levels (serum oestradiol) and adrenal gland function. If these studies have not been performed, please ask for them. Other studies, such as a CT or MRI should be ordered upon suspicion of another underlying cause. Again, if you are not satisfied with your physician's diagnosis or decisions, you can always seek care elsewhere. I hope you find this information helpful.\n\n",

    "content": "Penises that appear abnormally small, but on palpation appear to have normal shaft w/normal stretched length are most of the time diagnosed w/: 1. buried penis, 2. webbed penis, 3. trapped penis or 4. micropenis All of these **most of the time** caused at circumcision.   Penis size varies w/ethnic background, at times, that also could be a factor & something that you should think about. Now, I'm getting into adult conversation here, these are ADULT figures, but here is some information according to Andro Medical the following sizes are averages found from country to country:  France \u2013 average erect size equals 16cm, or 6.3 inches Italy, Russia \u2013 average erect size equals 15cm Mexico \u2013 14.9cm Germany \u2013 14.4cm Spain \u2013 13.6cm Japan \u2013 13cm  United States \u2013 12.9cm, or 5.1 inches when erect Saudi Arabia \u2013 12.4cm India \u2013 10.1cm Korea \u2013 9.6cm  Ethnic Origin plays a greater role in penis size than geographic locale. It\u2019s been said that Black men are generally better endowed than Caucasian men. Some facts bear this out w/ the average black man having a penis size almost 1 centimeter in length greater than an average Caucasian man. Generally, Asian men or North American Indians are less in length than black or white men.   I would suggest talking to the pediatrician about your concerns & maybe seeing a urologist. If you would like more information on the conditions I listed above, please let me know. I hope this winded reply was of some help.   Best of Luck\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for your response. In checking out micro penis on the internet they talk about hormone treatments. I'm just concerned, hoping his hormone levels are what they should be.  His testicles do seem very small. He was not circumcised.  I feel weird about this, but I measured him while he was sleeping and here is what I came up with. 3cm long and 1.3 cm wide.  Would you consider this a micropenis?  At this age he sure acts like a boy.  He likes to play rough and loves trucks and tractors. Can hormone levels be checked at this age?\n\n",

There is no cure for micropenis but hormone therapy is sometimes suggested to stimulate penile growth. I would suggest speaking to your son's pediatrician. Seeing your son would be easier to come up w/a plan for him better.   By the way, there is nothing strange about your concern or questions!!

He has had a loose stool for about two weeks - not sure if this has coincided exactly with the  nails.  I think we noticed the nails before the loose stool. Thanks  The only thing that I can think that would cause blue toenails is cyanosis, but you didnt list any of the other symptoms that might go w/ that.   Cyanosis is caused by a lack of oxygen in the blood. It can be  associated w/cold temperatures, heart failure, lung diseases, being smothered, & is seen in infants at birth as a result of heart defects, respiratory distress syndrome, or lung & breathing problems.  The blue discoloration is seen mostly in the beds of the fingernails,toenails, the lips & tongue.  Low blood oxygen may be caused by poor blood circulation, or heart or breathing problems. It can also be caused by being in a low-oxygen environment or by carbon monoxide poisoning. Cyanosis also may be caused by poisoning from chemicals, drugs, or contaminated food & water.  I do not think that the loose stool is associated w/the toenails in any way. Anytime there is a skin/nail discoloration, all the above that I stated (things to do with breathing & circulation) are normally the 1st thought.   I would get another opinion or ask your GP to run some standard labwork   Best of luck\n\n",

She has been going to the bathroom every day a couple of times a day and her stool is normal then goes back to being round hard balls.  I am very concerned because last night she was complaining again and her aunt tickled her in her belly and she started to cry because it hurt to the touch.  Today it hurts again and seems to be more frequent in the morning, afternoon and at night.  I don't know what I should do, we have eliminated alot of the milk she was drinking, still allowed one glass but that is it.  I am concerned that this might be more than just \"constipation\".

In the first case, you could try some over-the-counter sold soothing gels. In the second case, try more frequent eructation, lay her on her side after feeds and try giving her some herbal tea before bedtime.

The spots were scattered all over entire legs, anywhere from small to quarter size.  I'm suspicioning food allergy(tomato) for the red spots, but not sure how the purple color fits in, if it's that. Looks like something under the skin, as opposed to a rash. Noticed last night while she was just standing, have also noticed several times before, and also after her showers occasionally. Somewhat itchy last night, but the purple color went away, when I had her lay down. No itchiness today, and a small outbreak on back of thigh. Greatful for any help, or what type of Dr. to start with? THanks.\n\n",

This is quite normal considering the effect of gravity on our veins causing pooling and stagnation of blood in the legs.  Individuals with weak walls of their veins (also normal) are quite prone to the effect of gravity on the venous system. The marked congestion could also cause itching.

    "content": "Lots of children go through picky stages & stages where they don't like anything altogether. If it is a continual problem, he is getting at an unhealthy weight, weak, etc, or he is taking control of the situation, making it impossible for him to eat anything healthy, some intervention should come in.   If your son is not taking vitamins, I would suggest going to the pediatrician & discussing a daily supplement w/ him/her. The essential vitamins & minerals that a daily vitamin provide will help make up for some of what he might be lacking.  I do not know what foods it is that your son eats as you did not include this in your question so I cannot comment on that, or your stepmother's opinion on them. All I can say, without knowing what it is that he is eating is everyone in the world has different opinions on what is right/wrong, how to live, what to do, etc. Sometimes people's advice is the best thing that could ever happen for us & other times you need to just take what people say w/a grain of salt. A simple way of getting out of the conversation would be to say \"I have discussed w/his pediatrician his eating habits & everything seems to be ok!! Thank you though, maybe you might have a few new reciepes for us to try to add some variety to what he already likes??   If you would like to write back w/the types of foods your son does eat & enjoy, we can discuss that.   Best of Luck\n\n",

They seem to be progressing...she's got exaggerated reflexes, ankle clonus (3-4 beats in one of them, 1-2 in the other), mild weakness in her arms, legs, and hips, tight hamstrings, starting to walk more on her tippytoes but not all the time, and her gait has become  flat & stomping and sometimes absolutely off (can't even describe it). She has a movement disorder consisting of tics, intention tremors, and myoclonic jerks, and her feet are turning in somewhat and she is tripping on them. She also has sensory integrating problems, and is small for her age due to lack of appetite. Her brain MRI is fine and we are being referred for a spine MRI also. They cannot tell us yet what this is, and as of now, have us coming for checkups every 6 months...but I would like them to rule out neuroblastoma. Can neuroblastoma present without any felt masses, and also I have read of the jerking eye and limb thing (can't remember the name of it)...is it possible to have the limb jerks without the eye movement? We do have a nephew with neurofibromatosis 1...is there any connection with neuroblastoma? Any other thing we should be pushing for? Thank you!\n\n",

Any single or mixed variety of immune responses may occur after exposure to low molecular mass (1,000 daltons) inorganic or organic medicinal chemicals. The immunogenic potential of such drugs is often determined by one or more reactive end products or metabolites which haptenate with various body proteins. Often, the parent compound itself is not immunogenic because it lacks the ability to conjugate with proteins in a stable covalent linkage. Metabolism of drugs by cytochrome oxidase pathways may occur in the liver, skin, and phagocytic cells. In addition, patients with certain genetic polymorphisms are at higher risk for allergic and autoimmune disorders induced by drugs.\"   Sorry, but I don't know enough immulology and biochemistry to help much further.  Basicly,Glycerine by itself occurs normally in the body and is too small alone to upset the immune system; perhaps it combines in some circumstances with something else and the two cause an allergy. I sugest you learn all about glycerine by reading http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycerin\n\n",

In different states they test newborns for different characteristics, mostly genetic, that often have something to do with enzymes and ability to digest various substances.  That would be a list of conditions already ruled out, and there might be more of these mostly rare conditions that could be tested for.  Sometimes they do not show themselves as problems in early infancy.  Do you also have a list of things they tested for in the scratch testing? Also question relatives about whether any blood relatives ever had digestive problems as infants or children, both your family and husbands'.  Ask lots of questions of doctor and take notes, and if you forget to ask something, ask the doctors nurse afterwards, or call and see if at his leisure he can have someone get back to you with an answer. I don't have time today to look more into protein induced enterocolitis syndrome, and I might soon get deployed to the Gulf area in Red Cross relief work.\n\n",

I am very concerned that she has something serious and that not addressing it will make it worse.  Her appetite is very poor and limited.  She never asks for food and when she does she is very finicky about what she eats.  She refuses to eat any type of protein and her intake of vegetables is poor.  She takes iron supplements and she compensates her diet with a great deal of dairy products.  She has been seen by several doctors and they all reasure me that she is healthy but will remain petite.  I am concerned with this diagnosis as no diagnostic tests were ever performed to make that assumption.  To me she appears pale and is often sick but this doesn't seem to concern her pediatrician.  Are there any tests that I could suggest that her doctor perform to rule out anything serious?  Much appreciated, Laura\n\n",

If she was naturally short and lean, she would maintain the same percentiles. Kindly discuss this with her doctor.

He is 6, has poor appetite, he weighs 32 pounds and is about 40 inches tall. His bones are so frail that his limbs look like sticks. The difference with Laura is that he has always been barely in the 3rd percentile of the growth chart. His weight at birth was 4 pounds and 10 ounces. I am very worried about the situation and always have. More recently, I have seen an endocrinologist at the Montreal Children's Hospital and they tested the production of growth hormone by his pituitary gland and everything seems normal.  What is wrong with my son's growth ?  Thanks Bio\n\n",

If pain persists beyond that period, you should consult your doctor. Also, the dose is preferably calculated according to body weight. Symptoms of overdose include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, sweating, seizures, confusion, an irregular heartbeat, and jaundice from liver toxicity.  If none of these symptoms or signs have appeared, then thankfully there is no need to worry, but please try to be more careful next time.\n\n",

    "content": "My 3 year old started with a rash about 2 weeks ago.At first they looked like small masquito bites.I took him in and was told it was either A tipical chicken pox or hives.I kept him in and stuck with oatmeal baths and benadryl.This seemed to work until yesterday.He started to tell me his pee pee hurt.(thats what he calls it).I went to look and noticed he was swollen and in a lot of pain.At the same time his hives are now circular (some of them) and Very inflamed.I took him straight to the DR. and was sent for a ultrasound .(to make sure his testicles weren't twisted).We found that it is soft tissue swelling and his testicles were pushed back into the canal.He was put on an antibiotic called...cefzil.He wears a pull up at night except last night.(he sleeps to hard to wake up to use the bathroom)Normally in the morning he is soaked.Last night he didn't even have an accident .And isnt peeing alot like normal. My question is is this dangerous?And how long can his testicles be in the canal (safely)?Could this be linked together?(He is still swollen and bruised) His hives seem to be unfased by the benedryl,and after 2 weeks have become much more intens. Oh and has only had a low grade fever from time to time.He has not had a consistant fever. Thank you for any insite (he thanks you too)\n\n",

I was shocked at his reply then he told me he would just send him to a specialist.Needless to say we have now (as of yesterday )been to a ped. urologist.He thinks the hives and the swelling are related.He said the hives spread to his scrotum which (like hives do) caused the swelling there.He also said this is a virus which last up to 4 weeks.It aparently looks like a lot of masquito bites for the first two weeks and flares up during the second week. As of to day the rash (hives) are on the tops of his fett causing them to swell.He cant even bend his ankles because of the swelling.His scotum swelled up again last night.When the rash flares up around his eyes, he looks like he has a black eye.When the rash popped up around his mouth his lips swelled up. At this piont I am being told to keep him on Motrin (for swelling and pain) and Benedryl for the itching. Is there a way to see if there is a name for this virus?My Dr. is pretty stumped and is not sure of the incubation period or really anything else.Should he be on an antiinflamitory?

I don't see it as serious, and cough can be one of the most resistant symptoms to treat, sometimes taking up to a month to disappear. You can try giving him plenty of warm drinks, avoid cough expectorant drugs as this would make his cough more irritant, and ask your doctor if he can prescribe a cough sedative drug to be taken at bedtime.\n\n",

    "content": "Is it possible for Hepatits C to be passed to a baby from an infected father?  I'm asking because my ex-husband was diagnosed with Hep C.  I was tested and was cleared but I often wonder about my daughter who has always experienced some unexplained and constant illnesses all of her life (chronic constipation, vaginal discharge, back pain, anal fissures, chest pains, hemangiomas on her tummy etc).  Five years have past since he was diagnosed and I just thought about the Hep C and my daughter possibly having it just recently.  She is 12 years old now.  I guess the smart thing to do would be just to get her tested and put my mind at ease but we currently have no family doctor and am on a waiting list.  Any input would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

The possible inch or so that they claim you will gain is not worth the health risks included.   You can speak to your doctor about growth hormones but in the meantime, there are some little things that you can do that though they might sound silly, actually DO help in growth or feeling taller at least.  1.Improper posture puts the spine out of alignment, strains the muscles & ligaments of the back, & leads to a loss of height. Stand tall!!!  2. Yoga & Pilates, Inversion, ankle weights, kicking & hanging - these techniques will help you with height & make you physically stronger  3. Knowing about the importance of proper nutrition, as it leads to proper hormonal balance. Find out the nutritional amounts that you should consume w/each meal so that your body will respond positively.   Best of Luck\n\n",

There are no limits to the hours of workout, just don't violate the \" 10% rule\", where you shouldn't increase the intensity or duration of workouts more than 10% per week. It's also best to avoid heavy weightlifting at this stage! Always stick to a healthy balanced diet, with 3 main meals a day, together with 2-3 snacks in between. Try to use fats, oils and sweets sparingly. Include 6-11 servings of bread, cereals ,rice and pasta, 2-4 servings of fruit, 3-5 servings of vegetables, 2-3 servings of meat, poultry, fish, beans, eggs and nuts, and finally, 2-3 servings of milk & dairy products in your daily diet.\n\n",

Ok, let me start with this, not to confuse you more, but this is the actual dosing according to Amoxicillin guidelines. Then I will explain:  Infants 3 months of age and older and children weighing up to 40 kg (88 lbs.)\u2014Dose is based on body weight and must be determined by your doctor. The usual dose is 6.7 to 13.3 mg per kg (3 to 6 mg per pound) of body weight every eight hours or 12.5 to 22.5 mg per kg (5.7 to 10.2 mg per pound) of body weight every twelve hours.   Medicine is all math so lets start with 1st off: 5ml = 1 teaspoon so your calculation of 2 1/4 teaspoon is off.   every kg = 2.4lbs . So, if doing the math, the dose is correct.  Best of luck\n\n",

    "content": "Just wanted to add that children can present with red/pink ear drums while crying and may not necessarily indicate an ear infection.  Doctors would like to know if the child was tugging or pressing the ears to give an idea of localization of ear pain.  We also have to rely on a detailed history as well as a physical exam. Additionally, Amoxicillin is recommended at a twice a day or three times a day dose.  With your son's weight,  the highest dose i'd give, in this situation,  according to my calculations is 250mg twice a day....so if i use 125mg/5ml  that would be 2 teaspoons (10ml). The alternative is Amoxicillin (250/5ml) which would be one teaspoon twice a day. Also, most colds with runny noses are viral infections which resolve spontanously after a few days.  (no fever).   We all must be careful of the over-consumption of antibiotics.\n\n",

As I always say, they are evidence of a good response of the body's immune system. Now, their persistence for 2 months probably warrants some lab studies to prove infection, and may be try to figure out what organism could be causing this. Your doctor may also prescribe an antibiotic accordingly.\n\n",

    "content": "Patient: 2 years old male  At born: weight \u2013 3,6 kg, length \u2013 51 cm  At present: weight \u2013 16 kg, height \u2013 93 cm  The delivery was difficult \u2013 childbirth trauma with break of clavicle. At maternity home Luminal treatment during 5 days was performed.   At 15th day patient was consulted by neurologist. The following treatment schema was suggested: 1.\tSermion \u2013 \u00bc of 5 ml (during 45 days); 2.\tActovegin and vitamin B1 injections \u2013 0,5 ml (1st day) 3.\tStatus Ophthalmicus and vitamin B6 injections \u2013 0,5 ml (2nd day) 4.\tProserin \u2013 0,2 mg twice per day (3rd day) 5.\tMassage and electrophoresis (Eofilin, Nicotin Acid and Proserin)  After this schema patient was treated by Dibazol and Cavinton (1/4) during one month. At 2nd month the rupture surgical operation was done.  The development was normal. Teething started at 9th month. The first steps were done at 14th month.   At 19th month patient was treated by Encephabol and Noophen (during 1 month) \u2013 the cause was nervousness and fidgety behavior.   At 20th month patient was consulted by neurologist and the treatment by Cogitum and Glicine (during 2 months) was suggested. Furthermore, the injections of Cerebrolisine (10 injections), Status Ophthalmicus (10 injections) and Actovegin (10 injections) were done.   After this the genetic analysis was done:   Phenylalanine in plasma (21.07.2005) \u2013 19 mg/l (normal) Evaluation: below 30 mg/l \u2013 normal \t       40-100 mg/l \u2013 control specimen necessary \t        above 100 mg/l \u2013 clearly elevated Serum analysis (22.07.2005): Amino acid proline \u2013 41,2 mg/l (increased) Evaluation: normal range \u2013 11-35 mg/l   Child recognizes relatives (mother and grandmother), surroundings (shops and etc.). He likes sitting and playing in the bath. But he does not answer questions; patient\u2019s speech is restricted by two words - IA and sometimes KAKA.   Patient was consulted by endocrinologist and otolaryngolosit, no pathology was revealed. The sleep is normal.  Questions: 1) Are the available laboratory data enough to judge about the disturbance of proline uptake/ hyperprolinemia? 2) What other diseases should be considered for the differential diagnostics in this clinical case? 3) What further investigations would be recommended to reach a final diagnosis?\n\n",

As for the first question, hyperprolinemia should be diagnosed not only by a high serum proline level, but also by presence of proline, hydroxyproline and glycine in urine. I see from the drugs prescribed that this child mainly has neurological problems, can you please specify the symptoms, and mention if there are any convulsions? Also, skin manifestations and abnormal facial features? Are the parents related, and is there any positive family history? The lists of differential diagnoses are long, so we need to narrow our search by specifying the signs and symtoms.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello sahara, Good day to you too. I assume your child has TB of the genitourinary tract. Now in that case, the primary aims of treatment are to preserve renal tissue and function, to make the patient noninfectious, and to manage comorbid conditions.  Prescriptions will consist of several special medications that must be taken for 6-9 months. Treatment takes that long because the disease organisms grow very slowly and, unfortunately, also die very slowly.  Doctors use multiple drugs to reduce the likelihood of resistant organisms emerging.  Of course, all drugs have side effects which your doctor will be on the look out for through regular follow up and lab studies.\n\n",

Changing the babys position to sleep will help but be aware to ensure that the respiration is not affected that means putting the baby to sleep with the head turned to either side instead or just putting him on his back all the time.

You did not mention being on any medication so in case your are taking  more than 2 taespoon linseed  a day or too much fish oil those things may affect as well.  However I recommend you have done a clotting test and a platelets count. Nevertheless most of the times these bruises are just due to capillary fragility or the lack of enough supporting  tissue for them that make them more prone to be broken then expose to bumps or blows.\n\n",

    "content": "After the first birthday, the most common treatment for a PDA is occlusion at cardiac catheterization. Today, the most common device used for PDA occlusion is a Gianturco spring occluding coil. In experienced hands with proper patient selection, this has become a procedure associated with high success and low morbidity. Coil occlusion is best suited to close PDAs with a minimal internal diameter of less than 2.5 mm. Success is usual with a PDA diameter of 2.5-3 mm, but larger PDAs probably are best served by alternate techniques. Typically, complete occlusion is achieved at catheterization. Occasionally, a tiny residual shunt remains at the end of the procedure, which closes by thrombus formation over the following days or weeks. If this does not occur, residual shunt closure can be accomplished with a second catheter procedure. Procedural risks of PDA occlusion by catheter are few and largely influenced by the experience of the physician performing the procedure. These risks include embolization of the device being used to occlude the PDA, blood vessel injury, and stroke. In the case of device embolization, the device usually can be retrieved by transcatheter techniques, and a second device can be successfully placed in the PDA.\n\n",

Then, later in 2004, I had a bad episode with Lipitor---my muscle enzyme count was over 2000 and I was hospitalized for a few days.  I have been off Lipitor and all other Cholesterol medication since then.  However, I still don't feel good.  My muscles always feel week and/or crampy.  About 2 months ago, my stomach muscle cramped up so bad it caused me (225 lb male) to drop to the ground.  I was tested for Lyme disease, but that was negative.  I was tested for diabetes; my glucose count was high, but I am not diabetic.  My muscle enzyme count was over 500 the last time it was tested, but, my Neurologist said it was okay because I was under a lot of stress.  He then put me on anti-depressants.   I stopped taking the anti-depressants because I'm not depressed, there is something wrong with me.  I don't believe it is normal for a 43 yr old man to have no energy, be tired all the time, and to not have the strength to hold my 1 yr old son in my arms.  Can anyone shed some light on this mystery?  Thanks!  [/i]\n\n",

However, there is an aspect of your story that caught my attention and which I believe we could explore further.  You said your blood sugar was high, yet you were not diagnosed with diabetes, can you please specify the value of your blood sugar then, and what additional tests were done to exclude diabetes? If no further testing was done, you ought to discuss this with your doctor, as diabetes in adults may sometimes present with a similar picture to yours.\n\n",

There have been no subsequent tests to exclude Diabetes.  My father was a Diabetic, but died of heart failure at age 65.  I just moved from NY to NC; I will try to find a Dr. down here who can put me through a battery of tests, including diabetes. Two last questions.....what type of Doctor should I seek?  An Endochrinologist?  A Neurologist?  And, are there any other tests you would recommend that I ask them to run?  Thank you so much for your help!  You sound like an excellent physician!\n\n",

Ask about a possible decongestant to help alleviate the post-nasal drip, and also ask if these symptoms could be caused by seasonal allergies.

The most common being  an infection in the throat, near the neck or in the ears.  Most of the time they are viral infections, though sometimes bacterial. If bacterial, a  course of antibiotics would be useful. If it is viral, it might be possible that its just not going away? Either way, I would inform the doctor that he complains of pain at times in the neck from it & maybe suggest taking another approach such as biospy if you feel there is something there that they might not realize but you do. That, and a 2nd opinion.  Best of Luck\n\n",

    "content": "A child with roseola typically develops a mild upper respiratory illness, followed by a high fever (often over 103 degrees Fahrenheit, or 39.5 degrees Celsius) for up to a week. During this time, the child may appear fussy or irritable and may have a decreased appetite and swollen lymph nodes (glands) in the neck.  The high fever often ends abruptly, and at about the same time a pinkish-red flat or raised rash appears on the child's trunk and spreads over the body. The rash's spots blanch (turn white) when you touch them, and individual spots may have a lighter \"halo\" around them. The rash usually spreads to the neck, face, arms, and legs.  Roseola is contagious and spreads through tiny drops of fluid from the nose and throat of infected people. These drops are expelled when the infected person talks, laughs, sneezes, or coughs. Then if other people breathe the drops in or touch them and then touch their own noses or mouths, they can become infected as well.  The illness typically does not require professional treatment, and when it does, most treatment is aimed at reducing the high fever. Antibiotics cannot treat roseola because it is caused by a virus, not a bacterium.  Home Treatment Until the fever drops, you can help keep your child cool using a sponge or towel soaked in lukewarm water. Do not use ice, cold water, alcohol rubs, fans, or cold baths. Acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) or ibuprofen (such as Advil or Motrin) can help to reduce your child's fever. Avoid giving aspirin to a child who has a viral illness because the use of aspirin in such cases has been associated with the development of Reye syndrome, which can lead to liver failure and death.  To prevent dehydration from the fever, encourage your child to drink clear fluids such as water with ice chips, children's electrolyte solutions, flat sodas like ginger ale or lemon-lime (stir room-temperature soda until the fizz disappears), or clear broth.   Call your child's doctor if your child is lethargic or not drinking or if you cannot keep your child's fever down. If your child has a seizure, seek emergency care immediately\n\n",

    "title": "Chronic Constipation in 3yr old",
    "content": "Our 3 year old daughter suffers from chronic constipation. We can't remember exactly when the problem became apparent but it has gradually gotten worse over the last 2 years. She was breast fed for 9 months and she never suffered with it during that time. She did get it occasionally even before starting potty training so we don't think that triggered it, although it may have made the problem worse. She has always been a fussy eater which we're sure was the main cause originally but think fear of painful bowel movements is now the most contributory factor. We are fully aware of the dietary changes required but unfortunately in the past she wouldn't eat the recommeded foods. We have tried prune juice, califig, mixing linseed with porridge, bran, peaches, pineapple, pears, increasing her fluid intake which has proven reasonably effective when successfully consumed. Unfortunately it becomes a constant battle to get this combination of foods into her, to the point where she goes off the idea of eating. We have even tried taking her off cows milk and replacing it with soy and goats milk but this has proved uneffective.  We have tried laxatives on the advice of our doctor, 10 to 20 mls of milpar and 10 to 20 mls of duphalac every day. This actually works when we can get her to take them but yet again we can't force them on her, expecially the milpar. We have tried mixing it with milk and the like but to no avail. She throws a fit even if she sees the bottle. We don't normally let her go without a bowel movement for more than 5 or 6 days without interveening because of the difficulty in passing large hard stools, stomach cramps and emotional distress.  In this case we would resort to using a glycerin suppository. However the suppository doesn't even get a chance to work as the insertion alone is enough to stimulate a BM. Plus, when it comes to giving her a suppository, it is a stressful and traumatic time for all concerned. Lately her appetite has increased so yet again we are going to try re-assesing her diet. In general she has a healthy appearance. She has good muscle tone, is above average height for her age and is of average weight. There are no problems with her development physically or mentally. She has lots of energy most of the time until she becomes constipated again. We feel that it has become, predominately, a psychological issue but would like medical advice on whether this case would govern the need for internal examinations for diseases such as hirschsprung's etc.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear annemarie, I agree with you that the underlying cause to this constipation problem is probably physcological, known as ' functional constipation' resulting from prolonged withholding of stools for fear of inducing pain, resulting in harder stools and more pain, together with progressive dilatation of the colon, gradually accomodating a larger volume of stools with longer periods of constipation. Hirschsprung's seems unlikely as you've mentioned the problem at least didn't appear during the first 4-6 m of age. I don't believe the condition requires further investigation, as that would be even more traumatizing to her, unless, of course, her doctor doubts the diagnosis for any reason. You seem very aware of her condition and I encourage you to continue with what you're doing. I don't believe I can add much except that may be it would help to try and set regular times for defecation, especially after feeding, as that usually moves the guts a little bit, and try to find a way to give her the laxatives, it would help alot.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Doctor,  I am writing this with great expectation of getting valuable advise from this esteemed site.  My son, Shiham Ahmed who is 4 years old boy (Weight 14 kgs) is suffering for the last 2 years from cold and cough.  Every month we used to visit doctor and get prescribed for antibiotics and cough syrups.  On every after 2-3 days of the antibiotic treatment, he will again get the same symptoms of cough and cold.  Two weeks back he was continuously coughing (it is like a dry cough with wheezing) from morning till evening.  Only nebulizer helps at this condition.  We as usual visited the doctor, and the doctor prescribed the following medicine.  He also told us to take the following test  Chest  PA x-ray  - it was normal,  Micoplasma Antibodies \u2013 (negative (1:20) And blood ESR \u2013 normal with following remarks : RBC 5.57 / MCV 71.5 /  MCH24.8 / PLT 397 / EOS 09   Klacid 250 Mg Ezipect Neoventil (Salbutamol)  Second day also cough continued from morning and we got worried.  We went to the doctor again and doctor gave nebulizer and advised to take TRIAXONE INJECTION  for three days.  We did took the treatment of this injection and the above mentioned medicine for 7 days (ezipect and neoventil continued for totally 10 days)  After 10 days again cough started same like before (it is like a wheezing kind of cough) and when we give nebulizer, some relief comes.  But again it starts like before.  Today we went to one Doctor and he suspects that my child has allergic symptoms.  Since the cough was beyond the tolerable level, he also prescribed for nebulizer and asked us to go for blood screening for food allergy and respiratory allergy.  Tomorrow the result is expected.  However, today doctor prescribed the following medicine MUCOSOLVAN ZITHROMAX \u2013 AZITHROMYCIN FOR 6 DAYS DAILY 7.5 ML ZADITEN (Ketotifen) \u2013 advised for 3 months treatment. Adol Syrup as there was fever of 101.  Doctor we are very much worried about the condition of our child.  What could be wrong with him.  Even after he takes the antibiotics, why the decease again coming? Please advise us in detail.  Abdul Nazer\n\n",

I saw in Target today a Johnny Jump Up by Evenflo, so they are still around. Are they the safest option? That I cannot answer. It would be a personal choice to me. For myself, I would go with the newer item on the market, (these have been around a while too ) - the excersaucer. This is a little safer in my opinion because it is not a hanging device that could possibly break under pressure. Once your little man start bouncing up and down, you never know. Than again, he might be ok in it.   Excersaucers, (if space is not a factor) are wonderful. There are a variety of noisemakers, mirrors, pop-up surprises, etc. that come on different models to entertain the baby while at the same time, giving them the ability to use their legs, & keeping them in 1 spot safe so you know where they are instead of the old fashioned walker that they can go all over and still get into mischief or the jumper which lets them bounce, but provides no other stimpulation than that.  I hope that was helpful\n\n",

If however, the bulge is still there, it is advisable to see your surgeon for consult and proper management.  MD\n\n",

    "content": "My daughter had these until she was at least 4 years old.  Very unnerving for the parents, and the child doesn't remember it.    The only way I could get her to calm down was to hold her in a very tight hug, rock and sing a song that I had sung to her from infancy.  It would take about 10 minutes, but she would eventually hear it in her dream and start calming down.  So \"my\" suggestion would be to find some sound that he depply attaches to during his normal day.  A TV show song, a children's song that he loves to sing, ask him if he wants to go play ball or something else that he really enjoys doing.  You'll have to repeat this several times and even fairly loudly before it will penetrate his dream, but hopefully it will finally get through and his dream will shift to that topic.  Be sure to hold him in a firm hug while doing this so he doesn't hurt you or himself.  As you've seen, it's impossible to wake them up from this state.  I hope what worked for me will help you find a solution for your child.  They do finally grow out of this, thank goodness.\n\n",

Taking a bath, reading a book, calm activities before sleep can also help lessen the frequency of night terrors. Sleep schedules, studies have found, are very much a part of NT's.

My son had jaundice as a newborn to dangerously high levels and then in the sixth week it plummetted to normal. Around 2 years of age it was discovered that he was anemic. He was treated and all seemed well. At around 7 years of age he became jaundiced again. He was then treated as having a liver infection. Since then we and others have noticed his yellowish skin tone. I've taken him often to have his iron checked but the doctors always stated he was ok. Could someone please inform me on what could possibly be the problem. I am concerned about luekemia. There are others in close relation to my husband and I that have suffered from this disease. Both adults and children. Am I correct in thinking the levels may be directly caused by this disease?\n\n",

    "title": "neocate not working",
    "content": "My son Nick is 6 months old. He was born with a cleft palate and at 6 weeks old a naso-gastric feeding tube was put in as bottle feeding was SO hard, he HATED it, it was making him too tired and he was loosing colour. He is now fully tube fed. He is on losec. Two months ago an upper GI endoscopy was done (this was due to him throwing up considerable amounts at about 3 of his 6 feeds a day and him wriggling a lot duing tube feeds) the endoscope revealed a large number of intra-epithelial eosinophilis in the oesophagus consistent with eosinophilic oesophagitis. In addition there was mild to moderate gastritis. The gastroenterologist thought it consistent with eosinophilic gut disease and put Nick on Neocate, which he has been on for at least one month.   This is where the problems have got way worse. He is now throwing up at 5 of his 6 feeds, still considerable amounts (about 50 mls of the 150mls given each feed). I try re-feeding but with mimimal success. I wonder why there are more allergic cells in his eosophagus than his stomach, considering he has been fully tube fed since he was 6 weeks old. I don't know what to do next- I've tried every different feeding position, doing the feed slowly, not moving him (the feed he keeps down is done when he is in a very deep sleep in the middle of the night, I don't wake him). Weight gain is very slow- but minimally there. He is starting to wriggle again and arch his back half way through the feeds. I feel I should put him back on the \"normal\" formula. Is it common for babies to react poorly to the neocate? Nick hates swallowing, and I feel is never going to take food/ drinks orally- I need help!!!! Thank you for your time.\n\n",

Even then relapses are common, necessitating long-term therapy with low-dose steroids or even immunosppresive therapy. Hidden parasitic infection remains an elusive and unrecognized cause of an unknown number of cases, suggesting that empiric antihelminthic therapy should also be tried in some patients.\n\n",

    "content": "I have a 4 yr old son who has had a deep cough and fever off and on.  He has been to a doctor four times over the past two months and still has not got better.  Here is what they have given him so far.  First visit he was given steroids, two breathing treatments and then was prescribed Zithromax, oral steroids, and Albuterol with an inhaler tube.  This was stemming from chest x-rays that showed pneumonia and a round spot on his left lung.  Went back two weeks later and he was coughing as much so they gave him another breathing treatment and wanted us to keep giving him the Albuterol and bring him back in two weeks.  On the third visit they took new x-rays and said that the spot was gone but there was still stuff in his lungs.  They gave him another breathing treatment, prescribed more oral steroids and put him on Flonase and another allergy medicine.  They said he might have a viral pneumonia and it would just have to run its course.  On the forth visit they gave him another breathing treatment and wanted us to keep giving him everything else.  They just called and said that they wanted to give him a stronger antibiotic because the radiologist noticed that it had moved into a different part of his lungs.  Do these actions sound appropriate?  Should I try to get him referred to a pediatric lung specialist?  Thanks for you help.\n\n",

    "content": "Yes, it is quite usual for a viral pneumonia to run a long course, with persistent wheezing and cough, together with minimal or absent fever. However, I'm not quite sure about the X-ray description you've given, a viral pneumonia usually does not localize into a certain area of the lung, but rather results in a diffuse affection of both lungs. May be, it would be wise to have another opinion about the X-rays. Conditions which may result in a similar picture is an inhaled foreign body or enlarged lymph nodes causing partial obstruction of the airways, or an atypical micro-organism that has just not been treated properly so far.\n\n",

Also I had pressure in my ears yesterday (not exactly pain but if I pushed on my ears it would hurt) but seems to have gone away today.  Also I had temporary hearing loss this morning for about 15 minutes then my ears popped and it was fine.  My roommate was also sick with the same symptoms but hes completely better now.  My first symptoms were about 3-4 days ago. As of now I have just been taking tylenol to help the fever.  Do I have an ear infection? or just a nasty cold and water in my ears?

    "content": "Since you are in college you should access to a medical faciity for the students as Dr. Ismail suggested.    PakMan is correct in what he has learned about thermometers and factors that affect accurate temperature readings.  Tylenol lowers fever, so an accurate reading cannot be expected for at least 8 hours after taking a dose.  Also realize that if this IS an infection, taking Tylenol on a regular basis decreases the body's ability to naturally try to kill the bacteria by raising your body's temperature.    There are too many options out there right now to give a definitive answer, again as Dr. Ismail shared.  We are in the middle of another allergy season causing stuffy noses, clogged sinuses, and post-nasal drip.  These can turn into an infection.  Being in college and around new people puts you at risk for viral illnesses, such as a cold or flu.    So as the good doctor told you above, see a physician for a thorough check of the inner ear, throat and sinuses.  I hope this resolves soon!\n\n",

I first was told to watch them for about 2 - 3 months when i first found small hard lumps under my jaw that i could move. I waited and more nodes grew bigger. I had an ultrasound done and the largest lymphnode reached a size of over 2 centimeters. I was then referred to get a needle biopsy which came back negative for cancer and hodgkins disease. My lymphnodes have not got any smaller in this time period, and i have appeared to be perfectly healthy. I am very frustrated because i don't want to find out too late that there is something wrong. Do you have any idea' s or possibilities of why this is happening and what else i can do? Thank you so much.\n\n",

    "content": "Just last week ( Wednesday to be exact) my 2 1/2 year old had eye surgery for a glandular infection that ended up being MRSA.  The doctors believed that it started as a simple sty, but that somehow he was exposed to Staph.  Within a day his poor eye looked like he had been in a boxing match.  My question to you is in regards to relapse and exposure.  He attends daycare (not back yet), but is on a very high powered antibiotic and is acting fine.  What is the percentage for relapse, what should I be looking for, and could it effect other areas of the body?  We are doing the eye drops and nasal swab also to prevent further transmission.  I have just read several articles online that speak of this resistant staph spreading to the lungs and causing death.  What am I up against?  Thank you for your time,\n\n",

What I would think would be done by the doctor and department of health is finding out what the source was. This is a very contagious bacteria that is resistant to a lot of antibiotics and yes, can be very difficult to get rid of. Secondly, your child is also a high risk to other children in a daycare. This bacteria is usually more worrisome in people are immunosupressed. I would ask the tough questions about how my child got this in the first place, and I would be in contact with the department of health. We need to ensure we are not letting this superbug spread unnecessarily in the community. Again, not everyone exposed will get it, but it is significant that a 2 yr old had this in the first place. Was he ever in the hospital before the infection broke out? What antibiotic is he on? How did they know it was MRSA, did they swab it? If he were in the hospital he would be in isolation, so I think you have some questions to get answers for. Please keep me posted. Charleen\n\n",

    "content": "A quick history : My 4 1/2 yo son has had chronic loose stool almost since birth - it  is very acidic and malodorous.   He is also quite small for his age (he's 37\" and 29#). His faternal twin brother eats about the same amount of food and is 5\" and 8# bigger - even tho they were the same size a birth. It seems like everything that goes in comes out too fast and isn't being properly absorbed. We are giving him Lactese drops in his milk in case it's lactose intolerance - but it seems to have no effect. He is allergic to peanuts but all other allergy tests are negative.  Our Ped Gastro doctor has run a number of tests over the past 18 months to try to diagnose what is happening.  Including Fecal Fat, Stool Reduction tests, Celiac Blood, Stool Parasites etc, Sweat test, Upper GI Barium test and last week an endoscopic small bowel biopsy (which was only tested for Celiac).  No breath or urine tests have been performed and while blood was collected - I'm not sure what was tested  Other than showing signs of GERD and inflamed esophagus (Prevacid was prescribed) - everything has been negative.  Since the biopsy returned negative on celiac the doctors only suggestion was to take the prevacid for 6 weeks and return then for a weight check. Since appetite isn't an issue I don't' expect the Preacid to resolve the failure to thrive or loose stool issues.  Are there any other malabsorbtion tests that can be run against biopsy slides (there isnt' anymore of the sample left) or in any other way without performing another biopsy?  I'd appreciate any other thoughts or suggestions that you may have\n\n",

Guidance Counselors although may be efficient in assisting with resolution of academic related situations offer little assistance regarding situations outside of their realm. I would suggest some relaxation techniques, to assist with her anxiety. You may want to discuss with her physician about a therapist to assist her in this endeavor. I would however, advise you that if medications are suggested for anxiety relief that you be wary, as I would not suggest this approach as an answer. Relaxation techniques, tea preparations, ginger ale, etc., to help resolve nausea, in my opinion, are the safest way to treat adolescents. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

The ER physician did not examine our son in any way, made inappropriate, judgemental, unprofessional comments to my husband during the visit and sent us home telling us he was fine.  Approximately six hours later he was rused into emergency surgery in critical condition with a heart rate of 176 and subsequently required a blood transfusion.  We have spoken to an attorney who says we definitely have a negligence case but the first hurdle is to find a doctor who will be willing to stand up and say what should have been done and that what this ER doctor did put our son in danger.  This seems to me like trying to find a needle in a haystack.  How can I ever find a doctor who will be willing to basically \"bad mouth\" another doctor.  Why would anyone who does not know me from Joe or know my son want to involve himself/herself into this situation?  Do you have any ideas how or where I can find a physician who might be willing to help us?  We do not want this to ever happen to another family.  These were the most horrific moments we have ever experienced.  We are in Washington State.  Thanks for your time.\n\n",

It might be a bad posture problem. Sounds like I'm not giving you a serious answer, but I really am being serious. After a while of doing something on a regular basis a certain way, it just becomes natural & so, your daughter might just be standing in a way that is \"natural\" to her.    Does she have any pain or discomfort? If she has back, neck, or shoulder pain, than yes, I would say follow up is needed but if so far she isnt having any complaints or otherwise known problems, it hopefully its just that she is used to not using her body correctly.   Since your pediatrician is willing to get some xrays done to be safe, it couldnt hurt to do so & in the meantime, if there is no pain, I would encourage her to SIT UP or walk w/her head held high    That will get her standing/walking/sitting in the best position she should be in & you will be able to see if its just lazy/accustomed movements or a situation. If there is pain, ask your doctor about those tests again & maybe a possible referral to an orthopedist or sports medicine doctor if she is physically active in sports.\n\n",

Thankfully they now have a medicine that kills not only the lice but the eggs too!!!! No more waiting 7-10 days to use the shampoo again. It's called Ovide. It's quite expensive (we paid $50 for 2 ounces!!!) but it's enough for the whole family, just in case. It'll be WELL worth it if it works!!!\n\n",

I felt around today and I do not feel any bumps where the molars are due in,  Any suggestions?  I can't believe molars could cause such discomfort all day and night for a month.  Thanks for any feedback!\n\n",

I don't understand why it's so difficult for have this checked out or what makes them think it couldn't be this.  To me, it makes perfect sense.  The baby could possibly have GERD. As for your question to why they havent ruled out  pyloric stenosis yet, there could be many things that did not suggest that this is what it is. Some might be:  1. It is more common in male infants 2. It is common to run in families 3. more common in caucasians  4. most have type B or O blood  5. Normally develops around 3weeks old  6. baby is constipated  7. mucus in stools  8.  most times there is a \"mass\" (lump) that feels like a pit that can be felt in the belly   Diagnosing pyloric stenosis requires some tests at times that could be difficult for an infant - if the ultrasound does not show an enlargement or thickening, they might have to do other tests such as a barium swallow. That would require getting the baby to drink a liquid that is not so tasty then take xraysof the stomach to see if there is any narrowing or obstruction. If they were to find that, hospitalization & surgery would be required.   Its a process of elimination to tell you the truth with diagnosis & based on what symptoms are being exhibited, that is where they are going to lead diagnosis wise.   If the parents do not feel comfortable with the care they are receiving for the baby, I would suggest a 2nd opinion. Based on what you said with switching formulas, hospitalization for monitoring, etc., it seems they are taking the normal steps in ruling out different possible reasons for the intolerance.  Best of luck\n\n",

That baby could have died if she were to go on much longer. Sincerely helpingfriend  I'm so happy that they finally got to a diagnosis & she is starting to feel better.  I understand your fustration & I do agree, it seems that sometimes you want to say \"Duh...Doc..what don't you get???\" But sometimes it IS hard to make a diagnosis. Also, not to get political or cause a whole other can of worms to spill here, but unfortunetely sometimes health insurance companies have a lot to do w/the treatment of patients. I've seen more people - INCLUDING MYSELF - have to wait longer to get to a diagnosis or treatment than they should have to in my opinion but what can you do when there are restraints that health care professionals have?   A very fast story - now mind you - I work w/these doctors & this happenned to me - I was left sitting in a hospital, much like the baby - in pain, etc. for over 2wks. I had an ongoing issue that I felt was gallbladder related. Went to the ER 1 night when I couldnt take it anymore....was admitted right away based on my statements, not on tests. Because I'm known by the staff, they automatically said my statements match gallbladder, thats what it is, get her settled in, we will test in A.M. The morning came & I had my catscan which didnt show any evidence of it being a gallbladder issue. Hidascan, ultrasound, barrium swallow, endoscopy, gyn referals, you name it...it was not my gallbladder according to tests. Finally, on the 12th day, my doctor came to me & said :\"We believe you but don't know what it is & insurance is not going to pay for all these tests, you know this. We have done all the tests & more that we didnt even need to, they simply will not pay\". It didnt matter to me - I demanded I have the operation anyways & so even though I read my chart (which said in doctor's notes that they are aware that they might be doing this for nothing), I proceeded w/surgery. When I awoke in the Recovery room, my surgeon said they all were so wrong. Just because the tests didnt show it, didnt mean there wasnt an issue. My gallbladder was rotten. A *Good* gallbladder is normally a robbin's egg blue color - mine was green & other unpleasant colors.   My point here is that they allowed me to sit there in misery & even tried to send me home & I WORK THERE. I'm 1 of them but there was only so much from an insurance point that they are able to do. don't take this as a healthcare professional will allow a person to die if insurance wont cover it, but so long as there is no immediate risk, sometimes it happens.  The only other comment I can make is that maybe you did unfortunetely go thru a case of incompetence. In that scenerio, it is sad to say, but being aware of your own health, your child's, etc. is important & if you don't feel that you are not receiving care that you should receive, you must be the one to take the 1st step to go seek another opinion.   In spite of all the politics, the what if you had changed doctors sooner, who found the diagnosis.....the point is the baby is ok & thats what is important.   Take Care & Best of Luck\n\n",

It is caused by a virus, and there is no antiviral treatment yet available for it. It is a self-limited disease which usually leaves no sequelae or scarring. If, however, the fever becomes uncontrollable, or your child is not feeding and drinking well, he may need to be hospitalized for a few days.\n\n",

I have read that accutane can cause premature closure of growth plates.   I do remember that I didnt grow much after I started taking the accutane.   I realize  there is nothing that can be done now if it did stunt my growth.   It just is really affecting me psychologically to think it stunted my growth and I would like to know if it did or it didnt.  My question is,can doctors look at an adult skeleton and determine if there was premature closure of growth plates during the growth period?  I know that they can see harris lines in bone scans of people who had stunted growth.  Is  there some similiar indicator that could tell a doctor if my growth plates closed prematurely?  thanks very much for any help\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, im really hoping you can give me some answers. My 10 year old son has a history of desmoids in right thigh, 3 have been removed succesfully and he has full movement again. 12 months ago he complainrd of sore back on left side and a visual lump was seen an x ray was done which said small deformity of left 10th rib and soft tissue density to the right of 7th and 8th rib only seen on frontal views and cant be confirmed. We were referred back to my sons specialist who ordered CT scan, MRI, Bone scan all of which showed nothing (took 3 MRIs to pick up last desmoid in thigh). Doctors say most probably another desmoid they can see it visual but because nothing showing there is nothing they can do. It has now got larger and is also visible from the front of his stomack (rib) as well. He is in considerable pain in his back and stomach and his physical excerise is becoming nill as it hursts to even bend. Before he got this lump his walking was extremly deformed due to desmoid in leg and i thought maybe it was muscular due to his walking. Does muscular pain show as a lump, what shows on x rays but not MRI. He also has numbness and pins and needles down leg onnsame side. Please give me some answers or questions to ask specialist. thanks so much\n\n",

    "content": "I was on Depakote, Lexapro, Wellbutrin, Atavan, Klonopins, Ambien, and Visterol and began feeling weak and tired all the times, my hands would shake and my fingers would twitch. I'd get random muscle spasms all the time. My hair is falling out in clumps, even though I am only 15. Since it has always been thick, I have no bald spots, but I can now tell that my hair is starting to grow thinner due to the hair loss. I feel like I'm always sick. I thought that because of the weight gain I had developed stretch marks, as I had always been very thin before I had never really had them and thought the marks on my skin were them. But when my mother saw them she said they weren't stretch marks, but something else. They are mainly on my thighs, but there are some on the back of my calf. They are red and purple small almost rectangular shapes on my things. When I press on them they don't turn white, and when I pull back/ stretch the surrounding skin, it looks like long red lines in which you can see very very small dots of blood starting to come out. They feel raised, as in, if I run my finger across it feels bumpy. Also, I missed two months of my period and when it started it was extremely heavy and lasted for almost 17 days, as opposed to my normal 11 day periods.  I have just gotten off the depakote, lexapro, atavan, klonopin, ambien, and visterol about three weeks ago because I thought that was causing the fatigue and hair loss and weight gain. For a while, I thought I was anemic, but my doctor ran a lot of tests on me and everything came back normal. He just told me to increase my water intake, which was not especially helpful.  Any idea what this could be?\n\n",

Thanks  Re: testing: Most of the time 1 of the easiest tests to get a better look at what is going on & what is causing UTIs is a kidney scan. It is a good test & used a lot in for children that are known to have reflux to see the scarring. An IV is inserted, enabling a medicine that makes pictures clearer for radiogy to read (its actually a radioactive dye, but not to scare you, its very normal & common). Then photos of the kidneys are then taken.   Re: the reflux itself: sometimes there are children that need to be on an antibiotic every day to prevent UTIs. Make sure you are following the directions regarding time administration, etc. Antibiotics need to be taken as scheduled & not missed. When the schedule gets switched around or doses are missed, this can cause the antibiotic to not work correctly. If that is not the reason for why the infections continue even on antibiotics, or if there is more scarring that is developing, there have been times where some children have needed surgery.   Talk to your pediatrician about his/her thoughts on having your daughter see a urologist, whom would be of great value in answering your questions/concerns.   re: Genes: Maybe the forum can help me out here, because I'm at a loss for a good answer. There are numerous studies that I have read & more I'm sure you can find on the web regarding the linking of genes, domainant genes, inherited conditions, etc. I do recall reading topics related to that & though there were a lot of studies I read, I never read any 1 thing linking it to 1 certain gene or another. In that case, it would just be a matter of testing both mom & dad to see who is the carrier but when it could be a multitude of genes (I have read that there are a group of genes together that are involved), its just too hard to answer (at least for myself) on the forum. I would suggest though asking the doctor since he feels 1 of you carry the gene, what gene does he feel it is & how would you go about finding the carrier. The answer is basic bloodwork, but again, without knowing what the testing is for, I, personally, cannot offer more insight as to how it is developed or where it starts or comes from. I'm sorry   Best of Luck\n\n",

    "title": "IgM and IgG Tests for Chicken Pox",
    "content": "My daughter has recently been exposed to Chicken Pox. She has not had the Chicken Pox vaccine (medical exemption from pediatrician) due to a family history of neurologic disorders.    Since it has an appx 21 day incubation period and she is starting school prior to the end of this period, we wanted to find out if, in fact she was incubating Chicken Pox.  I would hate for her to miss the 1st week of school if it's not necessary.  And I don't want to take a chance on infecting other children at school either.  So, the pediatrician did an IgM and IgG test.  The IgG test came back negative, meaning, from my understanding, that she does not have antibodies, or, in other words, an immunity to Chicken Pox.  The IgM came back at .91.  The way that it was explained to me was that if the number falls in the range of .90 - 1.10(I believe) it would put her in the category of \"possibly\" having a recent exposure.  The lab called the IgM \"indeterminant.\"  I don't understand what this means.  Does it mean that she is in the beginning stages of it and, that, maybe when we administered the test, it was too early to determine and the anitbodies were just developing?  I know that not everything is black and white, but, I know she can't \"sort of \" have the Chicken Pox.  Could it also be that this .91 does indicate a response from her immune system, but doesn't necessarily mean that she would be affected by it or come down with it? Most importantly, I would like to have a 2nd test done now.  Wouldn't the 2nd test be more valid now that she's several more days into the incubation(if, in fact, she is incubating it?)  This 2nd test seems to be the answer.  If I could test her, which she is more than willing to do (she's very upset that she may have to miss the 1st week!), how would the time frame (of about 6 days later) affect the results?  WOuld this work? Just an FYI,,,the exposure date was around July 31st.  It was her brother.  I know you probably think that I'm crazy, but I separated my kids, in separate houses, through my son's contagious period.  Also, interesting side note, the initial exposure that my son had in which he contracted the Pox was from a child that my daughter had sleep over.  In the middle of the night the child woke up with a fever, then proceeded to break out in the am.  My daughter played with this child all night, my 3 yr old son, about 3 times, had to go in the room where they were playing and tear up the \"Barbie world\" that the girls had created!  HE develops Chicken Pox, while my daughter escaped this 1st 21 day incubation period!  The Dr was amazed!  Hence the reason for the IgG...the Dr thought that, maybe she had an immunity to it.  But, apparently not.  Anyway, would a 2nd test be beneficial?  Thank you so much for reading this through!  I know that I was long winded, but I just wanted you to have all of the facts.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello     I am a teenage girl and i keep gettin.hard nonmovable lump/s near the top of my hip bone on my left side. The lump or lumps can only be felt when I lie down, are non tender, cause no bulge, cannot be felt or seen when i stand or cough, and is very large .The lump or lumps occur in a curved L shape above my groin and I can feel various hard surfaces there but can not tell if they are the same thing or seperate because sometimes a part of it can be felt while the other part can't and sometimes it all can be felt and seems one thing. It seems to be in the area where the large intestine is and is kind of the shape. I have had bowel changes. There is no pain and the stool is easy to pass. I believe I had a fever the other night as i wasn't feeling quite right and my face felt hot but did not check with a thermometer and was fine the next morning. I also have enlarged lymph nodes I think 2 clearly felt ones in my neck along with a cluster of them that I can not count also on my neck, three in my groin, and possibly 1 under each armpit but I don't know if the ones under my armpits are lymph nodes or not. They are all hard, not painful, and slightly movable. I have had them for about 2-3 months and more keep popping up and getting larger. I also have had lower back pain for proibabably about 5 months now with no injury and my legs especially my right are now hurting. I am trying to get my mom to set up an appointment with my doctor but haven't shown her my swollen nodes or my lump/s in my abdomen cause I don't want to make a big deal out of it, but I will show my doctor to get her opinion. Is it normal to fell lump/s in this are of your abdomen and what could it be? PS: I have had no sickneses or infections since the appearance of any of these symptoms.

    "content": "My 17-yr-old son has been diagnosed with HSP. When he was 9, he had an upper respiratory infection, stomach ache, and then broke out in a flat, red, circular rash with purple in the middle. The rash was warm to the touch, and only on his joints: his ankles, knees, elbows, and fingers.  Since, then, he has continued to have outbreaks 2-3 times a year for the last 8 years, which I understand to be very unusual for HSP. In addition, his rash is never on his buttocks and is never raised, which is supposed to be typical for HSP. Recently, the rash also broke out on his palms, he is getting more frequent headaches, and he reports that his stomach often hurts (particularly after eating).  Is this really HSP? What steps should we take to determine what is actually happening?   As an aside that may or may not help, his identical twin brother was diagnosed with lymphomatoid papulosa at nine as well, about six months before he had the first outbreak of HSP.   Thank you very much for your time.\n\n",

Regretfully, there are no specific lab studies which are conclusive, but a biopsy from the skin lesions may be very helpful in doubtful cases. Also, if it does turn out to be HSP, you must watch out for your child's kidneys, as recurrent cases are usually associated with a higher incidence of kideny affection.\n\n",

    "title": "Baby With Lump On His Spine",
    "content": "Hi all. Looking for some help for a friend's son. Caleb is 9 months old now. When he was 6 months old, his mom noticed a lump on his back. It's between the L and T vertibre (spelling??) They just took him to 2 different hospitals and had MRIs done, 3 on his back and one on his skull. The doctors didn't show the parents the MRIs, and gave no name as to what is wrong. They said there is a cyst on his spine up near his head. This is not visible to the eye. What is visible is the lump lower down. It is getting bigger. At the end of the last visit, the parents were told just to come back in 6 months for a check up. When they pressed the doctor for an answer, he said Caleb is, \"Abnormally normal\". (No ~ I'm not kidding!) When she asked again about the lump, the doctor told her it is a muscle that sticks out farther when he bends over. (As far as I know, muscles aren't suppose to do this OR get visibly bigger as months pass...) The lump is now about 3 inches long and this is pretty big when you consider it's on a 9 month old's back.   Has anybody got a name for this? Any suggestions for research would be greatly appreciated. The mom has 3 boys and not much time for computer searching. I said I would help. The closest guess I'm finding on the net is spinal bifida occulta. Caleb is totally normal except for the lump.   Thanks in advance!\n\n",

Hi,  The smegma serves asa lubricatator between the foreskin of the penis and the glands, helping with movement between intercourse. Even though he is not having intercourse, and this is most likely erections that he is having (he is only having these symptoms at night I'm assuming by your post), the smegma is prepping itself to do what it feels is its \"job\", if that makes sense.  I agree with your theory on erections...his age, when it is happenning, the feeling he is having, etc. all fall in place with that.\n\n",

I would like to know if there is anything wrong with her.  Hi,  There is a condition called nystagmus that develops in infancy that make their eyes jump r oscillate back and forth.  It can be caused by poor vision or also inherited. Normally though, this condition goes away after around 6months of age and nohing is done for it but after that, consulting a  pediatrician who will send the child to the eye doctor is the next step.  If it is more a \"lazyeye\" like action, there are things that can be done with her to correct that. Following a pencil back and forth, etc. If it is related to a vision problem, corrective glasses can be given.  Either way, its worth mentioning it to her parents to see the pediatrician about it. It might also be that they are aware but just havent talked to the family about it.  I wish your niece luck\n\n",

I don't really know anything about the Staph skin infection.  I don't know what type of staph infection he has (impetigo, cellulitis, etc) but either way the easiest way and probably only thing that you can do is soaks in warm water, warm moist washcloths to the area, heating pads or a hot water bottles for about 20 minutes, 3-4 times a day to the area. Tylenol or Motrin can help reduce pain.   The doctor can prescribe a analgesic if none of those methods are cutting it.   As for the duration of the infection, that all depends on A. What it is and B. The course in which you take to treat it. Keep it very clean, have him take the antibiotics as prescribed (Actually, I don't see he was given any...but if he was, take them lol).\n\n",

    "content": "I have an eight year old son who has life threatening alleriges to peanuts.  At his first allergy testing at 18 months of age, he was also allergic to egg yolk and egg white...  During his last allergy testing at age 8, he tested positive to corn, wheat and soybean.  He has avoided all forms of egg, egg white, and peanuts.  This is truly limiting him food choices.  (Food allergies now to: peanuts, egg white, egg yolk, corn, wheat and soybean).  Do you have any advice on how to help him eat a variety of foods and continue to stay healthy?  I am very worried about him.  He is currently underweight (70% in height and 20% in weight) and has difficulty with his stomach.  I have now cut out all corn, wheat and soybean products...  It is helping somewhat.  What is causing all these allergies?  Will his list of food allergens continue to grow?  How do I help him cope?  Any suggestions?  The poor kid has never tasted cake, cookies or brownies!  Most chocolate has traces of peanuts... so that is also limited.  He has a huge amount of air borne allergens also.  (dust, dust mites, mold, cockroaches, 4 types of grass, oak, ragweed, dog, cat) Thank you for your time!  You are greatly appreciated.\n\n",

The doctor will most likely suggest some allergy testing after determining what factors he is subjected to that are different than the ones at home.(Ex: You have no pets and he has no contact with them except for when at Grandma's...could be dander, etc).  The fever is probably associated with the allergic reaction, not a separate illness.     Best of Luck\n\n",

    "content": "bukswife wrote:he has coxsackie????? news to me..never heard of it when my kids were little...he just had the rash now...no other effects...  thanks  Normally the way that this goes around (and it spreads like wildfire - there was a case of it in my hospital's daycare center once...the whole daycare had to be shut down for a week) is it spreads from child to child most of the time from unwashed hands or from being in contact with feces.  This leads can lead to what you might know as \"Hand, foot, and mouth disease\" ; a type of coxsackie. It causes the child to have very painful blisters in the throat, on the tongue, gums, inside of the cheeks, hands and feet. There are also other forms of coxsackie like: herpangina (a virus infection of the throat), Bornholm disease (spasms in the muscles of the chest. Boys that get that also somtimes have pain in the testicles), conjunctivitis (pink eye), left untreated also very rarely, meningitis  The ONLY reason I am giving you this information, it is not to worry you...your doctor knows best & Im sure if he saw a pattern he would comment but also, so that you can make sure that his hygenic needs are being cared for while he is out of the home and left in the hands of others. At 3 1/2, most for most little boys, there last thoughts are \"need to wash my hands\" but obviously, it is so so important. Also, when OTHERS do not wash their hands, little children have a tendency to be very oral and go to their mouths with their hands after touching someone/something that is not clean. This can bring it on too.  Best of luck & sorry about the allergy info - my 1st thought was allergic reaction since it happenned with each visit.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear nicholeharmon20, I'm afraid there is no particular age where infants stop having colicks, especially if one or both parents has irritable bowels, and in that case, it may extend well into childhood or even adulthood. Here are a few tips though, you can try spacing of feeding and frequent eructation during feeding. Also, try laying him on his side following feeds, as that helps release of wind.  If he is bottle fed, always ensure the nipple is covered completely with milk, so as to avoid swallowing of air. Check you use the proper concentration of milk formula, and that it's not too strong.  As for your four year old, he may be a little hyperactive, which is natural in his age. He will also resist discipline. Try bargaining with him, like if he learns his ABCs, he could play more often. If he is still hyperactive and stubborn, then go see a child psychiatrist. As for your last question, it is unlikely for you to get pregnant within only 4 month of delivery.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I didn't know where else to ask this so i'll ask here. A couple of days ago I had a pimple on my upper lip. I tried popping it but that didn't work so I decided to use ZapZyt. Being my stupid self I didn't bother reading the warnings, I ended up rubbing it all over my upper lip. Yesterday is when it began, it became very swollen, probably two or three times the size of my lower lip. Today it has only gotten worse spreading over to the other part of my lip. It also seems to have gotten bigger. Please help me, it pains me and it is so embarrassing I don't even like showing my parents.  They know about it but I wanted to hear a word on what you guys think it is. Thanks.\n\n",

It seems to be working really well as I have seen very noticable results, the swelling has decreased to half the size and a lot of puss is coming out. Again thanks for the help!   *UPDATE* My lip has since gotten much better but I wanted to help those searching around for this kind of problem.  If you are someone you know has this problem avoid putting ANY kind of oily product, creme, vasaline, etc.. until you consult a doctor.

Any suggestions?  Thank you.  I wrote a great post & my computer jammed up & I couldnt post it   So here I go again, lol:  Its hard to tell just what the \"white\" is by reading & not looking so if you have not taken your son to the pediatrician, you might want to do so based on what it might truly be that is giving him the spots. It could be a simple case of drewling, causing rashes (very common). It could be more a heat rash or it could be candita (yeast). If it is yeast, he needs an antibiotic creme to remove it & putting vaseline on it will not help.   If it is just a rash from drewling, something to use as a \"sealant' would be very helpful. I have always found Gold Bond to be the wonder lotion/powder for everything. There is also another product on the market called Udderly Smooth. Though I have never in my experience had a doctor prescribe it for a patient, my 13yr old daughter had a lot of problems with chapping & rashes in the same areas. We found this product in our local CVS & it works wonders. Not only is it a sealant, it helps with making the skin smooth & rash free. As long as you know this is not fungal, I would suggest trying that or Gold Bond for break-outs and future breakout prevention. I have never found in patients or with my own children (6 kids) Vaseline to do much of anything to be honest.   Regarding the white spots, you can try Vitamin E. It works very well on stretch marks & scars. Your son's pediatrician might suggest a dermatoligist to give you a Rx method, which normally works a lot quicker than the old OTC way.   Just make sure you know the reason for the rash!!  Good luck\n\n",

    "title": "Improper Use of Antibiotics",
    "content": "My family and I recently went on a cruise and, during the trip, my 15 year old son started having stomach pains.  I attributed it to the change in schedule and eating rich foods which typically occur during vacation.  His stomach was really starting to bother him, however, so I decided to take him to the medical facility on the ship just to ease his mind (he occasionally experiences anxiety).  The doctor diagnosed the condition as indigestion and advised my son to stay away from rich foods.  The doctor also prescribed a 5 day course of antibiotics (Septra).  I was a little wary about giving my son antibiotics for this type of stomach problem, but when my son continued to complain as the evening went on, I went ahead and gave him one pill of the Septra.  Shortly after giving him this pill, his stomach became even more upset.  I became concerned that the Septra had upset his stomach even more, so I just stopped giving him anymore of the antibiotic (so, in total, he had one Septra pill).  I thought we should just see if his stomach returns to normal on its own as he watches his diet.  Now, however, I am concerned that, by not finishing the entire prescription of antibiotics, I have made any bacteria that he has resistant to Septra and that this will make it more difficult for him to overcome any infections in the future.  He has not overused antibiotics in the past as I don't recall him being on antibiotics for the last several years (as an infant, he took antibiotics for occasional ear infections).  I know that just giving him the one pill of Septra was not a proper use of antibiotics, but how likely is it that this will cause problems?  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "My daughter, who just turned 9, has gained 20 lbs. in the past year, 5 since late June and 2 in a week.  She swims competitively year-round (in the water approximately 5 hours a week, not counting meets), plays travel softball and basketball.  This is in addition to the usual kid stuff like riding her bike and playing outside.  She eats a very healthy diet (loves broccoli and brussel sprouts and drinks water 95% of the time).  This has been an on-going problem that has begun to snowball.  We have talked with her pediatrician several times over the past few years.  Until recently, they did not really take us seriously.  She has seen a nutritionist who said she was consuming about 700 calories a day less than she safely could given her activity level (eating about 1200-1400).  She has had some sleep problems (tonsils and adenoids removed and some changes in habits have helped this).  She has seasonal and year round allergies that she takes weekly injections for and uses Zyrtec and Nasacort as needed.  She has exercise induced asthma that is getting worse and not responding to the preventative albuterol inhaler.  She has been tested for thyroid problems and Cushing's.  All tests are normal.  Her metabolism has been tested and she was found to only be burning 900 calories a day.  We have tried to cut calories even more and have only seen weight gains.  We have made changes as a family.  I have lost 30 lbs and her dad 20.  Please help!  We are being referred to a pediatric pulmanologist and a pediatric endocrinologist but have been told there probably was nothing the endo could do (has been consulted, just a courtesy visit).  My daughter is becomimg upset!\n\n",

You did not mention anything about diabetes or any symptoms other than weight gain, but I wanted to add that when you have a child that has excessive thirst, urination, sweating or weight gain to name a few, these all could be signs of diabetes. Before you prepare yourself for the worst..see the endocrinologist.

This surprised me because his formula is iron fortified, as are all his snack foods (we only get the ones that say they are a good source of iron and zinc).  6 weeks ago he was prescribed drops (brown sludge that really stinks and tastes terrible). I was very lax in giving him the drops for the first 3 weeks. Upon his return to the dr, he tested at a 9.0 the first time and a 10.2 the second. we admitted to not being adament about giving him his drops. We were told to give him the drops and return after our vacation. I was dutiful about giving him the drops daily and upon our return we went in. this time his iron counts were 8.0 and 9.2. We were sent to the local hospital to have more extensive labwork done (3 different blood tests). I am very concerned, what could be causing this? Best and worst case scenarios. We don't return to the doctor until thursday for the results. Given that his iron intake has increased drastically and his iron counts have decreased I am thinking I have reason to worry. He has been more and more fussy over the last few weeks but has always been where he should be developmentally. What is going on?\n\n",

    "title": "IRON deficiency",
    "content": "I can base my advice on my experience with the neonates I work with on a daily basis in the NICU.   Babies, and small children have less blood than adults. The red blood cells in adult last > 100 days in our bodies before our spleen(the graveyard of dead red blood cells) takes them to get rid of them. In children, red blood cells die faster. When your child had his \"HCT\" or hematocrit checked, they must have also tested for a \"retic\" count.  A normal or slightly higher retic count indicates that your child is in fact trying to make Red Blood cells.  That yucky, smelly iron supplement your baby takes is called \"Ferinsol\", just a fancy name for an iron supplement. I give it to our babies in the NICU ALL THE TIME.  And YES, it is \"nasty\" smelling and tasting.  If your doctor felt that your baby's HCT and Retic count was critical, he/she would have opted for a transfusion. The irritability your baby has could be related to so many factors, and not just his low iron.  Please rest assured, that if your doctor was very concerned about these numbers, he/she would have advised a transfusion and you do not indicate this in your post.   Your doctor, based on your child's weight may increase her dose.  Change to a different brand.  He/She may also encourage you to feed your baby for green/leafy vegetables, lean meats, eggs, oatmeal, other high iron cereals and/or other foods high in iron.  You should definitely try to be more consistent in giving your baby his iron supplement.   God Bless  NICU_RN\n\n",

    "content": "He is in the 25percentile for height but has completely fallen off the scale for weight. He borderline \"failure to thrive!\" He is an EXTREMELY picky eater. I think this is partially due to his Aspergers syndrome. He has very heightened senses. But he's so thin. I've been giving him Pediasure but that gets expensive. He's otherwise a healthy normal little boy. Hardly ever sick and most definitely not tired. He gets up about 7:30-8:00am and he goes to bed at 9pm but is usually still awake at 11pm. I take him to the Doc for his yearly check-ups and they never say anything about it. My side of the family on my Dad's side is also very thin so I tend to think it's just genetic. High metabolism. He doesn't have any of the other symptoms of things like hyperthyroidism and such. Does anyone have any other ideas on getting him to eat better. I think I've tried everything!!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Jen, Most kids pass through this phase of being picky eaters. Of course, in your son's case, it may be related to the Asperger's, but then again it may be only partly related. Genetics also play a big role in weight gain, so if you and your spouse are slim, your child may not put on pounds quickly.  To determine whether your child is receiving enough food, your child's doctor (sometimes with the help of a dietitian) could do a calorie count after knowing what your child eats every day.\n\n",

    "title": "2 Month Old with Parietal Skull Fracture",
    "content": "I put my son down for a nap and 2 hours later he had a huge knot on the top left of his head. I immediatley got him up, gave him a bottle, and took him to the emergency room. Turns out he has a fractured skull! The doctors are really trying to make it out to be child abuse but as God is my witness, I would NEVER hurt my son. They refuse to even try to look into it further, even after I told them he has had injury to his head. When he was born the doctor had to use the vacuum thing and when that didn't work, he used forceps. A great deal of force was applied because the umbilical cord was around his neck and he was face up. I suffered major wounds and had to have 60 to 80 stitches...it was a 4th degree tear. The baby was born with a high fever and had to be in intensive care overnight. Other than that, 3 weeks ago my husband was playing with the baby on the coffee table and looked away for a second and my son stiffed up his legs in front of him and went right back on the table and hit the top left of his head. There was some swelling afterward but swelling was gone by the next day. I am my sons primary care giver. I stay at home with him 24 hours a day and I KNOW nothing else has happened to him so this fracture has to be associated with birth or the coffee table incident or both. But the doctors insist this happened within the last 24 to 48 hours. All i can figure is that it was possibly aggravated within that time, but I know it definetly did not happen that recently. They insist it is child abuse and have made my husband and I sign over custody to the baby's grandparents pending investigation by the State. I swear I have not hurt my child and I have to figure out what is going on so that I can get my son back. Also, aside from that reason, I, as a good mother, need to know what really is going on. I know I have never hurt him but without any type of medical personnel even attempting to help me figure this out, I fear I will lose my son for good. Please help  me. I need to know the possiblity of this happening at birth, how long it takes to heal, if it could have been re injured with the coffee table or if the coffee table is what did it by itself, and how it looks now like it happened within 24 to 48 hours. If you can't help me, please find someone who can. I am getting no where alone. Thank you!\n\n",

    "content": "I am very worried abotu my friend and her 10 year old son, and I am looking for any information, help that I can find to help him.  She had him when she was 14 years old. She was to young to be a mother and did not want him. Her mother told her she had to keep him, and forced her to take care of him. She wanted to gie him for adoption. As a result of being forced into motherhood, she resented her son, and tried to stay away from him as much as possible. She did not want anything to do with him. She also didnt treat him very nicely, and tho he was never physicially abused, he was mentially abused his whole life, just because he was not wanted around. He leared very early in life how to take care of himself, how to turn on the tv, and get dressed, but he is slow learner in school, and behind other kids his age, probably because he don't have someone at home helping him with homework and stuff.  He was never an easy child to be around, he was very hard to handle, prone to horrible tantrums, but that only made matters worse.  he has not been shown affection or love. He refuses to comb his hair, but if you try to make him, he will throw a fit liek you tried to kill him. I can remember one time he had sores in his mouth, and I tried to give him something to make him feel better, he had a fit, he cried and screamed and cowered in the corner like I tried to beat him, and all I did was offer some medicine to help his mouth from being sore. He does not play with other kids, he is completly anti social, he onyl like to play vidoe games, he don't play with toys, or liek to go outside, his personal hygene is terrible, and I don't know if thats because he is just a 10 year old boy, or because he was never taught the proper way to bathe or wipe his butt, or if its because he just don't care. He doesnt laugh, or have fun, or act liek a normal little kid, all he likes to do is play vidoe games. His mother has taken him to dozens of doctors, and they have diagnosed him with every mental illness known, from Bi polar, to ADHD. He has been prescribed a ton of drugs, but none have calmed him down, they have just turned him into a zombie, but his attitude is the same.  My personal opinion is although he may possibly have some mental illness,  who wouldnt that has gone through what he has? he has never been shown love. I don't think any drug in the world can cure that.  Eventually, He went to live with his grandmother, but she cant handle him anymore. He is just oiut of control. His mother does not want him back, she is at the end of her rope. But she cant seem to find any governtment help to aid her. She has called a lot of psychiatric homes and such, btu until he is a threat to himself or others, noone will take him. She does nto want to put him into foster care, because bouncing him from home to home wont help either. I think he need to be admitted to a group home of some sort, taken off all the drugs, and start over from scratch, but apparently, she cant find any group homes, or facilities to deal with this.  My question is what can be done for this child? He is going to grow up to be a very miserable depressed, drug addicted person, and I just feel terribly for him, he didnt deserve to be born into this kind of life.  Does anyoen know of any homes he can be placed in to give him therepy counciling.....affection and comfort. The family does not have money, so it has to be some kind of governtment assistance, she does get disability checks for him...she is at the end of her rope wwith this child, and I am worried about his welfare and his welbeing.\n\n",

In case of that the risk is that the unconjugated bilirubin reaches the brain  especially one part which is called the basal ganglia in a very important amount and causes irreversible damage to the brain.  This level requires phototherary and the smaller the baby the more risk of brain damage. Definitely the baby needed phototherapy and monitoring of the bilirrubin leves till he  reached a safe level to prevent brain damage.       for further information , please feel free to contact me.

    "title": "Pediatric Knee Problem",
    "content": "My daughter who is now 9 years old has been able to \"pop\" the bone in her shin where it attaches to the knee in and out at will since she was 3 years old. Our family doctor insisted that the knee didn't require any intervention. He said that children often have \"soft\" bones and ligament connections don't always tighten until they are much older. As the ability to do this knee thing didn't seem to be causing her pain, he insisted we leave it alone and evaluate it later if it began to bother her. Granted, it didn't seem to bother her so we did leave it alone, but I've insisted that she quit popping it in and out just for the fun of it. Now, she seems to be having lots of problems with her knee. She complains of pain in it constantly - sometimes worse than others. When she is on it for a prolonged period, she actually retains quite a bit of fluid on it. And now I notice that occassionally the knee just seems to give out on her making her fall. I've taken her back to the family doctor for the problem, but he says that it is Austen-Schlatters (sp?) and there really isn't anything to do but exercise it regularly and take motrin for the pain. That just doesn't seem right. She is quite active already and given being on it for a long period makes it retain fluid and really hurt, I just don't think this is the best advice. I am afraid that we've waited too long to treat this correctly. I am afraid to take her to a regular orthopedic doctor, but can't get an appointment with a pediatric orthopedic doctor for many months. Any suggestions what this might be? And should I give in a take her to a regular orthopedic doctor instead of waiting for the pediatric ortho at Children's Hospital? Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear JustDionne, Osgood-Schlatter disease occurs in children and adolescent athletes where repetitive extension of the knee causes inflammation and injury of the tibial tubercle (of the bone itself).  The tibial tubercle is the protuberant knob on the front of the tibia, a couple of inches below the knee, where the patellar tendon attaches. This pain is typically worse when extending the leg. The tibial tubercle is painful and tender to touch and over time begins to protrude more because the chronic inflammation stimulates the bone to grow.  This is a self-limited condition that usually resolves as the bone stops growing with the end of adolescence (at about age 17 years in males and age 15 years in females). Treatment includes PRICE therapy, which stands for: PROTECT the knee from further trauma which can be done with knee padding.  REST the knee. ICE the knee. Use an icebag placed on the knee 2-3 times a day for 20-30 minutes each time.  COMPRESS the knee with a knee brace or wrap.  ELEVATE the knee.  Over-the-counter pain control medications such as naproxen (Aleve or Naprosyn) and ibuprofen (Advil or Motrin) also play a role in treatment.  In severe cases, splinting the knee for a few weeks may help reduce the pain and halt the inflammation cycle.  My advice is: give the PRICE therapy together with medication one week, and if no improvemnt, go see an orthopedic doctor, as this usually points to some other underlying condition.\n\n",

    "title": "My son's testicles and penis have not grown since surgery",
    "content": "My son was born a normal child.  His testicles were decended until he reached the age of 3.  I noticed alot of changes in my son when he was 3.  He started putting on ALOT of weight and I couldn't seem to find his testicles.  We took him to a urologist and he found his testicles and wanted to wait a year to see what would happen.  When my son was 4 years old he had surgery because his testicles had turned up and attached to the vas deferans.  Since the surgery his testicles have not grown at all and his weight is still out of control.  I have pictures of my son from before his testicles attached and after and he looks like two different children.  I know his weight has everything to do with his testicles not growing and I am concerned.  I don't know what to do about his growth problems.  His testicles are the size of a small lima bean and his penis is so small and stays pulled inside that it is barely visible.  My son is 8 years old now and I am seriously concerned about him.  When I take him to the doctor he tells me not to worry and that everything is normal, but I don't think so.  They tell me when he reachs puberty that this will all change.  I know this is doing damage to his testicles because they are always close to his body and can't regulate his body temperature.  His testicles are supposed to be producing testosterone but being so undergrown I am worried that they are not producing anything and this is what is causing his weight problems.  He doesn't over eat, I have a 9 year old daughter that eats more then him and is just as active as him.  Do I need to find a new doctor for my son and demand that something be done, like hormone therepy or something.  I'm at a loss and desperate to know if anyone else has been through this.\n\n",

What I can tell you, from one mother to another, is that if you're not happy with the care your son is receiving, you absolutely have the right to seek that care elsewhere.  What would I do if I were as worried as you? I'd find another physician and get a second opinion. It would at least serve the purpose of easing my mind that my child was getting the best care available, as well as the opinion of two qualified physicians.  Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "MY 9 year old step-daughter has 2 marble size (larger than a quarter) lumps very close to each other on the right side of her head behind her ear and above her neck hairline.  She reported her mother told her that the mother had the same thing and dr said they were calcium deposits so she has not taken the daughter to the dr to check the daughter's lumps assuming they are calcium deposits just like hers.  From what I have found on-line this seems like cause for concern.  The lumare very hard and not movable.  Daughter can't remember how long they have been there but it took a while before she asked dad since mom apparently is doing nothing.  What could these be?  How are they treated and how are they caused?      Also I think she has poor nutrition and have recently noticed that her ears appear yellow compared to the rest of her pale body.  She is so pale that her veins can be easily seen in legs hands feet and arms.  I have tried vitamin supplements but we can only help when she is here.  Is this cause for concern or is she simply light skinned?  Her dentist reported that some people just have dark yellow adult teeth but considering she had bottle rot and 8 baby teeth had to be extracted I am concerned her adult teeth are coming in very dark compared to the baby teeth she has left.  And my last concern is her back.  There are two areas where it seems different than the overall slight curvature in scoliosis as it is not slight and only in two areas.  Any respons or reassurance or direction would be helpful.  Thank You\n\n",

    "content": "Dearest Angelina, As regards the lumps, I believe they need to be seen by a doctor. It doesn't have to be something serious, but someone has to have a look. Pallor is usually judged by the degree of pinkness of the palms and soles, as well as that of the inner sides of the lips and eyelids. You can simply use the colour of your own skin and mucous membranes in those areas as a standard for comparison (provided you are not anemic yourself?!). If you then think she is pale, then that warrants a complete blood count to exclude anemia. Visible veins is seen in light skinned persons. Your description of her teeth and back again suggest she needs a proper evaluation by a physician, and please check her percentiles.\n\n",

    "content": "After a drama situation the bio-mom took my step-daughter to the docter.  He ordered blood work for anemia and possibly other stuff that dad and I weren't informed about.  He expressed her back did not seem to have scoliosis but he was concerened about excessive hair on her lower back that could indicate a problem and ordered an MRI of her back to check spinal development.  He said that the lumps were reactive lymph nodes.  All the information I can find that has commonality between excessive hair growth and reactive lymph nodes and anemia has to do with tumors or leukemia.  Is there any positive news to be reassuring aobut these conditions before the blood work results are in?  This is extremely anxiety producing and any advice would be helpful. Thanks Angelina\n\n",

Reactive lymph nodes are lymph nodes that enlarge as a result of infection or repeated infections, indicating that a person's immune system is functioning well. Anemia could result from several causes, but the most common is a nutritional defciency in iron intake, which is probably the case here.\n\n",

Infection could not therefore reach your baby while you were pregnant. It would be wise to call your children's doctor to inform him/her.\n\n",

Anyhow, her symptoms were severe diarrhea, vomitting, lethargy, high fevers(104) which lasted 6 days and on the seventh day she broke out in a rash which was diagnosed as scarlet fever at the hospital. Nobody else in our home( I also have a 2 year old) came down with any of these symptoms and I am wondering now if scarlet fever can be caused by a foodbourne illness. I have read that it can be bacterial , and something about hemoytic bacteria , and something to do with ecoli, etctec. Just wondering if yu can help me understand this.  Thank You Very Kindly\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Scarlet fever follows infection by group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection. Usually, the sites of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal growth in scarlet fever are the tonsils and pharynx, but scarlet fever may also follow streptococcal infection of the skin and soft tissue, surgical wounds, or the uterus. Clinically, there is a sudden onset of fever associated with sore throat, headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, myalgias, and malaise. The characteristic rash appears 12-48 hours after onset of fever and resembles a sunburn with goose pimples. Scarlet fever is also known to be rare in children younger than 2 years.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, My name is Matt.  Im 14 yearsold (15 in august). Im 285 pounds 6 foot 1.  A little over a month ago I started developing slight pains all over my body. On my Right and left side, my right and left chest side, right above my belly button, also bellow it.  I went to my doctor and he said that I might have pleurisy.  The only problem is, I Rarely have pains when I take in deep breathes.  I took an xray 2 weeks ago it was perfect.  I went to the emergency room yesterday because I got sick of feeling the pain and it became very discomforting prior to that night.  I Have a slight pain right now under my right breast a bit towards my side.  I had a fever and Running nose when I visited my doctor but I took allegra and the running nose went away.  The fever wasnt even that high 1 deg. off normal temp (99f I think).  Also I sometimes get numbness in a few of my fingers and my wrist. I havent really been out a lot for this past month.  I feel like crap during the day Im tired but I cant sleep due to a rash I have that itch's me when I try to sleep (wich Is the only time it bothers me).  Also im not sure if this would help, I smoked marijuana everyday for 2 weeks prior to this discomfortness.  Im not sure if it could be from that since I asked a lot of my friends that do it almost everyday, they said they never had a problem like this.  I also have asthma, I used to smoke ciggerets a pack a day for 2 years but since this happend im afraid to start smoking again and I also have a bit more energy since I stoped.  These pains are out of the blue, they come on randomly but sometimes at night when I lay on my side I hear a sound like boiling water as it bubbles and is ready to overflow and spill out of the pot.  As for the rash they are sort of like little red pimples/dots that have a yellowish/greenish tip.  They only itch during the night mostly rarely do they itch during the day.  The rash is on both arms, back, chest and legs.  If there are any test I should run or anything I should talk to my doctor about I have an appointment with him on monday.  Thank you for your time and help.  Sincerely, Matt\n\n",

I do get burning feelings, but their only when the pain is in my right/left side of my chest, usually the burning is right where my heart is.  As for the rest of the pains, its a sharp pain very rarely does it hurt when I breathe in...  my doc said it could be pnemonia but Im not coughing at all, but the doctor gave my antibiots (Zithromax) when I started feeling Really tired wich was when this stuff first started.. Im guessing he was afraid it was walking pnemonia, at first I thought it was pleurisy because when I lay on my side I hear sounds like gergling at times... burping seems to help some, but Im still getting pain... I might have acid reflex or a disgestive problem, but I know there is something else wrong because the pain is so bad, especially if i bend or twist my torso   The rash is from either high insaline, eczama, or allergies... I go to a skin doctor next week.  I went to the cardiologist yesterday and I got a sonigram but they called it something else since it was for the heart.... I got another EKG and blood test... the ekg and sonigram were normal...  the cardiologist said it could be a inflamation because when she pressed down in the center of my chest it hurt really bad, the sonigram also hurt really bad.    They are not sure as to what it is but the cardiologist said its not my heart....  Thanks for your time   Matt.\n\n",

Today my 23 month old son was in his kiddie pool and i noticed that he was drinking the water at one point, then after a few times in and out i got up and looked and saw little bage colored floaters that i thought were from the grass but turned out to be from his diaper that had a small amount of stool, kind of on the diarrhea looking side. Anyways im not sure if he was drinking the water whilst there were afloat with him, but im gonna assume the worst that they were, and i started reading about hepatitus A, so im kinda worried, what should i do.......   P.S. It wasnt long till i noticed the 'floaters', so he maybe took a few drinks at most, and the 'floaters' were the size of like small fish food, just some extra info if it helps...?\n\n",

Unless he was already harbouring an infection and in that case he would be re-infecting himself by swallowing that water, then there is no need to worry. Just watch the diarrhea which you say he already has, and if it gets worse and he starts getting dehydrated, then take him immediately for evaluation.\n\n",

    "title": "16 mo old loosing weight, diarehha, & tempature for 1 1/",
    "content": "I have a 16 month old daughter that started having diarreha March 28th then fever started April 3rd by April 5th she was running 102.6 and the doctor put her in the hospital because she was very lathargic. Her WBC 27,000 ESR 83 chest x ray okay abdomen x ray okay nasal swab came back okay. They started her on IV antibiotics and she stayed in the hospital until April 9th. She had antibiotics every day and her white cells went down. They also did a tick bite test on her that was normal. She continued to run a fever but it became low grade so they let us leave the hospital and sent her home with 10 days of augmentin. She continued to have diarreha but the doctor thought it could be from the meds. 4 days after being off the augmentin she started running a fever again and still had diarreha. The doctor prescribed Alinia for the diarehha which was to be taken for 3 days 2 x's daily. on the third day she developed a rash so the dr said to discontinue the meds. Her fever started again and diarrhea was still there. They ran the wbc again and they were normal he sent us home and said lets check her agian in another week. Sorry she also had stool culture and urine culture while in the hospital that were normal and then another stool culuture after the hospital that was also normal. There have been so many appointments I may be getting them a little confused but at the last appointment on May 18th she had lost a pound and is still running a intermitent fever and having diarreha. The doctor was already concerned about her weight because she has not gained any since she was 8months old and she is 16 months but know she has lost a pound. At 8 months she weighed 20.8 and now she weighs 19.0. She is 30in tall.  He also checked for strip and that was normal. He also did a CHem 14 and her plattlets were high and her lymphocytes were 65% and ESR 28. He has even told us that he did not know what could be wrong with her and was not sure what to do next. He said he was not sure what kind of specialist to send her to but picked a pediatric GI but it will be at least a month before they can get her in. Her doctor is a general practioner. Because of our insurance we are at the mercy of our dr and the specialist. The only way I could get something done faster is to take her to the emergency room but I am afraid they would not realize the importance of her condition since she is stable at this point. The doctor made the comment that she does not look bad and she will smile a little and I am like I do not want to wait until she looks like she is dying before something is done. I am a mother of 3 kids aged 10, 8, and 16 months. So this is not me being a nervous first time mother her behavior and health is not normal. Also I know why she is not gaining weight she will not eat. I am still breastfeeding her, I stopped nursing her during the day to try to wean her per the doctors idea that maybe that would make her better but since she lost weight I started nursing her whenever she wants. Sometimes she does not even want to nurse. I do not know what to think but I am very worried please let me know what you think. Thank You!!!\n\n",

After she was born and we brought her home she seemed to have a snotty nose a lot but that was the only symptom and my mother thought that maybe it was our wood stove so we did not think much about it. Other than that she had a few other times I took her to the doctor but was always told that it was just a cold and it would need to just run its course and she always got better. Nothing really significant. I have not noticed any hairloss, but she has always had problems with her skin. She scratches a lot like she itches and causes sores or a rash but this is usually in the diaper area on her lower back. She has had watery stools and she has had some that have some consistency to them some are foul smelling some are not so bad. Since I posted this she was admitted to the hospital on Saturday night the 21st and stayed until tuesday. They ran a lot of blood test I am not even sure what all tests they ran  but they did an HIV test which was negative and a cystic fibrosis test which was negative. When they admitted her the wbc was 28,000. They found a small spot on her lung that the ER doctor said was pnemonia but the drs that saw her after she was admitted did not want to call it pnemonia. They discharged us without a diagnosis and did not give her any antibiotics (which I was fine with) I agree with them that we need to see how she does without antibiotics confusing things. They want us to take her to a Pediatric GI I have made the appointment but it will be June 21st before they can see her. I just hope I can keep her from getting very sick or losing anymore till then. Any advice would be great!!\n\n",

I do have a suggestion though, and that is to give her supplemental zinc. Sometimes, the diarrhea can start because of an infection and then after the infection is treated, it will go on because of zinc deficiency.\n\n",

Her platelets have been high for 2months but on this last CBC they were really high 771,000, wbc 21,700 and ESR 45. So now the dr has ordered a blood smear but we have to wait 4-5 days for the results of it. She ran a fever of 100.7 to 101.7 for 7 days straight but for the last 2 days she has been fever free but that is how it seems to work she will run a fever and then it goes away for couple of days and then it is back. She has this rash that started when she went into the hospital on 5-21-05 and it is still around it is red dots that pop up anywhere on her body. At first they thought it was heat rash but it is lasting too long for that  but they have not diagnosed it yet. Any thoughts would be great.\n\n",

This is the tube that carries urine and semen through the penis and forms the opening at the end of the penis. Chemical irritation caused by soaps, lotions, and colognes can cause temporary pain with urination. It could also result from infection. He should drink plenty of fluids. He may take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (such as Motrin or Advil) and acetaminophen (for example, Tylenol) for pain control. Sitz baths can help with the burning associated with chemical irritant urethritis.  To take a sitz bath, fill the tub with 6-8 inches of warm water, just enough to cover the genitals when sitting in the tub.  Try these a few times a day.  Don't use soap or anything else in the bathtub that may irritate already sore areas. In case of infection, he will need antibiotics.\n\n",

    "content": "My 18mo daughter has been having fevers of 101-104 (lasting 24- 48 hours) at least 2 times a week for about 3 months. Each time I have her ears and throat checked, only to be told that it is probably just a virus. During the fevers, she is lethargic and irritable with no appetitie, generally miserable.   She was checked last week for a UTI. They put a bag on her and said it came back positive in the office test w/ blood and lucolites (?). When they cultured it, however, it came back negative. Today, I finally insisted on a complete blood workup and was told that everything was in the normal range except for her segmented white blood cell count was slightly elevated and her Sed rate and C-reactive proteins were both mildy elevated (a \"5\" (?) on one of them).  They also did a strep test (neg) and chest x-ray (clear) and another urine sample for UTI (positive in office--awaiting culture).  As an aside, she also has bad allergies (pollen, etc) and a constant clear runny nose and eczema (cleared up right now). She is not in daycare and stays home with me most days.   Any idea what could be causing the fevers if not a UTI? Any avenues I could suggest that my physician look into?  Let me know if you need more info...Thanks so much!\n\n",

    "content": "Well, if the urine culture came back negative again, this is suggestive of 'viral cystitis', where a viral infection is causing the UTI, and in that case, bacterial cultures would come back negative. I agree that also viral illnesses anywhere in her body could result in a similar picture.\n\n",

    "title": "14 year old abdominal pain/pressure",
    "content": "Hello,          I am a 14 year old girl who about three weeks ago started experiencing moderate pain in my right side of my abdomin as well as pain on my left side of my abdomin, and I would also get severe pain across my whole lower abdomin. All are still occurant, but now I keep feeling pressure in the my rib area that can hurt pretty bad and has woken me up att night and put me close to tears. I have no idea what might be causing this, but it is not getting better. Last night I also noticed that my left ribs are protruding a fair amount more than my right ribs, and just the night before I was turning and I heard a wierd sound that sounded like me breathing but different. At first I thought it was infact just that, me breathing wierd, but in the morning I discovered that when I rotate my chest left to right and right to left I could still hear it and I was holding my breath. It does not hurt, but it sounds like air is being pushed out of my lungs unvoluntarily. This is still a problem to this day as well as all of the other problems I have mentioned. My lower back is also hurting which I brought to the attention of my pediatrician who ordered an x-ray of my lower back and the results of it were fine. Also there are some weird bumps in my groin (I think that is what you call it) area that are becoming more apparent and feel hard, and are increasing in number. I have been home from school yesterday and today because I have not been feeling well because of naseua, feeling hot, tired, the chest pain and pressure, and just generally not feeling well. However, I had no fever.          There are really no diseases in my family, except that my mom has polysistic  kidney disease and is now on dialysis awaiting a transplant. My mom scheduled me for an ultrasound for May 10th (tuesday) to see if I have kidney disease and if that is what is causing this. Any thoughts on what might be causing this would be greatly appriciated, as well as any thoughts on how to figure out what this is would be great too.                                          Thankyou\n\n",

    "content": "I did have the ultrasound done and I have kidney disease. So I think that explains alot, but I don't know how it relates to everything. I understand that the pain in my side is caused by my cists bursting or something, but I don't see how it causes pain and pressure on the upper part of my chest by my ribs and such. I am also still in the dark about those bumpsI have, and that weird sound when I twist or move my chest even so slightly. However, if it is related to my kidney disease I guess it is just something I will have to get used to. If you have any info on anything I mentioned it would be greatly appreciated.                                              Thanks Again\n\n",

    "content": "Hi again,      My mom probably has the ultrasound report, but i haven't seen it. But the technician told my mom when I had left the room that it looked likle I had cysts on both my kidneys, and then she left the room to give the pictures to a doctor and came back and told us we could leave. We didn't see or talk to anyone besides the technician who did the ultrasound. Whan I lloked at the screen during the ultrasound it looked like I had abut 4 black hole things and my mom said that i had a few cysts on one kidney and on the other she said I had one  large. Also my kidenyes were normal size for my age the only thing big was the cysts.Thats what the tech said anyway. As for my lower back pain it isn't getting any better. I have been taking weeks off of gymnastics because the simplist things I was really good at before I can barely do anymore because they hurt so much. There was this one move that I was so pleased with and could do absolutley perfectly no pain no discomfort, but now I can't even do it because I get severe pain when I try and in addition look incredibly stupid since i was once good at them. However, I got no ingury beforemy back pain started occuring. Last night I went to gymnastics and my lower back was hurting already and when i got home my back was hurting even when i stood up and i think it was slightly swollen, but now it hurts when i press on my lower back and i have and have had trouble lying down because it hurts to lay back. The bumps are still there and bigger. And i get a stining pain where the bigger one is during the day and sometimes if I press on the area surrounding it , but it doesn't hurt when i press on the lump itself, it just feels hard. I also had more chest (by upper ribs/ mid ribs) and abdomen right side pain /pressure. I have been noticing that something inside my lower adomen swells sometimes i don't know what it would be but the swelling can be on the left, right, or both sides. I had my mom feel this a while ago (1/2 months) and she said she could feel that there was a difference betwen how my right side felt compared to my left. This swelling occurs at random, but happens at min once a week, and will lat acouple days.  added note: It has been a few days since i wrote this but good news my back no longer hurts when i press on it but it is still painful. I also thought i should mention that for the past few weeks my knee has been bothering and the lasst couple days its been worse and it was hurting when i walked, but the pain comes and goes, and i norice that it only hurts in the late afternnooon and evening. My arms around the elbow have also been hurting for a few months especially when I exercise. I don't like this because when I am at gymnastics my arms will hurt and I am afraid when i do backhand springs my arms will give out. Now i can only do a limited amount of backhand springs because my arms ache so bad.  Thanks again\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for your reply!  He has a very colorful history with prescribed drugs already.  We have thought at one time that he was colicky also. But when he received his 2 month shots he developed croup and a rash.  So we asumed the rush was due to the laudry soap and switich to dreft.  They put him on albutol, predisolone, augmitin for the croup.  He has had three episodes of the breathing problems.  That's when the ear infections started.  Just four weeks ago they had him on albutol, predisolone, zantac (acid reflux), zrytec (allergies), and antibotic.  I'm no doctor but that was to much!   So we stopped everthing but the breathing treatment to as needed and switched him to soy based formula.  That has taking care of the breathing problems, rash, and the colic.  We are now two weeks without ear infections.  But we just had his 4 month shots Wednesday.  He has been running a 102.1 temp since and Sunday started to throw up, broke out in a rash, stop eatting altogether, and had dirrahera.  I have managed to get some pedialyte down him.  this poor child has not been well since his has been born.  He is still not sleeping.  The answers to your questions are as following:  He is on Enfmil soy based formula  I feed him sitting up ( Our first child had and out grew severe acid refluix)   He burps easier now that he is on the soy formula.  His bowls were getting regular ( before the dirrahera)  And he stop pulling his knees up to his chest.  Thank you  Kschmelzle\n\n",

You can do the following if you haven't already done them: You can try and strengthen the posterior muscles of your legs (calf muscles and hamstrings) by gentle stretching exercise. Shoes with shock absorption should be used.  Downhill running can aggravate this problem and should be avoided as well as running on conrete and hard ground. Finally, some anti-inflammatory drugs can be very useful, but you shouldn't abuse them. Over-the-counter drugs, such as Tylenol, Panadol, Motrin or Ibuprofen can be used 2-3 times a day.\n\n",

He does not add tobacco to his joint.  #2) Yesterday, our 6 month old daughter started crying in her sleep. My husband (after smoking a joint) went in her room to see her. He smelt like pot (on his breath and clothes) is this dangerous to her? He doesn't think so because there is no second-hand smoke and it is simply 'an odor' he says. Can the odor harm her?

Today topped them all when she not only had one of her horrible headaches, along with a fever, but her right hand and lower arm went numb!!  I rushed her to the ER where they did blood work, urinealysis, and a catscan all which came back normal. They did give her Motrin while we were there, which took her fever down and the headache away, however her hand and lower arm continued to go numb. She was sent home, and the numbness is continuing about every 1/2 hour. Her left leg also has done it once to her. Her cheeks get EXTREMLY flushed when a head ache comes on. I am at wits end, and any advice would be wonderful. I am following up with her peds tomorrow, but in the mean time I am pulling my hair out with worry!!!!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Dr., Seven years ago my now nine year old son had minor surgery to remove what I was told was a blood clot on his wrist.  During the healing process, the middle stich broke.(there were only three stiches). I  Was very displeased with the Pediatrician at the time,and wanted to avoid going back to see him about the broken stich.  The incision is about an inch long.  I kept the area clean and dry as I was told, But instead of having  the wound re-stiched, I put a butterfly bandage on it to hold it closed. It seemed to heal nicely at first. Now that my son has grown a bit, he often has bleeding just under the surface of the skin, over the area where the stich broke.The blood under the skin looks like a clump of tiny dark red blisters. My son says that it is not tender or painful. Should I be concerned about this? What do you suggest?   Thankyou for your time,  Ristenk\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Ristenk, I'm not really sure. It could be related to the original blood clot that required surgery, where there is an occasional bleeder or fragile vessels.  It could also be due to the poor wound healing where the blood vessels have become more superficial and prone to trauma. Anyhow, so long as you think this beeding is not severe and isn't forming a clot again, I don't believe it's serious.  You can bring it up the next time you go for a routine check up. Until then, just avoid trauma to that area.\n\n",

It's very common for children to go back to what they feel most comfortable with, long after they seem to have learnt and established a habit.  Could be out of fear or stress or even a sort of retaliation, but when they start doing that, it's important to just back off. May be he needs more time.

    "title": "12 year old Daughter with pains in her legs",
    "content": "Hi,        Two years ago last November my daughter had a really bad virus which she was unable to fight off.  It took almost 4 months on and off of Antibiotics before she was finally well.  Since then she periodically complained of leg and joint pain, plus a reoccuring red and inflamed throat ( although it never got infected ) I was always told that there was nothing to worry about and that it was just growing pains.  Well 2 years on and I am at my wits end with worry.  These past six months she has been steadily getting worse with the pain especially in her thighs, although her knees and feet occasionally hurt too.  Every bone in her body seems to crack and creak with it sometimes causing pain as well.   I have to frequently write notes to the school excusing her from P.E. which seems to aggrivate her condition and has often come home from school limping and crying.                 She has now been off school for almost a week as its too painful for her to walk there or manage the stairs as the kids jostle her and she loses her balance.  She has had blood tests done at the doctors but they have all come back negative.  I took her to the doctors again today as i cant keep her off school indefinately but neither can I force her when she is crying and in pain, I just don't know what to do.   The doctor this time examined her legs throughily and has told me that my daughter has weakness and wasting of the muscles of both thighs and is going to refer her to a Pediatriction.  This is something that I was told could not be faked. The doctor looked concerned and said there were a couple of illness that could cause this wastage of her legs but wouldnt tell me what she suspected.  It might take months to get an appointment with a Pediatric doctor and in the meantime I don't know what to do for best.  Does anyone know what this might be or have an ideas of how I may treat her? I would be grateful for any advice. Thanks in advance Linny\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Linny, From what you've described, I believe she could be suffering either some inflammation of the nerves, known as 'peripheral neuropathy', or some muscle disease, known as 'myopathy', both of which have several causes.  It would be difficult to tell what type she has exactly until a paediatrician, preferably a paediatric neurologist examines her. Meanwhile, there are a few things that can be done, which may be helpful. She will certainly need physical therapy, so we can start there.  Routine exercise within her capability is encouraged; muscle stretching is very beneficial. Special shoes with good ankle support may be needed. Obesity should be avoided because it makes walking more difficult. Pain control is essential and simple analgesics could be given: Ibuprofen (Motrin, Ibuprin) The recommended dose for her age would be: 200-400 mg PO q4-6h while symptoms persist; not to exceed 3.2 g/d  Acetaminophen (Tylenol, panadol)  The recommended dose for her age would be: 325-650 mg PO q4h; not to exceed 5 doses in 24 h.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Dr. Heba Ismail,                                  Many thanks for your response to my posting.  My daughter has been prescribed Ibuprofen which she takes along side Paracetamol which I believe is like panadol which she tollerates quite well, although so far after 2 weeks it is not helping the pain when she is walking.  Luckily we do not have stairs in our home as stairs are horendous for her to attempt. She says she has to almost will her legs to move in order to get up them and the pain is so bad her legs actually sweat with the effort, although coming down seems to be a little easier.           I have been in touch with her school as many of her classes mean walking up and down large numbers of stairs and they have assured me that if she cannot manage them then she can do her lessons downstairs.  P.E is another factor that causes extreme problems so she is being excused that until futher notice.  Thank you for the tip about exercise as it didnt occur to me that gentle stretching might actually benifit her so I have been looking to buy a tape of gentle stretching exercises she can attempt to try.                 In the past when I mentioned to my doctor about the pains in her legs, I also mentioned that there is a family history of Arthritis, Rheumatism, OsteoArthritis but he told me not to be rediculous that it doesnt run in families and was definatly growing pains.                With this new doctor who  told me after doing manual diagnostics on her legs that her thigh muscles were weak and that she could feel wastage, I didnt tell her the family history as I didnt want the same thing to happen.  Should I mention this when she eventually gets her appointment through with the Pediatritian? Once again I thank you for your reply. Kind Regards Linny.\n\n",

As for hepatitis C infection, if proven, it could seriously affect the liver, although very slowly, and is also infectious, through contact with body secretions or blood. If the child has congenital syphilis and the maternal status is unknown, the child will need to be treated as if infected, untill lab follow up proves whether she is infected or was just carrying her mother's antibodies.\n\n",

    "content": "Can anyone please advise me, I'm a desperate mum with a 25 year old son in hospital. He's never been ill before. 2 weeks ago he experienced severe abdominal pain and went to A&E. They gave him tests and sent him home saying could be trapped wind and would clear up. Next day it was worse and had travelled to his back. His GP sent him back to the hospital, they gave him various tests and told him to take Gaviscon and sent him home.  That evening he collapsed with pain and I took him to my local hospital. He was put on morphine and started a series of tests.  That was two weeks ago. Since then he has developed numbness all over the body, pins & needles from feet to his face, itching and severe nausea. (The nausea seems to be subsiding). He is unable to eat and cannot sit up or walk without fainting. He has severe weakness in his body. He is unable to pass urine and now has a catheter.  He seems to want to sleep most of the time when the pain allows.  The Consultants are absolutely baffled, he has had most tests except for Neurology - which he is currently awaiting.  Can anyone offer any sort of advice, specialist contacts, anything.\n\n",

If this is not occurred then I would find it unlikely to be the cause. For example, there is a rash, roseola, caused by a virus,  that usually affects children between the ages of 6 months and 3 years, that begins with a high fever, lasting about 3 days and upon subsidence a red rash appears on the neck and or trunk lasting a few hours up to 2-3 days. Of course whether or not this is the cause it would still warrant an evaluation by the physician. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "content": "Dear mornenstar, Your daughter probably has vaginitis. If infection is suspected, by the presence of any foul smelling, abnormallly coloured vaginal discharge, and fever, well, a vaginal culture is needed, in order to prescribe her an appropraite antibiotic. Nevertheless, most cases do not have a specific cause and treatment is then focused on improved hygiene, hand washing, and sitz baths. She should sit in warm water for 10-15 minutes once or twice a day. Bland soap can be used; however, the vulva should not be scrubbed. Afterwards, gently pat dry the vulvar region or allow it to air-dry. Clothes should be washed in a mild detergent with no rinse or dryer additives.  Small amounts of ointment such as Vaseline can be used to protect the vulvar skin, if affected.\n\n",

There's nothing to worry about really. Cancer is almost out of the question, if that's what you're thinking. And since you haven't mentioned the presence of fever, redness or inflammation of her breast, then I assume it's not an abscess either. This is probably just a benign overgrowth of breast tissue. But do go see your doctor tomorrow, someone has to have a close look, at least to document the lump size and folow up if it's growing or not.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Jacky,  Molloscum contagiosum is a very common childhood viral infection that causes small, harmless growths on the skin. It is contagious and can be spread by touching the growths. There are some things you can do to prevent further spread on your son or to others. Make sure he does not pick or scratch the Molloscum, as this can release the virus and cause spread on the body. He should also wash his hands frequently, particularly if he is picking at the bumps. Your son should not share towels or clothing with other children and it can be spread through swimming. This virus will eventually go away by itself but it could take months or years. Have you thought about having them removed by a doctor? You could also get over-the-counter wart remover and put it on at night, this may get rid of them quickly. Instead of covering practically his whole body, can you just put band aids over the MCV\u2019s? A Dermatologist may have a prescription medication he can recommend for the little guy and you may also be able to get literature on the virus to support allowing him to swim.\n\n",

Our doctor was concerned that there may be a different problem which has caused the diabetes so he ordered blood tests and x-rays of my son's wrists.  He mentioned very briefly something called Shaukmans Syndrome.  I probably have misspelt it but I was hoping somebody could shed some light on what is being investigated. Thank you. Carol.\n\n",

Patients with SDS typically present with diarrhea, short stature, weight loss, and dry skin. Recurrent bacterial infections, anemia and easy bruising may be the presenting picture in case of bone marrow affection. Patients with SDS rarely develop diabetes mellitus. Ultrasonographic findings of the pancreas of an individual with SDS show a pancreas of normal size.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  My 9 year old son has what I suspect may be mumps. Monday night he showed me that the gland behind/under his left ear was swollen and sore. Today, Wednesday, it's now very swollen, and the one on the right is just a bit swollen. The left one is painful when touched. His tonsils are also quite swollen, and have white spots. He has no fever.   Without health insurance, I really can't take him in to the doctor unless I really have to. So far, Tylenol Jr. has done alright at alleviating the pain.   Since I'm sure you're wondering, yes, he was vaccinated. He got one dose of the MMR, when he was 6 years old.   I remember having the mumps when I was young, (for me, it was not very painful, didn't even go to the doctor -- I was the youngest of 6 kids and my mom knew what it was)  except that I had to miss school....and my son's on spring break this week! So, I'm inclined to not worry about it, just help him be more comfortable and wait it out.   Is it likely to be the mumps? If so, is there anything other than the Tylenol that would help him feel better? And how long should I expect it to take before the swelling is on it's way down? If not mumps, then what???   Thanks,  Karen\n\n",

    "content": "Dear jrthames, Well it depends because it could be a number of things. It could be a collection of fluid which has leaked from the abdomen, known as a 'hydrocele', and results from a congenital defect allowing this leakage. If persistent beyond the first year of life, it usually needs surgical correction. It could also be a 'hernia', and in that case, you would notice that it is not constantly there, and becomes more apparent with crying or coughing. That is if it is not 'strangulated' or 'obstructed', in which case, it would be hard, red and tender. The swelling could also be the result of a torsion of the testicle, and again that would appear tender and red and the pain would be unbearable. I assume from your description and the way you accidentaly noticed it, it would be either a hydrocele or a 'reducable' hernia. In any case, you must consult with a pediatric surgeon to have a good look at it.\n\n",

    "content": "My 8 mo old daughter has had 2 endoscopies (w/ biopsies) which both showed elevated eosinophils in the stomach (lamina propria)... the first biopsy was in November, the second in February- both showed the same number of eosinophils. She has been on Neocate only since January and while she finally gained weight on Neocate that was the only difference. She still is very unsettled, very bothered, sucking her fingers all the time, spitting up alot, overall she is not well and it has taken a serious toll on everyone in this house.  My problem is our pedi GI insists it's allergy, yet it makes no sense to me why she didn't respond (symptomatically) to Neocate. So, we tried several things at his request: sugar water (he thought she just had learned behavior of being in pain), Singulair (for its mast stabilizing effects) and now we just finished steroids. She is no better. I bet if he scoped her today she would still have eosinophils.  What is going on? I am so worn out from trying to convince doctors something is wrong. It has been 8 months and still we have no diagnosis and no idea what's going on with  her. Will she outgrow this? What else could cause persistent eosinophillia? He keeps saying her case is mild (she has somewhere around 19-20 eos per hpf) and makes me think we should just wait it out. But what does that mean? She is miserable. She is bothered. We don't know what to do anymore. We have just carried her through the house as she's cried. Whatever is wrong with her seems to flare up and flare back down. She has MANY bad days but is able to have some good days and good times. Overall, though, she has been uncomfortable for most of her life.  I just don't know what to do anymore. I don't know what else could be going on. I feel like they're missing something but I don't know what. What else should be done? We are at our wit's end and are desperate for help. Please, can someone help us? Our pedi GI said the next step will be Amitryptylline (for its central analgesic effect- incidentally, my husband and I are both pharmacists and think he's just full of it- we feel like he's just trying to buy some time and keep us at a distance by medicating her with random meds that won't work)  Please help.\n\n",

How about a CBC and stool analysis? Any family history of allergies? Does certain food make her worse? We need to be exclude the possibilty of any misdiagnosis.\n\n",

    "content": "It started with extreme irritability as a newborn but was not colic (my first daughter had colic so we know all about that unfortunately)... it was entirely centered around digestion... she refused to nurse, many times screamed at the sight of the breast, went 6, 8 sometimes 10 hours without nursing. Our pedi said it was colic, we suspected reflux, namely silent/hidden reflux as her symptoms seemed to fit it the best. We referred ourselves to a pedi GI who said she was a classic case for silent reflux, yet she did not respond to MANY meds and at high doses. That's when I started wondering if the reflux were secondary to another problem. After much research I happened upon eosinophilic disorders and was convinced that's what it was. I tried elimination diets but didn't find they greatly helped, nothing consistent anyways. Finally I asked for her to be 'scoped' and they did so in November BUT informed us she had no signs of eosinophils, no sign of allergy and no reason for me to quit nursing. I asked all the right questions, I was sure they were mistaken but finally I accepted it and continued to nurse for 2 more months. What I didn't know was that the doctor who read the results made an error and missed the fact that she had 'prominent lamina propria eosinophils'... why we were misinformed, how the error happened I will never know but in those two months Katherine stopped gaining weight, had diarrhea 5 or more times a day and cried for most of those days.  Finally we learned of the error (beginning of Jan.) and stopped nursing and started Neocate. She gained weight immediately but was still bothered. We had another endoscopy/biopsy last month which showed the same number of eosinophils as she had in November which is odd because generally the eos die within a week or so of the suspected allergen being removed. We just finished up a 3 week course of steroids but she is still bothered. At this point his new theory is that if she is still bothered after steroids then eosinophils aren't her problem (because theoretically they should've been wiped out by the steroids) but why does she still have them? He doesn't know. He said maybe her problem started out as allergy but developed into some form of IBS??  Anyways, for tests.... she had a CBC and all was normal except she was borderline anemic. Also, she had an absolute eosinophil count which was normal. She had a stool test to test for fat percentage which was normal. She has also had a urine culture to rule out UTI. She had another stool test to rule out viral infection (early on).   I would appreciate any advice or input you can give.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear katiesmom, Regretfully, there are no evidence-based studies of the treatment of patients with eosinophilic gastroenteritis. Treatment decisions depend on experience gained from observations linking causative entities, principal clinical manifestations, and anticipated natural history of the disease. Elimination of foods and the use of elemental diets, corticosteroids, and mast cell inhibitors (eg, cromolyn sodium, ketotifen), alone or in combination, all have their place, depending on the age of the patient, organ involved, clinical presentation, and clinical urgency. Patients with eosinophilic gastroenteritis generally respond well to corticosteroids but relapses are common. Patients with relapsing disease are usually placed on long-term low-dose prednisone or immunosuppressive therapy. Reports of favorable responses to new leukotriene inhibitors in patients with eosinophilic gastroenteritis are encouraging. Occult parasitism remains an elusive and unrecognized cause of an unknown number of cases, suggesting that empiric antihelminthic therapy should be tried in some patients.  I agree with your doctor that with the eosinophil count she has, her condition is mild, but it is puzzling that she is not responding so well to treatment. I suggest you consider and discuss with your doctor the possibilty of prolonging the steroid therapy, as well as considering an antihelminthic therapy. Even though her age is not quite prone to parasitic infestations, you may as well give the therapy to eliminate that possibility altogether.\n\n",

The severe pain goes away after a few minutes..but lingers as mild-moderate pain on and off throughout the day.  My ped. prescribed zantac.  I am not convinced.   Her symptoms now have changed a bit. they are tenderness in upper right abdomen, itchy torso, light prown spots on arms, stomach, and back. I also notice that her stools are very sticky--like they stick to the toilet bowl and do not slide down the drain---this happens in all toilets, not just ours.  This does not seem normal, especially since I have seen these brown spots.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello my name is Amy and I have a few concerns about my 10 yr old girl. My ex got custody of her in Oct. and she has gained 20lbs in less than a year and today she has strep throat, and she has been hospitalized for guenonephritis(kidney problem?) in the past and she always has real rosy cheeks all the time. She lives 4 hrs away from me now and I am wondering why she has gained so much weight in such a short period of time.....She gained all of this weight while visiting last summer and going to live in Ohio with dad in October 2005. So she has gained all of this weight in about 7 months. What should I be concerned about with all of the information I have given? Today her father said she is on antibiotics and I understand that.....for the strep..AND also he said she was taking steroids...WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? I have told my ex to keep an eye on her urine samples because she has had protein in her urine in the past and I do know that it is connected to her kidney problems she has had and that strep can bring about kidney problems. What can you tell me about the weight gain and the rosy cheeks and the steroids? Any advice is welcomed.......I would love your input! Thanks everyone!\n\n",

It includes many health hazards as:  growth of facial hair, male-pattern baldness, changes in or cessation of the menstrual cycle, enlargement of the clitoris, deepened voice.  I can directly say that the weight gaining is becuase of the Steroid use. My advice is to not use steroids on a child.\n\n",

THANKS...I just wanted to point out that her rapid weight gain and her rosy cheeks happened before she got steroids..my ex said she is on steroids and antibiotics just on Friday and he won custody of her on Oct 31 2005.......the weight gain was during his 3 months of visiting him before he won custody and she has gained even more weight from OCT 2005 until now. I AM SORRY TO CONFUSE YOU. I live in PA and Cassidy my 10 yr old lives in Toledo Ohio so just this past week my ex told me she got strep and I told him to watch out for her kidneys problems or protein in her urine....ANYWAYS I have cared for Cassidy her whole life so I know her history---Back in summer 2003 she went to the ER cause she was peeing brown red and then they admitted her in PA(where Cassidy lived with me) and they told me she had glomonephritis(not spelled right) and also gave me some streptowhatever word---she was in hospital for 1-2 days and then after that her pediatrcian kept track of her her urine..THEN in Oct 2005 she got strep and I told the ER to check her urine because of what happened in 2003 summer....she had protein in her urine and not long after that I had to turn her over to my ex so she went to live with him in Toledo Ohio. SO NOW just a couple days ago my ex called and said she has strep throat and I told him to keep an eye on her because of her history...She has some Dr she JUST MEET on Friday who put her on steroids and antibiotics....I am just worried what is going to happen to her after this strep because it has happened before and I hope their NEW dr in Ohio got ALL of her records because they don't know anything about her yet. Im sorry for carrying on I just wanted to explain the whole history of Cassidy.......SO THE WEIGHT GAIN AND ROSY CHEEKS ARE MY CONCERN NOW------------Could it be something else like diabetes or something...WHAT ARE THE POSSIBILITIES? I AM NOT LOOKING FOR ONE THING---JUST POSSIBILITIES GOING BY HER SYMPTOMS..........THANK YOU SO MUCH...IM NEW AT THIS FORUM................AMY ......... THE HERE WAS ANOTHER RESPONSE FROM SOMEONE ON HERE ABOUT THE STEROIDS................................................ Hi MomOf4,  I can understand your concern about the strep. The use of steroids is usually to reduce inflammation etc. However, has the reason for the glomerulonephritis been investigated? That's my concern. Has there been any kidney function studies etc. done?  Sincerely,  Rntdj  THANK YOU Dean M. Mitchell FOR YOUR REPLY\n\n",

If this is the case than her Montgomery's Tubercles or Glands may be waking up.

The other thought is if she is starting to develop and she isn't in a bra yet but her areola is starting to get sensitive maybe it was cold and became raw from rubbing or was wet from sweating during play.

    "title": "Urgent RSV question!",
    "content": "I am a foster parent with a one year old boy who was diagnosed and hospitalized with RSV last week. In the morning of the day he was diagnosed with it he had a clear runny nose and a small cough. I called his caseworker and told her that I felt he was getting a cold and that maybe he shouldn't go on the visit he was supposed to go on with his parents that afternoon. It was to be his first unsupervised visit. She told me that as long as he wasn't \"knocking on death's door\", he needed to go as they needed to know how to handle a sick baby. This is their 5th child and one of the children, not him, has asthma and special needs.  Anyway, he was gone a total of 4 hours. When he returned, I could audibly hear that he was in trouble when the aide opened the car door. He was whistling with each exhale and his tummy looking like it was struggling for him to get air. I commented that he didn't sound so good and the aide just said he slept all the way home, as though that meant he was comfortable. I put him immediately into my car and took him to urgent care where he was given 3 bretahing treatments with oxygen in between before they sent us to the hospital as they could not get his oxygen up out of the low 80's.   The social worker called me the next morning and I expresed my frustration that his condition was so bad when he got home. She blamed me for sending a sick child on a visit! Next, she told indicated that he probably didn't develop the more serious symptoms until he got home and they probably never saw any.  I realize that you are probably limited in what you can say and you don't know me or my situation, but I just want to know, in your opinion, if his breathing distress could have developed on the 20 minute ride home or if he had to be showing some signs of distress during those 4 hours? Also, he is still on breathing treatments at home and I'm wondering if this is asthma that he will have long term or if it's just related to the RSV and will go away when he gets over the virus?  Thank you so much for the opportunity to ask these questions!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear mrbeansmom, RSV usually begins by affection of the nose and throat, as you've described, then moves on rapidly over 1-2 days to cause inflammation of the small airways of the lungs. So it's very unlikely he would be short of breath and whistling within 20 minutes. He must have been showing signs of distress earlier that day, even mild signs.  RSV infection has a tendency for recurrence and children hospitalized for RSV disease during infancy have been shown to have abnormal pulmonary function tests and/or increased episodes of wheezing up to 10 years later. Whether RSV itself plays an active role in this or is just a marker for children at risk for asthma remains controversial. .\n\n",

    "title": "TWINS with rheumatic fever??",
    "content": "I have 4 year old twins who had strep tests done over a week ago.  They both were postive.   I was told Andrews was much worse than Nicholas.  Both were put on Amoxicillin.  Same day Andrew broke out with a rash, I called the doctor they said it was Scarlet Fever.  Couple days went by his rash went away.  His rash came before the medicine was started.  A week into the medicine Nicholas develops a rash, I take him in they say it was an allergic reaction to the meds and to stop them.  I was not gave another medicine for the boys but was told to stop it on both of them.  The day before Nicholas broke out with a rash he was up all night crying over his knees hurting him.  He was to the point that we were carrying him from room to room because of the pain.  Blood was drawn on Nicholas and I was told all Blood test came back normal except the arthrits test.  We now have to take him to a specialist for that.  BUT... Now his twin brother (Andrew) is experiencing the same problem with his legs hurting him and can't seem to walk.  They both have continued to run fevers but only in the late evening and through the night.  Mind you in the meantime Nicholas legs felt better and he is walking again but had another episode 2 days after going to the doctor.  I know this is not the other child just want the attention he is truely hurting in pain.  There has been a weight loss in both children and very tired all the time.  I know Nicholas has lost at least 5 pounds in the last 3 weeks, not sure what Andrew has lost.  Now they have a cough that has developed and runny nose.  I have been to the doctor office 3 times in one week, but seem to get a differant doctor or the new one on staff (just out of school).  Could this be a missed diagnose or just several things hitting at once making me think it is rheumatic fever? There have been other people in my family that has had rheumatic fever before.  Is this also heritary.  I have also been told that it could just be growing pains but no way of knowing for sure.  The doctor is not taking into consideration all of the symptoms.  What else can I ask to be done to know for sure and put my mind at ease?  I have never been this worried about my kids being sick, this is the first time I have ever seeked help from a posting site for medical issues... PLEASE HELP MY TWO BOYS!   VERY WORRIED MOTHER\n\n",

    "content": "Dearest Penny, Diagnosis of rheumatic fever is not difficult, and despite that, it is commonly overdiagnosed! Now we need to have a few questions answered specifically: First, we need a description of the arthritis. Is it just hurting, or do the joints actually become swollen, red, hot and tender? Also, does it affect the big joints, like the knees and elbows, or is there affection of other smaller joints? As regards the rash, Andrew's, did it appear as pink to red rings or wavy lines raised above the surface? Can you describe their distribution? Do either of  your kids have chest pain, shortness of breath or palpitations? Are there any abnormal involuntary movements? Do you feel any small hard lumps under the skin? Your answers to these questions will guide us a lot.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear dwtsmom, Why did your child develop hydronephrosis in the first place, and what type of surgery was done? Depending on the answer to these two questions, you are usually instructed on how to take care of your child. What would be most serious is for your child to develop kidney failure, and for this you should keep your eyes wide open. Warning signs include: change in energy level or strength, puffiness or swelling in the legs, around the eyes or in other parts of the body, shortness of breath, nausea or vomiting, light-headedness, severe bone or joint pain and easy bruisability.  If there are no signs of that,and if your child has normal kidney function tests, then he can lead a normal life.\n\n",

The bump has been there for about three weeks and i figured it would just go away but it hasn't yet. The pain is getting worse. At first, it was just the bump that hurt but now my entire ear hurts. Is this something i should have checked out or will it eventually just go away? thanks in advance.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello my name is Amy and I have a few concerns about my 10 yr old girl.  My ex got custody of her in Oct. and she has gained 20lbs in less than a year and today she has strep throat, and she has been hospitalized for guenonephritis(kidney problem?) and she always has real rosy cheeks all the time.  She lives 4 hrs away from me and I am wondering why she has gained so much weight in such a short period of time.....She gained all of this weight while visiting last summer and going to live in Ohio in October.  So she has gained all of this weight in about 7 months. What should I be concerned about with all of the information I have given?  Today her father said she is on antibiotics and I understand that.....for the strep..AND also he said she was taking steroids...WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?  I have told my ex to keep an eye on her urine samples because she has had protein in her urine in the past and I do know that it is connected to her kidnet problems she has had and that strep can bring about kidney problems.  What can you tell me about the weight gain and the rosy cheeks and the steroids?  Any advice is welcomed.......I would love your input! Thanks everyone!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Amy, The weight gain and rosy cheeks are commonly seen in children who've been taking steroids for quite some time, not just a short while. And, I believe, the steroids were given in your daughter's case for treatment of the glomerulonephritis. However, it is not routine for us to give steroids in cases of simple glomerulonephritis due to strep infection, unless there has been a more serious underlying problem with the kidneys. 'Glomerulonephritis' means an inflammation that occurs in certain parts of the kidneys, and this can result from several causes, resulting in several types of glomerulonephritis. It would help if you could find out which type she has. You've mentioned she has had proteins in her urine earlier, so were you given an exact diagnosis or explanation for that protein loss? Try and find out what her doctors think she has and tell us so we can give you more input on that matter.\n\n",

    "content": "THANKS...I just wanted to point out that her rapid weight gain and her rosy cheeks happened before she got steroids..my ex said she is on steroids and antibiotics just on Friday and he won custody of her on Oct 31 2005.......the weight gain was during his 3 months of visiting him before he won custody and she has gained even more weight from OCT 2005 until now.  I AM SORRY TO CONFUSE YOU.  I live in PA and Cassidy my 10 yr old lives in Toledo Ohio so just this past week my ex told me she got strep and I told him to watch out for her kidneys problems or protein in her urine....ANYWAYS I have cared for Cassidy her whole life so I know her history---Back in summer 2003 she went to the ER cause she was peeing brown red and then they admitted her in PA(where Cassidy lived with me) and they told me she had glomonephritis(not spelled right) and also gave me some streptowhatever word---she was in hospital for 1-2 days and then after that her pediatrcian kept track of her her urine..THEN in Oct 2005 she got strep and I told the ER to check her urine because of what happened in 2003 summer....she had protein in her urine and not long after that I had to turn her over to my ex so she went to live with him in Toledo Ohio. SO NOW just a couple days ago my ex called and said she has strep throat and I told him to keep an eye on her because of her history...She has some Dr she JUST MEET on Friday who put her on steroids and antibiotics....I am just worried what is going to happen to her after this strep because it has happened before and I hope their NEW dr in Ohio got ALL of her records because they don't know anything about her yet.  Im sorry for carrying on I just wanted to explain the whole history of Cassidy.......SO THE WEIGHT GAIN AND ROSY CHEEKS ARE MY CONCERN NOW------------Could it be something else like diabetes or something...WHAT ARE THE POSSIBILITIES?  I AM NOT LOOKING FOR ONE THING---JUST POSSIBILITIES GOING BY HER SYMPTOMS..........THANK YOU SO MUCH...IM NEW AT THIS FORUM................AMY\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Amy, Well, assuming that she hasn't taken any steroids before, then I'd believe it to be due to the protein loss in her urine. In an attempt to compensate for this protein loss, the body tries to hold on to more water, to keep a balance. This would give you a picture of weight gain. A number of hormonal troubles could also cause this rapid weight gain, including high endogenous blood steroids, but not diabetes.  I believe she was probably misdiagnosed as post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis from the start, and that her glomerulonephritis is due to other causes. Keep us informed with any more data you get to know, so we can try & figure out what she has.\n\n",

Well ever since then she has been saying it feels as if her belly is full of cold water?    She is a very nervous child and seems to be VERY bothere by this, to the point where she can not sleep, and hardly eats. I have taken her to her doctor and she came back positive with the rapid strep test they have?? the weird thing is there is no complaint of sore throat? she did have a sore throat about 2 and  half weeks ago, jsut days before all of this started.    i am very confused about this? i don;t know what the \"feeling of cold water in the belly is?\" could it be nerves? she is also saying the pain is localized right across the belly button area. maybe pulled miscle from dry heving??? i don;t know. I feel so badly for her, I hare seeing her so worried. she is only 7 and she is scared to death !!!!!!!!!!!!!!1  please help\n\n",

    "content": "Dear jaime4297, There is  only a 2% possibility that a rapid strep test would give a false positive result, so there's a narrow possibility she doesn't  have strep infection. It is common for children with pharyngitis/tonsilitis to present with abdominal pain and mention nothing of their throats. This may result from irritaion of the stomach from swallowed saliva mixed with pus, or from reactionary enlargement of some lymph nodes in the abdomen, called the mesenteric nodes. I'd like to know what your doctor thought of the pain? We usually don't pay much attention to the abdominal pain in such cases, but since the pain has lasted so long and she is unable to sleep nor eat, I suggest you take her back to the doctor or look for a second opinion.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello jaime4297, It's always very difficult to watch a child in pain while unable to diagnose nor help, but I'm sure if the doctors who've seen her think she's fine, then she probably is. The possibility of cancer is very remote, and I don't want you to start thinking that way! As for her low platelets, how low was low? It is expected that the platelet count decline after some infections, so if it's on the low normal side and she's not bleeding, then you needn't worry. Is she still not eating, nor sleeping? Has she lost weight? What about her general activities? Does she go to school and play with her friends, or is she completely bed-ridden? Could it be a stress-related situation? Is there anything that relieves the pain or is it just as bad all the time? Hope I can help you!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear erm, Ankle sprains could take a while to heal, and it depends on how badly your muscle tendons were injured. The presence of a lump could be due to a hematoma (collection of blood) as a result of broken blood vessels from the injury. Have your doctor take a second look, and if you're reassured then just avoid straining it too much, because that could even prolong the period of heeling. If you feel like working out, swimming would be a suitable sport for the time being, as it provides a sort of physiotherapy to your ankle as well. I know elastic bandages could be annoying, but it really helps avoid any further injury to the already weakened tendons. Also, try to elevate your foot whenever possible.\n\n",

I believe you need proper rehabilitation and physiotherapy by a specialist before you resume your usual activities.  Recurrent ankle injuries are more likely in patients who have not undergone complete rehabilitation, and if after 9-12 months of adequate rehab there is still some residual instability in the ankle, surgery may then be considered.\n\n",

The tongue does not appear to have a strip of white or red areas either, as in geographic tongue pictures.  It looks like a single circular, irregular, raised white tastebud.

    "content": "Well she is 11 years old, she was premature of 4 weeks, born with pneumonia, beta strep infection, and jaundiced. She stayed in the hospital for about a month and then came home. She was immediatly taken back into the hospital due to the same infections coming back, after that she suffered the normal ear infections, tonsilitis, bronchitis, she had her tonsils and adnoids removed at age 3, and tubes put in her ears at age 2, and then had her appendix removed at age 7 due to rupture. She contracted chicken pox 5x, and was sent for an immunology work up that came back normal thru CHildrens Hospital Dallas... Well since her appendectomy at age 7 she has seemed to grow well, been actually very healthy. She is now 11 and is 5'4\", but this past year or so, she has had reoccurrent headaches, easy bruising, pale skin, joint aches in the knees, elbows, anckles, then about 2 months ago, she started having severe chest pain, and shortness of breath, so now we find that she has the beginning stages of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy... but as of today no blood flow problems have occured or valve problems with this... So I guess now I need to add this red rash she gets on her cheeks from time to time, her pediatrican before put her on some sort of medication (lotion) to apply to it oh about a year ago, but it has never worked... We even bought all the expensive clinque products to have her wash her face with thinking it was some sort of acne?? but it flares up from time to time becoming more frequent.. Now she has dropped over ten pounds in a 3 week period, she still eats all the time,, we have always referred to her as the bottomless pitt in the family,,, she is bruising easily, we went into the pediatrican last week who ordered a CBC, RF, and ANA on her,, CBC and RF are both normal,, we should have the results on the ANA back tomorrow, i expect that to be normal also... I have since September of 03'    37 documented times she has gone to her school nurse for all these syptoms plus low grade fevers, is there something else that could be done to show us what is going on??? I am getting worried about her,, she has always been very athletic, cheerleader, basketball, soccer, ect... She can't even run in gym due to her heart feeling like it is coming out of her chest, and joint and muscle pain... She gets these headaches and just crys all night long, or all day long..... She walks with a limp when her joints are hurting?? Could there be other tests that maybe we are not running to explain what is going on with her?? I could really use the help thank you for your time... Lynette (brittany's mom)\n\n",

My grandmother has SLE also I just found out this morning, from my mother. She died a couple of years after she found out. I guess now we are just trying to learn everything we can about this disease, I just don't understand really. I mean why me, why my children. I have lost one child at the age of 8months, and now britt is sick with this, and her baby brother has another auto immune disease, and I am sitting here crying and wondering why? Brittany is wanting to change doctors because she has no trust in her pediatrican at this point, she hurt Britt's feelings pretty bad this past week, bby the things she said to her, so now I am in contact with our sons endocrinologist by email to find out who we can go to for treatment, but Britt cried when we got the news, and now she doesn't want to talk about it at all. She doesn't want to even listen to any advice or anything on any of this. And I guess she is just stressed out, with this and the fact they found the heart problem not even a month ago... I just would love to have some input here on what I need to do, or can do for her?? Any response would be great. Thanks Lyn\n\n",

    "content": "Hi!  I see that you are going through a hard time. I feel sorry about everything. If it is of any consolation, this life is limited, and any life compared to eternity would always remain negligible, be it someone who lived a 100 years or just a day. What is important is to cherish what we do have as life and live it as complete and as fruitful as we possibly can.   SLE is a disease without any predictable course. Each individual with the disease would have different manifestations. Some may manifest with acute life-threatening disease, some may come with many years of symptoms. But early diagnosis and careful treatment tailored to individuals have improved the prognosis from what was once perceived as an often fatal disease. This is a multisystem disease, and any organ of the body may get affected by it. Majority (some statistics say 90%, others 95%, and some quote 98-100%)  of children diagnosed with the disease live beyond 5 years. The commonest cause of death are infections, kidney disease, and brain affected by SLE.  In SLE, it is very important to have careful and frequent clinical and laboratory evaluation to tailor medicines to suit the individual, and to provide prompt recognition and treatment of disease flare (increase). This is the cornerstone of treatment. Monitoring is lifelong. A rheumatologist would be the specialist you can depend on in the long run. Other specialists come in depending on the organ affected.   Steroids, among other medications, may become part of life for Brittany. A diet with no added salt, low fat, and calcium rich should be brought into routine. Medicines used for SLE may have adverse effects. These adverse effects may be perceived as more severe than the disease iteself for the patient. Brittany, the family, and the physician should expect issues like depression and non-compliance with treatment to arise during the course of therapy.  Like any other grave disease of such nature, one must always keep openness, honesty, and hope as among the best friends to be trusted. Brittany should be encouraged to talk, be spoken to with openness and honesty, and be listened to with empathy. It is a common fallacy by the patient's care-givers to hide the true nature of the patient's disease for fear of hurting the patient's feelings. But the truth is the care-giver is usually in fear of hurting one's own feelings to see their loved one hurt. Whatever hope we intend to give should be realistic, and not false. Giving false hopes would only pave way for a heavier crash later on in life, when it would be too late.  Encourage Brittany to have a normal lifestyle. Exercise is important to maintain a normal bone density and appropriate weight. Sunlight is better avoided. Stress and fatigue may cause a flare.  Similarly, like other diseases with no cure at site, patients often tend to move their trust upon alternative medicines, hoping to somehow get cure. Though alternative medicine is not discouraged, it can have effect on the medicines used by allopathy (modern medicine) to treat SLE. So, one has to be careful before embarking on that route.   Remember, the CORNERSTONE of SLE management is frequent re-evaluation and prompt medical treatment of flares.  I think this should suffice for a start. I am sure Brittany's doctor would detail things out for the family.  Wishing her a quality life,  I remain.  With warm regards,  -bill\n\n",

    "title": "I also have lupus",
    "content": "I just wanted to let you know that I am 24 and was diagnosed with lupus (sle) 6, almost 7 years ago. It has been a long journey. I thought I could give you just a few words of advice though nothing helps more than informing yourself.   I finished my junior year in highschool and over the summer spent almost every day at the pool. It relaxed me, plus I had no energy and could barely do anything other than lay around. Towards the end of the summer, my family was concerned because I would fall asleep in the middle of conversations, even in the middle of the floor. Not only was I falling asleep easily but I was aching all over and when I would shop with my mom (one of my favorite past times) I would have to stop and sit on the floor, I just couldn't go on. Luckily for me, they found out from the very first blood test that I either had lupus or Rheumatoid Arthritis. I went to a specialist who actually diagnosed me as having hashimoto's thyroiditis which did not set well with us. My mother contacted the Lupus Foundation of America and asked for the best doctor in our area. They were very helpful and I was seen right away. The diagnosis was made, I have systemic lupus eurythematosis.   Now this is obviously a very long story, so I will just give you a couple key points which I would have liked to know in the beginning.  Number one, don't have your daughter take every drug that is thrown to her. My doctor had me on 27 pills a day in the beginning and to this day my stomach has never been the same. Not only are nausea and vomiting a part of my daily life, but for almost 2 years I was unable to take anything at all other than liquids or shots. This meant I had no treatment for the disease itself for almost 2 years. I did take methotrexate injections, which never helped and also liquid vioxx which I found extremely helpful for almost 2 years and then one day it no longer worked for me. After I found another doctor, we found out that one of the meds I was on was valium, but because I was getting the generic brand, I never realized it. Now did I really need valium? I don't think I did.  Your daughter has a couple years to cope and deal with the disease before highschool starts. I see that as a good thing, obviously the fact that she has lupus is horrible but with highschool being such an important part of a teenager's life, it is good that she has time to get in under control and find meds that help her. I missed 75% of my senior year and missed out on so much. No one understood what was happening, and either did I, so I wasn't much help. My mother made sure all of my doctor's notes were on file and the school worked with us with home tutoring and I was still able to graduate. That is one definite thing I recommend, keep everyone informed. That way there are no assumptions. Everyone knows. When it is out in the open, people cope better with it as well.   Inform both yourself and your daughter. Make sure your family is informed, but make sure you read up to date information. In the beginning I bought a book that told me never to have children because I would die and that only 60% of lupus patients live past 10 years. Totally not true today, maybe when the book was written but not anymore. That is so important to get up to date information. And there aren't that many books out there that are up to date.   I now am on 24 hour release morphine for my arthritis. This sounds scary I know, but my advice is to not let your daughter be in pain. For 5 years I just accepted that I would also have to live with the pain that was ruining my life. NSAIDS haven't worked for me, COX-2 Inhibitors haven't, steroids haven't, plaquenil hasn't, nothing curbed the pain (except for the vioxx for that time) other than morphine. How did I get it? I went to a pain specialist and said \"listen, my life is suffering, my marriage is suffering, my job is suffering, not just me. I can't take it anymore.\" And that was that, I was given morphine. Actually called Avinza. Now don't get me wrong, the pain isn't gone, but I can sleep through the night and even exercise some, but it is the best pain relief I have ever had. So don't let your daughter live in pain, if the meds she is given don't help, keep searching till you find one that does.  I know I have gone on forever, but I could tell you so much. The last advice I will give you is regarding the malar rash (the butterfly rash across the nose and cheeks). Mine has been very bad, I have always been described as \"red.\" This was very hard in high school, it looked like acne and believe me acne makes it worse as you get older. About 6 months ago (after trying everything, even the topical steroids) I broke down and ordered Pro Activ. I am sure you have seen it, it is almost 50.00 a month and Vanessa Williams endorses it. Now this is alot of money but I just had nothing left to try. After 4 weeks my rash was lighter and the acne was gone. I use it once a day because the twice a day was actually making it worse, but my face hasn't looked better since before my diagnosis. I will never stop using it though I discovered 2 months down the road that it bleaches everything it comes in contact with. Even my pillowcase. So be prepared with a white pillow case and a white towel. Even these will turn orange.   If your daughter is photosensitive they will tell her to stay out of the sun. This was the hardest part for me in the beginning, but I am not that good about it. I don't cover up, I wear hats and sunscreen if I am in direct sun, but I will still go to the pool. But as an adult I have made that choice. I actually had my wedding in Jamaica on the beach at sunset, my doctor didn't forbid it and it was the best time of my life.  Take everything in and then do research of your own. I have run across horrible doctors who know nothing about lupus and I have found great doctors. Just follow your instinct as well as your daughter's. You have to. Because this is a chronic illness, you want remission, that is your goal. Although I have yet to acheive remission, many other's have. Don't lose hope. I actually lead a very normal life, just with pain and alot of meds and some other complications but if you saw me you would never guess.   My husband wanted me to add that my mother was a little lax with me because of my diagnosis and it being senior year. She let me have alot of freedom that actually wasn't good to have at that point. It could last a few months or a few years but your daughter will be angry and hurt. Understand but don't let that make you parent differently. I went a little wild and did because of my freedom. This was my way of rebelling against the disease but it did me no good, only harm. So keep that in mind.  I wish you luck, patience and strength. Both your daughter and your family will need it. You will be going through this with her for years and you must be there for her but not act like she is dying. My advice anyway.  I hope you don't think I have crossed the line, I just wanted you to hear it from someone who has been there recently and am still living with it day in and day out. I so wished I had some advice from someone other than doctors back then.   One last thing, please don't take your daughter to Lupus seminars, my mom took me and they did much more harm than good. All you see is people in wheelchairs and walkers, suffering, not life and laughter, she doesn't need to see it. I didn't and I still don't.   Thanks for listening, CKBruce\n\n",

Decongestants make children hyperactive and antihistamines make them sleepy, in addition to more serious side effects as heart arrhythmias. Better stick to a single medication, and while we're at it, never give a decongestant for more than one week. It causes a 'rebound chemical rhinitis' that is very resistant to treatment.\n\n",

    "content": "I did not know if i should ask this question to a pediatrician or not, but since I still see one I figured it okay. My question is in January I started a weight loss program, one meal a day or two depending on what the meal consisted of 3 bottles (16.9 oz.) of water, stopped drinking soda pop completely, taking a multi-vitamin and green tea diet supplement pills. I excercise 7 days a week, 1 hour on treadmill, every other day 20 min-30 min on weights. My beggining weight was 281.7, now I am 260.8, my question is, Is this the right speed at which I should be loosing, and if so or if not, i still do not notice any difference in the way my clothes fit, or my apperance, I still look and feel heavy. Also I already had strechmarks over I would guestimate 80-85% of my body and they are getting worse, is there anything I can do to erase them completley or cover them up, I am an African-American with medium to dark skin and am afraid to use lightners, because I do not want to lose my color. Suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank's so much.\n\n",

Also, try not to burn yourself out. You should practice an average of 30 min. a day, most days of the week, but not necessarily every day! As for the stretch marks, they are mostly expected to improve after adolescence, so you may as well wait for a while. If they still bother you, try topical retinoids, they are very useful!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,   My 7yr old daughter has been waking during the night with nose bleeds. She used to get them frequently and on 2 occassions bled to the point where i called the hospital as she was starting to go pale. (the nurse said to wait a little longer and it did stop so didnt take her in).  She hasn't had them for quite a few months now but has started again this last week and a half. This week she's had 3 nights where she's woken in the middle of the night with a blood nose. One night appeared to be both nostrils.  Is it normal for a sleeping child to wake with a blood nose? She sleeps with her head slightly raised in bed.  Also (not sure if this is significant or not) she fell over a week ago and at first didn't appear to have any real damage done but ended up rushing her to hospital few hours later where she spent the week in hospital with grazed and bruised kidney and mild internal bleeding. Is she just frail?   Any advise would be great.   Thanks,  Kazzy\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Kazzy, Nosebleeds can sometimes be frightening, but fortunately enough, they are usually not that serious. As Rntdj, mentioned earlier, it could result from dry mucous membranes, causing the blood vessels to break, so you should be aware of that so you may humidify the air with a cool mist vaporizer in the bedroom, if possible. Nasal saline sprays are also useful. It can also result from repeated trauma to those fragile vessels by nose pricking, or irritation resulting from a cold, so it's best to avoid these factors. I also believe it is very likely your daughter has fragile vessels as witnessed by the minor trauma you've described that didn't turn out so mild. If lack of humidity and trauma or irritation are excluded, or the above measures have already been taken with no improvement, then please seek an otolaryngologist. This does not mean she needs cautery, but you need someone to have a good look at the bleeders. Also, if at any time she bleeds severely enough to cause her to become pale or go into shock, take her immediately to the emergency department!\n\n",

I've never had to worry about her as she doesn't get sick often but lately it seems that if she has an accident she \"does the job well\" so to speak.  Having 2 older sons who're very active and never seemed to do any real damage it's worrying having my daughter seem so accident prone and fragile.  Kazzy\n\n",

Though we have included lot of fiber rich food, like fruits, leafy vegetables, it remain as it is.  When the movements occurs, the stool come out is very hard and painful which we can notice in his face.  We have consulted a doctor and has been prescribed Duphalac Lactulose Solution 5 ml every day and Skilax 15 Ml 5 drops in the night.  This medicine was given for almost 2 weeks but no success.  Please advise us what steps we have to take to make his bowel movements as a regular and routine.  When we compel him to go to toilet, he looks very worried and start crying.  Please advise through this valuable site.  Best regards,  Manazer\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Manazer, It is always wise to seek consultation when a child fails to respond to routine therapy or when management is otherwise complex.  Now, I'm sure your doctor has excluded the possibility of anal fissures, but may be he'd like to recheck, since your child obviously suffers pain on defecating. Also, with such a recent onset, and with the hard stools, it is very likely. Elimination of any pain associated with the passage of bowel movements is extremely important and using very large doses of laxatives to produce very soft stools may be necessary.  If the child has anal fissures, using Xylocaine ointment or hydrocortisone suppositories for a short period of time to provide symptomatic relief may be appropriate. It is also important to establish regular and routine toilet times, once or twice daily for 5-10 minutes, preferably after feeding.  As regards diet, continue to administer lots of fluids, especially fruit juice, and carbohydrates. A balanced diet that includes whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and lots of fluid is always recommended.  You may also consider removing cow's milk protein from your child's diet.\n\n",

    "content": "I have a 12 year old son who was diagnosed with rheumatic fever about 2 years ago. The chief of emergency medicine who first directly diagnosed and admitted him firmly believes he had the fever, but some other doctors don't.       He has since then had some painful red swollen joints that may or may not have rashes, and hives. He mostly has these rashes and hives are  around his wrists,knees and ankles. The rashes can be tinyitchy red dots, or they can be raised, hot, red and highlty visible hives.      He has not been feeling up to par and has gained weight and has looked very swollen in the face and eyes. He is a very athletic and an active guy, but for the last month or so has been sleeping alot and is quite moody. He has also had more incidents of the joint rashes.        He was seen by our family doctor and throat culture showed no strep, but the lab blood test did, along with showing a low iron count. Since then (about 1 month ago) we have given him vitamin with iron and we have encourage good eating habits. He is still very sleepy, he falls asleep in the car and at others houses. It is so out of character for him, that it is really puzzling. When we visited the doctor, he had no signs of having strep, no fever ,no sore throat. So why would strep show up? Are these syptoms stemming from his possible rheumatic fever from years ago?  He just looks so swollen and is sleeping so much it makes me concerned. Any information you could give me would be very helpful. Thanks                           Angie\n\n",

    "content": "Dear gullsgirl, Chicken pox typically shows crops of 'teardrops' or 'dew drops' on a rose base. They appear initially on the face and trunk, beginning as red spots which gradually turn into vesicles, and finally crust. These lesions usually spare the hands and feet. There is usually an associated fever. Hand, foot and mouth disease, as its name suggests, typically involves the areas mentioned, together with the buttocks. The lesions begin as a 2-10 mm spot on which a gray vesicle appears. The mouth vesicles are rarely seen because they rapidly become ulcerated with an average number of 5-10 ulcers. As for the skin vesicles, the hands seem to be affected more than the feet, with the back of the hands and sides of the fingers more than the palms. They usually disappear within 3-7 days.\n\n",

    "content": "My daughter is seven years old and for the third time in the past six months she has gotten swollen lymphnodes with nausea, headaches, backaches, neck pains, and legpains accompanied by a fever anywhere from 101-105 that lasts for 1-2 weeks at a time. She is treated with antibiotics, both tylenol and motrin for pain and fever and IV fluids and lots of liquid due to dehydration which treat the symptoms and the infection.  Her Dr. also said after a blood draw in the ER that she has a low iron count but that everything else was normal. Three years ago she had the same symptoms along with muscle spasms and was in the hospital for three weeks. After monitoring and the same treatment as well as blood draws they could not find anything wrong with her, she just got better and was released with no explanation at all. It is still going on and I am getting worried. She also has gotten strep every winter since her second b-day. She also has a tendency for the past year to scream, moan, yell, walk, talk and cry while practically asleep complaining of pain and not making very much sense at all. It is hard to make out what she is saying as she screams and yells while putting pressure on a part of her body that she says is hurtting her. After 10-15 min. she goes back to sleep and in the morning she doesnt remember a thing. Other than that she has been very healthy. What is the cause, why is it happening so much, is it serious and is there anything we can do to prevent this or treat it differently. Please let me know if you know what is going on and what I should do about it. She is constantly getting sick and these scary awakenings at night are all worrying me. There is a a history of epilepsy, parkinsons disease, diabetes, asthma, low iron, depression, high blood pressure, MS, heart defects(not sure of specific), smoking for years of 1-2 packs/day by all family members, tumors, and cancer in the family if that helps.Thank you. Lisa\n\n",

She was tested for TB.  Again, normal.  She complains off and on.  She will go weeks without complaining then it starts again.  It is not sharp pain.  She says very matter of factly, my back hurts.  She points to her lower back.  This is mainly at night as she is falling asleep.  Sometimes in her car seat and less frequently at play.  Again, she will go for periods of time without any mention of it then it will start again.  Can you recommend any additional tests or an option as to what this could be?  Note that she was adopted from an orphanage in Ukraine at 15 months.  I am at a loss to and no one can give me answers.  Any help/advise would be appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear debisab, I believe with all the investigations done that came back negative, your girl could be exhibiting the manifestions of a condition called 'somatization' and this is fairly common in children.  This is a condition that usually occurs in response to psychological stress and is expressed in the form of a persistent experience of physical pain such as headaches, stomachaches, backaches or chest pain.  It could persist after the stressor has gone, resulting in the child and family to believe that the correct diagnosis has not been reached. I believe this is very likely the diagnosis in her case, putting in mind she was in an orphanage at a very vulnerable period of her life.\n\n",

It can be a very tough specialty though, but if you love children, then you'll be able to bear with anything! Now, there are different subspecialties within pediatrics. There are the pediatric endocrinologists, intensivists, cardiologists, hematologists, oncologists and more, depending on the different body systems.  Some prefer to remain general pediatricians, and when need arises, they refer their patients to the specialists accordingly.\n\n",

Is this the right forum to ask for answers to the related questions we have?  I do not know how small is \"small\". Next appointment I will ask the doctor for additional information. Should we stay worry free?  Can a small cyst be inoffensive? Will it need to be removed? Will my child have a normal development? Is it possible that more cysts are developed? What can be done to prevent possible new cysts? What causes them?   Thanks for all the answers to some or all of these questions.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear michelangelo, To tell you the truth, this is a bit confusing, due to lack of information! However, I'm sure if it was worth any concern on your side, your doctor would have notified you, or at least asked you to come in a little earlier to check it's not growing rapidly. I assume that what your doctor meant by a small cyst, was an extra collection of the fluid that normally surrounds the brain to protect it, called the cerbrospinal fluid (CSF), into one the pockets (called cisterns) that lie within the different parts of the brain. An exaggerated collection of CSF into one of these pockets is usually no reason for concern. Since your doctor isn't concerned you shouldn't be either, and next time you visit, try to find out more about it, especially the exact site and size.\n\n",

    "title": "Golden Irises(I am young, may as well post it here)",
    "content": "An odd occurency, though at least a few of you have seen it before. I'm simply requesting an explanation beyond, say, genetics. Myself and my brother have hazel eyes, our nuclear family of six is split evenly between the colors. Neither of us is a genetic sport, though one of my two sisters is. I am 14 years of age while my brother is 28. We share hazel with the details of no one we' ve met. I discovered this oddity while brushing my teeth, notified him, and it turned out he had the same problem. Now down to the point. While our hazel eyes are obviously just that, they have a yellow ring near the outer edge of the iris. My case is a fair bit more prominent than his. When our pupils dilate, the yellow ring is exposed around the outside of the pupil. When light reflects off of this, it gives the effect of eastern european brown eyes. It is golden. But unlike with Romantic countries, this gold looks quite literally polished, producing a shine on one third of the iris closest to the bottom of the nose(at least this is where it is most easily recognizable). Anyone within a short distance(no more than about three feet) can see this effect. I was not born with this, my eyes were the perfect model of hazel. I suspect this is the case with my brother, but am not sure. An explanation I would be very grateful for. I have seen cases of a color split in the iris, and even know one girl who has this that changes from season to season. However, I have not heard on this eye color on anyone except, well, wolves. I know I am not turning into a wolf, especially seeing as it takes dilation of the pupils to make this show up. I suppose some other physical information would be useful. Myself: 5' 6\"(growing). 115lbs. Light, wiry stature. Brother: 6' 3\". 260lbs. medium stature.  here is a picture of the closest match I could find to the color of our eyes. though this is a much more dim case of gold, seeing as it does not shine as though burnished.

    "content": "Dearest Perrin, The closest I could find in the medical literature to what you've described is something called 'sectoral heterochromia iridis'. It is a condition where different sectors of the iris has different colours. It is rare in humans and is commonly seen in dogs and cats. It is usually benign and frequently genetic in origin, but can also occur in certain diseases. If you feel concerned about this condition, please check with an ophthalmologist.\n\n",

    "content": "...for the research. I looked a bit further into it using the condition as a search keyword. Surprising result: \"\tThe presence of some yellow pigment called xanthin combined with the scattered blue light gives the color green.\" http://www.tipsofallsorts.com/coloredeyes.html   In my mind I would begin to believe that xanthin is now the prime suspect. Is it not a possibility that the prism effect of the blue is non-existent in the rim of the eye where this shows? It is, after all, most obvious when the light shines directly on the side(not the front) of the iris. Would this simply be that the xanthin is shown clearly and alone on the rim of the eye, where the prism may not be at the correct angle? The girl I mentioned, now that I have read up on the condition you described, most certainly has sectoral heterochromia iridis. She has one eye with blue and brown in it, separated clearly in what looks almost like a line.             Back to the subject, would the reflection of the yellow simply be caused by the blue not reflecting inside the rim of the iris? I'll have to observe some other hazel eyes. This may well explain the distinctly yellow rim showing(which is exposed when dilated) up because it is a concentration and lacks the clear iris that produces the blue reflection. And also, would this simply mean that wolves have a higher concentration of the xanthin pigment in their eyes to produce a yellow throughout?  Many thanks again for the research and thoughts.\n\n",

    "content": "I am wondering how likely it is to develop an allergy to ibuprofen, my daughter who is almost 9 takes ibuprofen when ever she needs it for headache, fever, etc. Never has had a problem with it. The other day she had a stomache virus and was getting over it and got a headache, so like normally I gave her one ibuprofen of 200mg.(store brand) and within 30-45 minutes her arms started itching alot and had alot of heat in them, that was unusual so I started watching her closely and in about 10-15 min, her arms started looking like maybe a rash, and she had a fever of a 100.5, so i called the doc. and she said \" maybe poison oak, or ivy, so to give her a benadryl. So i did and in about 5 min. it looked like raised skin that was white surronded by red,( probley hives). Well, then in about 30 min. they got much better and went away. this was only on her arms, she said she had some other itching on her  legs, and lower back, but it did not turn into anything. Could this actually be an allergy to ibprofen now, because she had taken ibuprofen just 3 days before this and didnt have any problems, or could this have come from her having a stomache virus and taking ibuprofen triggered something, or something she may have ate in combination with ibuprofen and that triggered something. She did not eat anything differernt that day, and i didnt think about telling the doc on the phone that she had ibuprofen. i have called her doc since and am waiting on her to call back. just wanted extra info on this. oh and there are no allergies to this in either family to my knowledge.\n\n",

    "content": "My daughter is 4 yrs old. She is normally a healthy and very active child. However since Sept she has had one illness after another with 1 or 2 weeks of up time before she is down again.  Sept. Ear infection, Oct Strep throat,  Ear innfection, Nov Flu Double ear infection, Dec Strep throat again.   Complains of headaches, always cold, cirlces under her eyes. (no matter how much rest she gets)  Her Pedi did a QBC to ck iron level, RBC and WBC. They told me the results were within normal limits. Could she really be this sick for no reason. I have a 3 yr old who has a weaker immune system how gets sick easy and has only had 1 ear infection and 1 cold. Usually she is the one that is sick and on breathing treatments and steroids.  i just want to make sure I am not overlooking anything and I have done everything I can in the best interst of my child.   I have heard of children getting sick like this and they are anemic or end up having Leukemia. As much as would never want my child to have anything like that and amthankful her test cam back normal. I do not want to blow it off an then later something come up and it has really hurt her.   Any input would be appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi!  I hope by the time this reply finds you, the illnesses that haunt your child are locked up somewhere far and safe. It is probably right to be anxious of any preventable or potentially curable disease that could be detected early and eliminated; but, to an extent beyond which anxiety can ruin the mindset.   When you mentioned that your second child had a 'weaker immune system' did you mean that the child had some kind of immunodeficiency disorder? If so, or if there is history of immunodeficiency in the family, it would be prudent to check out your child for immunodeficiency.  By ear infection, was your child diagnosed with acute otitis media? Does your child attend a daycare center? Some of the preventive aspects to check out would be passive tobacco smoke, daycare centers, vaccines, and antibiotic prophylaxis. I feel your child qualifies for the rather controversial preventive step of antibiotic prophylaxis for otitis, which may be further discussed with your doctor.  Hope this helps.  Warm regards,  Bill\n\n",

    "content": "Bill,   My youngest daughter has CHD (Congenital heart diease) Therefore is more susceptible to infection, however is slowly outgrowing this.  My 4yr old.. who is theeee middle child... has always been the stonger.. healthy one.  SHe does attend daycare, however did so last year also,,, and never went to the doctor for antibiotics. Yes we smoke but not in the house or in the car. So 2nd handsmoke is out. SHe has had all her shots and just received her 4 yr old shots on Jan 20th. She is now sick again. Complaining of her throat.. So I am sure she has Strep again.. This will be the 3rd time... I just don;t see this as normal.. I have never seen a child so sick with one thing after another she just got off anitbitoics the 15th of Jan... For Strep and on the 2oth they did a strep test to make sure it was gone... It came back Negative.We changed her toothbrush ... So i know that is not the case... She was DX with otitis Media, Acute Suppurative. The ear drum had not ruptured.  Dad gets sick easily but he also had Congenital Heart Disease. (Different defect then the baby).   SO it seems that as soon sh she finishes her antibiotic she gets a 2 week break and is sick again.. I am taking her to the Doctor tomorrow... If I wanted more tests run I don;t even know what kind of doctor to take her too. Her Pedi... Thinks this is normal for her   Thanks Kim\n\n",

I am a 34 yro single mother of two wonderful children. One of those wonderful children is severely emotionally handicapped. He is currently living in a 5 day a week residential program and comes home on the weekends. He has 9 months in this program before he is returned into the \"normal\" setting. Hence, my plea to you.. My son, Nicholas, is 9 and may never be in a \"normal\" setting. His father, whom is 50 and still lives home with mom, cant hold a job, and is a severe drug and alcohol abuser, never see's or cares for his children is one indication my son has it in his \"genes\". His uncle died living at home with him mother, never to have held down a job. Both Diagnosed with OCD, Bi-Polar, schizophrenia, along with a gander of other problems. My child has been diagnosed with the same with a grim out look of his future without serious intervention. My first awareness of my sons illness started at age 2, when I received a call from his daycare that he was uncontrollable. It just continued to get worse from there. As I said before he is in a residential facility currently after years of a lot of pain, tears and research. I am writing you today for your help. I am at my wits end and do not know what to do. I hold a 40hr a week job and make a mere $30,000 a year. Not much of a budget to get him the helps he so needs. In 9 months he will be back into the world ALONE to face life's challenges without the skills he needs to survive. I will not keep you any longer and will thank you again for your time, ANYTHING you can advise for me would GREATLY appreciated.   A Mothers Plea...\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Trudi, Since they're gaining weight, then I'd like to reassure you that at least we're not dealing with something grave. However, I was wondering, has there been any change in diet to explain this change in bowel habits at the age of 4wks, like the introduction of milk formulae, or changing the one used before? Is it possible they may be overfed? Because then it would be natural that their bowels would be unable to cope with the extra feeding. Also, do you or the father have irritable bowels, because kids for parents with irritable bowels may manifest as early as this age, and that may be the simplest explanation to their sufferings.  If so, try spacing of feeding and frequent eructation during feeding. Also, try laying them on their sides, following their feeds, as that helps release of wind. If they are bottle fed, always ensure the nipple is covered completely with milk, so as to avoid swallowing of air.Check you use the proper concentration of milk formula, and that it's not too strong.  Finally, ask your doctor if it's possible to add some mild natural herbs for relief of colicks, as herbal teas or chamomile.\n\n",

    "content": "Let me start by giving you a little history... My 9yr old son has been diagnosed with Aspergers Syndrome.  He also has gone through a period of Obsessive Compulsive things, such as washing hands and worrying about touching things.  At one time last summer, he was constantly asking us things such as, I touched this \"worm\" or whatever and then put my finger in my mouth is everything going to be ok???  He finally got over that but now let me explain what is happening....  The other night he came to me and started telling me that his mind is doing weird things.  Sometimes he cusses in his mind for no reason at all...he is not even mad.  And now he is telling me that he is picturing himself kissing people....boys and girls, adults, people on tv.  He says he is also picturing peoples \"privates\" and \"kissing\" those also.  He is only 9 years old.  And every minute he is telling me this.  He waits by the door until I get home and it's like he has to rush to tell me this. Very obsessive.  He also told me that about a year ago, his boy cousin tried to get him to perform oral sex on him and that his boy cousin told him that he does this to his own sister.  After this shock, we are in the process of getting them some help and counseling, but I am wondering is all that my son is going through a result of this, the Aspergers, puberty, or what.  And how do I get him to stop thinking about all this?  Please some help from someone that may have gone through this or some of the doctors.\n\n",

I cannot provide you with much help either, besides the fact that you need to refer him to a psychiatrist that is specialized in treating children. From your description it appears that his problems are not related to Asperger's Syndrome. The obssessive behaviour alone is a significant manifestation that warrants referral to a psychiatrist.

    "content": "Dear thecashmama, Children with Down's syndrome are always at increased risk for the development of a decrease in thyroid gland function (hypothyroidism) of the autoimmune type, where the body starts to attack the thyroid gland and eventually destroys it. Now any patient suffering hypothyroidism, with a defect primarily in the thyroid gland, would have an expected TSH level of > 100mU/L. Diagnosis may be delayed in children with Down's syndrome, in spite of the high index of suspicion, because they share many of the manifestations with those suffering hypothyroidism. Even patients with a congenitally absent thyroid may show no symptoms at birth and also suffer a delay in diagnosis, as some of the mother's thyroxine (T4) passes through the placenta to her fetus. Symptoms of hypothyroidism often appear gradually, and diagnosis is usually at the age of 3-6 months, when the clinical picture is fully developed.\n\n",

    "content": "My sister is 11 years old. She is very much aware of her body.... however, claims that she is NOT a \"girly girl\". Nothing wrong with this. Being what she claims is a \"tom boy\" suits her. Her involvement in sports and whatnot keeps her away from the \"girly girl\" status, and she LOVES being just one of the guys per say.   Okay- You may think to yourself, \"am I worried about her being a lesbain.. \"... well, NO.. she's very very interested in boys.. which is why I believe she try's to hang with them.  My problem is this. She looks up to me for advice and whatnot. However, with her claims and wishes to not want to be to girly, she will lack on her personal hygene, claiming that *QUOTE* \"only girly girls do that kinda of stuff\".    I've tried MANY way's of approaching this issue with her... asking her to come with me to my bathroom, and letting her try on my perfume, makeup ect.... I've even tried to get her interested in wearing some more form fitting shirts and pants.. (not as baggy as she likes, but then again, not so Feminen(SP)....... )  She just simply LACKS interest!  I've even tried to just very bluntly talk with her about it.. but she just get's upset to the point of crying and yelling about how she's a tom boy.   Is there a way, that maybe someone could suggest to me, to approach her more directly and actually get a point across that being a woman, or in her case, a very pretty young lady, that there are just SOME things you HAVE to do, because it's good for your body!? I don't want to invade her personal space, but I think it's just time. But I don't want to upset her anymore... I hate the look on her face. I hate to see her embarrest.   SO PLEASE.. some one suggest something. Thanks a TON!\n\n",

I'm not so much worried about her taking on the charteristic's of a \"typical\" woman as I am worried about her personal hygene though..... SO- after I posted my first comment lastnight, I spoke with Her privately about my concerns. #1- she had the BIGGEST knot in her hair, so as I was talking with her, I brushed her hair.. LOL best way to get the ball rolling....   Anyway, as I talked, she didn't get upset. She simply listened to what I had to say. I told her that she was going to become her own person in due time, and that I was proud of her for bleh bleh bleh ect. Then, I did some of that oh so common reverse phsycology to the best of my ability..... I told her that we could work TOGETHER to better our personal hygene, As many of us COULD use an extra teeth brushing a day LOL... she seemed to respond with gratatude this time rather than with her ususal rebelious yell of \"IM A TOM BOY\". I thought that it was best to tell her just very simply and plainly how I felt, and low and behold.. I think I may be getting somewhere!   Call me completely nuts but I just was concerned with the fact that all to often for example, she would come out of the shower and not brush her hair... or run off to the school bus claiming to have brushed her teeth when I knew she hadn't. Perhaps the problem wasn't her at all? maybe it's me that is to \"girly girl\"...........\n\n",

    "title": "7 week old Ankle Injury",
    "content": "Hi, I'm a 34 year old healthy woman with an ankle injury. I've had it for a little over 7 weeks now. And I'm still on crutches. I've tried to walk on it but the pain is unbareable. I injured it stepping down into a hole and my left ankle twisted inward to the right and I heard a popping sound. It swole up almost immediately to the size of a baseball on my outter ankle bone, my toes swole so much I wasn't able to move them. My whole foot had a bruised coloring to it. The X-rays showed no break. Ultrasound has ruled out a blood clot and Doppler shows adequate blood flow. The Ultrasound and Doppler were within the last couple of weeks. My foot stays a redish somewhat blue color. The bottom of my foot and my toes have a pins and needles pain when pressure is applied. Each side of my ankle has sharp shooting pain if i try to put my foot down and put weight on it. It also hurts across the top of my foot and upwards onto my leg. My big toe feels pressure in it like someone is squeezing it, and sometimes like it's being pushed down or up. I sometimes catch myself looking to see if I'm holding my toe down but I'm not. The swelling isn't nearly as severe as it was but it still swells some each day. The outter ankle bone is swolen and hard all the time but is not tender to the touch. My foot feels cold alot even if it isn't cold to the touch. It gets a tingly feeling in it alot of the time as if it were falling asleep. I can move my toes but it does hurt. I have limited motion of my ankle in moving it up or down and sideways, this also hurts. Is this just a bad sprain or could this be something more.  Is there something that maybe I could suggest to a Dr. that maybe they did not think of or maybe did not know of. I can't keep living on crutches. I have 3 children and cannot keep up with them like this. I had a nurse friend of mine say I could possibly need an MRI to rule out more severe Ligament damage or Nerve damage. Please any information would be much appreciated.\n\n",

Now I am really worried about my sons surgery, he is already a pretty rambuctious child. Are the risks that great? He currently is on his third week with enlarged tonsils and on his second type of antibiotics, you can't tell he's sick, but you can tell he has a hard time swallowing.I checked his throat again today, and now it seems as though there are brown patches on his tonsils as well as them being so big they touch the sides of his uvula. Should I reconsider the surgery and just let mother nature continue to take its course??\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Splume,  Tonsils and adenoids are there for a reason. But if their presence is harmful for the child, then they are not needed. If the tonsils are inflammed or infected 6 or more times in a year and/or an abscess has developed and the child is missing a lot of schoold days (talking abbout older children), or the child just spends time in bed and not enjoying himself then they ought to be removed as they will serve as a septic focus harming the child. About the adenoids, if they become enlarged, the child starts to snore, becomes a mouth breather, and he will have chronic ear infections, will be hard of hearing and will not follow well in class and he will be less attentive and have low grades.  Every surgery has its indications, contraindications and complications and alternatives. You will have to discuss all of those in details with the surgeon especially all the possible complications and then take an informed decision whether or not you would like your son to have the surgery.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Splume, First of all, it should be clear to you as well as all parents that neither tonsillectomy nor adenoidectomy should be performed as prophylaxis against the \"common cold\" at any age! Always keep in mind that the tonsils and adenoids are part of the lymphoid tissues which serves essentially as a defense against infection. Now you have not mentioned how frequently your child suffers tonsillitis. For a child to perform surgery, there are certain criteria required. This includes a frequency of seven attacks of acute infection in the past year, five in each of the past 2 years, or 3 in each of the past 3 years, or more than any of these. Factors such as severity of illness, the frequency of missing school or child care, any associated complications, or the presence of other medical issues also needs to be considered. From your description, the tonsils appear to be enlarged enough to affect swallowing, which is also a reason for surgery, but only if they are persistently or chronically enlarged.  Before tonsillectomy is recommended, it should be ascertained that the enlargement is chronic and not the result of a recent acute infection. Tonsils can increase in size greatly during an acute infection and recede after its subsidence, either on their own or in response to a course of antibiotics. Tonsillectomy in children less than 2-3years is generally performed for obstructive sleep symptoms rather than tonsillitis.  If you find your child's is in need of surgery, then you should know that for children < 4-5 years, as in your child's case, separate tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy is preferred! Minor hemorrhage occurs usually in > 10% of procedures. Severe hemorrhages occur occasionally and are another reason for carefully assessing the reason for surgery!\n\n",

    "content": "My son's tonsils are in the beginning of week four of being enlarged. He has been on Zithromax and just finished Augmentin. He is usually sick off and on for about 9 out of 12 months a year. Symptoms ranging from swollen tonsils and ear infections, vomiting & congestion w/ ear infections, or wheezing and vomiting. It is so \"normal\" to my family for him to be sick that we just clean him up and go on with our day as usual. He frequently gets nose bleeds in his sleep, occasionly during the day.. He on his 2nd kind of allergy medication. He snores at night and gets up several times, but I have never actually witnessed any type of \"sleep apnea\" episode. When he was an infant he had chronic Broncitis and Pneumonia. (Like once or twice a month) he is immune to Amoxiccillin and Zythromax did work really well until this current episode. I don't see any changes in him with the Augmentin either though. He is a hyperactive child and you can never tell he is sick except he sleeps longer. I am nervous about the possible hemmorraging after surgery, because he is so hyperactive, I don't know if I can possibly keep him confined to rest for 2 weeks.\n\n",

    "content": "Daer Splume, In your son's condition, it is obvious he is in need to perform surgery, for many reasons you've mentioned! As regards bleeding, reasons for bleeding can be divided into medical causes and surgical causes.  The medical causes are usually looked for by certain labs your doctor will order before surgery, and if any bleeding tendency is found, he will manage accordingly. Surgical bleeding can occur at any of three times:  During surgery or intraoperatively, and this may happen with even the most skillful doctors and usually all the settings are prepared to deal with such a situation.  Bleeding may then occur in the first 24 hours, and in my opinion , that is the most critical period. In children under 3 years, the child is usually kept overnight to avoid this complication. In patients older than 3, outpatient tonsil and adenoid surgery can be performed safely and may be mandated by insurance carriers. Discuss this with your doctor. Secondary bleeding is the term used to describe the bleeeding that happened to your freind as a child. It extends from after 24 hours postoperatively to up to 10 days. It is recommended that your child not exert in any effort during that period.That does not mean complete rest, just tell him not to run or jump up and down  like a monkey. Keep an eye on him while playing.Try to engage him in video games or read him stories. If, however, bleeding did occur, remain calm, so as not to frighten him further,  apply immediate pressure to the bleeding site using clean cotton or bandage and take him immediately to hospital!\n\n",

She is in daycare 3x/wk so we attribute some to that environment and Central Texas is BAD for allergies, too.

She's treated for each thing, then it dies back down to just regular sniffles, coughs and hacking.  This past week when she throws her \"i don't want to be in the car seat\" fit, it ends up with a major coughing episode, painful cries, and then last night a string of bright red bood in her sputum.  Phone nurse said to monitor, and no more was seen.  Her nasal secretions are usually clear or yellowish/green, her right eye seems a little swollen (but everyone around her has swollen eyes from allergies this week).  Any recommendations?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi!  As a first line of activity, I would begin with enough steam around the baby so that they condense on to the respiratory tracts, easing and diluting any secretions from the nasal passage down to the lung end. To keep the nasal passages clear, I might also try some saline drops into the nose.   One may try over-the-counter children's allergy remedies if all household remedies fail.  Blood in nasal secretions may sometimes occur after a bout of rough coughing or vomiting or nose-picking. But it would be best to show the baby to a pediatrician to rule out other causes like hypertension or bleeding disorders.  Hope this helps.  bill\n\n",

To make a long story short they ended up doing a test putting dye through her veins.  They found that she has an artery going across her throat instead of up and down.  After learning CPR I did bring her home with a breathing monitor. I was told that her throat would get stronger as she gets older and she would be able to handle the problem.

No doctor seems to be able to give me the same answer.  The health officer went into his daycare and said everything was fine and no other child caught it from him.  My husband and I would like to have another baby, however, can we use his blinkets and clothing or are these contagious?  Of course everything has been washed, but what about bottles and toys that he has chewed on?  We don't want to have to go through this again!\n\n",

He is almost completely potty trained and my husband said he doesn't need to have his penis wiped after he pees, so I haven't been wiping him. He gets baths daily and the foreskin is pulled back to wash under it. When he has an accident he is changed immediately. He is still in a diaper at nightsince he hasn't mastered waking to go pee yet. I have started putting Neosporin on it 3 to 4 times a day and it is getting better. Is this just an irritation, or is it infected? Do I need to wipe under the foreskin after he pees?\n\n",

Normal external cleaning at diaper changes and external washing with soap and water during bathtime are all that is necessary.  It is important that you do not try to retract the foreskin or try to clean underneath it with Q-tips. This can cause pain, bleeding or permanent damage to the penis. There is no need for any special ointments or creams, either. Normal soap and water work just fine.   As for the rash it should be examined by his pediatrician.\n\n",

    "content": "Dalton's disease is sex-linked recessive. The term \"sex-linked recessive\" means that an abnormal gene on the X chromosome from each parent is required to cause the disease in females since the female has 2 X chromosomes. In males there is only one X chromosome, therefore, a single recessive gene on the X chromosome will cause the disease.  So to solve your problem:  X=Dalton's gene x=Normal gene   Man has Dalton:   +   Woman not carrier        Xy                        +          xx                       = Xx, Xx, xy, xy   Hence none of their children will have Dalton's but any girls they have will be carriers.  Man has Dalton    +  Woman carrier Xy                        +         Xx                        = XX, Xx, Xy, xy  Here, half their boys will have Dalton's and the other half will be carriers. Half their daughters will be carriers and the other half completely normal.  The couple need genetic counsuling before they marry.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Archi, Daltonism is the inability to perceive or distinguish certain colors, esp. red; also known as color blindness. It has various forms and degrees. So called from the chemist Dalton, who had this infirmity. Daltonism is a genetic character which is carried in heredity on a recessive gene on the X gender chromosome. Therefore women may be carriers of the deficiency and pass it to their sons. A son to a dalton mother will definitely be dalton too, while son of a carrier mother may have a normal sight.   There is no treatment or cure for color blindness.\n\n",

However, mutations in MECP2 are almost always sporadic, that is, they occur spontaneously rather than through heredity. That means that parents rarely pass on the disease to their children. Even if a child does inherit the mutation, however, boys don\u2019t usually get RS. That\u2019s because the father can\u2019t pass it on to them. In order for the fetus to become a boy, the father must pass on a Y chromosome, not an X chromosome. Since the MECP2 gene is located only on the X chromosome, the boy, by virtue of being XY, avoids RS.   No they don't run in families.\n\n",

The doctor at his 6 month checkup had to pull the skin back and wipe away the dead skin.  She then put silver nitrate on the skin that was attached.   I was in and out of the ER 3 times, because my son's penis had swollen, was really red, and the silver nitrate was eating sores on his penis.  He was still able to urinate.  The last time I was in the ER, the doctor had to remove the silver nitrate and that took some skin with it.  Six months later, my son's penis is red again.  This time I think it is normal.  I read that the foreskin doesn't fully retract from the head of the penis until after the age of 2.  I want to know if I caused the skin to be pulled away from the head, or if it is normal, and will heal by itself.\n\n",

They told me he had an allergic reaction, and gave me what i thought was a prescription, which in fact it was some allergy benardryl that you could buy over the counter. Its been 5 days since i brought him to the hospital. I thought his ear was starting to go down, but tonight it actually started to swell a little more. It looks as if there is blood in his swollen part of his ear, which by searching online i found it to be his helix. Could someone please help me, and let me know what i should do. I plan on bringing him to a pediatrician in the morning, but i am worried sick.  Thanks, Shantell\n\n",

    "content": "Hi!  From your description, I feel if the there is some fluid (pus/blood) swelling up the ears, it needs drainage. I would suggest seeking the help of an ENT surgeon/Head & Neck surgeon for expert help.  But if, as was considered earlier as allergic, the causes could be plenty and management accordingly with avoidance of the triggering allergen.  Is there any history of trauma to the ears/head? Sunlight could be a factor that triggers inflammation of the skin when combined with topical or ingested agents that interact with proteins of skin or absorb UV radiation. There is a condition called JSE, or Juvenile Spring Eruption of the ears, but like allergy, pruritus/itching is usually there, and I don't know if its spring in Louisiana.  Juvenile spring eruption of the ears (JSE), a photodermatosis (skin affected by light), primarily affects boys aged 5-12 years. This disorder typically appears in the spring following the first intense sun exposure and may persist through the summer. Often, a history of JSE in other family members, typically fathers and brothers, suggests a familial predisposition. Although the prevalence is higher in boys, girls also may be affected. However, girls' ears often are protected from the sun by their hair.   Triggered by sunlight or a combination of sunlight and cold air, JSE presents as pruritic, erythematous, circumscribed solid elevations (papules) that progress to small (<0.5 cm) fluid-filled lesions (vesicles) or even blisterlike lesions (bullae). Within 1-2 weeks, the vesicles crust over and heal with minimal or no scarring.   But I am hopeful that from your description the disease should be amenable to treatment and you would provide feedback after a visit to your doctor.\n\n",

There is no history of JSE in my family. And he has no brothers. He does have short hair, and likes to wear a cap exposing his ears. His daddy and him like to go frogging at night, so he does spray some repelent on him, but he has always done that and no problems arose before. It is spring here now, summer is a few days away. The day before my son's ear started to swell, his daddy did put some kind of sealant on the bottom of his metal canoe. I am wondering if that could be the cause. But wouldnt you think that with the allergy benadryl he has been taking, that the ears would start to go down, instead of actually worsening. If it was an allergic reaction.  I will be back to let you know what the doctor has said. Thanks so much, you have lightened my load alot by helping me. Thanks, Shantell\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Well i have brought my son christian to the doctor. He said that it is definately not a allergic reaction. He said that he has either pus/blood in his ear, it is a bacteria infection. Maybe caused by a insect bite. He said that if it was an allergic reaction the area would not have fever in it and he would have it elsewhere besides his ears. He prescribed some Sulfatrim 200-40/5 Sus Alph, to him. He said that after one day for me to bring him into an ear specialist if i don't see any improvement. The generic name of his medicine is: Sulfamethoxazale and Trimethoprim. But his prescription name is: Sulfatrim. He has to take it every 12 hours for 1 week. I did tell the doctor of JSE, but he said he wasnt familiar with it. Also he said he would normally like to drain the ear in his office, but since he was so small and since it was in the face region, he wasnt going to do that.  Thank you so much for giving me feedback on what you think the cause might be. It was very helpful in me getting some sleep last night. And i really appreciate it!!.  Bye, Shantell\n\n",

Good to know that your son is receiving the right antibiotic, though, if painful and swollen, I would add an analgesic antiinflammatory drug along with the antibiotic, and apply dressing with some glycerine magsulfate to the swollen external [not internal] ear so as to let some of the fluid in the swelling get absorbed out. One of the best antibiotics, sulfa antibiotics are notorious for their propensity to cause serious reactions in patients who are already allergic to the drug, which I hope your son is not.

    "content": "Hello, Well i ended up bringing my son back up to the hospital today. Because his ears were swelling and i was worried. So i wanted to get them drained. I didnt know what would happen if they erupted. The Doctor spoke with me and i told him i wanted to possibly drain his ears. The Doctor thought he should. So they gave him a shot of pain medicine. Then they numbed his ear and drained his massively swollen ear into a needle holder. They said they would send it off to the lab to find out if it was infact infected. They then made a little cut line and got out all of the blood/fluid from his ear. They then had to do the same to the other ear. I had been talking with the Doctor about all the posibilities of what it could have been that caused this massive swelling in one of his ears and the progression of the other ear as well. And i had mentioned that he wore a ball cap and wore it so tight everyday that his ears were forceably flapping forward. The Doctor thinks that possibly, his hat being so tight and forcing his ears down could have possibly broke some blood vessels and then the ears could have been building up with calcuim, blood, fluid. So that is the conclusion he has come up with. And he said it was hematoma.  But my son was also around his father when he fiberglassed a boat with some sealant. So i don't know what the true cause of his ears to swell like that is!. The Doctor is keeping him on the antibiotic til the results come back from the lab. They dressed his ears and head and he has to wear the dressing for 3 days. The Doctor said that it might try to swell up again and if it does to come back in so they can drain them again. So that is it. Thanks so much for all your help bill!!!. Bye, Shantell\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Ok, this is the update on my son Christian. Well i ended up having to bring him to the hospital again to have his ear drained. The swelling would not go down. The antibiotics werent working. His ear was swelling massively and starting to hurt him real bad. So they drained it a second time.  The ER referred me to a Ear,Throat and Nose specialist. Because they were concerned with a deformity of the ear, that my son was starting to develop from the drainage and swelling of his ear. I went to the Ear Specialist  office on June 30th. His Doctor said he would have to go into surgery that night. That what he infact had was Auricular Hematoma {Califlower ear}.  His Doctor said that since the other doctors had just cut his ear a tiny bit, that it just kept building up pressure, and blood is what was filling his ear up. He went into surgery that night. They had to put him to sleep for the surgery. The surgery only lasted about 15 minutes. They cut his ear along the whole top rim of his helix, then sowed on a flattening thingy onto both sides of the ear. So that his ear would flatten out. Then they placed a cup on the side of his head.  I had to put some Bacitracin Zinc Ointment on his ear 3 times a day. And they prescribed him an antibiotic called Augmenten ES 600mg He went back to the doctor today {1week after surgery}. The doctor took off the stitchings and it looks better, just a tiny bit swollen and a tiny bit red.  But he has to finish off his 10 supply of Augmenten.  And he has to go back in another week. The Doctor said that he will most probaly have a deformity of the ear, that it will not look like the other ear, but there is a chance of it healing completely. I have to go back in one week from today {Monday}. I will update ya'll after i go. Thank You, Shantell\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, My grandson has breathing problems due to large tonsils. He had his adnoids out about 1 year ago.  He is 3 yrs old.  He is scheduled to have his tonsils out in about 3wks. I would say in the last 6 wks he has developed a very disturbing cough that always ends up with him throwing-up.  At first it was only on a hard cough, but now he throws up when he coughs every time and when he cries or laughs hard.  At night when he sleeps he seems to be in a deep sleep but then he starts coughing and ends up throwing-up 2-3 times every night, always arouond 2-3 am.. This episode is repeated every night and he throws-up enough to make a real mess on the sheets and floor.  He chokes easily on things that he could eat before, like sliced apple. Any bulky foods like bread going down cause him to gag.  He was in our pool (I'm the Grandma), last weekend and was playing and suddenly coughed and threw up in the water. We got him out and dryed off and dressed right away. This was a very warm day and when dryed his skin was warm. He had a bluish gray from the tip of his nose to his chim for about an hour after swimming. I am very worried but my daughter seems to think it's all related to the tonsils and all will be well when they come out.  I won't watch him by myself because his day care told my daughter that he choked and was very frightened but they were able to get the food out of his throat.  Am I being to worried over this?  I have noticed he a lot more quiet than he used to be. I feel he knows anything can set off the vomiting.  Is there anything from your experience that explains this?  I know you must be careful in what you say, but any information would be greatly appreciated.  Thank You, The Grandma, Pat.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear grandma, Pat  The possible explanation for your grandson condition is that due to his breathing problems, he became mouth breather. Mouth breathing is one of the factors that lead to throat infections (which are mainly viral in this age group). Being allergic is another explanation for persistent symptoms. Tonsillitis usually starts with the onset of sore throat leading to pain on swallowing. Dry cough and sore throat indicates a viral laryngitis an extension of the infection and inflammation to the larynx, which is usually associated with hoarse voice. This laryngitis explains the attacks of getting choked. The best treatment for his condition right now is steam inhalations and plenty of fluids. Having his symptoms for more than 2 weeks, have your grandson seen by an otolaryngologist, or ear, nose and throat specialist. This kind of specialist could rule out allergies and can prescribe the best treatment. Hope to hear he recovered soon. Thank you\n\n",

    "content": "I am very aware that what I am going to post is going to sound strange, and it is based on childhood recollections. However my memories are very vivid and I have recently discussed them with my mother who confirmed my story.  When I was very young -before the age of five- I remember being at my grandmother's house and going to use the bathroom.  Strangely, I recall that my urination was painful, and found that I was passing things that looked like white shells about the size of an adults thumbnail.  I know that I told my grandmother and mother, but I never remember being taken to the doctor.  The strange occurence stayed with me for the next 18 years and after checking with my mother to make sure it was not an overactive imagination, I began to do some online research.  I of course have not been able to find any information on \"solidified urine in the shape of shells\" which by the way returns some very strange results from a search engine.  The only other thing that I feel may be important to mention is that I was molested as a toddler and thought perhaps there was a connection to that.  It only happened to me once in my life, but I still am very curious what caused the abnormality...can someone shed some light?\n\n",

Sometimes things that we dreamed of are remembered as memories. If you find something in your research let me know. But I honestly wouldn't worry about this again. Best regards.\n\n",

If you wanted this further pursued you can have a urinalysis and make sure that you do not have too many crystals in the urine.
