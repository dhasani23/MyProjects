    "content": "Hi all,  Good Day,  I had bilateral Varicocelectomy in april 2009 for infertility reasons. then by July my we've got a baby girl:-)  Approx. in marsh 2010 i felt like small hard lump on the upper side of the left testis then it was associated with pain and enlarged somehow. i went to see the doctor \"who did the Varicocelectomy to me\" and he said - after having semen / urin analysis and culture + Ultra sound - it is epididymitis \"on the head of the left eppid.\". knowing that the S&U analysis and culture gave normal results \"no infiction, pus, RBC, WBC, or bacterial presence. only UltraSound give the indication\". and he gave me antibiotics for 20 and said the swilling will not go. now i don't feel the pain, although it is uncomfortable and some few times it tickles me. and now i am feeling that the tail of my right eppid. has the same feeleing \"swilling and tickling especially during sexual intercourse\". to confirm, I went to other urology doctors and all gave the same diagnosis after Ultrasound only.  my questions now are, is this a consequence of the Varicocelectomy? is it true that the swelling can't be removed? what is the cause of it if the semen/urin analysis showed nothing? shall i live with it peacefully?  Thanks a lot for your support,   kindest regards.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: can epididymitis lead to cancer?",
    "content": "Hi, Firstly let me congratulate you for the successful outcome of the varicocelectomy. Varicocelectomy per-se, is not expected to cause an epididymitis.  In clinical practice,one tends to classify epididymitis into - acute and - chronic types.  The pathogenesis of epididymitis in general, and chroinc epididymitis in particular is poorly understood. Although generally believed to be an infective process, a sizable number of these patients show no demonstrable evidence of infection.  There is no universally accepted definition for \"chronic\" epididymitis. Its incidence and prevalence have not been well studied.It remains a \"common and important, but neglected, urologic diagnosis.Some workers have recommended that it should be defined as \"symptoms of discomfort and/or pain at least 3 months in duration in the scrotum, testicle, or epididymis localized to one or each epididymis on clinical examination\" (Rev Urol. 2003 Fall; 5(4): 209\u2013215.).  An epididymitis (inflammation of the epididymis), generally regarded to be due to a retrograde entry of organisms via the vas deferens. This affects the tail of the epididymis first,then its body and then its head.The swelling may persist for varying lengths of time despite adequate treatment.  Varicocelectomy is not an accepted cause of epididymitis.   You have not indicated whether the ultrasound report indicated an \"acute\" or a \"chronic\" epididymitis. In your case,it is important first to determine whether your symptoms are indeed as a result of epididymitis.   Epididymectomy certainly feasible and in several studies it is  shown to be beneficial in relieving the symptoms of 'chronic' epididymitis.  In uncomplicated acute epididymitis, management is in most cases, non-operative.  I feel that you should quit worrying excessively and let your doctor deal with it based on the clinical findings and the results of the various tests. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, A hard lump in the scrotum can be due to a variety of conditions ranging from completely benign causes to malignant tumors of the testes. As a malignant testicular lump is usually hard (and charecteristically \"heavy\", with an associated loss of normal testicular sensation), excluding this possibility is the overriding concern.  I will to provide you with some basic information about some of the causes of a hard lump in the scrotum.  Syphilic gumma of the testis: rare these days. it is a characteristic lesion of tertiary syphilis.It presents as a hard, smooth and painless lump.Histopthology: Although infrequent, spirochetes may be identified in the necrotic centers of gummas.  Chronic hematoceles: Hematoceles are commomly dur to trauma, but can als be caused by tumos. If an acute haematocele is not drained, a clotted haematocele usually results and course of time, may get calcified. It is usually hard/painless and closely resembles testicular tumours  Bilharzial epididymitis and orchitis: causes chronic granulomas that can feel very hard and mimic testicular malignancy.  Tubercular epididymitis and orchitis: can present as irregular, hard scrotal mass.  Brucellosis of the male genital tract: very rare, but when it occurs, can produce a mass in the testis which may be very difficult to distinguish from a testicualr tumor.  Post vasectomy seminal granulomas: can present as hard lumps.  Tense hydroceles: any hydrocele if tense,may feel very hard.  Filarial hydroceles with calcified walls: can resemble testicular tumors clinically.  Testicular actinomycosis: can cause a hard swelling but, presence of sinuses is charecteristic.  You certainly need to have a scrotal  ultrasonographic examination which will help in sorting out this issue. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Pain in right testicle",
    "content": "Hello. I am a 20 year old male in pretty good general health.  Since about November of 2004, I have been having an off and on pain in my right testicle. It started suddenly one day and felt like an ache. There was no swelling or blood in my fluids or anything. I saw a doctor at a walk-in clinic the next day who examined me for signs of torrosion but she couldn't find anything. A urine test was also done (which didn't show anything out of the ordinary). The doctor then referred me to get an ultrasound done on my testicles which I had done in December and that too did not show anything wrong. My family doctor also examined me to signs of testicular cancer and also had me do another urine test which showed nothing again. The first time I had the pain lasted for about a week or two. It started in my right testicle and felt like an ache with occasional sharp pains. The pain stayed in my right side 90% of the time, very rarely I was able to feel pain on my left side. Eventually the pain became more dull and started to radiate away from testicles and down into my buttocks and eventually went away. It was uncomfortable to stay seated or to walk for long periods during this time. My family doctor couldn\u2019t figure out what was wrong but decided since the pain went away that it might have just been some infection and to not worry about it unless it came back. Well, a few months later (in February I think) my pain came back. It was the same as before, more or less, but it didn\u2019t hurt as long or as much. I got a referral to a Urologist whom I was unable to see until May. During that time my testicle pain had come and gone several times. The urologist examined me and couldn\u2019t think of what was wrong. He said that it might be an infection that\u2019s going away but keeps flaring up every now and then but he said that it was \u201cimpossible to tell\u201d and the only thing he suggest was for me to take some Tylenol or other over the counter pain medication and to maybe see him again when the pain comes back.  Well, since then the pain has come back and it\u2019s starting to annoy me even more. I haven\u2019t gotten around to calling up the urologist because I\u2019ve been busy and also because I\u2019m frustrated that he didn\u2019t give me any help last time I saw him. I have no idea what it is, but I have a good idea what it isn\u2019t (ie, cancer, torrosion, etc). Does anyone have any ideas at all? Thanks.  PS, I\u2019m not currently sexually active and since I last was I have been tested for STDs and nothing was found. Although I did get a message saying that the manufacturer of the urine test that was used for my STD test issued a worldwide recall of their urine tests because it produced higher than acceptable false negatives. But since that STD test I\u2019ve had several other urine tests done that showed nothing. Just to be sure I\u2019m going to the clinic sometime this week for a retest\u2026in the meantime, any help would be appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Cosmosys  I wanted to reply to you becuase i too have exactly the same problem which you are describing and i too have had all of the tests which you have had.  My doctor though told me that the pain is called Varicecole (excuse my spelling).  This is nothing serious purely simple.  It is when sperm ducts become blocked and infected which is why there is occasional pain and discomfort along with occosional swelling.  I have been experiencing this since the age of about 14 and i too am now 20.  It is nothing to worry about and you just have to live with it.  Doctors have said you can have surgey however they do not recommend it as its not life threatening etc.  Take my advice and try not to feel or touch you testis when possible and this should delay intervals of regular pain.  You may find from time to time that they will be triggered by the way you are sitting down or if you wear tight underwear.  You just have to live with it and be assured that this is actually very common amongst men these days.  I cannot say this is 100% what you have but by the sounds of things plus the fact that you have been tested for everything else it is more than likely.  You may also have varicous veins in your scrotum which could also be the cause.  Just remember its not life threatening and it will not affect your fertility.  Hope you feel more assured now you know someone else has same problem.  You are welcome to email me if you wish aaronman1289@aol.com\n\n",

Since then my piles have gone with change in habits and the testicle pain has reduced but havent gone altogether. Hope this is any help\n\n",

It lasted for a week, I went to the doctor, he immediately sent me for an ultrasound and I'm waiting for the results.  The pain went away for a couple days and is back now.  The pain is throbbing.  It's not totally like a throbbing thumb from hitting it with a hammer, but it is similar.  It's only in the left, othing in the right.   On a scale of 1-10 it's probably a pain of 3 when it throbs today but last week at it's worst, it was probably a 6 or 7.  Is ths what you guys had/have?\n\n",

My friend who is a dr said it sounds like a hydrocele which is an accumulation of fluid in the ducts. I explained it felt ropey and he said it probably is a hydrocele but of course as any good dr would do would recommend me to see a reg dr for evaluation. The one thing I notice is that when I gain weight, I notice it happens more often than when i keep my weight off. And if I can be frank,  I also notice that if I am fooling around with a woman and stimulated but hold off on having an orgasm I will have a lot of discomfort in that area as well. My testicle never gets swollen and i have not felt any lumps pr anything on it. The pain just seems to get worse ifd sitting for too long and i feel some relief if i push down on the testicle and stetch it from the tubes that it is connected to because it feels like its crampnig.

    "content": "Hello,  I too have been experiancing a similar pain since late September. It started as a dull pain in my left testicle. Since late October it has since traveled to the upper portion of my scrotum, and into my abdomen. At times becoming so severe that I can not walk right, or sit correctly. I have been to the ER 3 times, and have seen my family doctor over 4 times dealing with this. I have have ultrasounds, Blood, Urine, and on 12-28 a CT scan. My doctor believes it is Prostatitis, during the ultrasound they did find a 3mm cyst on my left testicle (the one I am having pain in) but according to my family doctor that is not the cause of the pain, according to him cysts are very common. My doctor is now leaning more towards a lodged kidney stone somewhere. Hence the CT scan. I have been on Doxycycline for 2 months. (according to my doctor; prostate infections can take well over 2 months to clear up with anti-biotics) I did a 15 day cycle of Cipro, as well as one other that I don't remember. When going through periods of severe pain, Percocet is the only pain medication that helps. I am hoping that I may get some answers on Monday from the CT scan. Good luck everyone.\n\n",

The clinical condition would probably fall under Chronic pelvic pain syndromes(CPPS).The cause of this is not known but may be related to depression.There are no specific tests here and only by excusion of other conditions.But then the condition it self is real and not psychological and could be debilitating.It is not life threatening,not venereal and not contageous. Prostatic massage,Therapeutic ejaculation,physiotherapy,sitz baths are some of the treatment options.Do consult a urologist again if symptoms persist. Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Wanted to post this in case anyone else was going through the same. Its a lil ackward. Mgrier1190 and jsmayhue, i have a similar issue.   Im a 27 year old male, very healthy. I am experiencing pain in my right testicle. From what I can tell, its not the actual testicle, but rather the epidimis(sp). The pain goes from the testicle, to the epididmis, and becomes an ache in my lower right back. Sometimes the back ache is worse than the actual testicle ache. I have found that this happens almost like you get blue balls. I will become aroused, if there is no release, the pain sets in. My testicle and the epidimis especially become hardened. I have found that massaging it helps, although sometimes that only alleviates the pain, and that if I masturbate, that is the only surefire way to solve the issue. Afterwards, my testicle will still ache and remain hard for several hours.   Its terribly uncomfortable at times. When the testicle and the connective stuff at the bottom are hardened, my testicle kind of resembles Africa, if that makes any sense, lol.  As in Mgrier1190s situation, i notice that when I masturbate, my semen looks different and there is definitely a clear watery liquid being released that isnt usually there. As in jsmayhues situation, the same testicle will sometimes slip back above the base of my shaft if I am on bottom. It freaked me out the first time that happened, and has an uncomfortable feel to it, but it just pops back down I have learned.  To complete the whole deal, i have a varicocele on my left testicle. Lefty has only hurt me once or twice, and that was when I was younger and it doesnt bother me anymore.   Hit me up if anyone is having similar issues. The frequency and easy of this coming on has gotten worse, so im going to get it checked.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: right testicle small..no pain but the left one is normal.",
    "content": "Hi, When a doctor examines the scrotum, he/she tries to assess (among other things) the following... - size(volume) of the testicle - consistency of the testicle - 'Lie' of the testicle - status of the spermatic cord - associated hydroceles - varicoceles.  Generally size is less important than consistency. A normal testis feels firm. A testis which is  relatively small in size will be considered normal if the consistency is firm.  A small, soft, testis indicates testicular atrophy. A horizontal 'lie' (normal testicular 'lie' is vertical), may suggest an increased risk for testicular torsion - which can lead to a small, atrophic testis.  Mastubation(to the best of my knowledge) does not make the testis smaller. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello.   Ten years ago I found a small lump on my right testicle measuring roughly 2.5 mm in diameter. I had an ultrasound and was told that it was not cancer. However, since then the testicle and the area around it has become more painful. The pain ranges from an easily ignorable dullness to sharp stabs. Sometimes the pain goes away entirely. The lump has grown only slightly since it was first checked, perhaps increasing in size by 30%.   A couple of possible contributing factors that I should mention are: - I cycle every day for at least two hours and have done so for nine years.  - I broke my hip, pelvis and neck in several places fifteen years ago (I've often wondered about referred pain from the pelvis, which is now arthritic).   I am 32 years of age.   Many thanks for any responses.   Philip\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, It would have been very helpful if you had mentioned the exact location of the swelling. A selling at the top of the testicle could be  - a swollen head of the epididymis(due to epididymitis- acute and chronic)   - an appendix of the testis, or - an an appendix of the epididymis. Appendix of the testis and appendix of the epididymis are embryological, vestigial, cystic structures. A swelling at the bottom of the testis could be a thickened tail of the epididymis(again due to epdidymitis).  The swelling in your case is unlikely to be related to cycling. Trauma could cause a swelling in relation to the testicle(hematocele).Your description does not favour a referred pain due to pelvic trauma.  Best Wishes!\n\n",

I sometimes have issues with maintaining an erection. Most notibly, I have a significant loss of ejaculate (not much more than a drop)but still am able to achieve orgasm. I do notice that I usually need to urinate afterwards. Is this a typical side effect of one or a combination of both the surgery and radiation?

    "content": "Hi, You say \"I have numbness from the incision.. down to the inside of the upper most part of my left leg and partially up the side of my scrotum\". This is in the distribution of the ilio-inguinal nerve.The skin at the incision site itself is predominantly supplied by the ilio-hypogastric nerve.This dysfunction of the ilio-inguinal nerve will most likely get better in course of time.  Radical Inguinal Orchidectomy and adjuvant radiotherapy per-se should not cause a significant loss of ejaculate.Retrograde ejaculation is a possibility.  Sexual dysfunctions after adjuvant radiotherapy (especially the so called \"Dog's leg field\") are known to occur (often, temporary oligozoospermia) but impotence does not appear to be major side effect.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: tender top of one testicle",
    "content": "Hi, The hard lump that you feel just at the top of the testicle i guess, is the thickened 'head' of the epididymis.It is probable that during the UTI episode, you might have developed an epididymitis (inflammation of the epididymis), generally due to a retrograde entry of organisms via the vas deferens. This affects the tail of the epididymis first,then its body and then its head. The swelling may persist for varying lengths of time despite adequate treatment. The smaller swelling you refer to, may turn out to be an appendix of the testis ( a developmental,vestigial structure) - can cause acute pain if it undergoes torsion of its pedicle (may even be mistaken for testicular torsion). An ultrasonological examination will give a definitive answer.Best wishes.\n\n",

I went to the docs and he could not find it, its rather small (around 2mm) he told me plainly he could not find it and to return if its grew or causing pain.  I can still find it and it does appear to be growing.  What is also concerning is that the testicle its on appears to be shrinking!.  Does anyone have any idea what it could be.  I know that it could be cancer but its unliky.  I am 24.  A few things the doc said concerned me - he told me that cancer was very unlikly in my age group in the testicle (epidemiology states i am bang in the middle of the high risk group) and he told me only if it caused pain should i be concerned which is also not true.  I left not knowing if the doc was lying to reassure (which in the days of the internet is pointless) or if he was not to clued up on TC.  Anyone any ideas if i should be concerned and if i should go back to the doc and ask to see a urologist?  Thanks for the time its much appretiated.\n\n",

I am not sure what to think since it is not on an actual testicle just inside the skin of the scrotum.  It doesn't have any kind of head which leads me to believe it's not any kind of pimple or something.  It only hurts a little bit if I have been touching it.  I am very  worried it may be cancerous.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  This could be a varicocele. A varicocele is a dilatation of the veins within the scrotum. Varicoceles are commonly seen on the left side than in the right due to different anatomic factors. Varicocele can lead to discomfort around the testicle, rather than actual pain in the testicle itself.   Other causes of scrotal swelling (less likely) are hydrocele, hernia, spermatocele, and tumors. - A hydrocele is a bag of clear fluid that collects in a sac around the testicle. It may be the result of a direct injury or occur spontaneously in the remnants of an embryonic sac that remains formed around the testicle from birth. Small hydroceles may hardly be noticed and often resolve without treatment.   - Hernia occurs when the local support tissues weaken, allowing loops of the bowel to slip from the abdomen into the groin.   - Testicular cancer usually affects only one testicle. It rarely presents with pain or discomfort in a testicle or the scrotum. Typically, testicular cancer produces a painless swelling of one testicle.  Direct clinical examination is essential, US will further help in the diagnosis. So, I advise you to follow up with your doctor. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "My 23 year old brother just advised me that he has had tumors growing on his left testicle for over a year now. He said that it has gotten to the point that his stomach aches from it and the pain travels down his left leg. He stated that the left testicle swells tremendously when hes standing but when he lies down, the swelling goes away. He does not have any pain in the testicle, but he does have an aching pain in the stomach and sharp pains that travel down his left leg.  In addition to this, he has started to grow tumors behind both of his ears. He has also lost weight. He refuses to go to the doctor! He has tried to impregnant his gf to determine if he is infertile, with no success. I should also mention that approximately two years ago, he caught gonnorhea and kept it a secret and did not receive any treatment for over 2mths because he did not know what was going on with his body. After having it for over 2mnths, he was in excrutiating pain in his lower abdomen and had to be taken to the emergency room for dx and treatment. He is embarrassed and ashamed and is scared to seek treatment.   He believes he has cancer and I'm so worried about him! What does this sound like to you? Do these sound like symptoms of testicular or prostate cancer.\n\n",

Regardless, the symptoms must be addressed as soon as possible in order to have the best outcome.  Do whatever you can to convince him to see his doctor at the earliest opportunity.  Reassure him that there is no need to be embarrassed or ashamed; he is just one person among many with similar issues, and the medical provider should also reassure him.  If his doctor is judgemental, see someone else. Whatever happens, it is urgent that his symptoms are medically evaluated.  I wish him well.  Faye, RN, MSW\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  Normally the opacity and amount of semen wouldn't be much of a consideration, but since it seems to mark a change consistent with the appearance of this enlarged and tender testicle, I'm a little skeptical about the \"nothing\" finding, because. I would think at the least your doctor would want to explore what might be causing this. They complaint could be normal, but it also could be caused by a spermatic cyst, hydrocele, orchitis, and a number of other, mostly quite benign but nonetheless annoying problems which can be treated to minimize the discomfort.   I'd be more aggressive and let the doctor know this is not only uncomfortable but also worrisome, and seek either additional reassurance or further study, whichever seems appropriate. It may well be a nothing, but if it's causing symptoms and is a worry, it deserves further attention.  I hope this helps. Good luck to you. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  This could be due to epididymitis an infection that is usually caused by bacteria. The bacteria usually get to the epididymis by moving back through the urethra (urine passes through the urethra from the bladder). The exact bacteria are identified in about 80% of cases.  Two main groups of organisms cause epididymitis: sexually transmitted organisms and coliforms (organisms that live in the intestines).  - In men younger than 35 years, the causes are usually the same organisms that cause sexually transmitted diseasess by chlamydia (responsible for nearly 50-60% of cases) and gonorrhea.  - In those older than 35 years and men who participate in anal intercourse, the causes are usually coliforms, which are bacteria (such as Escherichia coli) that live in the intestines. These organisms also cause bladder infections.  - Chemical epididymitis (rare) is inflammation caused by the backward flow of urine when exercising or having sex with a full bladder.  Symptoms include testicular or scrotal pain, abdominal pain, dysuria, and discharge from the urethra. Conjunctivitis is reported in association with sexually transmitted diseases causing urethral infection (although rare) through autoinoculation by the hands from the genitalia to the eyes.  Diagnosis is based on complete history, clinical examination and investigations that include urine analysis and isolation of the organism from discharge and by culture.  Other causes of scrotal pain include orchitis, varicocele and hydrocele; cancer; an inguinal hernia or pelvic congestion. Pain can also be referred to the testicles from conditions such as ureteric stones or spinal pathology.   Blue balls is a temporary congestion in the scrotum and prostate region that commonly results when prolonged sexual stimulation of the erect penis does not end with in orgasm and ejaculation.   Testicular cancer is less likely since it typically presents with a painless swelling of one testicle.   I would advise you to follow up with your doctor and to exclude infectious causes. Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It is very unlikely you have cancer but I understand this is often the first thing that comes to mind when something is different on our bodies.  Fluid or blood can become trapped, and hernias can develop when there is weakness in the abdominal wall, allowing a bit of intestine to loop into the scrotum, creating a lump.  Cancer is lower on the likelihood list but you will need to brave it and see a doctor for a correct diagnosis to be sure.  I know this can be difficult.  If you are not comfortable with your family doctor, see a urologist - this is what he does every day so try to get over the discomfort.  There are few people out there who enjoy having their sexual organs examined by \"strangers\" even in the medical field - this includes women as well as men.  But, it is important to do these difficult things for our health.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  There are many possible causes of testicular pain, however, Pain in the testicle and in the nipple makes exclusion of endocrine causes essential.   Endocrine causes could be due to a transient problem or chronic conditions like regular exogenous hormone intake, increased serum estrogen, or decreased testosterone production. Conditions associated with hormonal level changes include certain testicular tumors, endocrine gland disorders and some genetic abnormalities.  These chronic conditions however, are mostly associated with hypertrophy of breast tissue, chest adipose tissue and skin causing what is known as gynaecomastia (breast enlargement in males).  Other causes of testicular pain include:  infections such as epididymitis or orchitis; varicocele and hydrocele; an inguinal hernia or pelvic congestion and trauma or surgery. Pain can also be referred to the testicles from conditions such as ureteric stones or spinal pathology.   A direct physical examination is very important and investigations include US on testicles and evaluation of hormone levels in the blood.   I would advise you to follow up with your doctor and to seek direct medical consultation.  Hope you find this information useful  please keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,   In general the pulling up reflex (cremastric) is normal physiological reflex and generaly declines with age. This is usually a protective mechanism for example when the testicle expose to cold temperature, however both testicles usually go up.   It could be possible that there was a sort of friction or mild trauma that caused this effect however, it is not usual to remain for some time as you described.  So, I advise you to follow up with your doctor. Direct clinical examination is essential to exclude any other conditions that may need intervention. Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "title": "Lump on top of testicle",
    "content": "Hi everyone!  For the past year or so, I have been worrying myself to death. I found a lump in my testicle one morning whilst doing a self-examination. The lump is attached to the top of the right testicle. I have been too scared to go to the doctors, incase it is Cancer. I know sitting here will do nothing, so I've finally plucked up the courage and I've got an appointment for tomorrow morning. One of the reasons I didn't go straight away, is because I didn't have any pubic hair and was worried what the doctor would think. I'm now 16, have pubic hair, and my penis has grown so I'm a little more relaxed but still feel anxious.  This may sound like a daft question, but what's the procedure? I just tell him I've found a lump in my testicle ? Will he mention anything about my puberty development and do some checks? The reason I ask is, because I'm a small guy, only 5'3\" but I believe I am in the midst of my growth spurt -- just started getting underarm hair.  Onto another thing. I have Fordyce's spots. Is there any way to remove these, or is there any gel to reduce the look of them? Will these go away at the end of puberty?  Thanks in advance.  Kind Regards, Jason\n\n",

    "content": "Hello SamTheMan9988,  If this mass is directly on top of the testis, you may be feeling the epididymus.  This should be present on both sides, though.  There is another condition known as a varicocele that is a collection of dilated veins within the scrotum.  Nearly always they form on the left.  I would recommend you have your doctor evaluate this to see if this is what is going on.  Often, varicoceles are asymptomatic.  They can present with some pain in the scrotum, infertility and occasionally testicular shrinking.  If it is causing problems, a varicocele can be repaired surgically.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Jamie2700,  I'm not exactly certain what you may be feeling.  Generally there are not large lumps in the scrotum (with the exception of the testis themselves and the epididymus which sits directly on top of each testis).  Occasionally there are veins in the scrotum that you may be feeling, though your description doesn't really sound like this.  I would recommend you have your doctor examine these lumps when you're in the office next.  If they begin to enlarge or you have many more you should probably go sooner just to be sure everything is OK.  Given your age, this is pretty unlikely to be anything bad.  It's best to have this examined so you can be sure of everything.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm 27 years old, I've worked a physical job for the past 6 years, but I must say that I'm very overweight, I weigh a least 240lbs and I'm only 5'8\".  I experienced a back injury at work about 8 weeks ago, I'd taken some time off and went hard back at it and managed to hurt myself. The next day, I had pain in my back and 3 days later that spread into my left testicle. I went to the Dr. she thought it was a Hernia. Whilst waiting for the Ultrasound results, I noticed my right testicle became extremely swollen.  I went back to the Dr. and the Ultrasound didn't show a Hernia. He suspected Epididymitis (this was a different Dr.) and put me on Cipro for 2 weeks.  The swelling in my Right testicle quickly went away, only to be replaced by intermittent pain and now they were both testicles were becoming hard and heavy about 20-30 times a day. They did this at the time, but this heavy/hardness doesn't add to the pain.  I went back to the Doctor yesterday, he's finally sending me for a sonogram of my testicles, which I asked for 6 weeks ago, but is keeping me on the Cipro for another 10 days as it seemed to reduce the swelling in my Right testicle. He checked my prostate, but didn't say anything. I would have imagined if it was swollen he would have said so.  In short, I now have pain in BOTH my testicles, (it began just in my left testicle), this pain alternates between testicles. I don't experience pain in both testicles at the same time, it's either one or the other. My testicles become heavy and hard at least 20 times a day and they do this at the same time. The painful testicle doesn't get worse or better once they're heavy and hard.  Can you give me some idea what this is? I've never heard of anything like this before. Can I have testicular Cander in both testicles?\n\n",

Your description doesn't make me very suspicious of cancer.    Off hand, I'm not sure exactly what may be causing this.  An infection is possible although I'm not convinced of this.  It may also be a condition such as intermittent testicular torsion where the testis twists on its veins cutting off blood flow.  This can be a serious issue as the testis may become damaged or even die if blood flow is not restored quickly (within a few hours).  Typically, the pain with torsion is very intense.  I would recommend you see a urologist for further evaluation of this.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello hair123,  I am sorry to hear about your diagnosis. Testicular cancer is curable in the majority of cases. By curable I mean long term cure as opposed to simply going into remission.   Many clinical parameters are used to determine the overall prognosis of the condition. This way a doctor can answer a patient when he asks questions like - will the tumor return? What are the chances of cure? What are the symptoms that I should expect and will my condition get worse? All of that is known as prognosis.  HCG and AFP are two of the many parameters that are used to answer these questions.  So this is how your doctor would think about it:  If you have nonseminomatous cancer the following characteristics are considered good:  1. Is located in the testis or in an area known as the retroperitoneal space  and  2. Your cancer hasn't spread to other organs (determined by CT scans etc). If they spread to the lungs its ok - any other organ its not ok. 3. If your tumor markers are good  - -fetoprotein (AFP) less than 1,000 ng/mL  - Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) less than 5,000 IU/mL (1,000 ng/mL) - Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) less than 1.5 \u00d7 the upper limit of normal   90% of patients with these characteristics were found to be alive and doing well 5 years  after diagnosis when research was done to find out what happened to them. Overall up to 95% were still alive at 5 years (albeit a small proportion of about 5% may have had the disease at that time and were receiving treatment.  So, this isn't really a cancer in the traditional sense. I hope that answers your question and let me know if you need anything else!  Best regards,\n\n",

    "title": "Possible Testicular & Lung Cancer, Insurance Issues",
    "content": "Hi, I'm 21 and male. I don't know if I have family history of cancer since I don't know my dad. The only surgeries I've had are to get my tonsils and adenoids removed when I was six. I'm not on any medication. Now that I have that out of the way, here is my problem. A year and a half ago I was taking a bath and I noticed I had a mass inside of my scrotum. It's on the left testicle, and has a strange rubbery consistency to it. I was scared and wanted to go to the doctor, but I was living on my own and barely had enough money for food, not to mention that I had no insurance. It didn't have any pain in it, so I just put it out of my mind for a long time. Over the past year and a half, the entire tube (vas deferens I think) has become thicker and rubbery. The rubbery mass is right above the testicle, I don't think it's actually on it. A couple of months ago it started to ache, and since then the aching has been getting steadily worse. I examined my left testicle and compared it to my right one and I'm pretty sure the tube on the left one is thicker and kind of numb. It just doesn't feel the same way the other one does. I also examined my left testicle and I think that the rubbery mass is acutally the epididymis. It hurts when I touch it now, and I think it's harder than the epididymis on my right testicle, but I'm not sure because it hurts when I touch it. On top of all this, five days ago I started coughing for no reason. Ever since then I've been coughing every couple of minutes. I don't feel sick at all and I don't even want to cough, but it's just happening constantly. I looked up the symptoms for lung cancer and  the first one that was on the list was 'having a cough most of the time'. Then two days ago I decided to go for a run in the park. I made up my mind to run four complete laps around the park. After I ran the first lap I was completely out of breath and had to sit down for a few minutes. Just so you know, I am 6'3\" and weigh 180 pounds and I have never in my life had any problems running. I just don't run out of breath like that. After running the second lap I had to take an even longer break and I was gasping for air. Same with the third lap, and after running the fourth I felt a pain in my kidney and had to sit down for a while before even walking home. I'm worried that I might have testicular cancer and that it spread through my body and into my lungs. I don't have any pain in my lungs or any other symptoms other than the constant coughing. Also, I don't have a job now and I am living with a relative, and I don't have insurance. I really want to get this checked out but I don't know what to do. I looked up the medical costs for testicular cancer and one patient said the total cost for him so far was $175,000. That would ruin my life. But having cancer would kill me. Please help, thanks in advance.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Pod123,  I suspect that you most likely have 2 separate issues going on, one in the lungs and one in the testes.  The mass you are describing in the testes is very consistent with the epididymis.  It can become inflamed due to infection or trauma and can cause some pain and swelling. If this pain does not improve it is best to see a doctor.  If STD's are possible I would recommend you be tested since many of these can cause infection of the epididymis.  Cancer is likely quite low on the list of things to be causing this.  The cough may be due to an infection.  An infection that may tie the two things together is a bacteria called mycoplasma pneumonia.  This infection is commonly known as a \"walking pneumonia\" because it tends to cause a cough and cold-like symptoms but often is not severe enough to cause someone to be admitted to the hospital.  It can also cause inflammation of the epididymus.  I would recommend you see a doctor for an evaluation.  There are often clinics that can see patients on a free or reduced fee basis based on income.  Your local health department can help locate these clinics if needed.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Here is my situation/symptoms:  There is a hard, dense, painless mass on the skin of my scrotum.  It is smaller than a pea and is visible because it is very white and the rest of my scrotum is a slightly darker color.  There does not appear to be any hair growing out of it.  I am 21, and have some family history of cancer but not testicular cancer.  I am on no medications.  I do not think that it is cancer because it is attached to the scrotum and not the testis.  Could this still be cancerous?  Is this something that I should be concerned about?  If it is some kind of virus could it spread if I wait a few months before seeing a doctor?  Any insights I would greatly appreciate.  Thank you!\n\n",

    "title": "firm bump in upper scrotum",
    "content": "A week and a half or so ago I noticed a small(smaller than a pea) size bump on the upper left side of my scrotum. It's aprox' 1/2 an inch from the base of the shaft. At first I thought it was a pimple and tried to pop it or possibly an ingrown hair(which is really what it looks like). That didn't do anything except make it sore. It feels as though it is on or next to a tube. I can pull the skin tight around it which makes it look as though it is right under the skin. It is not on the testicle or near it really. Two days ago I tried to pop it again..not sure why I thought it would pop this time. Nothing new this time..just a little drop of blood where I tried to break the skin. It seems I irritated it as it has become swollen around the area of the bump(the swollen area seems mushy and is under the skin too) as well as mildy painfully if I touch it. It only hurt before if I was trying to squeeze it. The pain can be described as someone squeezing a testicle and other times it just feels like a group of pubic hair on the scrotum was being pulled. The pain stays within the area of the bump and doesn't seem to radiate anywhere.  Any help is appreciated. Joe\n\n",

Dr Lowe, I couldn't find the same lump on the other side, however, when I went to the doctor he managed to locate it and said that it was the epididymus. He suggested that when checking myself I should be looking for lumps in the main \"body\" of the testicle rather than at the top (although not to totally ignore the top) would you agree with that? Thanks again for your response, this site and others like it are an excellent resource for information and I hope it continues for a long time to come! Dave\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 28 y/o male with 10 year history of embroynal cell carcinoma & teratoma that was initially staged as greater than stage I and eventually stage II testicular carcinoma.  I've had orchiectomy (with persistently elevated post-operative tumor markers), 3 rounds of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin based chemotherapy, bilateral RPLND, and right-sided pyleoplasty (in that order).  Pyleoplasty is for chronically obstructed UPJ following scarring due to RPLND. Currently diagnosed with hypertension (presumed to be due to the RPLND).    Family history of colon cancer, adenocarcinoma, cancer of the larynx, hypertension (all grandparents, and all diagnosed within 6 months of my diagnoses).  I'm currently diagnosed with and managed by a nephrologist for hypertension.       Current medications:  Metoprolol & Hyzaar (for blood pressure and tachycardia), Cymbalta (for depression and nerve pain) and trazodone (for sleeping & pain I suppose).       Since my last round of Chemotherapy almost 9 years ago, my AFP level has been consistently rising slowly.  It's outside the normal range.,.which is why I suppose I'm still being monitored.  bHCG is below detectable leves.  CT scans of Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis show no marked interval change over the past few years.       Over the past few months I've had a persistent cough and decrease in energy.   It's been about 6 months since my last checkup and I've got another one scheduled for next tuesday.  My question is this -- how worried should I be, and what is the risk of recurrence after 10 years?  (I assume that my Dr. is still worried, at least a little bit, seeing as how he's still seeing me almost 10 yrs after initial diagnosis, and he's cheif of staff at a major university hospital).  What are your thoughts?  Please ease my mind.  Thanks, Mark\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Mh006720,  I probably am not going to give you the answer you were hoping for.  In general, recurrence risk with stage 2 testicular cancer is low; however, there are many factors that contribute to risk.  Unfortunately, your risk will never be zero.  The longer it has been, the lower the risk.  The big problem with statistics is that no matter what the risk, if recurrence occurs, your rate of recurrence is 100%.  Many cancers result in lifelong monitoring so I would not say you are at increased risk simply because you are still being followed.  Your rising AFP is a little concerning.  The undetectable HCG is a good sign.  I wish I could give you a more solid answer on your risk but I simply can't based on the limitations of the internet.  Seeing your oncologist again will be very helpful and you'll likely get a better answer.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Pain can also be referred to the testicles from conditions such as ureteric stones or spinal pathology.  I suggest that you have a direct evaluation by a urologist / andrologist in order to assess the possibility of infection or varicocele.  Good luck.\n\n",

A varicocele is present on the left and there is no hydrocele collection of fluid, A direct reduceable hernia is present on the left.  My general Doc said there was nothing to worry about, but he didn't explain me the results. I hope some can explain me this results ij plain english b'cause I'm still worried about it  thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  The explanation of the findings in your report is as follows:  - Hernia occurs when the local support tissues weaken, allowing loops of the bowel to slip from the abdomen into the groin. Usually, it causes pain and may be a bulge when standing upright, movement, or bearing down are present.   - A varicocele is a dilatation of the veins within the scrotum. Varicoceles are commonly seen on the left side than in the right due to different anatomic factors. Varicocele can lead to discomfort around the testicle, rather than actual pain in the testicle itself.   - The cyst at the head of the epididymis is probably A spermatocele. It  is a collection of sperm in a sac that develops next to the epididymis. Most are painless. While most spermatoceles need no treatment, one that becomes large or bothersome can be removed surgically.  - A hydrocele is a bag of clear fluid that collects in a sac around the testicle and may be the result of a direct injury.  - Testicular  microlithiasis (Microcalcification) is formed of concentric cores of calcification of intrasubstance collagen fibers. They have been reported to be associated with germ cell tumors in some studies.   Each of these medical problems has a specific medical approach.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm 24. A little less than 2 years ago (like 19 months ago) I felt a painless pea shaped \"thing\" on the backside of my left testicle. I have no idea if it was always there and I just now felt it for the first time, or if it was new. It doesn't hurt when I touch it.  To locate it, I kind of have to put my finger at the bottom of the testicle on the front side, and then sort of scoop under and go up very slightly. That's where it seems to be located... behind the testicle near the bottom.  It's hard for me to remember, but it is possible that around that time I did experience some groin pain (pretty much only if I bent over to touch my toes). However, I do a lot of weight training, so I figured that was the cause, which it certainly might have been. The pain went away completely within a week or two. Again, this was almost 2 years ago.  My first question is, based on this description, what could it be?  My second question is, does the fact that it has been there and remained (as far as I can tell) exactly the same for almost 2 years make it any less likely that it's something serious, such as cancer?  I know an examination by a doctor is the only way to know for sure, but I'd still love to hear some opinions anyway. Thanks in advance for any help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  If this swelling is a superficial skin swelling (scrotal) then inflammation of the Hair follicles and sebaceous (sweat) glands are to be considered.   Otherwise causes like spermatocele, varicocele and testicular cancer (less likely) should be investigated.  Epididymitis may cause scrotal swelling but signs of inflammation like pain, skin redness and Odem are present.   Although cancer usually present with painless swelling, it can result in a number of signs and symptoms that are usually persistent and even increase in severity with time. These symptoms include:  Enlargement in either testicle  A feeling of heaviness in the scrotum  A dull ache in the lower abdomen or groin  Scrotal odema    The history you have given makes a benign cause is more likely to be reason of your swelling.  I advise you to seek direct medical consultation. Keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "First off I have crecentic IGA Nephropaty and was treated last year with cytoxan. i was also on testosterone and a number of other medicines.  I don't know if that makes a difference to suceptabiliity to cancers or not.  Anyway about a little over a month ago i had what seemed like a big pimple on my scrotum, when i squeezed it pus would come out but i would still feel a small lump in there that wouldnt go away like a cyst or something.  It started out very small, about half a pea size i would say.  This went on for about a month then last night it was kind of tender, it has never been tender to the touch before.  it had grown to about a pea size, the skin was tighter over the swollen area than before, i tried to pop it and very little puss came out then blood so i stopped, now the area around it has swolen, it is not hard like the pea sized lump but the surrounding scrotum is swolen a little, im guessing from the irritation of trying to pop it.  the reason i am writing this is i believe if it was cancerous it would not be pussing?  if it continues to grow or become more painfull i will see my doctor but i was planning on waiting a week or two to see if it goes away. do you think its anything to worry about?  whats the timeframe for a cancer to spread?  i think i can afford to wait acouple weeks without worry, but i am not sure. i am 23 and no one in my family has had testicular cancer or this kideny disease i have now.  i am on lisinopril, zocor, warfarin, and i take cla and fish oil\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 20 year old male. About 9 weeks ago (February 16th) I visited a doctor, having a mildly painful, swollen right testicle, with a round lump(connected to the testicle) on it. It was diagnosed as Epididymitis and the doctor put me on Banocide for a week. 2 weeks later as the lump was still around (though not swollen or painful), I went back, and was put on the same treatment for 6 weeks.   Lately I have 2 lumps on my right testicle, and it's paining again( entire right groin area). Yesterday, I went to another doctor, who didn't examine me, but put me on banocide, a pain killer, Ranitin( Ranitidine hydrochloride) and FIXX LB (Cexifime?) . Both doctors laughed away the possibility of cancer when I mentioned it, but I'm not convinced. How long does Epididymitis treatment usually take?  I am currently in college in a small town(more like village) in India with very limited medical facilities, and my next visit home (a large city with hospitals etc. ) is months away. Considering that 2 doctors have discounted cancer as a possible diagnosis, can this wait?  Thank You for your help!\n\n",

If you are feeling the epidydimus I am not suprised that the lump has not gone away as it shouldn't.  However, the pain should resolve.  If the pain has returned you may have a recurrent infection that would require treatment with antibiotics.  I would also suggest that you have a culture performed to look for an antibiotic resistant bug that may explain the return of your symptoms.  Typically (though not 100% of the time) cancerous lumps are quite hard and non-painful.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  About a month ago I discovered a small lump to the upper portion of the right testicle, I say 'a lump' but it feels like two that are joined, the one behind fading into the testicle or so it feels.  Naturally I went to my doctor and he took blood tests and a urine sample. Everything seemed ok with the tests apart from raised liver enzymes.  I was then put on a broad spectrum antibiotic (cant remember name) and this was followed by Norfloxacin after a visit to the specialist. He seemed to think this was a better product than any broad spectrum Antibiotic, however, he ruled out any STD (Impossible anyway).  I had a scan revealing a lump, however not being awe inspired by the unqualified 'stand in' scan operator I was a little concerned.  I'm now down for surgery to remove the lumps as I've started to feel a weird sensation thats like a pulling on my scrotum, it comes and goes. I've also started to feel nausea, especially after waking in the morning. I'm feeling short tempered too if that helps and a litttle out of sorts ie spacey feeling head wise.  I'm 37 years old and was wondering if this sounds different to a benign cyst that I have read about? Thanks for any help or advice\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  The testes can swell for many reasons. Possible causes include cancer, testicular torsion, inguinal hernia, epididymitis, hydrocele, and varicocele. Other causes are far less common in adults. These include lymphedema, mumps and a spermatocele.  Testicular cancer is a rare cancer but is curable if caught early. The risk factors for cancer of the testicles include:  1. Age: Testicular cancer can occur at any age, but most often occurs in men between the ages of 15 and 40.  2. Undescended testicle (cryptorchidism): This is a condition in which the testicles do not descend from the abdomen, where they are located during development, to the scrotum shortly before birth. This condition is a major risk factor for testicular cancer developing in both the nondescended and the contralateral descended testes. 3. Family history: A family history of testicular cancer increases the risk.  4. Race and ethnicity: The risk for testicular cancer in Caucasian men is more than five times that of African-American men and more than double that of Asian-American men.  There would be no way of telling without a direct examination.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear dee_loc ,  It is a very good thing that you do self-checks regularly , I salute you for that. Regarding your query...I can not tell if it was a simple cyst or a simple inflammation in a lymph node..It has to be examined by a doctor...To be on teh safe side... you should do a simplle testicular ultrasound with Duplex...they would know exactly the nature of the lump.  Is it painful? (denoting inflammation in most of cases ) or not painful and has slippery edges when you flatten it...and does it move freely or fixed...all these question can be answered by your doctor...preferrably a surgeon.   Best regards,\n\n",

Adult-onset hydrocele may occur secondary to orchitis or epididymitis.  Inflammation of the epididymis is more frequent than orchitis (testis). Epididymitis usually arises as a complication of an urinary system infection, and as a part of STD.  In the past, gonorrhea was responsible for infection in the majority of cases, nowadays, mostly it is caused by chlamydia.  Antibiotics are a corner stone in the treatment in addition to other conservative measures, Epididymectomy is considered in refractory cases.

    "content": "Hi, im 19 and i always worry about testicular cancer and always check for bumps and lumps. Im pretty sure I don't have any lumps or bumps but if i touch a certain area it gives me an uncomfortable feeling. Im always worried about stupid stuff, and I was wondering should i be really concerned or is this a natural thing. Also I would like to know what a tumor would feel like and how big it would have to be to be concerned. Thank you for taking your time to answer this.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,   There are many possible causes of testicular pain, these include: trauma or surgery; infections such as epididymitis or orchitis; varicocele and hydrocele; cancer; an inguinal hernia or pelvic congestion.   Pain can also be referred to the testicles from conditions such as ureteric stones or spinal pathology.   Here are some information about common causes of testicular pain:  -Blue balls is a temporary congestion in the scrotum and prostate region that commonly results when prolonged sexual stimulation of the erect penis does not end with in orgasm and ejaculation.  - Hernia: It Occurs when the local support tissues weaken, allowing loops of the bowel to slip from the abdomen into the groin. Usually, the pain and may be a bulge when standing upright, movement, or bearing down are present.   - It could be also Referred from the lower abdomen ,as any condition that results in congested pelvis or irritates the pelvic peritoneum may be felt on in the scrotum like: Appendicitis   - Spasm in the muscles due to spinal problems may be referred to the scrotum.   - Varicoceles are commonly seen on the left side than in the right due to different anatomic factors.   -Testicular cancer usually affects only one testicle. It rarely present with pain or discomfort in a testicle or the scrotum.Typically, testicular cancer produces a painless swelling of one testicle.  It may not be a cancer but,  direct physical examination is essential.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  In most men, one testicle is slightly larger than the other.   Possible causes of scrotal swelling include inguinal hernia, , hydrocele, and varicocele. Other causes that are  less common in adults include lymphedema, and a spermatocele.  - Hernia: It Occurs when the local support tissues weaken, allowing loops of the bowel to slip from the abdomen into the groin. Usually, the pain and may be a bulge when standing upright, movement, or bearing down are present.   - A varicocele is a dilatation of the veins within the scrotum. Varicoceles are commonly seen on the left side than in the right due to different  anatomic factors.Varicocele can lead to discomfort around the testicle, rather than actual pain in the testicle itself.   - A hydrocele is a bag of clear fluid that collects in a sac around the testicle and may be the result of a direct injury. Alternatively, it can occur spontaneously in the remnants of an embryonic sac that remains formed around the testicle from birth.   Small hydroceles may hardly be noticed and often resolve without treatment.   Direct clinical examination is essential.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I am 20 years old and from Ohio, I have read a lot of information on your site about this and the possibilities that an enlarged testicle could be, but I have a few more questions. First, to be more specific on my problem; about a week ago I can't remeber exactly when it started, but I started feeling off balance, like I was going to fall over whether I was sitting, standing or laying down. Someone described this to me as a possible inner ear infection. I also lost my appetite and the thought of food made me sick. I didn't eat for about 4 days, I only drank juice and water. Well about three days ago, I woke up and the off balance feeling was gone and I had my appetite back. Although when I started to cough I felt a really bad pain in my left testicle. I checked and it was swollen to about 4 times the size of the right one. It was firm and it hurt to touch. That lasted for about a day and then yesterday and today it is not as firm, but it still hurts really bad and the size has not gone down. I am not familar with the possible causes you have described in previous posts similar to this one, so I wanted to know if someone could go a little more in depth as to what these causes are and how dangerous they may be. Also if anyone has any advice on what to do as far as treatment goes for someone who does not have health insurance if it is a seroius problem. Any help would be wonderful.\n\n",

There are programs in most areas that provide access to healthcare for those whom are uninsured/underinsured, for a reduced fee or free of charge. In some cases a loop of the bowel may protrude though a weakened area in the abdominal wall at the scrotum. When a hernia is present it can typically be seen as a bulging area when someone is coughing. Regardless of the causative factor, as I stated previously, testicular enlargement warrants an evaluation. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "Hi kenrex, There are many conditions aside from cancer that may cause testicular enlargement. For example, a varicocele, enlarged veins in the scrotum, typically affects the left side, feels much like a \"bag of worms\". Hydroceles, if the scrotum is full of clear fluid it can be easily demonstrated by shining a flashlight through the enlarged portion and it becomes transilluminated. Inguinal hernias also may cause scrotal enlargement. Regardless of whether the symptoms you are experiencing are from a benign disorder as the above mentioned examples or related to a malignant origin, I would strongly suggest an evaluation by your physician.

    "content": "Hello,  In September last year, I developed a pain in my right testicle.  I check myself regularly and found no lumps.  I went to see my doctor who prescribed me antibiotics to deal with epididymitis.  The antibiotics didn't seem to help much, so I went to visit the GUM clinic.  They took a swab and a urine sample but could find no signs of infection.  I was given a course of a different antibiotic, again to treat epididymitis.  This took the swelling down in my testicle (as it had swollen a little), which the doctor seemed pleased with when I returned a couple of weeks later (I assume the doctor was concerned about the possibility of testicular cancer, but that the swelling going down alleviated these fears a little?).  In all I did a 5 week course of the antibiotics and the pain never fully went away (it did dull a bit, but never left completely).  I was then referred for an ultrasound scan (which I am still awaiting). Last week, during one of my regular checks, I did find a lump.  Though, it was more like a continuous line going along my right testicle.  I saw a doctor who said that he felt that it was very likely a varicocele, but that it would be impossible to tell until the ultrasound had been done. I am just wanting to know if this sounds like cancer to anyone, or if the pain could be caused by the varicocele?  My scan is a week away, and I have to confess I'm getting a little nervous.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I\u2019m 32 years old and roughly three weeks ago I discovered a small (a little smaller than a BB) lump on a vein in my Epididymis just as it comes out of the top of my right testicle. The lump is hard and I can actually grab it and manipulate with my fingers so I know it is not directly attached to the testicle. It can be sensitive when I do this but not always. Just recently it seems to have gotten just slightly smaller. I have been doing alot of reading and have found numerous sites that say a lump on the Epididymis is not cancerous. In all the personal stories I have read, and I have read just about everyone I can find, everyone mentions that their lump was either in or on the testicle. In several stories the person involved has said that their doctor was not concerned with lumps not directly on the testicle. Needless to say I still find it hard to sleep at night and have not yet had an opportunity to see a doctor (which I plan to do as soon as possible). Has anyone had a lump like this, not actually on the testicle, which turned out to be TC. Any information would be greatly appreciated. Thanks very much.\n\n",

    "content": "I have recently found a small lump at the end of my left testicle. I have also been experiencing a bit of an ache about my belt-line on the same side. It seems that the testicle is a bit larger than the right one as well. I do realize that this is something that I need to have checked but here is where my questions lies. I have recently changed jobs and I am waiting (3 weeks) before my medical insurance takes effect. How big of a chance am I taking by waiting the 3 weeks until my insurance takes effect should this prove to be cancer? I am scared should it prove to be cancer my insurance company will consider it a pre-existing condition and deny payment if I do not wait.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi George  The lump in your tube can be a varicecole which is the blocking of a sperm duct.  It may cause occosional pain because of the swelling.  The lump on your testicle is probably a cyst although you should consult a doctor to be sure.  If it was testicular cancer the testicle would be very hard and there would be a lump on the end, it would feel as if there was another testicle growing on top.  Hope this helps, but you should still see a doc.\n\n",

I have a lump about 3/4ths the size of a toothbrush head on the area  where my scrotum starts and where my leg meets my groin area (on the right side).  So far it looks like it's only on the leg and not on the scrotum, and it's more on the lower side.. It's kind of hard and something I just noticed. I've been having pain & discomfort in my right testicle as well as my lower right abdomin along with soarness/discomfort in my kidney region/lower back, and in the last few days have been getting headaches that don't seem to keep reoccuring. I'm concerned & I'm wondering what this could possibly be. I don't' know how long the lump has been there for  but i've been having discomfort in the testicular region noticably for around the last few weeks. Do these symptoms coincide with testicular cancer, an std of any sort, or anything else? Or am I just being paranoid & should wait for the lump to go away.  Thanks for your help, Mitch\n\n",

The health professionals that i have consulted are quite stumped by this as none of them sem to have heard of it including myself.  The simplest explanation that we can come up with is that when the initial biopsy was carried out (that is taking a small piece of tissue and examining it under a microscope), the microscopy has shown cancerous cells similar in shape size and appearance to that of pagets  which you are right in saying is a type of cancer found in breast tissue.  as to how quickly this can spread and other effects, i am sorry to say we just don't know.   Best advice is for your father in law to speak again to his surgeon and insist on him answering his questions.  Sorry that i cant be any more specific on this occassion, hope this is some help to you.  Best wishes and good luck.\n\n",

Hydrocele/varicocele: Sometimes, a testicle can be enlarged because fluid has collected around it. This is called a hydrocele, and is usually painless unless it grows to certain size. Sometimes the pain can spread to the lower abdomen or back. Hydroceles have many causes, including infections, tumors, and anatomic abnormalities.   In a separate condition, the veins within the scrotum can dilate and cause enlargement and lumpiness around the testicle. This is called a varicocele, and has been described as feeling like a \"bag of worms.\" It is usually painless, but may be associated with a feeling of heaviness in the scrotum.  These two conditions may or may not require treatment, depending on their severity.\n\n",

Glad you are both taking this seriously and have done your homework, what you are both describing does indeed sound like a varicocele , which is indeed enlarged veins in the spermatic cord. This should eventually disappear on its own but if it ontinues you should both go back and see your physicians as if left untreated and it goes on for a long time it can lead to reduced sperm count.  Good Luck and best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Re lump in testicles",
    "content": "Hi b ,  well done firstly for having the courage to ask about this subject as it can be embarrassing for guys especially your age.  Does the lump feel hard or soft and does it stay in the one place? Do you have any other symptoms?  There are many reasons for lumps in the testicles some are simple cysts that go away in time and some can be what i think you are worrying about which is cancerous lumps.  You must go to your physician to have this checked out, he / she will examine you and advise what they think is going on and if necessary get the correct treatment for you.  It is easy to come onto a medical forum and give symptoms as no one knows you but for situations like this you must seek medical help.  Please don't be embarrassed , I know you are 15 but you must see your doctor.  Let us know how you get on.  Best wishes and good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Im a 17 year old male, and for the past 3 or 4 days Ive been having a nagging pain in both my testicals its not intense but pretty anoying. Also at first I had some diarriah but now it seems more like constipation. My stomach dosent hurt that much but its really gassy and grumbly. Over the past 2 days I don't get much pain in my testicals unless I put pressure on my stomach. Also the day before the pain started my urine was whiteish, that only happend once though. I examined my testicals a number of times and I cant find any lumps or anything, just alot of veins and ropey material. Im scared I might have testicular cancer. I hope it just has something to do with my upset stomach. Please give me some advice, Thank you for your time.\n\n",

This part of the story is based on an actual incident in which a person was admitted to hospital and kept there under observation due to this condidtion.   I have been informed that the diagnosis was that the swelling was due to fluid build up caused by having sex.   I appreciate that this is a serious forum soley dedicated to advising the public on their genuine health concerns, but i would be most grateful if a doctor could give me a little assistance here in my research.  Can this really be the cause of temporary swelling, if so, briefly why does it occurr and what is the correct name for the condition. I assume it is quite rare.  Your input is very gratefully received. Many thanks, Annabelle.\n\n",

It is only small but my left testicle is bigger than my right one. Also the skin on the outside of the scrotum was rough. So i went to the doctors he checked for lumps but said i had normal testicles. He said the skin was rough due to an excema. I do suffer from it. So i got some cream. But my testicle is larger than the right one. and hangs lower also is closer the the skin at back where small lump is. The lump feels like a testicle but is softer nd feels veiny. What is it? Should i be worried about it i mean it not noticeable without having a good feel?\n\n",

I asked him if it caused pain and he said more like a dragging feeling. Then he just dropped the subject. At the time, I didn't really notice anything different, but in the past couple of months it has gotten worse and is now uncomfortable. It is also visable to me, that the left side is at least twice as big as the right. I've since lost my insurance and seeing him again right now is not an option. Does this sound like 'fluid' or something more serious? And if it is fluid, what is the fluid and will it go away eventually, or continue to get worse? And what is the result of doing nothing. Does it have anything to do with diet?\n\n",

    "content": "OK, im 23 years old, and noticed a tiny ache in my left testicle a couple of months ago.  Nothing to bad at all, and it only last for seconds/minutes at a time, coming and going (mostly going).  I read online that I should do a self exam, so I did.  During my exam I noticed a lump on my left testicle.  It's not your standard lump however (or so I think) in that I can move it around.  It is on the top (or bottom, don't know which is which) almost adjacent to the epidymus (spelling??).  Is is a little smaller than a bb and appears to be attached to my left testicle by some sort of membrane or something.  I can put my index finger and thumb between the lump and my testicle.  Does this sound like cancer?  I can kind of move it around, and most of the descriptions I've read talk about lumps being firmly attached to the testicle.....wheras this isn't....however it feels like it is attached by s/thing.  It moves around so much that if I try to grab it with my fingers it can sometimes slip right out.  I can hold on to the lump, and let go completely of my testicle.  I scheduled an appointment with an urologist however I cant be seen for about a month - which is a long time when you are worrying.  Can s/one with information please help....I'm really scared about this.  Does what I descibed sound like TC at all?  Thanks in advance.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi tonyb, The urologist that is going to evaluate you will most likely order an ultrasound of your testicles/scrotum as well as possibly labwork. Generally speaking testicular cancer usually involves  the testicle itself and only a small percentage of cases do they spread to the epididymus or spermatic cord (which is the area you describe). Keep in mind that there are other conditions that cause lumps such as for example, a varicocele. Any testicular lump warrants an evaluation by a physician. I sincerely hope all turns out well.

Does this sound like testicular cancer though, in that I can essentially move the lump around and place my index finger and thumb between the lump and my testicle.  I've read that most lumps are basically imbedded in the testicle - whereas this is not.  Could this be TC?  Thanks again for your help.\n\n",

Couple of questions:  First, is it standard/normal to have a doctor order an ultrasound and bloodwork even though he thinks it is a spermatocele?  Thats what kind of freaked me out a bit....why would I have to have this done if he thinks it is just a spermatocele.

Look at it this way, if it was something other than the spermatocele (like testicular cancer) and the doctor didn't investigate it at all, it would go undetected. Better to be on the safe side, have diagnostic tests and rule out even the slightest possibility. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "content": "Hi dfrea, Do you have any tenderness, pain, inflammation etc.? Near the top and down the back side of each testicle you may be able to feel a spongy tubelike structure (epididymis). So essentially the epididymis is a long, tightly coiled tube that lies behind each testicle which collects the sperm made by the testicles. However, there is a condition where there is a soft collection of thin tubes (often referred to as a \"bag of worms\" or \"spaghetti\") is felt above or behind the testicle. This may indicate a varicocele. (This is certainly something I would consider regarding your description) A varicocele is an enlarged, twisted vein (varicose vein) in the scrotum and usually (not always) affects the left side. They are most usually left alone unless they start causing a problem or an effect on fertility. An ultrasound would identify this problem, discuss this diagnostic procedure with your physician. I hope this information is helpful. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "title": "Immediate Aching During Sexual Arousal",
    "content": "I have a problem with an aching pain in my testicles during sexual arousal. The symptoms appear to be very similar to \"blue balls,\" but the problem is that the onset of pain occurs very quickly, sometimes less than fives minutes after I become aroused. What confuses me even more is that this only happens when I am with a real person, which leads me to believe that it may be psychological. My sexual experience with partners is severely hampered because of it. Also, the pain intensifies greatly during orgasm and for several seconds afterward before finally fading away. I'm not sure whether or not this is also a symptom of \"blue balls.\" My testicles are often tender for several hours after this happens. If orgasm is not achieved, the pain usually takes one or two hours to dissipate.  I have no idea whether or not this is related to the above problem, but I figured I'd mention it anyway. I have a problem where If I don't drink enough water, or if I hold my urine for an extended period of time, the end of my stream will lurch and become very cloudy, putting sediment into the toilet. After this happens, I will experience a burning, and sometimes intense pain near my prostate and all the way up to the tip of my urethra. This will last anywhere between 15 minutes to an hour, and seems to go away faster if I drink lots of water after it happens. The reason I mention this is that if I don't achieve orgrasm after experiencing the above testicle pains, then the second problem will sometimes occur with great intensity the next time I urinate, regardless of how much water I've had or how long I hold my urine.  Any help or advice would be very much appreicated, as I have had to deal with both problems for many years.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Mgoldwaters,  Find a good Urologist, one you can talk openly with about your sexual pains and problems. Explain in detail all that is happening and it sounds to me like you should get your prostate checked out. Start out easy, get the urine test done first (whew, wiping your brow off). They will have you urinate into two jars and than they\u2019ll check for cloudiness, signs of blood or protein and for threads of cellular material like pus or bacteria cells and the urine will be cultures. (see how easy that was)! Now for the third cup, after your prostate is massaged it will release secretions and you will urinate them through for evaluation. This will be tested for the same things as above but it will give a better idea of where, if any, infections may be.  The prostrate gland secretes 30-40 % of the fluid volume in semen, it contains nutrients in it that help keep the sperm healthy, gives the sperm something to be ejaculated out with and it helps them swim away.   Prostatitis \u2013 microscopic passageways in the prostate gland becomes infected, inflamed or clogged either with thickened secretions or tiny stones causing prostatitis. The infection can be a bacterial, viral or fungus. Sexually transmitted diseases such as gonorrhea, Chlamydia and thrush/Candida are responsible STD\u2019s. Because of the high STD\u2019s in Prostatitis your Urologist may request a test for them, don\u2019t be offended.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello I have a epididymal cyst which I discovered at age 16 and I am now 22. When I first noticed it, it was the size of a pea but is now over one inch in length. I had an ultra sound done on it when it was about half the size it is now and  I was told it is a normal cyst  but since then it has become a bit irregular on one side. Although light is still able to pass through it evenly and consistently from all angles and no dark spots present themselves it seems to be cause for alarm. I do plan to have it checked out but I have limited ability to get to a urologist and I am wondering if the irregularity is a sign of something cancerous or if it is normal in the growth of the cyst for it to become less smooth. Also I am simply curious if a single cyst on just one side could cause low testosterone levels in a man my age. I have noticed a moderate loss of energy in the past two years and a lot of weight gain though I am still under 20 percent body fat I was at 18 years old only 6 percent and at 20 only 10 percent. Other strings have also mentioned a decreased libido but I never had much of one to start with so I don't know if it has been affected or not.  Thank you for your feedback on this issue, I hope to hear back soon.\n\n",

    "title": "masterbation, ejaculation, related to cancer? an obligation?",
    "content": "Hello,  i have a question, hope i asked it in the right place. im looking for some answers from someone who knows what their talking about.  1. people say that doctors say... that masterbation is something everyone must do, as a from of release of the sperm that is continually being created within us. and that our bodies can stimulate wet dreams, involuntary ejaculation, sexual dreams to cause us to become arroused without our approval.... all for the purpose of releasing the sperm as kind of an inbuilt security system. is this true?   2. people say that we must release the created sperm from time to time through masterbation if not intercourse, or we will get some sort of cancer or disease in our bodies.   i really don't know much about it, but if you can grasp the issue that im dealing with inspite of my lack of understanding and clear articulation... id like for you to explain it to me, the realities, the neccesities, etc. or show me somewhere to find it.  i for one, don't want to beleive we have to continually ejaculate, becuase im not married, and i don't want to believe i have to masterbate in order to aviod some sort of cancer, becuase i personally believe it is immoral, but the morality of it isnt what im asking about.  can i get cancer without continually ejaculating? is there is any danger in it?  can my body cause me to have sexual dreams or cause me to ejaculate by itself without the assistance of my choosing to do so?     and someone once said there is a way through urination, to release the sperm, that ejaculation isnt the only way, i don't know..... 'im kinda in the dark here.\n\n",

My left testicle is very enlarged now, Im just wondering if the surgery may have prompted testicular cancer signs? Im very worried, I don't know why my testicle is enlarged and when I do a search on the internet about enlarged testicle all I can find is testicular cancer. Is this possibly Testicular Cancer? What would umbilical surgery have to do with my scrotum? Am I overeacting?  Please Help! (I go back to see Surgeon in 2 days)\n\n",

He said that it is a very weird feeling not really painful but a heaviness...he feels the pain in his stomache. He has lower back pain and he is always tired. Also, he has no sex drive; which for him is very unusual..he is just always too tired.  This isnt the first time that he has had pain...about a year ago maybe sooner, he had pain too.   I suggested that he go to his doctor but he insists on waiting at least a week or two to see if it goes away...he said maybe he strained in when working out or it was an ingrown hair and didnt want to make a big deal out of nothing.  Can anyone give me some insight...is this normal, has anyone else had something similar and it turn out to be nothing? I am afraid that he has testicular cancer or something..\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I was wondering if anyone could help me out here. I noticed a growth I guess you could call it on my right testicle when I was 15. It was during baseball season and I'm a catcher so I figured maybe it was from one of times the ball took a unlucky bounce and hit me. Well It has been half a year now and the swellings size has changed almost daily for the past half a year. Sometimes it is barely noticeable while other times it swells up to almost the size of a lemon. It also isn't solid it seems to be filled with liquid as when it isn't one of the times when it is lemon sized I can squeeze and it feels almost as if it is draining. I haven't gotten it checked out by a doctor because I'm afraid of what might be the real cause of it and when ever it seems to be serious it shrinks away and I forget about it. Why I am seeking help now is that it has been lemon sized for a week or so now and sometimes when I stretch my arms straight up I feel a pain in my lower abdomen. I would really appreciate any information that could be shared with me because I am unsure of what action I should take.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Mike7, Cystic testicular masses can be caused by many things ranging from nothing at all to many benign causes to as you put it cancer. The long duration and the way it changes sizes certainly favour the benign causes more than the malignant. However, nothing can be ruled out for certain without an examination. You must consult your doctor, who may in turn request an ultrasonography to visualize the lesion and make sure there is nothing serious.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Four months ago I hurt my lower back from heavy lifting during a move, and I also thought I had a hernia. My right testicle was slightly swollen, and it and  the right side of my groin all hurtt whenever I coughed, sneezed, or strained. The doctor checked me for a hernia and said  I'd probably just strained the area. The pain left after a couple of weeks and the area went back to normal.       Three days ago I got up in the morning and the pain was back. It hurt when I coughed, sneezed, or strained, and when I would push on my groin above my testicle. I hadn't done any lifting in a while, so I don't know what is causing it. I've felt all over mygroin and  testicles looking for lumps and anything abnormal, but the only thing I've noticed is that the right testicle  is swollen slightly larger.        It's been three days and the groin pain is almost gone. What could this be? My lower back injury was aggravated from a six hour drive a few days before, could that have something to do with it?\n\n",

Otherwise it is very unlikely that anyone else will be able to make the correlation so it's still only between both of you. As for the 'bent penis' this is also known as Peyronie's disease. It should also be examined. Usually it is not a problem and may be a hereditary thing. Occasionally the problem goes away on its own, but this is rare. Therefore he ought to seek medical advice.

He has not been able to have any kind of sexual activity for over a year because of the pain.  He refuses to go to the doctor to have it checked out.  My mother-in-law says that now the lump has burst and my father-in-law has begun to lose weight, and he's not an overweight man anyways.  He's been hiding his weigh loss from everyone and refuses to tell anyone.  My mother-in-law would be in big trouble if my father-in-law knew that my husband knows.  Anyways, we would like to know if this sounds like testicular cancer and how bad is it that the lump has burst.  Is that common for the lump to burst?  My father-in-law doesn't have any pain urinating or anything like that.  It's just painful to get an erection and to ejaculate.  I noticed on another website regarding testicular cancer that lower-back and hip pain is common as well.  I think he's been having back problems for a while but I'm not sure if it's related or not, but thought I'd mention it just in case.  We are really worried and thought that we'd do some research first before confronting him about this.  We'd like to knowledgeable when we talk to him.  Thank you for your help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi auburnymist, It would be dificult to say yes or no regarding whether or not this is testicular cancer without doing some blood tests, biopsy etc. There are benign as well as malignant testicular masses but a mass alone without any other symptoms would warrant an evaluation by the doctor. Here is some general information on testicular cancer. Some of the symptoms are: A lump or mass in either testicle  Any enlargement or swelling of a testicle  A collection of fluid in the scrotum  A dull ache in the lower abdomen, back, or in the groin  A feeling of heaviness in the scrotum  Discomfort or pain in a testicle or in the scrotum  Enlargement or tenderness of the breasts  Weight loss A frequent symptom of later stage testicular cancer is lower back pain because the disease has spread  to the lymph nodes in the posterior part of the abdomen. If the cancer has spread to the lungs, cough, chest pain, or  shortness of breath can occur, as well as blood in the sputum.  As for a tumor rupturing, the cases of testicular cancer that I've seen has primarily been in the earlier stages. It is possible however, that a tumor can erode through any area of the body. Taking into consideration to the fact that he has been having symptoms for such an extended period of time  I strongly urge you to confront him and encourage him to be evaluated by his physicianI hope this small amount of information is helpful to you. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you so much for your reply.  I've read all the symptoms that you described, but none of them mention anything about painful sex, which has me a little baffled.  Also, as a clarification, I found out after I posted that my father-in-law felt something burst in his testicular sac and then the lump appeared.  Apparently the lump is still there and that he felt the burst over a year ago just prior to the lump appearing.  So I don't know if that tells you anything of importance or not.  My husband has told all his brothers and sister and at Christmas we are planning on confronting my father-in-law and hopefully will be able to get him in to see an urologist while they are in town.  My sister-in-law has already set up an appointment with the urologist just in case my father-in-law agrees to cooperate and go get checked out.  Please keep your fingers crossed that we'll be able to convince him to get checked out, if not for his sake, at least for his wife and children so we'll all know what we're dealing with and if he doesn't want to have it treated, then how long he's got, if that becomes an issue.  The last thing we want is to not know anything, then heaven forbid, that he dies suddenly from what he has and my mother-in-law is left alone in Ohio, with no means of income and no place to live.  At least if he finds out what's wrong and if deadly and he decides not to do anything about it, we'll have time to plan for my mother-in-law and for the funeral expenses.  I have a feeling that my father-in-law will refuse to have any kind of surgery even if it would save his life.  He's terrified of doctors and hospitals.  Needless to say, this whole ordeal has us all upset and worried sick.    Thanks again for your reply.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi auburnymist,  Please keep in mind that there are  other diseases and conditions can produce testicular lumps. These may include: Scrotal masses. These masses (benign as well as malignant) made up of fluid or solid material in, on or around the testicles \u2014 may be caused by cysts, inflammations, physical injury or hernia.  Epididymitis. This inflammation affects the tubes that transport sperm. (very painful) Hydrocele. This soft and usually painless swelling in the scrotum is due to a collection of watery fluid.  Spermatocele. This type of cyst is formed by blockage in the tubes that transport sperm.  Varicocele. This swelling in the scrotum is caused by enlarged veins.  Orchitis. This inflammation of the testicle is often due to bacterial infection or the mumps virus.  I would have to suspect that with testicular cancer as well as many other conditions there would also be painful intercourse even if it is not something specifically listed under signs and symptoms. Since his condition is long standing I again encourage an evaluation. Whether or not he elects for treatment or not (if in the event it is cancer) is entirely up to him.I will say a prayer and keep my fingers crossed as well. It's better to know and be prepared than wonder and worry. I hope all works out for you and yours and I wish you the very best  Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "content": "I appreciate you saying a prayer more than you'll ever know.  I've read up on all the other types of causes for masses as well.  I'm just praying that it's not cancer and that it is simply a benign mass that can be treated very easily.  The weigh loss has me concerned more than anything, I guess, because of the fact that a woman at our church got cancer and she started losing weight even though she was eating all the time, which is what caused her to go to the doctor, which led to her finding out that she had cancer.  She was like my father-in-law in that she didn't like going to the doctor and had not been to the doctor ever.  So, with my father-in-law losing weight like he is all the sudden, it has me a bit concerned, especially since he doesn't have hardly any extra weight that he can afford to lose.  But please keep him and his family in your prayers and hopefully the Lord will help work things out to where my father-in-law at least agrees to find out what's wrong, even if he chooses not to get treatment.  Thanks again for all your help and your prayers.  Have a wonderful Christmas and a Blessed New Years.\n\n",

Both tumors were fully encapsulated.   The latter followed 4 days later with exploratory to stop the internal bleeding after I passed out in the CT.    I am 5 weeks post-op now and the CT is clear, the Blood markers are clear, but I have a soreness and annoying pain in my armpits, specifically the left.  I am not sure if this is a sweat gland enflamed from the \"hot flashes\" while we were getting the testosterone replacement dose regulated or if I should have a \"spread\" concern.  Your thoughts?\n\n",

The possibility of cancer metastasis to the lymph nodes of the axilla is quite remote given the fact that your markers are good and that lymphatic spread usually involves the lymph nodes adjacent to the primary before any other groups are involved. Its also true that you don't feel any swelling there.  You should have it checked out by your physician. It could be as you say or an abscess.\n\n",

I was then registered for an ultrasound scan on the scrotum. The doctor then told me its \"nothing\" and not to worry about it.  But I'm still worried as he didnt really tell me what it was. Here's what's written on the ultrasound result.   US of the Scrotum --------------------  Small amount of fluid seen around the left epididymis. Slight increased in vascvularity seen at the left epididymis which does not appear swollen. Normal right epididymis. Both the testes are normal. No evidence of varicocele. No cystic lesion noted.   Summary ---------- Non specific small amount of fluid around left epididymis ? inflammation Normal testes.     What could the lump be? Any ideas? is there a cause for concern? Really appreciate any help given.\n\n",

    "content": "From the scan it seems that you have either a spermatocele or an epididymal cyst.  Both are benign conditions in themselves.   A spermatocele (cyst of the epididymis containing sperm) or a hydrocele (collection of fluid surrounding the testis or involving the spermatic cord).  These are similar to epididymal cysts except that there is a connection to the testicle and the swelling is filled with cloudy fluid containing many sperm and sperm like cells.   Epididymal cysts are fluid filled cysts that arise from outflow ducts that leave the top part of the testicle in the part of the testicle called the epididymis.  They may occur at any age and when small are best left alone.  Epididymal cysts are filled with clear fluid and are not associated with cancer.  It is usually possible to distinguish an epididymal cyst by careful examination and they can be felt as separate round swellings above or sometimes behind the testicle.    Since both conditions are benign (non-cancerous) I hope this puts your mind at rest. Thanks for using The Doctor's Lounge, Carolyn\n\n",

The test result was consistent with the first. So i guess i'm fine.  He prescribed some medication, tarivid tab (ofloxacin) for me, and tell me to try it as he thought the lump may be due to inflammation. But i've read from the net that spermatocele are best left alone and there's no medication for it, and moreover, i have read that ofloxacin has some nasty common side effects..  Kinda confused here, i sure do not want to take medication thats not necessary.  Any advice?\n\n",

Some persons get them just above the anal area and others tend to get them in the genital areas.  If they persist, then a dermatologist can excise them and any possible \"roots\" that are present.  This however, is done as a last resort.  Usually antibiotic therapy clears them up.  It is important to keep the area clean and dry and without the irritation of clothing rubbing the area in order to prevent reoccurence.  STD's do not come in the form of pustular cysts from the skin.

    "content": "i wasn't sure which subject this question would belong, but this seemed to fit best with my situation. The past 2-3 months i have found myself feeling less sexually active, like i have fewer hormones in my body. I can have an erection, but it takes a lot more effort than it used to. moments after an erection it can more easily cease than it has done in the past. i thought this was just a phase but within the past 2 months i have had a pain switching from my left and right testicle, which also comes with what feels like a lump or something that has expanded above the testicle. That is where the pain is. I don't get it all the time though, usually when i get an erection and do not reach climax. I would say i've felt this pain about 5 or 6 times within the past 2 months.  I am able to have sex after a lot of time is put in to making it work, but have also been unable to achieve an erection at times. It is just the pain and I am worried as I generally arn't having as many sexual urges as I used to. I really hope someone can help me as I find it fairly hard to talk about it and it is starting to effect my relationship with my girlfriend. I've just turned 20 years old, it seemed a bit soon to be suffering anything like this at my age.  I would seriously appreciate any help or advice, thank you.\n\n",

    "title": "Testicle pain",
    "content": "Hi everyone  I found a lump on my left testicle a few months ago. I only found it after feeling some discomfort there. The pain had become much worse, mainly when I played football (soccer) which I do twice a week. The pain afterwards was sometimes so bad that I couldn't put any weight on my left leg.  I sometimes also seem to feel the pain in my groin, but mainly in the testicle.  So I decided to go the doctors and he instantly reassured me that there was nothing to worry about. He diagnosed it as epididymitis and prescribed me antibiotics (oxytetracycline). The thing that worried me afterwards was that he hadn't felt the lump I had felt as he did seem to struggle to find it.  Anyway. I thought the antibiotics were working as over the two weeks I played football whilst on them, and for the last couple of weeks, the pain was not as bad. However, the lump is still there and it is still painful at times.   My doctor actually booked me in for a ultrasound, so I went for that and they found nothing. Which is good I guess but she had to ask me where the lump was exactly and with it being on the lower part of the testicle I'm afraid she may have missed it. I was actually hoping that she would find something relating to epididymitis and then put me on a new course of treatment. But she didn't say anything, just to make an appointment to see my doctor in two weeks although he may not even need to see me.   Well this ultrasound was Wednesday just gone, so my plan was to wait and see if it clears up in the next two weeks, but I really don't think it's going to.  Any ideas what it may be? What I should do?  Thanks for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I think your decision to wait and see if it resolves by itself in the coming two weeks is a good one. Epididymitis can present with a small lump that later resolves with antibiotic treatment. Two points in favor of a benign outcome for your situation is the pain that subsided with antibiotics and a negative ultrasound. The chances that your doctor missed the lump on ultrasound examination are minimal. In two weeks if the condition does not get any better, you may need further tests and/or a repeat ultrasound.

Do you feel a lump in the testicles or see that one testicle is much large than the other of odd looking?  This may well not be cancer.  My advise to you is to see a doctor.  If you do not have a doctor, then I would not let that stand in the way of being seen by a doctor.  Many hospitals do have arrangements for patients without insurance to be seen.  There may be a free care clinic in your area.  You also may want to contact the American Cancer Society to see what advice they have for being seen by a doctor in your local area who would see you without insurance.\n\n",

    "title": "Scrotal Mass",
    "content": "Hi- When I was 15 I had a pain in my left testicle so bad it made me vomit. I went to my doctor and he had me on pain killers and had me wear a jock strap for a couple of weeks. My testicle swelled about 1 1/2 times it's normal size. When it was done being swollen it shrunk all the way done to the size of a small bean maybe pea size and it was hard. He said one condition strangled the other, but unfortunately it resulted in the loss of one of my testicles that I am not at all happy about but I dealt with it and moved on with life. My right testicle grew slightly larger and I had no trouble sexually in any way including sensation. Now comes the important part but I had to mention first that I am down to 1 testicle. Ok life went on ok till I was about 30. While in a sexual act, the woman I was with rubbed my right testicle (which is my only one now) with her knuckle while orally and with her other hand until I climaxed and ejacualted. Well the next morning I noticed that my epididymis was starting to swell more and more until it reaches a certain size and firmness. Now this didn't really bother me all that much, besides scaring me on to what was happening with my last remaining testicle. I also noticed a very small firmness near the top of my testicle in the general vacintity of my now swollen and hardened epididymis. This one appeared to be attached to my testicle. Well I figured it was from this woman who I said performed this sexual act on me when I said she rubbed my testicle firmly with her knuckle. But the whole thing still scared me a little so I went to a medical library and read up a Testicular Cancer. The idea of them taking my last remaining testicle scared me to death and there was no way I wanted to go to the doctor to find out it was cancer. But I went to a female doctor anyway, and she felt the swollen epididymis and said we were going to do nothing at that point. So I felt it was not serious enough then to worry about it. I am now 46 and it probably was foolish not to pursue having another doctor look at it, but I was scared and did not want to live with no testicles and have to receive hormone shots to keep my voice deep and sexual drive active. I also wouldn't be able to ejaculate. So I maybe foolishly thought that I would just wait and see if anything got worse. In the meantime I have had 3 kids and have had normal and great sex. Nothing has changed with anything except that swelling that was smaller and appears to be attached to my teaticle got slightly larger over the years but I could swear it changes size and sometimes it appears to shrink if I squeeze and play with it enough, but I am not positive. I am almost positive that it does seem to change in size which makes me think it is a good thing. The only discomfort I have felt over the years is tollerable. I get the sensation to subtly touch or grab at that spot with my hand. I feel a little soreness sometimes to the right of my scrotal area in the crease of my uppermost thighunder my hip. Lying down and in sitiing positions almost always makes any discomfort if I had any go away. I have had thoughts over the years because I have read about harmless swellings to go to the doctor but I am a bit of a chicken when it comes to the doctor and have them put in a fake testcle on my left side and surgically repair my condition in my right scrotum assuming that it is a benign condition, but I am scared to find out if it may be cancer. I am hoping since I waited 16 years after the symptoms first appeared that it could not possible now be cancer or it probably would have worsened by now. Am I right Doc I hope? If you tell me that it most likely is Not cancer because it has been so long, then that may get me to a doctor otherwise I do not want to know because I do not want to be in that situation I mentioned with No testicles at all. I can live with this, but it just scares me to think if it is cancer and as I said I am trying to reasure myself that it most likely is not cancer since I waited so long to get it thouroughly checked out so I am considering having it taken care of at no risk of losing my last testicle because they say harmless sweeling can get bigger and cause some discomfort which I have from time to time but can tollerate it but I also want the piece of mind knowing it is ok and it will be left up to me when I get the courage to correct everything as I stated I wanted to do. Doc can you help me, I know what you will tell me to do but you have to understand my position on it. Is there a great chance since I waited 16 years that it most likely is NOT cancer?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Doc- Thanks for the reassurance on my situation. The latest development on this probem I have with my testicle area is that I just discovered that the spermatic cord leading up to what appears to be my swollen epididymis which was my very first concern abiut 16 years ago when this happened, feels like worms when you grab at them. All those cords feel like worms and one of the cords that goes down and attaches near the top portion of my testicle is where that 2nd swelling is that I was a little worried about it because it got slightly bigger over this 16 year time period being cancer. I can take my index and thumb and grab that particular cord and find that I can feel that this swelling that appears to be growing from the testicle out, is actually going  from the bottom of this cord into the testicle. I can grab both sides of it with my thumb and index finger as I said and sqeeze both sides of it as part of the bottom of this cord that is part of the spermatic cord that leads up to the epididymis. My point here is that I am tending to agree with you from what I have been reading that this could be condition that is originating outside of the testicle which gives me a better chance that it may not be cancer. Also this condition probably is causing from time to time diferent levels of mild discomfort that goes anywhere from my thigh to my front and or the back of my hip because it may be touching or interfering with nerves that affect that area. I don't know if you agree with that or not but it makes sense. Also I hope you still agree that my condition after adding this info to my earlier explaination, that my condition in my remaining testicle is most likely benign because that will get me to the doctor and I agree for piece of mind at least I should have it checked out. I want to further ask you doc as you didn't address it before, is it a good idea and is it very painful and is there a chance of complications and or rejection if I wanted to put in a fake testicle to replace the one I lost when I was 15 years old? This will make me appear normal to woman. Does it benefit me for what my insurance will pay for and for what I have to go through to have it done? Maybe if I get this one condition taken care of assuming it is benign, that I could do everything at once and include it in the cost of the other testicle work and move on with the rest of my life?  Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Dear cdj1212,  I feel what you are probably referring to is a varicocele. Varicoceles develop as a result of dilatation and tortuosity of a network of veins within the scrotum (called pampiniform plexus) because of backward flow of blood into a bigger vein called the internal spermatic vein (ISV). Varicocele is a common abnormality, occurring in approximately 15% of men. Some patients may have scrotal pain and swelling, but more importantly, varicocele is considered to be a potential cause of male infertility. This relationship is controversial, but improved fertility and sperm quality have been reported after treatment, including blocking (occlusive) treatment for varicoceles. On physical examination, large varicoceles are easily identified as the classic bag of worms surrounding the testis. Ultrasonography allows accurate diagnosis of varicoceles, even subclinical varicoceles. Sonography is the examination of choice for investigating varicoceles, and it remains the most practical and most accurate noninvasive technique.  I hope this information helps. Reasserting the absence of a substitute for direct medical examination by a surgeon,  I remain,  -Bill\n\n",
