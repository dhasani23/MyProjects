    "content": "I probably should have been more proactive in my daughter\u2019s earlier years of health; I have been going with the flow.  Now I am becoming Google educated in Nephrology. I have a whole new appreciation and respect for your field of science. My 12 yr old daughter, Samantha, is in the 97 percentile, is in normal health, and no previous surgery.   In 2002, Samantha had routine urine test and Hematuria was reported. Later in 2002 Sam had a UTI. A VCUG was performed with results negative and an ultrasound reported as normal.  I assume all was fine.  In 2008 during a routine physical, Hematuria was reported again.  (Note: My wife had Gestational Diabetes during the pregnancy.) Four more urine tests were performed and a 24hr urine test. The urine tests consistently reported Hematuria (RBC 3-4 / HPF), mild Proteinuria  - negative traces of protein, and bacteria.  The 24 hour urine test showed protein results of 365 MH/24.   Met with a Nephrologist and the recommendation was a kidney biopsy because he couldn\u2019t be sure it\u2019s Postural Proteinuria. We were given two of the three biopsy results (the electronic microscope is outsourced and due in a few weeks). The light microscope showed minimal abnormalities. He reported some protein around the cell, no scaring, or sign of inflammation. The fluorescent test showed some protein deposit at the glomerulus capillary.  All of my google-mation does not help me reduce the list of possible kidney diseases. I think minimal change disease is ruled out because of the light microscope protein. I think it rules out FSGS because no scarring was found, unless the biopsy didn\u2019t hit the focal.  It seems to indicate the Podocytes leaking into the Bowmans\u2019 space.  I really don\u2019t know what to rule out or rule in.  And what happened to Hematuria? Any help would be appreciated. Regards\n\n",

    "content": "I have a 7 year old son who a few years ago had poststrep glomerulonephritis, well that is originally what they doctors thought.  Following that infection they noticed blood and protein in the urine that was still present a year later.  They sent him to nephrologist that did some tests and saw that he had a low C3 level.  I guess the doctor assumed that it would clear up on its own.  Well it has been a 1 1/2 years since that and we went back to specialist as he has continued to have abnormal UA's.  Most recently he had large amount microscopic hematuria, trace protien, and low C3 level.  So now the doctors are ruling out the original diagnosis as this has been going on for years.  I am wondering what they are thinking this could be, and I also wonder if a child could have all this going on and it turn out to be nothing.  He doesn't seem to have any other sypmtoms (ie: HTN, edema, etc...) other than frequent lower abdominal pains, and some trouble swallowing (which I think might be psychological).  Could all of this be normal for him?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Urine Albumin",
    "content": "Hello --  Since your daughter is already known to have FSGS for some time, and since the albumin level was so elevated, it would seem that at the time of the test either she was unusually dehydrated (a common cause of gross albumin in proteinuria) or was either beginning a phase of nephrotic syndrome (kidney failure). The latter can be transitory or progressive, depending on many factors unknown in  this case. I would think, however, that in either case her doctor would react to this finding with concern and want to follow up to determine just what was going on, and probably repeat the test.   Since so little is known about the circumstances of this finding, other than the presence of FSGS, which could predispose to nephrotic syndrome, you'll have to depend on the doctor to follow this development and please do let us know what you find out. Best of luck to you and your daughter.\n\n",

I am also on cellcept for MG, which I much prefer.  I am not seeing any added benefit by adding the prednisone, so I would rather not have the side effects of prednisone. Do I need to taper to avoid adrenal insufficiency at this level? I was planning on 5 qod, for 1 week, then 2.5 qod for one week, then 1qod for one week and off.  Is this reasonable?   My doctor highly favors prednisone and minimizes the side-effects, so I cannot address this with him, but I do want to stop in a safe way. Any advice would be very helpful.\n\n",

The kidney is quite complex and can manage to maintain kidney function even with significant disease.     Regarding your question about pregnancy there are many factors that play into this, including the state of your kidney function, the medications you are on, your blood pressures, etc.  I would suggest that you talk with your obstetrician and nephrologit to get the best advice specifically for you.

    "content": "Generally the medications you are taking are not described as causing proteinuria.  There are several causes of proteinuria.  They range from harmless, such as orthostatic proteinuria where protein shows up in the urine after standing for a while to severe causes such as nephrotic syndrome.  With things such as nephrotic syndrome the amount of protein in the urine is very large.  Your amounts are not consistent with this.  Most likely you have an incidental finding.  It is a good idea to continue to follow this to ensure it does not get worse.  Staying hydrated is important.  As long as your protein amounts remain minimal and your kidney function/blood pressure are OK you are likely to be fine.  If there is concern, you may wish to see a nephrologist (kidney specialist).  A 24 hour urine collection can be done to formally assess the amount of protein in the urine.  I hope this helps.  Best wishes.\n\n",

In June 2006 she had a urinary tract infection which  was treated with bactrim. However, this intensified the pain. She stopped taking the antibiotic and her acute pain lessened. Her left side pain has increased gradually over the insuing months. Her right mid back  has now begun to hurt as well although not as bad as the left. She describes her left side pain as extreme soreness with occassional sharp, stabbing bursts which can wake her from sleep with SOA. She has had abdominal MRI and cardiolite stress test in the last two months that were unremarkable. She recently went to the ER when advised by her immediate care center during one of her flares ups.   Her blood test revealed the following: (2/11/07) Occult blood 1.0 + abnormal epithelial cells 5-10 abnormal  D-dimer 564 abnormal CO2 33 slightly high (end of normal 32) K+ 3.4 slightly low (3.5-5.0) Cl- 95 low (end of normal 100) Folic acid 20 abnormal (3.3-12.4) Neutrophils 79.1 slightly high (49-79) BUN 19  creatinine 0.8 BUN/creatinine ratio 23.8  The chronic pain makes it difficult to sleep and she is getting frustrated with the various physicians/NPs that have not seemed to diagnose/treat the problem. Lately, she has felt a general malaise and fatigue with occassional +1 pedal edema at night. She occassionaly complains of leg pain as well.  It seems to me that she has a clinical presentation of glomerulonephritis or pyelonephritis. Could there be any other possible diagnoses likely, for example abdominal arotic aneurysm?   If is renal what can be done to help relieve the pain?  Thanks\n\n",

I would tend to favor kidney stones over infection as generally infections going on for that long would be quite severe and have other symptoms of fever and dysuria.  Her electrolytes are essentially normal.  I would not be concerned about these.  Her kidney function appears to be normal based on her creatinine and BUN.  I would recommend a few tests.  1) A complete urinalysis and culture to assess for infections.  2) a spot calcium/creatitine urine test to look for elevated urine calcium which can cause blood/pain even without overt kidney stones.  3) If the pain continues to be severe a renal ultrasound may be helpful but the best test for kidney stones is a CT scan.  Continued follow up with her doctor is important.  She may also want to see a kidney specialist or urologist to help guide the work up.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

The kidney is located under ultrasound, and then the health care provider will mark the biopsy site (usually the right side). A local anesthetic will be given to numb the skin at the biopsy site. A tiny incision is then made in the skin.   You will be asked to take a deep breath, hold it, and remain still as the locating needle (a needle that is used to locate the proper location in the kidney) is inserted through the incision and into the kidney under ultrasound guidance. You will then be asked to take several deep breaths to help verify the position of the needle.   The locating needle depth is measured and then removed. The biopsy needle is inserted following the path of the locating needle. Again, the position of the needle will be verified. The sample is taken, and the needle is removed. Pressure is applied to the biopsy site to stop the bleeding, and a bandage is applied. You will remain in the hospital after the test and lie on your back for 12 to 24 hours.   Meanwhile,  Retrograde PyelogramA cystoscopy (i.e., a procedure in which a telescopic instrument is inserted into the urethra) is performed to locate the opening from the ureter to the bladder. The contrast agent is injected directly into this opening and an x-ray is taken to locate the kidney stone.   This procedure eliminates the risk for an allergic reaction to the contrast agent because the dye does not reach the bloodstream, but it may require anesthesia. While retrograde pyelogram is the most reliable method for visualizing the urinary system and detecting stones, it is generally used only when other imaging methods are inadequate or unsuccessful.   overall it is ok to have both proceedures at the same time, those are the gold standard for the diagnosis of nephritis.\n\n",

    "title": "My 10 Yr Old Girl w/Strep",
    "content": "Hello my name is Amy and I have a few concerns about my 10 yr old girl. My ex got custody of her in Oct. and she has gained 20lbs in less than a year and today she has strep throat, and she has been hospitalized for guenonephritis(kidney problem?) in the past and she always has real rosy cheeks all the time. She lives 4 hrs away from me now and I am wondering why she has gained so much weight in such a short period of time.....She gained all of this weight while visiting last summer and going to live in Ohio in October with dad. So she has gained all of this weight in about 7 months. What should I be concerned about with all of the information I have given? Today her father said she is on antibiotics and I understand that.....for the strep..AND also he said she was taking steroids...WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? I have told my ex to keep an eye on her urine samples because she has had protein in her urine in the past and I do know that it is connected to her kidney problems she has had and that strep can bring about kidney problems. What can you tell me about the weight gain and the rosy cheeks and the steroids? Any advice is welcomed.......I would love your input! Thanks everyone!\n\n",

The use of steroids is usually to reduce inflammation etc. However, has the reason for the glomerulonephritis been investigated? That's my concern. Has there been any kidney function studies etc. done?  Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "content": "Hello.........Thank you for responding!  Well...I have had custody of my girls(Cassidy and Christina) their whole life until Oct 31st when my ex won custody of them...ANYWAYS..In the summer of 2003 Cassidy my 10 yr old was peeing like red brown so I took her to the ER and they admitted her saying her kidneys werent working right--something about the little tubes that go(well you know)ANYWAYS...She stayed for one day and they said she had hat long G word--(the topic above--LOL) so then her Dr. just kept track of her urine and she seemed ok....a couple weeks before that ER visit I remembered she was sick...and they said it was strepto---something something nephritis...Then this past Oct 2005 she got strep and I told the ER to check her urine because of what happened in 2003 summer and she had protein in her urine....So this was just before my ex husband got them and moved to Ohio and I am worried that the Dr in Ohio doesnt know everything about her--and I have told my ex what to watch for in Cassidy......SO NOW she has strep again(and her sister Christina too) and all I can think of is that her kidney \"mishap\" is going to happen again.  I am in PA and she had a great Dr. who knew her whole history and now she has this Dr. with her dad and I hope they got ALL of her medical records.  So right now that was it.....no other testing.....I am just worried because I have cared for her for her whole life and know I cant.  THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING CONCERNED\n\n",

    "content": "Sore throat is one of the most  common complaint of older children and adults seeking medical attention.  While Group A Streptococcus or Streptococcus pyogenes is an important cause of sore throat, viruses are by far more common. The fact that your daughter is on antibiotics in no way assures that she has a strep throat.  Unfortunately physicians will prescribe antibiotics emperically without adequately reviewing the criteria that make streptococcal pharyngitis more likely than viral or other pharyngitidies.  Sore thrat with inflammed enlarged tonsils and a purulent exudate (pus) and fever suggests a 80-90 percent chance that the presenting symtoms and signs are that of  strep throat . Sore throat alone, with tender swollen tonsils suggest  a less than a 30 percent chance of having a strep pahryngitis.  I have to assume that the physician who started her on antibiotics appropriately screened for evidence of Group A Strep.   Given the likelihood that she has Strep pharyngitis, then she is at a small but siginificant risk of developing complications from her infection.  These complications were common prior to the development of antiobiotics, but have declined in their prevalence. However they continue to be problematic even in developed countries. These problems are Acute Rheumatic Fever, which I am certain she did not have or else you would have mentioned her symptoms.  Toxic Shock Syndrome, which she did not have, and third, Acute Post Streptococcal Glomerulonephritis, the occurrence of which is markedly ameliorated by antibiotic treatment  . Poststreptococcal Glomerulonephritis is typically an acute disease, with spontaneous recovery occurring in almost all patients, even those who develop renal insufficiency during the acute episode.  Irreversible renal failure probably occurs in less than 1 percent of children and perhaps a slightly higher percentage of adults.  It occurs in roughly 5-10 percent of patients with Strep pharyngitis and 25 percent of patients with Strep skin infections.   The clinical presentation can vary from asymptomatic, microscopic hematuria (small amounts of blood in the urine undetectable to the eye),  to the full-blown acute nephritic syndrome, characterized by red to brown urine, proteinuria (protein in the urine-which can reach the nephrotic range or greater than 3 grams per day, normal being less than 150 milligrams per day), lower extremity or total body swelling,  hypertension(high blood pressure) , and acute renal failure.  The prognosis is generally favorable.   The fact that she has been hospitalized precviously for glomerulonephritis suggests she has another form of glomerulonephritis. One of the most common glomerulonephritides in children is what is called \"Nil disease\"  or also known as Minimal Change Glomerulonephritis. It is so named because the kidney biopsy appears normal under the light microscope but we see changes under the electron microscope and with immunologic fluorescence testing.  That may be why she is on chronic steroids.   Her weight gain, may well be related to steroids, or in fact may be due to diet and growth in combination with steroid use.  The rosy cheeks may also have its etiology in the use of steroids but may also suggest she's a healthy, robust 10 year old child.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi! Good Day! Im researching and would like to know more about membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. My aunt is sick with this disease. But still the doctors here is baffled about her diagnosis. She is a 57y/o female,executive. With a history of hypertension. She has hematuria though no proteinuria. She is asymptomatic, with no edema or the usual signs. Accdg. to her doctor, clinically she has chronic renal failure, though the etiology is unknown, histopath findings shows she has membranoprolifeartive glomerulonephritis and benign nephrosclerosis. Her other laboratory results are also contradictory according to her nephrologist here. Thats why no definite diagnosis can be stated yet. Please help me to know more about it, or direct me to websites that cane help me about this disease. Since her case is very rare, and her nephrologist says thats its a very good study case since its very rare and the laboratories results is puzzling. Im a medical student, and im worried for my aunt. Please help. thanks.\n\n",

I would like to know the results of a 24 hour collection for protein in mg/day and creatinine clearance in ml/min  2- you mentioned that there are \"puzzling lab results\" yet you have not revealed these.   Please submit your aunt's race, complete past medical surgical and family history as well as social habits. Include prior hospitalizations and any medications she might be taking either prescribed or over the counter. In addition I would ask to know the results of her kidney ultrasouns with regard to size and echogenicity as well as all of her lab work in chronological order. I would like to know the reason for her biopsy and the area of the world that you live in. Was the reason for biopsy isolated hematuria (in other words blood in the urine with minimal protein)?   I am interested in this case and if you reply I hope to be able to at least share some of what I know   Dr. L\n\n",
