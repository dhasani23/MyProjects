    "content": "Hello, Blood tests and MRI seem sound from considering the following 2 main possible diagnosis: diabetes lumbar disc disease (leg numbness)  Since the symptoms have started in the upper limb, the blood tests are further indicated.  But lumbar disc problems may be further suspected if the pain or symptoms worsen with activity or static postures such as extensive driving farther and farther down the road.   Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "In 1988 I came off a motorcycle and sustained multiple fractures of the patellas.  In 2007 I sustained a communted fracture of the right patella.  With the injury in 2007 I could still walk, although painful.  After 3 days I decided to have an x-ray and I was then sent for an MRI, which found the commuted fracture.  My GP sent me to a specialist, who decided as I was walking, nil treatment was required.  Since the first accident in 1988, I have experienced pain over the years, however I have learnt to manage/block out the pain.  I think this is why I was able to walk etc with the second injury.    Currently I am experiencing hip pain and right knee pain.  I had an x-ray of the hip which showed calcification of the top of the hip bone.  The GP decided I have a bursa (don't think this is correct).    In the last week I have done alot of walking and my knee pain is the same as the pain I experienced when I fractured the patella the 2nd time.  Is it possible to get a stress fracture from walking?  Could my hip pain be related to my patella?   Thanks,\n\n",

Regarding stress fracture from too much walking, under normal circumstances the bones should tolerated normal walking - even prolonged walking.  But in case of a fractured patella and prolonged walking the fracture site if not healed fully may cause great pain or poor healing.  It would worthwhile to re x-ray the knee and patella.

    "title": "Re: Osteopenia-   tread mill excercise",
    "content": "Hi,  It is well known that exercises have beneficial effects on bones. Human as well as animal studies have shown that exercises do increase bone mineral density (BMD), as well as bone mass and strength . In addition, exercise has been shown to protect against age-related bone loss.It is thought that the mechanical stresses generated by exercises play a crucial role in the osteogenic response. Human studies have investigated osteogenic responses to exercise in many types of training programs, such as running and walking, resistance training, aerobic exercise, and high-impact or jump exercise etc.   Most animal studies have investigated treadmill running and found beneficial effects on bone in induced osteopenia.Some isolated reports have noted that high-impact, low-repetition jump exercise has an osteogenic effect on lower limbs in middle-aged osteopenic rats.One must be careful in extrapolating these results in animal experiments to a human situation.   Weight-bearing exercises are those where one's muscles are working against gravity. These can be divided into low-impact and high-impact exercises.Low-impact weight-bearing exercises are advisable if one is already diagnosed with osteopenia and is at risk for fall or fracture. In low-impact, weight-bearing exercise, one should not jump or twist. Usually, one foot must always be on the ground.  Treadmills and stair-climbing machines provide low-impact weight-bearing benefit.Treadmills are OK as long as the speed is such that one does not start to run(in which case, it becomes a high impact exercise).Therefore, it is advisable to do treadmill exercises under supervision rather than to experiment with the speed settings. The other safer option is to join a low-impact aerobics class or go for a careful,brisk walk.  Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, With the type of pain in your shoulder, tendinitis is certainly a consideration.  You may even call it impingement syndrome where the rotator cuff tendon pinches under the acromion about half way up as you lift your arms away from the body to the overhead position (lifting outward to the side - not in front of the body).    The bursa may also become inflamed in this area too.  The causes of impingement include bony spurs on the acromion, muscle weakness in the shoulder, and repetitive overhead work (like painting).    Treatment consists of an exercise program, NSAIDs, ice or heat.     Since rotator cuff impingement can lead to rotator cuff tear it is important to treat this correctly so physical therapy is often prescribed.  Take care and God bless.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Thanks for writing in.  Yes, studies have shown that high impact exercise increases bone mineral density (especially in young women as they reach their peak bone mass usually in their 20's).  As women age, the Improvement lessens and exercise's goal is for maintenance of bone density.   Jogging can increase your risk of foot,ankle, knee and hip problem.  So if you plan to start a jogging program, I would recommend 6 weeks of leg strengthening and stretching before starting to run.  Also, you should be able to walk at least the same time or distance you plan to run (This should be obvious but some people go right into running - there was a recent report of an unconditioned man who was forced to run mile after mile as training in a \"prison boot camp\".  He suffered bilateral tibial plateau fractures...from running on unconditioned legs.)  This preparation will build a good strength and flexibility foundation.  The other benefits of running are cardiovascular and some say mental improvement.  The eliptical machine can be incorporated into the 6 weeks conditioning program and can be used as a cross training exercise during your running program.    Yes, smaller framed women tend to become osteoporotic more than heavier women.  The exact mechanism is unknown - whether it's thicker bones or the extra weight?  Other factors affecting bone density: hormones (parathyroid, estrogen), nutrition, amount of sun exposure, smoking, excessive alcohol use, and medication (glucocorticoids).  Hope this helps.  Keep us posted and happy exercising.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  It sounds as though you may have something pressing on the radial or medial nerve on that side, probably in the area of the shoulder, but there's no guarantee it's there. It  could  be somewhere else higher up or further down. The problem is that nerves not only don't fix themselves, they also rarely get out from under things that are pressing them nor move themselves back into their native postions, at least without some outside help, which can  range from physical therapy to minor surgery.   First thing to do would be to see a neurologist who can help determine which nerve is causing the symptoms and locate where the impingement is located. Once that's done he (or she) can refer you to either physical therapy or a neurosurgeon who can free the entrapped nerve or get things back into proper alignment.  Sometimes with this sort of problem the solution is as simple as doing certain  types of stretching exercises. It  all depends. It seems likely the problem is fairly simple since there's no known trauma.   I hope this helps.  Best of luck to you with this.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi. I am a 37 yo female. Just had 3rd child 6mo ago. I had noticed my hands bothering me while pg, but just chalked it up to that,being pregnant. Well it is 6mo later and they seem to be getting worse. It got much worse 2m ago and I then thought maybe my wedding ring was bothering my left ring finger so removed it. But the finger still hurts,as does pinky next to it and now all the finger joints in middle and top of finger closest to finger nail are basically achy,even to the touch. But the left ring finger in particular feels really almost like it has a bruise,but nothing is visible and it has been like this for over 2mo. It is whole top side mid section of finger. When I wake in morning they are worst,or if I wake in middle of night . I can not fully bend my hands,they feel somewhat swollen and stiff. By afternoon they are not too bad,except that left finger always hurts. I have been not feeling well since having baby, was finally dx w/ reflux about 3-4m ago and just finished nexium. My throat does feel maybe 85% better with all that,but now I have this hand thing really bothering me.I was thinking RA,lyme,something from the nexium maybe???(but I stopped nexium a couple w/ ago).\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I am a 56 year old female who has been treated for Cushing's Disease (surgical removal of the pituitary adenomai).  As a results of my disease, my bones were damaged and I became osteoporotic.  I have had somewhere between 8 and 10 vertebral fractures as well as rib fractures.  I have been on large doses of calcium and have been treated with Fosamax and Actonel (not at the same time).  The possibility of PTH injections has been mentioned but I do have some concerns about he fact that osteosarcoma is a possible complications of the medication as well as the fact there are not that many years of data to give a long-term  picutre.  Also I have recently heard that even though the durg was approved for people who have had unsuccessful results from Fosamar or Actonel, some are saying that the benefits of the injections are really not very good in people who have already been treated with the traditional osteoporosis medications, that it may be better for people with osteoporosis as a first-line of treatment.  Well, I'm a little confused as I have heard different ideas about how effective this might be.  Obviously I don't want to take any medication which presents a potentially serious complication but on the other hand, I don't want to rob myself of the possibility of having some significant improvement in my bone condition.  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Medications such as Fosamax and Actonel have been around for a little while and are generally considered appropriate treatments for osteoporosis.  PTH injections are a relatively new thing, I suspect.  I was not aware that they were being done.  PTH works to increase calcium resorption from bone (taking the calcium out of bone) so I don't really understand how this would help.  Raising PTH levels would lead to decreased calcium supplies in bone-the opposite effect of what is desired.  My advise to you would be to discuss this possible treatment with 1) a doctor that is familiar with and has used this treatment (you don't want to be the first one to try it out) and 2) an endocrinologist who understands the mechanisms of PTH and calcium homeostatis very well.  This will give you the best information to make an informed decision.  Best wishes.\n\n",

For example, Infection, pneumonia, and blood clots are frequently the cause of mortality. In the elderly population, the mortality rates are highest during the first year following the hip fracture. After that, according to studies, the rate of mortality seems to decline as a direct result or complication of the fracture itself. Many elderly may not return to the activity function of the pre-injury level. Is she being treated for the osteoporosis? Is there a reason rehab has not been initiated?

    "content": "Hello,  Forteo (Teriparatide) is a form of the naturally occurring human parathyroid hormone. Is only supplied and delivered to the body as a subcutaneous injection. Teriparatide forms new bone, increases bone mineral density and bone strength and reduces the chances of broken bones. It is used for the treatment of osteoporosis in both men and postmenopausal women who are at high risk for bone fractures, or who have failed or are intolerant of previous osteoporosis therapy. It may also be used for other purposes as prescribed by the Doctor.   Warnings: In male and female rats, Teriparatide caused an increase in the incidence of osteosarcoma (a malignant bone tumor) that was dependent on dose and treatment duration. The following categories of patients have increased baseline risk of osteosarcoma and should not be treated with Forteo: Paget\u2019s disease, pediatrics, prior radiation therapy, patients with metabolic bone disease other than osteoporosis, patients with bone metastases or skeletal malignancies & patients with pre-existing hypercalcemia.  Use of the drug for more than 2 years has not been evaluated and is not recommended at this time. (all of the above information from the Physicians Desk Reference)\n\n",

    "content": "Indeed, Forteo (or in Europe Forsteo) is a good drug for osteoporosis, but until now not in the first line. As the GP suggested, the drugs like Fosamax are in first line and should be prescribed before Forteo. Although Forteo is a promising drug, the scientific data are limited, the costs are high and there is no prove that it should be used before the bisphosphonates (like Fosamax). Recommendations suggest to use Forteo in case of side effects under bisphosphonates or refractory osteoporosis.\n\n",

    "title": "Forteo Side Effect?",
    "content": "I'm a 63 yo female, 5'4\", small boned, w/mild Crohn's disease, 6 cm simple ovarian cyst I have opted to monitor for the past 3 years, osteoporosis and COPD. Altho my osteoporosis is severe I remain active (horseback riding, walking) and (knock on wood) no fractures.  Due to the Crohn's I admantly will not for a second consider the oral bisphosphonates. Just prior to the approval of Forteo I opted for a pamidronate infusion (Aredia - infusable bisphosphonate). With the advent of Forteo I read up on it thoroughly including the rat studies. Rats grow bone throughout their life, humans do not; rats were \"fed\" Forteo from birth to death; it is only approved for 2 years use in humans after maximum bone growth years. Despite my dread of self-injection I opted for the Forteo. Its been less than a year so far so I have no idea of any improvement in bone density.  However, a possible \"minor\" side effect has made an appearance. I've weighed 115-120 since the age of 13 except for pregnancies and 2 Crohn's exacerbations. I've always had a flat tummy and waist. I had some weight loss last year and was down to 98 lbs in July of last year. I've since gained back to 112-114 and have plateaued there. I started the Forteo injections in early August of last year. Since I am now retired I walk on a treadmill and ride an Airdyne exercise bike for a 1/2 hour each twice a week plus horseback riding and walking.   I have developed 3 \"spare tires\" or \"rolls\" slightly above the waist; below the waist and across the abdomen. I've spoken to 4 others on Forteo who have developed \"spare tires\" as well. My Endo is unaware of this as a Forteo side effect. Eli Lilly denies it as a reported side effect in 2% or more of clinical trial participants.  I would like to know how many others have encountered this \"spare tire\" whilst on Forteo. Side effect or coincidence?\n\n",

    "content": "Recent research, including that of other PTH type meds for osteoporosis such as Preos, is indicating that bisphosphonate treatment prior to PTH treatment slows down the good effects of the PTH. The bisphosphonates do not boost new bone growth but rather slow natural bone death, the PTHs are proving to increase natural bone growth. Indications are that PTH therapy for two years followed by bisphosphonate therapy along with adequate calcium and vitamin D intake and weight bearing exercise is currently the most promising way to treat osteoporosis.\n\n",

Since you did have an inury and have wear and tear between the vertebrae, it's most likely osteoarthritis.      You really should see a doctor if you are having not just tingling,  but numbness in the hand or arm.  It is treated with antiinflammatories, but with the possibly serious side effects of NSAIDs, talk to your doctor about it first.\n\n",

All, I did was sleep on my exercise mat, wake up and my arm killed, fingers were numb....  as the day progressed it got worse. It never occured to me that it was my neck, because my neck didn't hurt. In fact, my arm felt like it was a neck that had a crink in it......... Ouch.  I've had many people tell me they elected for surgery and were fixed up within a few months.

    "content": "Dear Celtic girl,  It can do...possibly.   Arthritis can be degenerative (due to wear and tear) or inflammatory (due to the the joint lining being inflamed for example beacuse of gout, or rheumatoid arthritis. Inflammatory arthritis is, as the name would suggest associated with warmth of the joint.   Generally it is not the muscles that feel warm though.  Warmth in the muscle itself (as opposed to the joints) can be as you suggest, due to increased activity. But when you are not exercising...well that I guess is more likely to be either due to systemic increased temperature (when you have a fever) or if localised to a particular area, one might expect that there may be an underlying focus of inflammation such as an infection or abscess...

    "content": "I am a 54 year old woman with arthritis of the spine and knees.  Since about my twenties I have had episodes of extensive \"all over\" joint pain that lasts anywhere from 2 to 4 days, and which occur at least 2-3 times a month.  This pain is different from my arthritis pain in that it occurs in every joint at the same time and there is a feeling of burning fire in every joint also. Nothing seems to help relieve the pain.  I have taken medication from anti-inflammatories to narcotics and get no relief.  In fact, the only thing that feels good is a cool bath to ease the sensation of fiery heat.  During these episodes, I cant sleep, rest or function at all.  I spend the time curled up in bed with a cool fan blowing on me.  Can you explain to me what this might be?  Is there anything that can be done to ease the pain and/or make me more functional at this time. I appreciate any understanding you can give me on this. Thanks, Carolyn\n\n",

    "content": "I have been told I have degenerative osteoarthritis of the entire spine, knees, one ankle and both hands.  In fact I am being scheduled for bilateral total knee replacements over the next few months because of total loss of cartilage in the knees.  I am very familiar with what that kind of joint pain feels like.  When it is my usual arthritis pain of just  a few joints that hurt they get a little red at the joint and I hear a grating sound and feel pain when moving the joint.  This other problem though feels more like a severe aching all-over from the flu and hurts whether I move or lay still.  Could all my joints actually start and stop hurting at exactly the same time?  Can anything be done to relieve the pain. All the doctors offer me is narcotics since all the antiinflammatories have failed.  They are now talking about putting in a pain pump due to my resistance to oral narcotics in relieving pain?  Help, I am too young for all this.

    "content": "Dear Carolyn,  It seems like a long time (since you were in your twenties) for this to be going on without being seen a specialist. And if you were seen by a specialist, a rheumatologist in this case, what was the opinion given.  If your joints swell up and become red, this might be a kind of arthritis that has a recurrent course. But they are usually localized in certain joints though. The typical example for such kind is crystal-induced arthritis like gout and if this is the case then the degenerative arthritis that you have is most probably secondary to this arthritis as even though i am not a rheumatologist but i think that you are, like you said, still young for all this including to have both your knees replaced.  It is not a bad idea to check your bone density as well as part of the regular check up as you are post menopausal now (i would assume) and need your bones checked as it is very strongly recommended nowadays especially if you are a white woman, who used to smoke, exercise rarely, have a family history of osteoporosis or fractures in elderly women in the family.

    "content": "Actually the first sign of arthritis started at about age 13 when I had pretty bad pain in my finger joints and my hands were always so cold.  They did a test which included putting a tube down into my stomach and withdrawing gastric fluids.  This was done over several hours as I remember and was supposed to show them whether I had true arthritis or not. At age 14 the spinal pain started and I was diagnosed as having Scheurman\"s Disease of he back and wore a steel and leather back brace for over a year to help support my spine as they said the muscles were not strong enough to support the spine yet.  I don't know if this has any connection or not but thought it was worth mentioning.  Anyway,  I have been trying hard to get my doctors to take my current condition seriously but when you deal with a system like Kaiser Permenente, they don't seem do want to do anything unless it is life-threatening.  I just keep being told its just arthritis and I have to learn to live with it.  Well, I don't agree that it is that \"simple\", but I don't know what to tell them to get them to take this matter seriously.  Any suggestions?

If the x-rays are normal and you are suspecting a fissure fracture (fracture that is hair thin) not sometimes detected by x-rays, your mother can ask her doctor if he/she thinks that it is appropriate to do a bone scan to detect those subtle fractures if there are any.  Another thing is to make sure to check a spine x-ray to make sure that the pain is not due to spine fractures. Have your mother ever had herpes of the skin (shingles)?  These are some thoughts that you can ask your mom's doctor about. However, i have not examined your mother and these are only suggestions of course.
