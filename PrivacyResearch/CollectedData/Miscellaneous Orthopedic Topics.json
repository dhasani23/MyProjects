    "content": "Hello, To evaluate the cause of the hip popping and pain, start with a plain x-ray and consult your local orthopedist. You may also consider pelvic or lower spine problems which can refer pain to the hip. Occasionally, we use an MRI to assess the structure within or around the hip joint. Treatment plan options follow the results of the clinical exam and special tests.   Take care.\n\n",

Also i don't know if this would have anything to do with the pain or not but when you put your hand on the front of the knee it feels cold, or well colder then the rest of the leg.

    "content": "Hello, Thanks for the pictures and inquiry. Sometimes severe ankle sprains can damage the outside ligaments and make the ankle unstable.  Besides the risk of recurrent sprains, an unstable ankle can cause pain and eventual arthritis. I recommend seeing an orthopedist for a clinical examination and x-rays.  Furthermore, an MRI may help view the outside ligament for damage.  In any event, you will need to protect the ankle from further sprains.  For this, perform ankle rehab exercise per your physical therapist.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Last fall, after finally being diagnosed with serious tendonitis in both of my arms and discontinuing work (shipping and receiving), I had an as yet unexplained experience: While tearing the package for a tea bag, I felt a deep \"itchy feeling\" on the inside of my left forearm, a few inches up from the wrist. I rubbed the area a couple of times and felt a snap - I KNOW something let go, because the tension in my muscles suddenly eased, but the pain was so severe that I almost passed out. I immediately developed a bulge in the muscle just below my elbow, and right after that my entire arm started swelling - from fingers up through shoulder and into my upper left chest area. I took Motrin 800 that had been prescribed for tendonitis pain, and went to see my orthopedic doctor the next day. Swelling in my arm had subsided by then, but I still had a bulge below my elbow. Doc's diagnosis was \"I doubt that anything snapped, it just looks like a bruise to me, keep taking the Motrin and you will be fine. 8 months later, I still have an abnormal bulge in my arm below the elbow, occasional pain in my forearm with use, no gripping strength in my left hand, and inability to flex my thumb to my palm. I still believe that a tendon ruptured, but what tests can I request that will prove it?\n\n",

    "content": "Good afternoon- I am 4 years post fasciotomy for chronic exertional compartment syndrome.  All four compartments in both legs were released. My right leg, has some nerve damage with numb spots--primarily on the outside of my leg and the top of my foot.  I also seem to be prone to posterior tibial tendinitis in that same leg.  Other than that, the surgery was a success.  The past 2-3 months, I have been getting the sensation of ants crawling on my legs.  It is not constant and both legs are affected.  It feels exactly as described and is bothersome, especially when I am sitting outdoors.  I have to look, because sometimes it is, in fact, an ant!  In addition, the outside of my left leg cramps up quite often.  The cramp starts halfway up my leg and goes down into my ankle and the outside of my foot.  This happens at rest and when I am active.  This started about 3-4 months ago.  Could these symptoms be related to my surgery?  I am not sure if it is \"just one of those things\" that comes along with the surgery or if it could be something more.  Thanks for your time.\n\n",

I had a hard time lifting it up to brush my teeth. Simple things like putting on a tshirt, shaking a bottle, picking up something thats usually light, were hard to do. I went to the doctor and he suggested that it may be a pinched nerve. There was inflammation and so he prescribed me 2 Advil, 3 times a day for a week. The pain is still here, and my shoulder is still pretty weak. I can barely lift a 5 pound dumbbell laterally and shaking a can of deoderant is hard too. Help?

An MRI of the cervical spine may be in order.  Also, doing nerve conduction velocity tests and EMG (testing the muscles for nerve impulses / connections) may add value to the diagnosis. Ask your physician about these tests to see if they are indicated for your symptoms and history.  Take care.\n\n",

    "title": "Hard, growing lump in forearm",
    "content": "I have had a lump in my left forearm, just below the bend of the elbow since around February of this year. It started out completely under the skin - it was pea sized but could only be felt if specifcally looking for it and was not visible to the eye. I randomly noticed it one day but because I couldn't see anything I sort of forgot about it. About a month and a half later I noticed that it had grown, and was visible to the eye as a small lump protruding from the skin. It didn't really hurt when prodded or squeezed, and felt very hard and didn't move much. I went to the doctor about it, who said that it was not a ganglion and was not really sure what it was so referred me to have an ultrasound scan. I had to wait about a month and a half to get the referral and appointment and in that time the lump has continued to grow - it is now about the size of a grape or almond and is protruding from the skin and is very noticeable when my arm is stretched out. It has also started to become painful when pressing/feeling it. The skin around it is not bruised or different in color to the rest of my arm.  I had the ultrasound scan done a few days ago, and was told that the lump was not connected to the tendon/joint/bone/vein etc, and as such they still weren't sure where it was coming from. I have been referred to have an MRI scan.  What could this be? I am obviously quite concerned that it is continuing to grow and becoming painful, and things like tumours and cancer keep going through my mind though I'm sure there are many other explanations. I am almost 24 years old and female, if this has any bearing on things.  Many thanks.\n\n",

Two days after this procedure i the top of my right lung collaspsed this did not require a chest drain and resolved itself. This mean't that the physio that i received for about 2 weeks was not as aggressive as it should have been. I believe that the operation was unsuccessful as i have exactly the same movement if not worse that before the procedure. No external rotation and stuggle to get above 90 degrees when raising arm to the side and in front of me. Pain is still a big problem also. I have exhausted physio and have tried hydrothearpy with no success. The physio has told me she can't help anymore and i have been discharged. She also stated that when i go back to see my surgeon next week..... he will probably tell me he can't help me anymore also. I am only 30yrs old.... and am right handed..... this frozen shoulder is preventing  me from obtaining a job and effects my qualitiy of life. Am i a candidate for capsular release and can i insist that i want something else done?...... I have already been in pain for two years prior to the bursitis surgery and the prospect of waiting a further 2yrs for this to resolve on its own is a very depressing thought and i can't cope with it any longer. Any suggestions would be greatly received. Thanks in advance\n\n",

If the condition is a musculoskeletal problem, a referral to an orthopedist may be the next right step.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "This medical history is for my father who is 75 years old.  Since the last 8 months he has been complaining about a grinding left shoulder cuff pain. The pain radiates more intensively to the back while sleeping.  He cannot lift his left hand above the shoulder position. It hurts him very bad when he raises his left hand above shoulder level.   Other movements of his hands seem fine. Right hand functions correctly and all movements are fine. Just the left hand cannot be moved beyond the shoulder level.  He is from India, the doctors in India, performed a shoulder cuff X-ray and mentioned that they did not see anything wrong with the bones around the shoulder.  They suggested that a physiotherapy might help his case. So He went to see a physiotherapist for a week. But that did not help.   He did say that he gets some relief from hot/cold compress massage that we got him from walgreens.  I am really concerned as to why he cannot raise his hand beyond the shoulder level. That does not look good. Also he sometimes seem to be in pain.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi all.  13 weeks ago I injured my left knee playing soccer. My weight was on my left leg with my right leg off the ground, when i was pulled from the side. This caused my left knee to over extend inwards towards my body.  I have had an MRI scan and consulted an orthopedic surgeon. They have told me that there is no cartilage damage and that i have a Grade 1 sprain/tear to my MCL & PCl. They said no surgery was required and to consult a phsyio for treatment.  The physio has treated my MCL with Ultra sound etc. and says it just needs time to heal now. He says with the PCL i will just have to give it time to heal as there is not much he can do for it. Just to rest and continue to take anti-inflammatories.  The one thing is that i cant straighten my knee fully after all this time. The physio was concerned with this as he said I should be able to straighten it by now. He did some exercises and stretches on it to increase the flexibility a bit but the next day it just goes back to the same. Its only the last, maybe 5 degrees, that i cant get past. There is alot of pain just to the right of my knee cap when i try to straighten it so it cant be my MCL as the pain is not in the correct region  Is this something you have heard of with these injuries. My physio has alot of experience with these type of injuries and sporting injuries but he said he has never seen someone not being able to not straighten their leg. I am going to go back to my surgeon for another consult and am trying to find as much information as i can    Thanks for any help you can give\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, In most cases of clavicle fractures, the treatment of choice is to brace the shoulders for comfort and use analgesics as needed and allow 4-6 weeks for healing.  The definite time to operate occurs when the skin is broken by one of the fractured fragments (open fracture). Otherwise there is no additional benefit from surgically reducing or fixing the fracture. It is hard to determine from your note the source of the pain - the shoulder joint versus the muscles around the shoulder versus the fracture site itself.   Over time the fracture should heal and limitations are minimal. I would suggest having a physician re-evaluate the shoulder to check for other problems or causes of dysfunction.   There may have been other structures damaged during the initial clavicle fracture incident.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi I have experienced an ongoing problem that I first noticed about 3 and a half years ago. I am a 21 year old male who tends to be very physically active as long as my body can keep up. When I was 18 I began to notice what I perceived as chest wall pain. It felt like all around my right chest wall and sternum that the cartilage was more prominent and tender. I saw multiple doctors and had all types of tests and scans and blood work done and the only diagnosis they came up with was costochondritis. I attempted rest and ice along with nsaids, and I have completed that same procedure multiple times throughout these years hoping for anything that will help. Nothing ever helped. I continued to just deal with it and I would go through phases where I would do no physical activity at all, to maybe light activity or just basketball and no weightlifting, to attempting to workout the best I can. It has really come in the way of everything for me since I have a passion for working out and playing basketball. But I have seen all types of doctors from orthopedists, to thoracic doctors to thoracic surgeons to cardiologists to internists. I finally found a doctor last summer who thought he knew what the problem was and said i had abnormal cartilage in my ribs, I had surgery performed and he removed cartilage and some rib under my pec muscle on the right side of my chest. I thought I had a solution but another problem surfaced and the sternum pain and tightness all in my chest never went away. My major pain areas now are going from the midline in my sternum towards my right side (so my ribs and muscles in my right pec) and my right clavicle and sc joint. I have done so much research on all these things for so long and am just hoping for some insight and something to help me get better. My sc joint on my right side and my sternum both crack and click and constantly bother me and always make me feel uncomfortable and in pain, it also feels like all the muscles in my right pec are tighter and I can just tell something wrong is going on.  I am a student in college and I can not even study without being consistently bothered by this pain. It also effects me in so many more ways but I am just hoping for some help, and everything on my left side is completely normal and doesn't bother me at all. I am hoping for any beneficial insight, advice, or opinions on this as it is such a rare case and I am yet to find a doctor or someone who can diagnose my problem and help me move forward. Thank you in advance\n\n",

Conservative treatment includes bracing, quadricep muscle strengthening and retraining, stretching and pain control measures.  If conservative measures fail and dislocation becomes chronic and debilitating then surgery is an option.  A lateral reticulum release would likely be done - surgically releasing or cutting the tight fibrous tissue under the skin just to the outside of the knee cap.  Risks and benefits of this procedure should be discussed with an orthopedic surgeon.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I have had pain in my left hip joint, which I only feel when I bend my leg or my left leg is put into motion where the hip joint is used. This is an inner pain near the groin, so I am confident it is a hip joint issue. I first noticed this pain in 2007 on an elliptical machine. I recently noticed it again because I started exercising and used the same machine. Therefore, this leads me to believe that this hip joint pain is chronic. Also, because I only noticed it while exercising, this tells me the pain is only felt when activity forces my leg to bend causing hip joint pain. I am 26 years old, and I can't remember any trauma that may have occurred to cause this pain. I am about 5'10, and I used to weigh close to 300, but now I am close to 200. Would this weight have any impact on why I am having this hip joint pain? Also, I used to have high blood sugar issues (diabetes) because of my weight, but this has also come down as well to regular levels. This pain is felt with motion, I have tried to stretch to perhaps increase the range of motion, but I think this has just caused me to feel more pain. Can anyone please offer insight into this problem? Unfortunately, I am a hypochondriac, and I imagine the worst case scenario which is cancer. However, this pain has not increased or gotten worse since 2007, and I would think that bone cancer would progress. Insight would be highly appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Your hip pain can arise from a number of structures in, around or near the hip.  First, lumbar (lower back) issues can refer pain to the hip.  Second, the  hip joint itself including the cartilage and labrum (padding in the hip joint) can be damaged.  Thirdly, the ligaments and tendon around the joint can be inflamed.  Fourthly, the muscle around the hip can be strained, sore or tight. In essence, have a orthopedist, physical therapist or physiatrist evaluate the hip for proper diagnosis.  Likely, the condition is benign and fixed with conservatie treatment (ice, NSAIDS and theraputic exercise).  Take care.\n\n",

    "title": "'High-Grade' ankle ligament injury, w/ MRI results.",
    "content": "Hey everyone, I bent my left ankle up out in the field (bent inwards leaving the pain on the outside of the left ankle).  I went to the ER and they said oh it not a big deal, once your off crunches you should be ok to go back to work.  Well this happened on the 7 of July  this year and I am still in the padded boot they gave me.  I am currently doing PT on the ankle and my treating phy. is sending in a specialist/surgeon to look at my ankle.  I got a pretty good amount of range of motion on the foot right now.  The pain is pretty moderate to extremely painful when walking.  It hurts the most when coming off the heel when trying to take a step. All around the ball of the ankle and in front and bottom of the ball.  The swelling has gone down a good amount but it is still swollen some and it almost looks like something is wanting to protrude out, right in the center of the ankle.  (On the outside)  They ordered and MRI for me, I will give you guys the results.  All i was told was, ya thats not great news and that I was going to need to see a specialist.  Please Excuse my long post.  1. High-Grade injury to the anterior talofibular ligament and calcaneofibular ligament. Extensive surrounding soft issue edema and the presence of bone marrow constusional injury.  2. Bone marrow Contusion within the inferior margin of the medial malleolus and within the inferior aspect of the talar head.  No Fracture  3. Moderate tenosynovitis of the peroneal tendons.  4. Low-Grade injury to the deep fibers of the deltoid ligament.  5. Small ankle joint effusion with small ganglion cyst formation extending into the posterior soft tissues.   What I would like to know?    They called in a specialist and surgeon, what are my odds (if yall can tell me) of needing to have surgery?  I work in a VERY hard labored job.  I need my ankle to be 100% like it was, I cannot have a re injury.    Are my findings from the MRI scan pretty typical of a normal ankle sprain and I am just jumping to conclusion or was this more sever than most?  Finally, did i actually tear anything?  I assume not since it doesn't say the word \"tear\" but I also don't really know what all this means haha.  Perhaps thats what high grade injury means, I have no idea.    I don't expect you guys to be the end all be all of my case here but I would really be thankful on yalls shoot from the hip opinions on what I have posted.  My main concern is if I will possibly need surgery to help fix the ankle.  Cause honestly, nothing has changed in about 3 weeks, even with PT.  Again sorry for the long post, I wish everyone a great week and I hope to hear from yall soon!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The MRI results show the results of a severe lateral ankle sprain.  Surgical repair is not likely needed unless the ankle joint is unstable (from a ligament tear - not reported on MRI).  Be patient with your rehabilitation as several structures were damaged.  Bone bruises or contusion take awhile to heal.  Expect at least 3-4 more weeks of recovery until the ankle starts to feel good.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I'm 19 y.o. female and I've been wondering about some irregular things that have been happening in my wrists, primarily in my right wrist. My wrists feel always feel tight, like they need to be popped. When I pick things up, or squeeze my wrists they grind and pop. The pain varies depending on the day, but typically, I am either annoyed by the tight feeling, or bothered by a mild nagging pain. Occasionally the pain can get quite severe. I don't know if it matters, but I am a violinist. Is there any chance that I have carpel tunnel syndrome, or will develop carpel tunnel based on these symptoms? Is this something i need to pursue, or do I just need wrist braces or something?\n\n",

It doesn't sound like carpal tunnel syndrome which typically presents with hand numbness and if severe hand weakness.

    "content": "2 weeks ago I mistepped off of a sidewalk and injured myself.  I iced it right away and elevated it.  My foot swelled a bit, especially around my ankle bone.  A few days later a bruise emerged around the ankle bone and down my foot to my little toe to my middle toe.  It wasn't a very dark bruise.  The swelling eventually went down after icing it and elevating it for a week.  My ankle feels much better but there is still some swelling and pain on the top of my foot just above my little toe to middle toe.  The pain extends towards the outside of my foot and when I walk up the stairs it feels very strange, like something is loose.  I am planning to go to a walk in clinic this week but was hoping someone may have an opinion of what I may have done to my foot.  Thank you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Abnormal Shaped Chest.",
    "content": "Hi, Thank you for your post. This condition is known as \"Pectus Carinatum\" (pigeon chest). (Carina, is a Latin word for the keel of a ship or for its entire hull Carina, in ancient Roman architecture, is the name given to any building resembling a ship. More simply, it means a \"ridge\").  This condition is one among the several protrusion anomalies of the chest wall. This has been further classified depending upon the site of maximun protrusion as, - manubrial (chondromanubrial), or - at the body of the sternum (chondrogladiolar).  It may be, - congenital, or - aquired (ex., following median sternotomies).  There is a male preponderance. The deformity may be evident at birth or become noticeable during puberty. Some cases may be associated with congenital heart disease. Minimal deformities are usually asymptomatic.  In conditions of normality, as the chest wall moves during the respiratory cycle, both the anteroposterior (A-P) and side-to-side diameters of the chest increase during inspiration.The sternum moves forward to increase the A-P diameter.In severe forms of pectus carinatum, this movement becomes severely restricted causing respiratory difficulties.  Management: Upto the age of 18 years, compression braces have been found to be useful in some cases. These act in a manner similar to the orthodontic braces. In adults (especially who have respiratory compromise),surgery may be the only option. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I'm very new here, so first of all sorry if I make mistakes (and also for my poor english). Since 12 years ago I started to suffer under my feet after some soccer with friends. It worsened little by little and in the last 3 years it became unbearable. I decided for surgery, and they operated my right foot, cutting away a slice of heel and inserting a big screw to shift it outside. They also cutted my \"plantar fascia\" (?) to reduce the arch of the foot. All this... for nothing: the pain is still there, unchanged. I then went to a chiroprator that said \"tarsal tunnel\" and fixed it (he said) but again the pain is there. I'm trying a TECAR terapy... the first session seemed to work greatly, but then nothing again. Last surgeon just changed my arch supports. My pain is everywhere under my feet (both, equally) on all the surface. The sensation is like the last 0.5 cm (0.2\") of the foot are burning. This happens when I walk even more when I stand, but also when I drive or even when I sit but put an ankle on the other (so just the weight of part of the 2 legs). It's really debilitating, and nobody can help till now, so I'm trying to find a solution here, even somebody who had the same \"thing\". Thank you very much. Nym\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It sounds like you may have been suffering from chronic plantar fasciitis coupled with a pes cavus foot ...and the rear foot was tilted inward too much (inverted) hence the surgery. With chronic foot problems including pain and abnormally shaped foot, it is important to do a few things for long term health. 1. Have a specialist evaluate the entire leg - biomechanical problems with the feet usually affect the knee and hip and all the soft tissue in between and address deficits  2. Treat the immediate pain and any future flare ups with NSAIDS, hot and cold packs, proper orthotic use and theraputic exercise  3. Proper foot wear.  Specialists include podiatrist and physical therapists.  Take care.\n\n",

I had x-rays at the time to prove nothing was broken and the doctor said that I probably strained the tendon(s). I felt like it has gotten better but not as good as I hoped and now it will make this popping noise at that joint at times (more often after use) which doesn't really hurt but feels tender like a bruise when the popping occurs or when joint is squeezed. The doctor told me that its kinda like arthritis but in the finger since it hasn't completely healed and that I would be okay to bowl when bowling leagues start back up. Does this sound like something else to you or do you agree with what my doctor has said and that I would be okay to start bowling again in August? Thanks for your help. Jason\n\n",

    "title": "Knee pain while unbending since giving birth.",
    "content": "For 6 weeks now I've had severe pain in my left knee and I don't know why. It started just a couple days after having my baby girl, so I'm guessing that might have something to do with it. It hurts most when my knee has been bent for any amount of time. Even just bending it for 30 seconds it will hurt as I straighten it out. If I have it bent for more than 2 minutes or so then it hurts extremely bad as I straighten it out and I have to go very slowly. It doesn't hurt while it's bent unless it's bent for about half an hour or more. When I walk around it also starts to hurt while walking and sometimes the knee starts to give out and I almost fall but it doesn't give out all the way so I can catch my balance.  Some other bits of information that might be helpful: -There were no complications or pain medications (just gas and air) during my labor; I was completely healthy. -I'm 19 years old. -No history with me or family of arthritis. -Knee hurts when it's straightened also just not as bad it's just a constant sore feeling. -There is no swelling or redness. -I have not had any injuries to my knee. -Before the pain started I used to have times when something in my knee felt like it slipped out of place and it would feel like it was clicking against something. It made walking very uncomfortable and I had to straighten my leg and sort of twist it around  to set everything back to normal. This has not happened again since the pain started. -It's only my left knee, the right one is just fine. -It happens anytime I unbend my knee regardless or if I'm laying down, sitting up, standing, or whatever else. -Bending the knee doesn't hurt, only un-bending hurts (A LOT). -I do sit up in bed a lot and I'm not very active. But I go for 2 hours of walking at least 3 times a week. -I don't lift anything heavy.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I am 23 years old, and I have been living with severe joint dislocations for some time now. When I was a baby, I had major problem with my elbows and shoulders, to the point where my parents could not even pick me up anywhere but around the waist, without a trip to the emergency room to have either my elbow or shoulder put back into place. In 2001 my left knee stared to dislocate, I have had surgery on it already, but obviously it didn't work because I am still living with dislocations in that knee. In 2004 I dislocated my right hip, and it poped back with a little persuation and pulling power. In 2006 I was pregnant and the morning sickness got the better of me when I then had to go to the emergency room yet again for a dislocated jaw, on both sides. I now take a pill for my immune system hoping I will not get sick to my stomach again and dislocate my jaw another time vomitting. I'm at a loss here!! Is there something I can do for my joints to keep them from dislocating, apart from parking it on a couch the rest of my life, and ignoring my active life style? I wear a brace on my knee when I am going to be out running or riding horses, my shoulder and elbows I have learned to live with, my hip has only dislocated the once and I don't have many problems with it, my jaw dislocates anytime i vomit, or if I yawn to big. Is there some kind of name for my problem??? Some sort of disease maybe so I can put a name to my problem?? I'm so sick of living with this honestly, what more can I do outside of surgery??

    "title": "Re: Repetative joint dislocations in various joints in my body??",
    "content": "Hello, There is a condition called hypermobility syndrome which describes general hypermobility of both joints and skin.   Four criteria help define this syndrome: 1. hyperextension the pinky finger at the knuckle to 90 degrees or extend the thumb to touch the forearm - painlessly. 2. extend the elbow 10 degrees beyond neutral 3. extend the knee 10 degrees beyond neutral 4. touch the floor with palms without bending the knees.  Two connective tissue diseases (rare conditions but have some potential serious manifestations) need to be ruled out when general hypermobility exists: 1. Marfan Syndrome  2. Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome  For proper evaluation and to rule out the above two conditions, see your family physician.  Take care\n\n",

    "title": "Subchondral Cyst in left wrist",
    "content": "My husband is in the Army and recently had an MRI done on his left wrist and was refered to an orthopedic doctor but the doctor happened to be a Major and military affliliated doctors tend to leave you uninformed with little to no information and I was hoping to lear a little more before his next appointment.   His MRI results were:  There is a 2mm Subchondral cyst along the ulnar aspect of the proximal scaphoid pole. There is a 3cm mutliloculated synovial cyst located along the volar surface of the capitate carpal bone extends distally to the level of the third metacarpal base. Mild subcutaneous adema within the fat adjacent to the scaphoid carpal bone.  I have researched the different cysts on the internet and all the websites I went to were basically saying the subchondral cyst is linked to osteoarthritis, but when my husband asked the Major about it he brushed off the cysts didn't even talk about treatment he just gave him a dex steroid injection and told him it was going to hurt (My husband is 22, no prior injuries in that wrist). He also has tendonitus a few different types actually ( I don't know them). His symptoms are things like pain that increases with use, anti-inflamitories such as naproxen have no effect. His wrist swells with use there is a popping/creaking noise with every movement (different movements produce different noises both his wrist and thumb pop and creak) His pinky and ring finger all the way down to his wrist goes numb, his wrist gets warm to the touch. limited mobility and strength. Pain goes all the way to his shoulder and neck.  Also I read up on the Dex steriod injections and it says multiple injections can break the cartilige and from what I have read about osteoarthritis it basically does the same thing. I am wondering if the Major could have just made my husbands situation worse?  So I guess my question is this, does a subchondral always mean osteoarthritis?  Does his case sound like osteoarthritis? and if not what might it be?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Subchondral Cyst in left wrist",
    "content": "Hello, Not all the research has supported the development of osteoarthritis (OA) from the finding of subchondral cysts.  However, if subchondral cysts do in fact preclude OA, all the more reason to care for the affected area properly - maintain painfree range of motion and strength, use proper analgesia during painful flare ups and protect the joint from trauma and deformity.  Sometimes bracing is needed.  Also, some vitamin C may be in order as some studies have shown this helps in preventing regional pain syndrome (aka reflex sympathic dystrophy) which develops in the limb after trauma or surgery.  A problem with the scaphoid should not cause symptoms in the pinky or ring finger - so the neck and elbow ought to be checked for pinched nerve signs (these fingers are in general innervated by the ulnar nerve and lower levels of the cervical spinal nerve roots.   Otherwise he may benefit from some physical therapy to the wrist and hand to regain function.    Take care.\n\n",

    "title": "Do subchondral cysts always mean you have OA?",
    "content": "In May 2008 I was throwing a huge trash bag into a dumpster behind where I worked. As I went to toss it in my right shoulder popped really loudly. By the time the District Manager came in my two middle fingers were drawn down into my palm and I couldn't straighten them out. My wrist was swollen to the size of my elbow and my shoulder was in extreme pain. I have had pain for years and have learned to work thru it, so anything that leaves me in tears is REALLY hurting.  The doctor prescribed pain meds, a splint and total rest until the Worker's Comp claim was approved. It took 11 weeks before they finally sent me to an Ortho specialist.  The Ortho gave me an X-ray which showed clear. The strength tests showed that I could not lift with my right arm due to pain in the shoulder and wrist. The middle and first finger of the right hand were numb and tingling.   Nerve tests came back 'normal'. MRI supposedly came back 'normal' or clear. I was then given a shot in the wrist which helped some. Had CT release surgery in July 2009.  I have had trouble ever since. The fingers are still numb and tingle. The wrist and just above it ache when I clap or if I have to drive a car in a wind from the driver's side. The pressure of trying to hold the steering wheel steady puts pressure on my right hand which causes it to ache for a day or two afterward.  I can't even carry a tiny 12\" x 12\" bag that doesn't even weight 3 lbs in my right hand. When I do the weight causes the hand to go numb and I have pain in the shoulder as if someone is trying to tear my arm off my body.  My attorney has been negotiating with the insurance company for two years now. I was sent in April for an IME with another Ortho. The report I received last week said that the MRI was not clear. It showed the presence of subchondral cysts in my right shoulder.  I had never heard of this type of cyst so I went online to see what I could find out. I too, read the information as basically stating that this type of cyst never shows up unless the person has either Rheumatoid or Osteoarthritis. I too, would like to know if this is correct or can the cysts actually show up by themselves just due to the injury received?  I was fired from my job for \"medical  reasons\" shortly after the Worker's Comp doctors released me. Medicaid said that I would have to be put on Disability and I have waited 7 months to see if they are going to approve it or not.   I would like to know for sure whether or not the presence of these cysts mean that I do in fact, have OA? I have been told that I have a predisposition to OA due to the fact that I had Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever as a child. I have also been told that if this is, in fact OA, then the disability claim would be automatically approved. So I really need to know whether or not the cysts are indicitive of OA.  Since all of this happened, I have also had problems with my left knee swelling and being extremely painful after I stand for more than a few minutes at a time on it. My left hip has also had periods for several years where it will suddenly 'lock' on me. I can't swing my left leg to take a step and I can't move sideways to even get into a car or sit in a chair. It has gotten worse since this accident at work.   When it locks up on me it will last for up to 10 minutes. However, even after it 'unlocks', my hip will feel as if the femure is out of socket and I don't feel secure taking a step. It gives the feeling that if I put my weight on it, it will give way and I will fall. That lasts for up to 90 minutes before some normalacy returns.  Some days are essentially pain free and I can do almost all of the things I used to. Other days it is all I can do to get out of bed. On those days I feel like the Tin Man on the Wizard Of OZ. It is as if my joints are 'frozen' and I need to have them oiled up so they will work correctly.  So I need to know: does the presence of these subchondral cysts mean definitively that I have OA or could they just show up by themselves due to the injury received at work? With the other things going on in my hip and knee, I have a tendency to think I do have OA. What do you think?  Thanks much for taking the time to answer so we can stop wondering.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Several studies have shown a relationship between the development of osteoarthritis (OA) (OA is characterized by cartilage damage, osteophytes - bone spurs, and subchondral sclerosis - thickening) and bone activity in the subchondral area (below the cartilage).    There are mixed reports however regarding the prediction or diagnosis of OA in the presence of subchondral cyst without other evidence of OA signs or symptoms.  In essence, without other signs or symptoms of OA, subchondral cysts may or may not predispose to OA.  The evidence seems equivocal.  Damage to the rotator cuff ought to be considered with subchondral cysts - there are on occasion associations between the two.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "I have a bone missing in each foot and from what I gather, there is a strip of cartilage in it's place.  I have extremely flat feet and have had issues with them my whole life.  On occasion, one of my feet will pop when I am walking and shortly it will swell and become difficult or impossible to walk on.    Last Wednesday when I woke up, I found my left foot ached and was swollen, even though I'd felt fine the night before.  I stopped by the grocery store for a few things and when I got home I felt fine, but my foot started to swell worse that evening.  The next morning, it was extrememly painful to walk on so I kept it propped up all day.  Friday I couldn't put any weight on it at all, so I laid around all day and tried taking some ibuprofin to help with the inflamation.  Saturday it stayed the same, even though I'd avoided using the foot all day that day as well.  Sunday, the swelling was still there, but the pain began to slowly subside.  Today both feet are swollen, but the left foot only aches a little.  I am still trying to stay off of it, so as to not aggrivate the situation.  If I recall correctly, the missing bone is from the center of the ball of my feet.  Is this a common deformity and is there something I could do to make walking less painful?  I'd also like to find a way to reduce my risk for injuries with my feet.    I should mention my younger brother by 10 years, also has a bone missing in his feet.  Thank you, klaarg\n\n",

Surgical correction is generally the option of last resort...but the foot structure and function should be evaluated to determine the treatment options. In the meantime, rest and NSAIDs with gradual return to normal activities seems right.  Take care.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Deformed Left Rib",
    "content": "Hi, Chest wall deformities are mostly  - congenital but  - may be acquired due to trauma(accidental/surgical).  They spectrum of clinical presentations is very wide ranging from a localized simple bulge or a depresion to the extremely severe forms such as the thoracic insufficiency syndrome (TIS).  Thoracic Insufficiency Syndrome (TIS) has been defined by as the inability of the thorax to support normal respiration or lung growth, resulting in respiratory insufficiency.  There are 3 types of the more common congenital chest wall deformities seen in clincal practice;  - pectus excavatum,  - pectus carinatum and  - Poland\u2019s syndrome.   Poland syndrome is a rare birth defect and appears with lateral depression of the ribs most commonly on the right side (75% of patients).The incidence of Poland syndrome is approximately 1 case per 32,000 live births, and  is almost always sporadic or nonfamilial.   It is also called as Poland\u2019s anomaly or Poland\u2019s syndactyly. When the defect occurs on the left side,there are chances of the heart and lungs being vulnerable because they are covered only by a thin layer of skin and tissue.  Poland syndrome is associated with congenital absence or incomplete development of the pectoralis minor muscles and the costal cartilages in relation to this muscle. Hypoplasia of the breast /subcutaneous tissue(on the involved side), lack of axillary hair and hand and upper extremity defects may also be associated.  It is probable that the deformity as seen in the attached photograph may happen to be a feature of underlying poland syndrome.  Surgical treatment for Poland syndrome: Minor defects may not need surgical correction other than for cosmetic reasons.More severe forms may need surgical correction(especially the left sided forms). Reconstruction of the chest wall with autologous rib graft has remained a standard 'open' surgical procedure in most situations. Endoscopically assisted reconstruction has been reported. Tissue expansion with tissue expanders followed by a second-stage endoscopic latissimus dorsi harvest and reconstruction has been reported.  I hope that the deformity in your case is completely asymptomatic. If this is the case, you may choose to leave it alone. It is advisable however, to exclude poland's syndrome by consulting your regular doctor. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi all,  I do not know the issue with my knee so im asking for advice/ help. I am 19 years old and always been involved in sports till i moven into college but i was still weight lifting and doing some kind of cardio exercise routinely. However, two weeks ago after a two hour basketball session, my knee locked on me and i was having trouble straightning my leg in the morning and i had a sharp pain in the knee (between the bone of the leg and the joint). I rested for 2-3 days and then started swimming and playing basketball again but my knee was still injured and not recoverd. So, i went into the doctors office in my community college and asked for help. The doctor told me i had swelling below the meniscus in my right knee where the ligaments are and that i need to rest and follow R.I.C.E. I have been doing that and my knee is better but it still has a little pain. The doctor could not explain the other problem that i had which was the cracking noise of the knee ...she told me to consult a orthopedist if problem persists or gets serious.   Since last spring around my tennis season in high school i was experiencing a cracking noise in my knee and ankle for both my legs. This problems persisted during the spring of 09 but it was off and on and i thought it was nothing serious. But, this cracking noise that occurs in my knees and ankle came back this spring and has been again on and off till the present date. It has worsen since this injury that occurred during basketball two weeks ago but i think its because of the lack of movement (exercise) that i have missed in the past ten days and all the icing that i have done with compression (ace bandage). I think i might have osteochondrosis but i really don't know hoe to fix this problem and on top of that i am worried about gaining weught because i was looking forward to the summer to lose weight...  Any kind of advice would help and im not consulting a orthopedic because i have insurance issues and i am covered during my school year in the university im enrolled in (which will be during the fall).   Thanks for any/all the help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, If your school has a physical therapy department, be a subject for one of their teaching labs to have them evaluate the knee.  In the clinic, the ligaments, meniscus, muscles and tendons can be assessed.  Proper exercises can be given too.  If the problem persists, an MRI may be indicated.  MRI would define any structural damage in and around the knee and testing would either precede or coincide with a scheduled visit to the orthopedist.   The crunching often comes from the patellofemoral joint.  Rehab involves specific set of exercises (stretching and strengthening) and avoidance of painful activities. Other noises around the joint can be normal tendon gliding over bone but should be checked as structural instability or muscle imbalances can also cause it.   Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "I am having pain in both my knees starting from a couple of months ago - primarily in my right knee, but my left knee also sometimes hurts in the same way.  The pain seems to be closely related to keeping the knee bent for a period of time. For instance, I used to often sit cross-legged, but I cannot do so any more, as sitting that way for even a short time leads to severe knee pain. I also get severe pain during/after driving, especially in our mini-van, in which I am not able to move the seat far enough away to allow me to extend my leg. 2 or 3 hours driving can leave me in pain for 2 or 3 days.  I can also get pain if I extend the knee for too long a time - either extreme gives me pain, while it is comfortable when it is mostly extended but slightly bent. In addition, I sometimes get pain in my hip as well when the knee pain is severe.  In addition, I also get pain if I carry a heavy object while walking, or if I carry my son for a while or carry him up the stairs. I also get pain when pushing something heavy, or mowing the lawn, for example.  I went to the doctor when the pain first started, and had x-rays taken, which showed no arthritis or bone problems in the knee area, although I do have bone spurs in my ankle.  I am not sure of the best option now - I don't think massage will help, as it doesn't seem to be a muscle issue, and same with a chiropracter, as it doesn't seem to be a bone issue. I guess it is probably related to ligaments?  Any ideas or suggestions would be much appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I like the way you are thinking about this knee pain...ruling out possible causes (bone, muscle, ligament). Particularly in the spine, it is hard to determine the exact structure causing the pain...with the knee however, it is easier (bone vs muscle vs tendon vs ligament vs cartilage vs meniscus or a combination of structures).  After a couple of months of pain with negative x-rays, I might suggest two actions in order. 1. Conservative treatment: NSAIDS and physical therapy (therapeutic exercise, manual treatments, hot/cold modalities).  Both can be prescribed/recommended by your family physician.  2. If no progress or if a complete clinical evaluation shows likely structural damage, do an MRI...and proceed with appropriate care.  All the best to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Ace bandage for patella alta?",
    "content": "Hi,  Patella alta: is an abnormally high-riding patella and is associated with a long patella tendon.This can be, in exceptionally rare cases congenital but, most cases will be aquired.   In a healthy knee, the height of the patella is roughly equal in length to the patella tendon. In patella alta, the ratio of the tendon length to the patella body length is increased, placing the patella in an elevated position that greatly increases the risk for dislocation of the patella.  There are many kinds of orthoses available for patellofemoral dysfunctions.  Elasto-crepe bandages are indicated in situations wherein one aims to reduce pain and swelling (inflammatory conditions or acute trauma). It may not be much of a help in patella alta, as it may not assist in optimizing patellar tracking. No harm may ensue however, by using this(go in for latex-free versions, to be safer).  A plethora of Knee Supports are available in the market. They come in various designs. Generally in a Closed Patella version and an Open Patella version.The patellar opening is claimed enhance comfort and freedom of movement. Patella tracking support is also a feature in some of them. These may be a better choice for you, rather than the elasto-crepe bandages.  It will be best for you to consult a physiotherapist, who will be able to offer you an individualized plan of therapy. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: 2 poping sound at my knee.. wondering what happen",
    "content": "Hi, Thank you for this thought-provoking post.  The \"pop\", sounds very much like either an ACL tear,or a tear of the patellar tendon (ligamentum patellae).   Most often ACL tears occur when considerable amount of momentum and violent forces are involved. Some of the mechanisms involved are,  - One-step-stop landing with the knee hyperextended:  a situation such as, when a baseball player slides into a base with the knee hyperextended.  - Planting and cutting: here, the foot is planted firmly on the ground followed by a twisting movement of the thigh and trunk. This in effect, causes the femur to twist over a stationary tibia. - straight knee landing:  - Pivoting and sudden deceleration: a situation such as, when a soccer player who is running very fast, slows down suddenly, followed by a quick turn in direction.  During a one-leg hop, some of the forces enumerated above may be active, but not necessarily of the magnitude needed to tear the ACL.    But you did hear a 'pop' and that is what usually happens during most ACL injuries.  The question is, how such seemingly innocuous activity such as a one-leg hop could have lead to an ACL injury?  There is some concern that females may be more prone to ACL injuries.The reason for this is unclear, but some sports medicine experts feel it is primarily due to certain anatomical differences between the sexes.  The intercondylar notch:  a depressed area at the lower end of the femur through which the ACL passes - tends to be smaller in females than in males.The walls of this notch may impinge on the ACL during some of the movements discussed earlier and cause fraying. Any fraying of the ACL would tend to be more serious in females, since the female ACL is a relatively thinner structure.    Bony pelvis: the wider female pelvis tends to exaggerate the angle made at the knee between the femur and tibia (normal adult tibiofemoral angle of 7deg in males and 8 deg in females).when the foot is planted on the ground, thus placing excessive stress on the ACL.   Lax ACL: there is a theory that the ACL is more lax in females than males - and therefore more prone to overstretching. There is evidence that  both estrogen and progesterone receptors exist on the ACL and the theory suggests that increases in one or both of these hormones may slacken the ACL.  Muscle  strength: inherently lower muscle power in  the thigh and leg muscles(especially the hamstrings which prevent hyperextension of the knee) and slower muscle-reaction times compared to males, tend to increase the risk of ACL trauma in females.  The other possibility is a quadriceps tendon or patellar tendon rupture. Typically occurs in middle-aged (30-60 year old) individuals,and part-time athletes (weekend warriors).Landing on a slightly flexed knee is the usual mechanism. Patients usually know that something wrong has happened, but they are often unsure of what happened. A \"pop\" is fairly common. Some patients may be able to walk following the injury, but many may not.There are many causes. Underlying pathology is believed to be repeated 'microtraumas' to the patellar tendon leading to degenerative changes. Several conditions are known to be associated with patellar tendon tears including, - systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE),  - long term systemic corticosteroid therapy & local steroid injections,  - chronic renal failure, - adverse effects of certain medications (ex; ciprofloxacin)  Only after a detailed examination by an orthopedic surgeon, will it be possible to diagnose your injury. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Chrissy, Limbs can be grown longer by a process called distraction histogenesis or the Ilizarov method, which is named for the pioneering work done in the early '60s by the Russian physician. There are three phases to the treatment. First, through a small incision, the bone is cut so it can be lengthened. It is done very carefully so the periosteum, or bone covering, is preserved, since it plays a major role in forming new bone. The surgeon then places a device, known as an external fixator, around the leg. It is comprised of lightweight carbon rings or a carbon bar that is attached to the bone, through the leg, by wires and/or screws. The wires are placed under a predetermined amount of tension. The fixator will be used to slowly pull the bone apart.   About five to 10 days after surgery, the second phase, known as distraction, begins. Each day the patient or a family member turns a small wheel on the fixator a total of 1 millimeter. It is usually done in four installments, once at each meal and again at bedtime. The turn results in a space forming between the two ends of the bone. New bone forms within the space. It takes about one month to gain a centimeter of length.   When the desired length or angle of the bone is achieved, the consolidation phase begins. During this time, which is usually twice that of the lengthening time, the new bone and tissue become solid. The fixator is then removed under general anesthesia, and the patient is fitted with a temporary cast or brace. This is to ensure that the new bone does not get broken. Ongoing physical therapy to maintain joint mobility is essential, as is follow-up care. If a patient is negligent about his after-care, temporary or even permanent loss of function may result.  Its a long and very tedious process, but rewarding if the case warrants it. This method has been used with dwarfism to give them extra height.  Regards,\n\n",

    "title": "human growth hormone",
    "content": "Human growth hormone is the principal hormone responsible for our body growth and maturation during our development from childhood to adulthood. Our height is attributed to growth of our skeletal bones. Each of the 'long bones' as they are called has an area called an epiphysis which represents a loose junction near its ends that allows further bone formation under the effects of growth hormone. However, once the bone epiphyses unite at adulthood no amount of growth hormone can make the bones longer. Length of bone in this cases can be grown using surgical techniques.  These injectable hormones, naturally produced in the pituitary gland, are designed for those with a growth hormone deficiency, or those whose growth has been thwarted as long as their epiphyses has not been united.  Athletes use growth hormone to build muscle mass and bone mass (stronger bones - not longer) , this usually comes at a price. There are complications to the use of growth hormone that include glucose intolerance, carpal tunel syndrome, gross hormonal imbalance.  Cheaper alternatives are on the market. Oral tablets, nasal and rectal sprays, and other products currently on the market claim to stimulate growth hormone production. A person soon builds up tolerance to these compounds so that they do no good. Improvements may one day make these so-called \"secretagogues\" a viable alternative to injectable growth hormone # but that their safety still needs to be proven.  Hence it should be known that the use of these supplements is not FDA approved at this moment as far as I know.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  Thank you in advance for taking the time to review.   I am a 25 year old male in great shape with no prior physical health concerns. On June 6th, I ran a half marathon in 1hr 22 min. (6:18 pace) with minimal prior training.  I am now experiencing discomfort in both knees (primarily left knee) with the feeling of fluid draining internally below the patella.  It also feels that my knees may give out when excess weight is applied (i.e. walking up stairs, bending forward).  There is no swelling, or major pain - just uneasiness and unnatural knee bending movement.  The uneasiness is directly over the patella.  I have full range of motion while seated with no pain.  However, when my knee changes degree of flexion, that's when I feel fluid drainage.    These issues surfaced one week ago and have been persistent for the past 5 days.    I would certainly appreciate any insight or advice you may have on moving forward.    THANKS SO MUCH,  J\n\n",

    "title": "Round the clock Knee pain and Whenever it wants instability",
    "content": "In 2002 I landed hard on my right knee during a football game resulting in instability.  I call it popped out, but I am sure it is not the right term.  After that I had seen 3 different doctors and they all told me to go home and ice it and it would be fine, and then it would pop back out again. In 2007 I found a doctor  that finally took some action.  Unfortunately I can't remember the medical name for the surgery but he said that he basically was going in and shrink wrapping tissue to hold me knee together better, and petellular realignment.   About 5 months after the surgery it happened again, and when I saw my surgeon again he said it might sometimes happen.  I do everything to keep it strenghthened and it still happens.  I find it very serious because I can lose my job from missing work, but if my knee is out then I can't work.   I went to see another surgeon for a second opinion and he explained to me that a surgery cutting a tendon and screwing in place could be an option in fixing the popping out problem. When i went back to my normal surgeon he said that there was nothing surgically he could do and that it was tendonititis.  I have that and brusitis in my shoulder and I know the difference.  My shoulder also doesn't pop out like my knee. I tried to go with the other surgeon since I felt he was trying to help me more but he won't except me as a patient.  I need help.  I am 18, and I already feel like giving up on it, and I have a whole life ahead of me.  Could you explain my options or give me some potentional diagnosises.   I am now moderately obese, but can tell you that weight is not causing instability because I was not obese when these symptoms started occuring.  I can't exercise as I used to because of this problem. Any thoughts, locations to visit, or diagnoses would be more than greatly appreciated. Thank You\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It sounds like the patella (kneecap) is dislocating (popping out).  The surgery sounds like a lateral release - easing the tension of the tendons on the outside part of the knee. The goal is to reduce the incidents of dislocations.   You have had surgery and now is the time to rehab the knee. I would recommend a physical therapist who has dedicated considerable time working with patients with the diagnosis: patella femoral syndrome or chronic patella dislocation. Whether you have another surgery, rehab is still needed.  And yes, you can exercise - e.g. swimming.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, It is not possible based on the information provided, to guess the diagnosis.   But, there are a few conditions that may explain such features that you have described, - congenital hemihypertrophy and - congenital hemiatrophy.  As the names imply, one half of the body is either overdeveloped (hypertrophy) or underdeveloped (atrophy).  Both are very rare. But in the medical literature, more cases of congenital hemihypertrophy have been reported than the  congenital hemiatrophy.  Hemiatrophy is known to be associated with - Ollier's disease(chondrodysplasia) and - scleroderma.  A disorder of the sympathetic nervous system during fetal development is suspected to be a major underlying cause of congenital hemiatrophy.The sympathetic nervous system is thought to play a trophic role in the development of all body tissues.A disorder of this is thought to lead to loss of sympathetic trophic control over growth.  Hemihypertrophy has been seen to be associated with - medullary sponge kidney, - wilm's tumors, - recurrent hypoglycemia during infancy,  - a predisposition to the development of tumors affecting embryonic tissue, and - malignant tumors of liver and adrenals.   Hemihypertrophy can also be a feature of a group of conditions known as the \"overgrowth syndromes\". - Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome, - Proteus syndrome,and - Macrocephaly-cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita.  As you can well see, there are very many conditions to be considered in coming to a final diagnosis. As this is such a rare feature, most clinicians will be more than glad to evaluate you. Good luck!\n\n",

When I show him my foot pointed and ask him to do the same he curls his toes, if I try to gently move it into a point he acts like it hurts.

    "content": "Hello, The surgery and casting have corrected the abnormal club foot position (excessive ankle plantarflexion and inversion). The position you are trying stretch him into is called plantarflexion.  This position was a part of the club foot and thus corrected.   I would not aggressively stretch back into this position as you will cause pain and may undo some of the surgery. Gentle mobility is fine but do not push it.  The correction has likely caused a contracture or stiffening of the ankles so do range of motion but again...not too aggressive.  Consult the podiatrist or orthopedic doctor for their instructions as well.  Take care.\n\n",

Make sure you are staying hydrated and eating balanced meals to prevent general leg cramping.  Also some stretching of the leg muscles before bed will help too. You should also check in with your family physician to rule out other causes of leg cramps or pain at night - e.g. circulation problems or anemia.  Take care.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Hyalgan injections",
    "content": "Hi, Osteoarthritis(OA) is a degenerative disorder that results from the biochemical breakdown of articular cartilage (Hyaline cartilage) in the synovial joints. Most workers believe that degenerative changes primarily begin in the articular cartilage.  In health, there is an interplay between the articular cartilage, sub-chondral bone and synovial fluid which maintains the health of the components of the synovial articulations for smooth movements and painless weight bearing.  Traditionally, management of osteoarthritis has centered around management of pain, which is the overriding concern for both the patients & clinicians.  Hyaluronates have taken management of osteoarthritis a step further, using an entirely different approach to address the problem.    This approach involves the injection of gel-like substances (hyaluronates) into a joint to supplement the viscous properties of synovial fluid. Sodium hyaluronate is similar to the synovial fluid that surrounds the synovial joints. Synovial fluid acts as a lubricant as well as a shock absorber. It ha s been speculated that the quantity & quality of hyaluronate in the joint fluid may be deficient in those with OA.   'Sodium hyaluronate' is extracted from rooster combs. Hyaluronic acid is a natural complex sugar of the glycosaminoglycan family. It is available as a sterile,viscous solution consisting of a high molecular weight (500,000\u2013730,000 daltons) fraction of purified natural sodium hyaluronate  in buffered physiological saline, with a pH of 6.8-7.5. It was  approved by FDA in August 1997.Indicated for the treatment of pain in OA of the knee in patients who have failed to respond adequately to conservative non-pharmacologic therapy, and to simple analgesics such as acetaminophen.  Sodium hyaluronate is given as an injection into the knee. This medicine is usually given as one injection per week for a total of 3 weeks (occasionally 5 weeks).Greater clinical benefit has been seen when used earlier in the disease process. Can be administered before, during or after therapy with NSAIDS/acetaminophen.  Contraindications: - Infections of knee joint (present & past) or infection of the skin around the knee. - past history of allergy to sodium hyaluronate. - pregnancy and lactation.  Caution: Before receiving sodium hyaluronate, one should tell their doctor if they have an allergy to eggs, birds, or bird products.  Adverse events: include - gastrointestinal complaints,  - local ecchymosis - headache,    - local joint pain and swelling,&  - local pruritus.  Apart from these relatively minor adverse effects, occasionally, more serious anaphylactoid/anaphylactic reactions may occur.  As it is a relatively recent form of therapy, studies are on-going. Early results appear to show significant benefit.Greater clinical benefit has been seen when used earlier in the disease.  Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "(OCD) / Cyst in Bone (R. Elbow)",
    "content": "(OCD) / Cyst in Bone (R. Elbow)  I just got back from the orthopedic in regards to my R. Elbow. For the last 3.5 years, it's been in near constant pain. Just recently, (Last december) I had orthoscopic surgery done to remove a half inch thick cyst from between my elbow joints and the tissues. All was well for about 3-4 months, felt much better and was tollerable, although the pain was still there.   Now here I am, just had another MRI, and the cyst did not come back this time. I was told I have Osteochondritis Dissecus? and a cyst in my Humerus elbow joint. My range of motion on the affected elbow is just under 90 degrees... which is horrible. Constant pain, not even 1600mg of ibuproffen helps.  I'm sick and tired of being in constant pain, im only 19 and was told I cannot be a police officer until I get my arm fixed (because my arm give out if i bend it doing push-ups).   I was told to take 1500mg of glucosamine for the next two months, then if it doesn't start to get better at all, he may have to drill about 5 holes through the bone into the marrow to let the marrow come through and try to heal the damage.  Can someone please help me? I'm looking for any alternative medicines i might be able to try, and whats the chance that drilling into my marrow is going to fix it?  I had fallen from my bike about 3.5 years ago, resulting in a radial head fracture, and my ortho says that the impact from the fall may have crushed the cartillage and some of the bone resulting in these problems im having now.  Thank you very much!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: (OCD) / Cyst in Bone (R. Elbow)",
    "content": "HI,  In the past, osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) of the elbow was called as \"Little Leaguer's elbow\" because it was so commonly seen in baseball pitchers between the ages of 12 and 20. Now it is known that other sports, primarily racket sports & gymnastics impose similar forces on the elbow. These sports can also lead to elbow OCD in adolescent athletes.  Pathogenesis:  The repeated forceful actions of these sports can strain the immature articular cartilage of the outer part of the elbow joint (capitellum of the radio-humeral joint). The bone under the cartilage (sub-chondral bone) weakens and becomes traumatized, which damages the blood vessels supplying this area of bone. Due to ischemia, this small section of bone dies. The weakened bone cracks & It may actually break off.  Symptomatology: In the early stages, Pain is the main presenting complaint, and restriction of extension is seen in almost all cases. Locking and clicking of the elbow may be seen in more advanced cases.  Management: Depends on the stage.For early stages plan is to rest the elbow until the symptoms regress. This may take up to a few weeks. Application of ice to the elbow periodically may help. NSAIDs may be needed for the pain.  For the more severe cases, some surgical option becomes necessary, such as -  Retroarticular drilling without bone grafting. -  Arthroscopy to remove loose bodies. -  Bone-peg grafting (graft taken from the proximal part of the ulna) to the prepared osteochondral defect. -  Autologous osteochondral mosaicplasty---obtaining small-sized cylindrical osteochondral grafts from the lateral periphery of the femoral condyle at the level of the patellofemoral joint and transplanting them to the prepared defects.  Unfortunately, I am not aware of any alternative medicines with proven benefit which may help you.Sorry, i can't help you there. Best wishes!\n\n",

He cannot find any over-the-counter medication that helps & he has had this issue for a few years, as I understand. He is 24 and cannot remember any previous injury. It is so painful for him, that he struggles to relax long enough to fall asleep every night. He shakes and moves his legs side-to-side to deal with the discomfort. It comes and goes every few minutes and lasts at least a minute or two. After an hour or so he finally is able to fall asleep, but I still notice occasional jerking of the bed throughout the night. No position change or pillow placement seems to help. What do you think the problem is? I'm hoping its not too serious and maybe if I tell him, he will accually go see a doctor.

    "title": "Re: Nocturnal Hamstring Cramps & Spasms",
    "content": "Hi, A lot of discussion goes on about muscle cramps in general, but,the actual cause remains elusive.Research has so far not been able to determine whether the cause lies in the brain or at the peripheral level (nerves/muscles).  Lack of water (dehydration), low levels of minerals such as potassium,magnesium, sodium and calcium as well as drugs such as diuretics- have long been linked to leg cramps. It may be associated with diabetes and certain other endocrinological conditions. A familial tendency is seen in some cases.  A muscle 'cramp' is one in which a muscle goes into contraction involuntarily and remains so for a while.During this time,the affected person feels excruciating pain.This situation may last for a few minutes at a time.Cramps commonly affect  - the calf muscles, - the muscles in the sole of the foot or - the hamstrings.  The description that you have given about your boy friend's illness does not sound like either typical muscle cramps or the 'restless legs' syndrome.I suggest that he consults a neurologist initially to sort out his symptoms. Good luck!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Genu Varum treatments",
    "content": "Hi,  Firstly one has to decide if indeed you have true bow legs.Some persons have what is known as 'apparent bow legs', wherein,  externally rotated hip joints & slightly flexed knees lead to an appearance of bowed legs.Simply by internally totating the hips and extending the knee joints, this appearance goes away.  In the new borns & infants, bow legs are commonly seen and are considered normal. This is attributed to the fetal position in utero.T hereafter, gradual straightening occurs and by the time the child starts to walk (18 months of age), the limb becomes straight(zero tibiofemoral angle).Between 2-3 years of age, gradual development of genu valgum occurs to the extent of 12 degrees.This knock knee situation corrects itself by age 7 to the adult tibiofemoral angle of 7deg in males and 8 deg in females.  Persistent genu varum in adolescents may be corrected by surgery (osteotomies/hemiepiphysiodesis).  Apart from cosmetic concerns, adults with uncorrected genu varum are at an increased risk of osteoarthritis as age progresses. Physical therapy & orthoses are unlikely to be benificial at this stage.Minimal genu varum may be perhaps observed. If person develops osteoarthritis of the knee(usually in the medial compartment) or severe pain in the luter aspect of the knee(ligamentous stretch),surgery may be the sole option.  In young adult patients, valgus producing high tibial osteotomy (HTO) is an effective surgical option for medial compartment osteoarthrosis with varus deformity . This could be - the conventional high tibial osteotomy techniques or  - an osteotomy at the distal border of the tibial tuberosity coupled with a gradual correction of the varus deformity using an Ilizarov external fixator. Good luck!\n\n",

    "title": "Fell on knees 6 mos ago, still having pain, Dr's unsure",
    "content": "Six months ago, my right leg got caught on a table leg at my work. My leg was wrenched sideways, and then I fell on my knees. I was unable to catch myself, so my knees recieved my full body weight. I immediately got a bruise on my tibia right underneath my patella. My knee became very swollen and it was uncomfortable to walk, sit , or stand. I went to the Dr. and he took X-rays. They did not find anything in the X-rays, but decided to start me in phsycial therapy. During physical therapy they focused on strengthing the muscles around  my knee. I continued my regular work duty which involves standing for 8 hours a day. After 12 weeks of physical therapy, I was still having pain, and my knee was still swelling. They decided to do an MRI. I then went to see an Orthopedic specialist. While reviewing the MRI, the doctor thought he saw a small fracture on the tibia near the iliotibial band insertion. He called the radiologist, and they both decided that it was just a blood vessel instead of a fracture. He did mentoin that the MRI quality was poor however. I was given 8 more weeks of physical therapy due to IT band tendonitis. It has now been 6 months since my injury. I am still doing physical therapy. I still have pain specifically where the IT band inserts into the tibia, and also patellar tendon pain(I am guessing from my fall). The Dr. has decided to complete another MRI. He says that tendonitis should have started to resolve itself by now, so he is worried that something else might be wrong.  I am very frustrated with the situation. It has been 6 months since my injury, and it seems that they still don't know what is wrong. Any ideas??? Additional info: No clicking or catching of the knee joint Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, It appears that due to persistence of your symptoms, a fairly rare injury known as \"The Segond fracture\" needs to be excluded. The Segond fracture is a small vertical avulsion injury of the lateral aspect of the proximal tibia just distal to the plateau (about 2-10mms distal).   It usually results from an excessive internal rotation and varus stress.  The iliotibial band is lies superficial to the lateral capsular ligament and is an extracapsular structure & inserts proximally on the epicondylar tubercle of the femur and distally on 'Gerdy tubercle' of the tibia.  Segond fracture is seen in 6-13% of patients with anterolateral rotational instability of the knee. Diagnosing a Segond fracture may not be straightforward as the fracture fragment may be tiny.   Segond fracture is best detected on the anteroposterior projection. In some cases, the frature may be seen only only on the tunnel projection.MRI offers additional help. The Segond fracture may be associated with injuries to other ligamentous structures and menisci.These must be carefully looked for. Best wishes!\n\n",

For about the past four weeks, my ankles have been hurting and swelling for no obvious reason.  By this I mean that I haven't injured them nor has anything in my life really changed recently.  I have a follow-up appt. with an ortho specialist tomorrow afternoon but I am so confused by my symptoms and I want to make sure I cover everything with my doc.  Hopefully there is someone else out there who has my same issues and can help put my mind at ease.    First, let me give you some background on me - I am 29 and work as a secretary.  I have had a \"desk job\" most of the time since graduation from high school and therefore have been pretty inactive most of my adult life.  I didn't play sports in high school (I was a band geek!) which probably helped me escape any major injury to any parts of my body.  I've never had any broken bones - - not even stitches!  Medications:  The only medications I am on are over-the-counter Naproxen for headaches and PMS as needed, 1 mg Xanax nightly, 37.5 mg Pentermine daily for weight loss and Desogen for birth control.  My new \"injury\" -  Around the beginning of May, I noticed that my ankles kind of hurt.  Anyone who wears heels all the time, has twisted an ankle at least once before in their lives.  It kind of reminded me of that but not too painful.  Just a little sore.  But I can't remember injuring my ankles in anyway.  About a week later I noticed slight swelling on the inside of my left ankle.  Although both ankles hurt, it was the left that hurt the most.  The right ankle didn't appear swollen but could have been just a little bit and I just couldn't tell because I was looking so hard.  A few days later, I noticed significant swelling in the left ankle (inside only) and it was starting to turn a little pink and it felt warm to the touch.  A week into this, my right ankle appeared obviously swollen but not as bad as the left.  Again, only the inside of the ankle.  The pain was getting worse and the swelling wouldn't stop so I started putting ice on them at night and elevating them.  No help.     Labs - After 2 weeks of swelling, I went to my primary care doc and he told me to ice the swelling, elevate them and take some Naproxen for the pain.  He also did the usual labwork.  He said everything came back normal and referred me to an ortho doc.  I got a copy of that labwork just the other day and everything was within normal ranges except two things under my white blood cell count.  But apparently, it wasn't abnormal enough to alert the doc.  Neutrophils were 40 (range 42-77) and Lymphocytes were 46 (range 16-43).    Tailbone - To make matters worse, my ankles hurt so bad one morning that I fell on my tailbone in the bathroom and I think I bruised it.  Now that hurts!!  My ankle pain is the worst in the mornings and starts to feel better throughout the day but still hurts all day to the point that I limp and have to walk slowly and carefully.  On the day I fell on my tailbone, I noticed more swelling in my feet by late afternoon.  Not only were my ankles swollen, but now the whole foot was swelling on both feet.  Everything except my toes.  So that evening, I got some Ace bandages and wrapped my ankles.  I can't sleep in them cuz they drive me crazy at night but I do wear them to work.  I still have to dress up for work so I've been wearing slacks and stuffing my fat feet into the only two pair of low heels I have that I can with Ace bandages on them.  Again, I sit most of the day so I can kick my shoes off.  However, it is rather difficult to elevate my feet while at work.  Ortho doc - I got in to see the ortho doc about a week later and his inital impression was some sort of arthritis of unknown origin.  He took x-rays and said they were normal.  He also ordered more labwork and I go back tomorrow.  He ordered RH factor, ANA test, C-reactive protien, Sed rate and uric acid level.  Now here is where I start getting paranoid.  It's been almost a month and my ankles still hurt and they are still swollen.  The Ace bandages seem to control it somewhat but I need to know why they are doing this and how to stop it, as I can't wear Ace bandages every day of my life!  Starting the morning after I went to the ortho doc (this past Friday), I woke up in severe pain - everywhere!  My left hip hurt, my left knee hurt, both my ankles hurt so bad and even my right elbow hurt!  I almost didn't get out of bed because it hurt so much to move.  Thank God that was my last day at work for the week.  This weekend has been pretty bad.  The pain has pretty bad in my hip, knee and ankles.  The pain in the elbows comes and goes as does other pains.  Like in my shoulder, wrist and thumb once.  Today was the first day that I haven't hurt like hell.  My ankles are still swollen and still hurt, though not as bad as they have all month long.  I've read about all the types of arthritis, lupus and fibromyalgia and I have some of the symptoms of each but they could all be because of other minor things too.  My mom has multiple sclerosis and I've read that some doctors think some of the auto immune things are hereditary.  The biggest symptom, other than joint pain, of all these auto immune things is fatigue which I don't really think I have.  Because I sit all day, I am always kind of sleepy but I don't really think that is fatigue.  On the weekends, I prefer to be a homebody most of the time, but I don't think that is fatigue either.  I think I am just lazy actually.  I haven't had any rashes as with lupus nor any increased hair loss.  I do get ulcers in my nose but I just thought they were cold sores since I get those on my lips all the time!  I keep telling myself that I am making too much out of this but I don't know how to explain why so many different parts of my body hurt all of the sudden.  Every morning I wake up wondering what is going to hurt today and how long is it going to last.  I can't wait to go to the doc tomorrow!  On one hand, I hope he finds something in my lab work so I'll have a definite answer, but on the other hand, I don't want anything to seriously be wrong with me.    Sorry this is so long but even if no one reads it or responds to it - - at least I feel better now for getting it off my chest!    Thanks in advance for anyone who takes the time to read this long sob story!!\n\n",

    "content": "Just thought I'd share my new lab results that the ortho specialist ordered: ANA - Negative Uric acid - I can't read the number on my copy but it's within normal limits RF - 25 CRP - 15.40 ESR - 29  My doctor wasn't available Friday when my lab results came in so I haven't talked to him yet to get his interpretation of them, but I can read... so according to the reference ranges, the only elevated levels were the CRP and the ESR.  The ESR was slightly elevated (should have been between 0 and 20) and the CRP is elevated.  I probably shouldn't have had the results faxed to me before I could talk to the doc but I was going crazy waiting.  Based on what I've read, I guess I have some sort of infection or immflamation in my body.  I bet the next step is going to be more tests to try to figure out what kind of infection or immflamation.    So I feel like this is good and bad news.  Good because I probably don't have lupus or rheumatoid arthritis but bad because who knows what kind of infection I could have!  My ortho doc will be in the office on Monday afternoon and I expect to hear from him then, but in the meantime, this waiting is DRIVING ME CRAZY!  And the joint stiffness isn't getting any better.  Actually, my ankles hurt MORE now than they did last week.  And the migrating joint pain elsewhere in my body is really getting annoying and more intense.  It's been one month now since this all startd, and I am really getting worried!  Any responses would be appreciated!\n\n",

    "title": "Hi jaki",
    "content": "Hi jaki!  I'm so sorry you are in pain.  I'm not sure how much help I can be of but I'll tell you my story.  I am a 29 yr old female and have been in relatively good health most of my life.  I wasn't very active in high school (i.e. sports) but I was in band.  After graduation, my activity level decreased A LOT!  I gained so much weight over the next ten years after graduation.  I was probably about 110 when I graduated from high school in 1994 and by 2004, I was 190!  I didn't have children to blame the weight gain on and I didn't think I ate a lot but something had to change.  It's hard to change your lifestyle when it's been the same for 10 years!  I never had any major health problems except for a cyst on my right ovary.  I had surgery to have my right ovary taken out just before my senior year of high school.  Other than that, I never had anything really wrong with me.  I don't exercise and since I never really have, it's kind of hard to make myself stick to an exercise routine.  I am a legal secretary and I work a lot - mostly sitting at my computer - so just thinking of exercise exhausts me!  When I hit 190 pounds, I decided to go to my primary care doctor and ask for diet pills.  I had some problems with depression and anxiety over the past 10 years, but nothing too serious.  I had been on anitdepressants but decided to get off of them hoping that would help stop some of the weight gain.  I was doing pretty good except my weight was out of control and that started depressing me again.  Mostly it was anxiety.  So when I went to my primary care doc for the diet pills, I decided to ask for Xanax again.  I had been on it previously and loved it!  I didn't abuse it or take it during the day all the time.  I only take it at night to help me sleep throughout the night.  My mind starts working overtime once it's time to go to sleep so the Xanax allows me to relax, stop thinking about things, and go to sleep.  My doc gave me Phenteramine for weight loss too.  I love it!  I'm down to 147 and my goal is 130.  I started the Phenteramine in Dec. 2004.  Well, that's my background.    As far as my family is concerned, my mom has multiple sclerosis and I have a second cousin or maybe third cousin or something like that that has MG.  I have one cousin with Downs and high blood pressure seems to run in my family.  I don't know my father or anyone on his side of the family so I don't know about their medical history.  Obesity seems to run in the family too!  Since MS and MG are auto immune disorders, I know I am sort of predisposed or something, but I've never had any problems to warrant going to the doctor for lots of tests - - until recently!  In March of 2005, I went for an eye exam and decided to switch to contacts.  In May 2005, while I was fully frustrated with getting used to contacts, I went for a follow up with my primary care doc.  Everything was going good with me, the weight was slowly coming off and I was feeling pretty good - with the exception of not being able to find any brand of contacts that were comfortable!  My eyes were always so dry with every brand I tried.  I never really noticed that I had dry eye before but now, in trying to wear contacts, my eyes were always dry.  Even on the days I didn't wear them!  Then, not two days after my doctor appointment, my ankles started bothering me.  They just felt a little achey.  About a week or so later, I notice that my left ankle seemed a little swollen.  Another week later, I noticed that it was started to turn a little red and sometimes kind of blue and purple, like a bruise.  Then my right ankle started swelling and they felt very warm.  After several weeks of this and taking 400 to 600 mg of Naproxen two to three times a day, I decided to go back to the doctor.  While he was mashing around on my ankles I sort of felt some muscle pain.  Kind of like a sore muscle and when he would hit just the right spot, it felt pretty good.  Like when you rub a sore muscle.  The joint pain was puzzling though.  It wasn't a distinct joint pain either.  It was hard to explain.  It felt sort of like I had sprained my ankles but I knew I hadn't.  Primary Doc ordered labwork but it all came back mostly normal.  He ordered a CBC, Chemistry and Thyroid tests.  The only abnormality was in my white blood cell count.  Lmyphocytes came back slightly elevated and Neutrophils came back slightly lowered.  Otherwise, everything was normal.    Primary Doc referred me to an orthopedic doctor.  Ortho Doc took x-rays and said they looked ok.  I didn't have any pain anywhere else except in my right elbow and I thought I had just slept on it funny the night before.  Ortho Doc didn't have a clue so he ordered more labwork.  He did a complete arthritis panel and tested for lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.  The very next day, I woke up with joint pain all over my body!  Hips, knees, ankles, elbows!  I was miserable for the next few weeks!  The pain would migrate.  One day it was my left hip, then the next it was my right knee.  Everyday a different combination of joints would hurt.  My ankles got so bad that I almost couldn't walk because they hurt so bad!  I had to keep them wrapped with Ace bandages all day just to make it through work.  My labs finally came back and my CRP was elevated and so was my Sed rate.  Rheumatoid factor came back normal and ANA screening was negative.  So infllamation of some sort was present but none of that gave him a real answer.  He prescribed me a one-week packet of steroids, Prednisolone I think, and I felt better in only three days!  It was great!  Steroids work wonders!  It was only a one-week prescription, thank God!  I only gained two pounds while on them so it wasn't too hard to drop it again!  Ortho decided that neither my diet, my other prescriptions, nor my lack of exercise had anything to do with my pain.  He said it was something systemic but he couldn't pinpoint it.  He told me to take Mobic (an anti-inflammatory) daily and see if that kept everything in check.  If not, he could refer me to a Rheumatologist for further workup.  I tried the Mobic but a few days later, my ankles started swelling again.  None of the other joint pain came back and my ankles didn't hurt near as bad but I was worried that they would.  Ortho Doc told me to switch back to Naproxen as anti-inflammatories tend to increase water retention and maybe I would do better with Naproxen.  Then again, it might not be water retention.  I switched back to Naproxen and it didn't really help but the swelling and pain didn't get worse do I just left it at that.  I took the Naproxen, about 400 mg twice daily, for the next several weeks.  Slowly but surely the swelling and discoloration started to go away.   As of now, my ankles hurt everyday but it is minor.  No more swelling or discoloration and no more joint pain anywhere else.  They really bother me if I am on my feet a lot.  I forgot to mention that when they first started hurting, before I went to the doctor, I tried elevation and ice but nothing helped.  Now, if I am on my feet too much, I just put them up when I get home, keep them warm and take some extra Naproxen and they are usually okay in a few days.  That's the other strange thing.  My feet are always cold.  They never really used to be but since I work in an office all day and sit at a desk all day and since I live in Texas and it's so hot all the time, I wear sandles A LOT!  So when I'm at my desk all day, my feet got cold.  But over the past year, I've noticed that I can't even get them warm at home.  I'll have socks on and be sitting on my feet and still they are freezing!  Unless I'm active and on my feet, they get soooooo cold soooooooo fast!  And the coldness seems to make them hurt more too.  My dry eye is what is bothering me the most now.  I went to an opthomologist and was able to get him to prescribe me Restasis.  My left eye tested somewhat dry so he said I could try the Restasis and see if it helps.  I was told that it usually takes a full 6 o 8 weeks before the Restasis really starts to work so I am still waiting for it to work.  I've been on it for about a month now and I can't wait for it to start working!  I'd really like to wear my contacts again!  That is if I can find a brand that won't dry my eyes out so bad!  Hopefully the Restasis will help that but I'm sure I'll have to find a good contact too.  Other than a very strange lack of sex drive, I don't think I have any other symptoms.  It's not normal for a 29 year old to have absolutely NO sex drive!  But that doctor's appointment is on August 30th and we'll deal with that when we get there.  I am thinking that I probably have some sort of autoimmune disorder but it is probably so borderline right now that it would be impossible to diagnose.  I could probably go to a rheumatologist and have more labwork done and possibly narrow it down to something, maybe, but until I have a \"flare-up\", I guess I'll just keep taking my Naproxen.  I probably don't want to know what's wrong with me anyways!  So, that's my story.  I know it's long but hopefully it's of some help to you.  Good luck and I wish you well!\n\n",

I would be ok during the games and practice, but I crashed extra hard afterward. My doc is testing me for Rheumatoid and Lupus. I do not have the results yet. I am just so tired of health problems. I have had daily headaches for 10 years, and only recently have a found a doctor, who has been able to pinpoint the problem. Throughout the last 5 years, doctors have found cysts in my brain, sinuses, eye, lip (thank God that was removed, I was looking like Bubba Gump! Haha!) Once I found a doctor who was able to diagnose and treat me, unfortunately because of Hurricane Katrina, I am unable to go there. Now, I have another unexplained \"canklitis\". At least that's what I am calling it since my ankles are an extension of my calves. We have to laugh at. Please let me know if you read this. Let me know if you have had diagnosis lately if any.

I am a lawyer and work both from home and in an office. I am also very active with sports. So, I was very shocked when my ankle swelled up for no reason. I had not twisted it or injured it playing sports, rather i woke up one morning and my right ankle was extremely swollen on the outside. There was pain when I tried to walk. It eventually went down but the same thing happened to me last night. And, this past weekend, I noticed that my hip joints are hurting. If I sit for more than 20 minutes at a time my hips are really stiff and hurt when I get up.  The bad thing for me is that I don't have insurance yet so I can't even go to the doctor for tests.  The ankle swelling seems to come and go but the hip pain seems like it is here to stay for a while.  Does anyone else have hip pain too? The only drugs I take is an occasional abuterol inhaler for sporadic asthma and Dexitrim for hunger curbing. Other than that I eat pretty healthy and exercise. I don't smoke and I rarely drink.  I'd love some advice or someone to share concerns and symptoms with. Thanks.\n\n",

    "title": "lump on ankle",
    "content": "I am 50 and fit. I got this large lump above my ankle in one day.  It is positioned about 8\" up, at 11:00 looking down at my right ankle.  It is 65mm x 35mm or about the size of an egg cut lengthwise.  I went to my family doctor.  He did not know what it was.  He sent me to an orthopedic surgeon.  He did not know what it was.  He checked it with a flashlight and said it was liquid.  He stuck it with a needle and said it was not a ganglion sis.  He could not get much out of it with the needle.  So he and the nurse \"milked\" it with their thumbs and were able to flatten it by 70%.  However, it returned to its original size soon after I got home.  I was able to ream the needle hole out and \"milk\" it myself.  I did this twice before going to bed.  It returned to size by morning and the needle hole healed shut.   Its been on me three weeks now.  Hardly any pain, <1.  Today is the fist day I noticed any pain... about a 1 unless I bump it ... then it really hurts for a short period.   No samples were taken by ether doctor.  I'm going back to the surgeon in a week.   Any thoughts or advice?    Thank you for your time. Ken\n\n",

    "content": "Iam a 30yr old female..i was shocked to come across this page because i had assumed my problem was unheard of..my symptoms are similar to most and exactly the same as sweetsugrbriches. Basically it was on may 31st, 2005 ( i was 25 yrs old then) when i felt pain in my right ankle my was also red hard and a throbbing, numbness feelinwg to it. I quickly consulted an orthopedic specialist as a matter of fact i went to two different one ( so i could have a second opinion) the orthopedist had me wear uno booth & the other big black boot for my foot for a few weeks which didn't help at all. He ordered i had x-ray, ct-scan, and finally MRI but no fractures were present just an unexplained fluid build up on my right ankle he then referred me to a rheumatologist..i was tested for lupus, rheumathoid arthritis & a few other things but all was ruled out the rheumatologist stated that if it was a rheumathoid arthritis issue then the pain would be symmetrical my situation was unique i had pain & swelling in my right ankle only and it only worsens throughout the day when im walking too much or sitting for longer periods..but not bad in the mornings so he then referred me to a lymphedema clinic they did a lymphosynthigraphy test where they (inserted a clear dye in both my foot & view my lymphatic system via gamma rays) that also came back with no results there was no circulation problem they had me work with a PT which showed me how to minimize swelling by using bandages, wraps, compression socks etc. i admitt this helps only to minimize swelling but doesn't cure it. They ruled out lymphedema and told me basically there was nothing else to be done i had come to the end of the road so disheartened and upset i stopped being active. oh i forgot to mention i was eating healthy, working out didn't injure myself besides sprain from heels or fall which healed a year before even my symptoms started. I stopped working out because my foot and ankle swoll up more when i walked/ran on treadmill, when i went to the mall with my girls after walking 30 mins i had to stop and sit for a while becaue i couldn't walk any further ...i've also had the cortison shot injected on my ankle area twice which helped with alleviating pain and swelling for a few days but then it returns...i decided after taking some time off on investigating this issue since i had given up to consult another rhumathoid specialist i just felt i was young and symptoms weren't really precise and presenting themselves for a proper diagnose but it seemed that might be it...anyway this doctor looked at my profile and decided to have me do a bone scan test i don't remember why but that also came back fine...he also had another round of extensive blood work done on me nothing at all..then he referred me to a vein specialist...he said basically there is nothing at this point if i have had the swelling this long it is hear to stay no cure to just start working out and eathing healthy etc. which by the way i was never overweight just wasn't working out like i used to ...so i really decided to come to terms with it.. i love heels so much i gave them up until last year i decided i will wear them again but always have a flat shoe as a back up...i suffered last year as a bridesmaid heels all day i had no choice my feet swell up i had so much pain could barely stand & ended up with lots of blister but right now im at a point where i've to terms with it aslong as it doesn't turn to something else/worse..i elevate it when i have a chance which always helps reduce swelling... i hate the compression sock but i use them sometimes...recently i also decided to test for lyme disease just incase but that was negative as well the only thing is my vitamin d came back at level 10 which is supposed to be very low so my primary doc has me on 50,000 iu once a week taking it with calcium im supposed to go in 6mons for a follow up...she has suggested taking aspirin 3times a week and working out more to build leg muscles so there is more circulation going on there bcuz the doplar test showed a slight lower amount of vessels or ciruclation i believe is what she said...Also i had a reunion with my cousins last year i hadn't seen them in ages and my female cousin has the same issue as me so we we're starting to think could it be genetics related? But then again after looking at this site i see so many women around my age range with this issue oh and my type of employment was customer service ( 10 years) im not working currently though just in school. One last thing i also HAVE A VERY LOW SEX DRIVE which is strange for my age? i wonder if its all related...i blamed it on depression because iam prone to that..i also realize this is a very old forum but one that fits my criteria so if anyone still checks back and wants to update me on their story i'd appreciate...sorry for the detailed long story but had to get it out..thanks for reading\n\n",

Numbness is a risk, and is the development of a neuroma, which is a painful lump at the site of procedure.  The pain can come back.  The thing to remember of course, it does not necessarily eliminate the cause of the pain, just the symptom of pain.

    "title": "Congenital Radial Head Dislocation",
    "content": "Looking for some feedback about my condition.  Both my elbows are pretty messed up and hurt most of every day. The symptoms I have are los of ROM in both elbows. My right I think is about a loss of 15 degrees in straightening out, as well as loss when contracting. The left elbow is not quite as bad, the Dr. told me it was about 5 degrees lost. But that was last year, and I can tell it's gotten worse.  I had a scope surgery on my right elbow about 6 or 7 years back to clean out floating pieces as well as relieve pain. It did work a bit, no re-gaining of ROM, but pain was relieved some. It wasn't long once I resumed my activities that my elbow started to hurt again.  Fast forward to early last year, April when I decide to have another surgery on my right elbow. This time the surgeon was going to attempt to regain ROM as well as relief from pain. Not sure what the surgery was called, but he said something about releasing \"capsule\" pressure or something like that. The surgery was much more extreme than my last one that I was back and up to normal activities within a few days.  This time I was to keep an arm brace on all day every day and night for over a month, as well as use an otto-bock machine that I sat in about 6 hours a day to regain ROM. I was also attending therapy twice a week for 2 months.  Therapy and progress went well from what I was told, regained some ROM within a month and it pretty much stopped progressing. Pain was more sore after that, not overall too bad.  After the second month I finished therapy as well as received the go-ahead to resume my activities. I let my Dr. know that I wanted to lift weights again and play basketball, which he seemed ok with. I was also told I could order an Otto bock static immobilzer (Not sure if this is the right name) to aid in regaining more ROM.  This is where it pretty much starts my issues into today.  I began using the immobilizer as instructed, resumed playing basketball and lifting weights. At first I wasn't really in all that much pain playing basketball or lifting weights, but then I remember pains starting up in both elbows that wasn't going away.  I wasn't sure then or now if this pain is just normal due to the surgery or to my server arthritis. Every day my elbows, both of them, just ach all day as if the bones are just grinding against each other.  It's been about 7-8 months since my surgery, and the pain doesn't seem to be going always like I expected it to. My ROM is slightly better than before the surgery, but I don't know if it is getting worse again either.  Due to my condition as well as from what I was told by my Dr. very bad arthritis am I just causing my issue to be worse by lifting weights? Or does it not matter really, and I just have to live with this.  I'm 35 now.  And yes I've been doing as much as I can think of to relieve/reduce pain and swelling. Heating pads, ice packs, resting ibuprofin, Glucosomin and Chondroitin..  I'm just at my wit's end on what to do and if I should just give up again doing anything remotely physical in my life.  Any thoughts or opinions are greatly appreciated.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Congenital Radial Head Dislocation",
    "content": "Hi, You have not given any details about the radial dysplasia that you seem to have.  Osteoarthritis usually affects the weight-bearing joints(ex, the hip and knee). The elbow is one of the least affected joints due to osteoarthritis on account of its well matched joint surfaces and strong stabilizing ligaments. As a result, the elbow joint can tolerate large forces across it without becoming unstable.  Elbow osteoarthritis could be - primary (idiopathic - can not be attributed to some specific     circumstance) or - secondary (cause is known).  Symptomatic 'primary' OA of the elbow particularly affects middle aged men (but some patients can have symptoms earlier), especially those who engage in strenuous manual activity. Commonly associated with metacarpophalangeal OA ('Missouri metacarpal syndrome'), and has a favourable outcome.  Primary osteoarthritis of the elbow is characterized by painful stiffness, mechanical symptoms(restriction of joint movements), and the presence of hypertrophic osteophytes. Preservation of the joint space is common and may account for the good results that are usually achieved with nonoperative treatment and nonprosthetic arthroplasty.  Arthroscopic or open  capsular release and removal of impinging osteophytes are the primary surgical modality in the management (osteocapsular arthroplasty, d\u00e9bridement arthroplasty).    The major changes are hypertrophic osteophyte (bone spur) formation and capsular contracture.The relative sparing of joint cartilage is unique to 'primary' elbow osteoarthritis and thus makes it amenable to this modality.   Arthroplasty is rarely indicated for primary osteoarthritis of the elbow and is generally reserved for elderly individuals with low physical demands, for whom other treatment options have failed.  For advanced 'secondary' osteoarthritis of the elbow, some other types of surgery may be needed, such as... - distraction interposition arthroplasty - elbow joint replacement or total elbow arthroplasty (TEA) or - elbow arthrodesis.  In the absence of details,regarding the radial dysplasia and its severity, only general information has been offered. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for the reply.  Right now I don't have much new information to go on. I have only seen my Dr. once since June, so there is quite a bit I'm missing as well.  Right now my main issues in my right elbow is what seems to be deformities on the elbow joint. Not sure what causes iit or anything, but seems to be related to the surgery and I think it's spurs maybe? My radial head is quite a bit larger than it was before, as well as the other joint tips. Seems to be kind of pushing outwards from within.  My pain is a constant aching at almost all times as well as increased pain when I extend out fully, about -10 from full complete ROM. As well as during contraction.  What bothers me the most is that just after my therapy and rehab earlier this year I felt pretty good, not full extension but no real pains when extending. My Dr. said that is I wanted to regain even more extension to get one of those Otto Bock ROM immobilizers(?). But since I started using it my elbow won't stop hurting. Just wondering if I caused the pain from the brace, or just arthritis getting worse.\n\n",

    "content": "Brief history: -23 year old female -5'3\" -122lbs -17 years as a gymnast -born with total flat feet -bunion on left foot (big toe) -coach gymnastics 2x a week (and still tumble some) -work at a hospital where I walk 3x a week, 12hr shifts  On Thursday (the 5th of November), I did an advanced 1.5hr aerobics class and the class went well. The day after the aerobics class, my ankle started hurting (left). The pain is pretty much centered around my medial ankle bone and when I do a lot of walking (at work) it extends up my tibia a little. It is also really sore and stiff when I wake up in the mornings.  It has moderate swelling and it is very sore to touch on the ankle bone, but no bruising. I've been taking 800mg if Ibuprofen every 6-8 hours or so and I iced it for the first few days on and off. Walking, the pain isn't bad unless I let my foot evert. When sitting, it hurts to invert my foot.  I would rate the pain about a 6/10 and I have a pretty high pain tolerance from my history as a gymnast.  I modified my work schedule so I had 5 days off in a row to rest, ice, elevate, etc.  It did not make any impact in pain or swelling.  I've had inserts made for my shoes by professionals. I don't wear them on a daily basis, but I do where them whenever I am at work or at the gym working out.  My insurance will only pay for 50% of any doctor visit to a specialist until the new year starts (for us, February) and I simply cannot afford that right now.  I'm barely making above minimum wage and I'm a full time student.  Before I take out more loans to pay for a huge doctor visit, I'm hoping to receive some insight on this forum.  It would be great if I could figure out what is going on or at least make the pain go away without throwing out a few thousand dollars I don't have.  Any help would be greatly appreciated!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Pain in the left medial malleolus without trauma",
    "content": "Hi, Considering your profile and the history, a few conditions need to be considered in the differential diagnosis.  a) A 'stress fracture' of the medial malleolus: Stress fractures of the medial malleolus are known to occur very rarely. Usual symptoms are pain over the medial malleolus which is made worse by activity (running and jumping etc), tenderness over the medial malleolus and sometimes an associated swelling. In the early stages it may not beseen on X-rays but a bone scan, CT scan or MRI may confirm the diagnosis.  Treatment: rest from weight bearing activities for around 6 weeks. An 'aircast ankle brace' may be useful to protect/ support the joint & to relieve the pain. In case the injury  progresses to a complete fracture then surgery will be usually required.  b) Symptomatic 'medial malleolar bursitis':  popularity of athletic activities requiring tight-fitting shoes and boots has increased the  prevalence of this condition which is an inflammed 'Adventitial bursa' .  Congenital bursae develop in utero. They are fairly constant in location, usually deep-seated,and may communicate with the adjacent joint. Anatomic bursae in childhood develop at sites where normal friction is expected to occur.Adventitial bursae develop in adults as a result of chronic, excessive friction between soft-tissue and underlying bony prominences. The adventitial bursae are frequently subcutaneous & are not true synovial-lined potential spaces like congenital bursae.  c) one of the most common causes of medial ankle pain is ''tibialis posterior tendinopathy'. Here,the pain is just behind the medial malleolus & may radiate ti the food in the vicinity of the navicular bone.   d) in patients with a rupture of one or more of the lateral (outer) ankle ligaments following an ankle inversion injury, an impingement is said to occur between the medial malleolus and the medial facet of the talus resulting in pain that is felt on the medial (inner) side of the ankle.  Many of the injuries outlined above commonly occur in sports persons (figure skaters, gymnasts,runners etc).  In your case, you will surely need an orthopedic consult, perhaps an X-ray to exclude a  'stress fracture' of the medial malleolus. If fracture is excluded, then, it may turn out to be a case of symptomatic 'medial malleolar bursitis'. Best wishes!\n\n",

I can lay down on my side but when I first lay down and my butt pushes together it is a little sore.  I can lay on my back for a little bit with no pain in the butt.    How long can I expect for my tailbone to heal and is there some other kind of cushion that I can sit on to help with the pain?  Would I benefit from a cortisone shot?  Thanks Julie\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Coccyx (tail bone) is usually made of 4 coccygeal vertebrae(this number is variable, 1-4). It may be prominenty felt in some individuals than others.The more prominent ones are more prone to trauma.This feature depends on a number of factors - overall shape/tilt of the pelvis, - males vs females, - its angulation with the sacrum, - racial/familial factors, etc.  Minor trauma usually results in bruising at the tail bone (coccyx)and severe trauma can produce a hairline crack fracture. Hairline cracks can appear either at the coccyx tip(common), at the lines of fusion of the coccygeal vertebrae or through the vertebral segments.  Paradoxically,natural coccygeal segmentation seen on a plain film in trauma cases may be mistaken for simple fractures!.  Coccygeal injuries generally are quite painful & can take months (even up an year) to heal.Most coccygeal fractures do heal on their own, although this generally is slow. Even actual simple fractures are generally treated conservatively,  Occasionally, a manipulative closed fracture reduction may be done if the displacement is major and is impinging on some neighbouring structures.  As i have already indicated, the prominence of the coccyx varies.In those, in whom it is more prominently palpable, the pain(presumably) will be expected to be more while lying in bed(supine).It is likely that in your instance, this may be the case.  I suggest that you should consult an experienced physiotherapist(in consultation with your regular doctor) who may be able to suggest/modify/design something suitable('tailor-made') for you. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "I had a THR in August 2009.  Afterwards my legs were measured and it was determined that I had a LLD of 5/8 inch which requires shoe modification.   I have been experiencing pain in my thigh and around my knee for approximately 2 months now.  The pain has become increasingly worse and seems to be moving further up my thigh.  Also, my foot has begun to drop and my leg becomes tired after walking for short distances. It feels as if the muscles in my thigh are being pulled.  It is difficult for me to lift with my legs becuase of the pain.  I have addressed this to the doctor who performed the THR but he seems to concentrate only on the x-rays of the hip.  He doesn't acknowledge that the LLD might be causing problems, therefore I am left with no solutions.  What could this be and what should I do?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Thigh Pain and Pulling after THR",
    "content": "Hi, Sir John Charnley (1911\u20131982), Founding Father of the total hip surgery said famously: \"Over-lengthening of up to 1 cm can be justified because ....it permits active rehabilitation ...and patients very soon become adjusted to 1 cm of over-lengthening. Since men nowadays wear raised shoes for cosmetics, slight lengthening is less important.\"  Postoperative leg length disparity after total hip arthroplasty frequently leads to medical liability issues. No standard exists as of now regarding the 'acceptable' disparity. How much disparity is preventable is not clear.  The 'total hip' prosthesis has two components - the acetabular component and  - the femoral component. Both of these together contribute to the length of the limb (after removal of the diseased parts). Lengthening more oftren occurs due to the femoral component.   Even patients with 'equally long' limbs(after a total hip replacement) may perceive that their operated leg is longer immediately after the operation. This is called 'apparent leg length difference' ('Real, anatomic leg length discrepancy' is where there is a 'real' or measurable leg length discrepancy).   Usually,this perception gradually disappears  (approximately within three months) with physiotherapy. If there is 'Real, anatomic leg length discrepancy',the patients continue to complain more often about this(even after 3 months).  If the operated limb became shorter after surgery,this difference is less disturbing to most patients.The shortening is usually tolerated better as no soft tissues are strained. When compensated by appropriate shoe lift, there is no undue strain on their soft tissues and the spine is well balanced.  Measuring the limb length can be done by various ways (with or without the aid of X-rays).This needs expertise.  In some patients the operated leg may have been shorter already (before the surgery) because of prior deformity (ex, congenital dislocation of the hip) or trauma. If such a patient 'desires' correction of this, then this is a 'desired leg  lengthening'.  Studies have shown that the real leg length discrepancy does not cause problem in itself but, It is the increased painful tension in muscles and nerves that sorround the total hip joint and strain in the spine caused by the longer leg that causes pain.  I note that you have not indicated - the indication for the THR in your case or - which limb is either longer or shorter.  Therefore, my answer can't be more specific. Best wishes!\n\n",

Treatment include supporting the digit with stretchy adhesive bandage (e.g. Coban) and use ice and/or heat. NSAID's are also helpful. It will take about 3 weeks for the finger to heal.  Keep gently bending the digit but within painfree limits. Take care.\n\n",

    "title": "Ankle sprain or maybe a hairline fracture",
    "content": "2 weeks ago I fell down a few stairs first twisting my ankle inward then tumbling and hitting outside of ankle pretty hard on the banister.  Pain was intense for about 10 minutes but subsided.  I was able to bear weight with some pain. I had swelling and bruising almost immedietly to the area.  I went to the ER and about an hour after the accident they did ankle xrays which they said were normal and it was just a sprain.  2 days later I followed up with PMD and she saw my big toe area was pretty bruised and swollen so she got xrays on my foot.  Those were negative.  She said I'd be fine in a week no problem.  Well, it's been two weeks.  I can walk but my ankle (lateral, posterior) is constantly hurting, like an almost pulsating aching.  It was better for a couple daysbut has been getting worse.  I've been off work, resting, icing, elevating, and wearing an ACE when up and about.  I used crutches for 4 days as well.  Also taking NSAIDS every 6 hours and Norco every other day or so when I just cant deal with the pain anymore.  I can't sleep well and constantly wake up moaning out in pain. I went back to my PMD today telling her about the paina nd that I still cant work.  Asked her if I should get a second set of xrays, since fractures can be missed or not even visible for 2 weeks.  She told me no and that I should have healed by now and she doesn't understand what's wrong with me.  She ordered PT and sent me on my way.  I have a stupid HMO and can't go to an ortho doc without her approval (switching to PPO in January thank God).  The pain is getting so intense I'm half tempted to go to ER.  Any thoughts, suggestions?  Is it possible there is a fracture that just wasn't visible only an hour after the injury when my entire ankle was 3 times its size?  If the pain does continue, at about how many weeks after the injury should I contact my PMD again and suggest she give me a referral to an ortho?  Thanks!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Ankle sprain or maybe a hairline fracture",
    "content": "Hi,  Missed fractures (occult fractures) around the ankle do occur from time to time.  The most commonly missed fractures are of the talus, the bone that articulates with the lower ends tibia and fibula, forming the ankle joint proper.  Other fractures that are known to be missed are... - fracture of the base of the fifth metatarsal bone, - calcaneal stress fracture ,and  - tibiofibular syndesmotic injuries.  Fractures of the talar dome (the most commonly missed), are usually the result of inversion injuries of the ankle. They are located medially or laterally on the talar dome with equal frequency and occasionally through both. Lateral talar dome fractures are almost always associated with trauma, while medial talar dome fractures can be traumatic or atraumatic.  These fractures present like ankle sprains and can be missed on routine plain X-ray projections.They tend to show up on plain films weeks after the injury (variable).   Efforts are on to improve the diagnostic accuracy for these fractures.It has been suggested by some that a modified search pattern may result in improved accuracy of radiographic interpretation.  A twostep 'gold standard' interpretation, has been suggested. - an initial interpretation by the clinician or the regular radiologist, followed by - reinterpretation by a 'musculoskeletal radiologist' with the patient's medical and imaging records, with review of discrepancies(if any) by a consensus panel. MRI or CT scanning may be needed in diagnosing these occult fractures.  As you continue to be symptomatic you certainly deserve an ortho consult immediatly. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Wrist sprain post 12 months. Still feels discomfort",
    "content": "Hi, Since you seem to be having continuing pain in your 'sprained' wrist, certain other possibilities have to be thought of...  a) a missed fracture (especially of one of the carpal bones) b) post-traumatic synovitis at the wrist joint.  A fracture of the scaphoid bone (one of the carpal bones) is missed at times as the fracture-line may not be visibile in the X-ray plain films at the first presentation. X-rays repeated a week or two later may reveal the fracture.That is why, if a scaphoid fracture is suspected, it is generally treated as such, even if X-rays are negative.  Synovitis is an inflammation of the tendon sheaths as they course through the carpal tunnel. The tendon sheath (tenosynovium), becomes thickened and constricts the gliding motion of the tendons.Pain and difficulty in finger and wrist movements are usual with or without swelling at the wrist.  It will be advisable for you to consult your orthopedic surgeon who, after examining you will be in a position to decide if an MRI of your wrist is necessary to exclude these possibilities.

    "title": "Re: Middle Finger pain running down side of finger to hand.",
    "content": "Hi, The symptoms that you describe indicate that you probably have a neuritis affecting the 'Proper digital nerve' which supplies the adjoining sides of the index and middle fingers.  As you have not mentioned any injury, past surgery or swelling in the affected area,this could be something akin to the well known 'Morton's metatarsalgia' in the case of the foot, which is thought to be a degenerative process of the nerve characterised by epineural,perineural and endoneural fibrosis; hyalinisation of the walls of the endoneural vessels & endarteritis; demyelination and degeneration of the surrounding adipose tissue.  Various theories regarding its aetiology have been suggested. These include  - ischaemia , - enlarged bursa,    - repetitive micro trauma to the nerve and  - entrapment neuropathy.   You need to consult your doctor and get investigated (plain radiography, ultrasonography, electromyography etc) to exclude other causes of nerve compression (tumors, AV malformations etc).  Treatment will depend upon what cause is found.If it is only a neuritis,treatment would be most likely non-surgical, centering around physical therapy. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "I have had a sore side with the coughing and sneezing with this cold.  but i had a violent sneeze and it felt kind of like when I had a muscle tear in my thigh years ago. a sharp burning pain on my right side.  now if I cough it hurts some and then just aches a little bit. but I sneezed once more and it was even worse.    I wrapped a ace bandage around me and put pressure on the spot and it feels a bit better.     the question is without insurance I would have to go to someplace not cheap.  Is there anything that could be done beside not sneeze or cough? I don't want to go into debt and not get any relief on something that will fix it's self with time.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Severe cough is known to cause the following.... - simple fracture of the rib/ribs, - fractures of a rib with associated rupture an intercostal artery, - a ruptured diaphragm (with or without fractured ribs), - chest wall hematoma, - abdominal wall hernias etc.  Fracture of the ribs occuring as a result of cough is called \"cough fracture\" of the ribs.  Whether this can produce any serious problem or not depends upon which rib is involved, how many ribs are involved, condition of the underlying lung, co-morbid conditions etc.  But one needs to remember that severe cough is capable of producing life-threatening conditions (ruptured diaphragm with herniation of abdominal contents into the chest) as well.  So, the best for you would be to consult your doctor. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, when I was 9 I was diagnosed with left tarsal coalition and I was told that I could either take steroids or have an operation involving some sort of fusion that would make my left foot very stiff with reduced mobility. My mother chose not to have surgery or steroids and I was fitted with an orthotic device for my shoe instead.  I'm now 20 and enjoy playing basketball and jogging but find that after 15 minutes of activity, I develop a lot of pain around the heel of the foot and some pain around the metatarsal bones. Additionally, my foot will automatically curve outwards at an angle and I begin to limp.  My question is, if I were to have the fusion surgery now, how stiff will my foot become? Will I have any mobility in the foot at all?  Additionally, is there an alternative treatment that would allow me to enjoy my activities with less pain?  Thank you very much for your time.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Left Tarsal Coalition",
    "content": "Hi Daniel ,  The prevalence of tarsal coalition is probably <1%. The two most common sites affected are the  calcaneonavicular joint and the mid facet of the talocalcaneal joint.   Diagnosis is usually suspected in the preteen or teenage individual with insidious or sudden onset of pain in the midfoot to hindfoot associated with a lack of motion in the subtalar joint.   Initial treatment is by immobilization or an orthosis(an orthotic implement) may relieve symptoms, but most patients will have persistent symptoms that warrant surgical correction ('excision' of the coalition rather than 'fusion' as you have mentioned.   Long-term results show that excision of the coalition is moderately successful in relieving symptoms in the calcaneonavicular bar. Long-term success with excision of subtalar bars is not clear, although early relief of symptoms is usually seen.  You say \"my foot will automatically curve outwards at an angle and I begin to limp\".This indicates spasms of the peroneal group of muscles which are known to go into intermittent spasms in tarsal coalition (an indication of a spastic flat foot).  As you have not mentioned what is the exact type of coalition that you have, it is difficult to be more precise.  I hope this information clarifies some of your doubts. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "For the past week, I have been waking up during the night with severe pain in my hand and elbow. It feels like I have hit my funny bone. My elbow aches and my hand has a burning pain from the palm into my fingers. This only happens when I am sleeping, however, I have noticed a slight tingling and numbness in my hands when I am awake. Work has been slow, so I have been moved to a different department for the last couple of months. My hands and arms have been getting a real work-out so I assumed this was causing the pain. I work for a packaging company, catching and stacking different sized boxes as they come off of the machines. The boxes range from small enough to package light bulbs to large enough to hold king sized mattresses. I am female, 44 years old, small frame and have experienced only minor problems with my hands... occasional swelling and joint stiffness, usually in the cold months. I have never had any problems like this before. I have tried taking tylonel before going to bed and it has not helped. Ibuprohin keeps me awake so I can't take that before I go to bed. Is there anything else that I can try?\n\n",

Also, strengthen the wrist extensor muscles and stretch wrist flexors.  Avoid any ball squeezing type exercise as this will worsen the symptoms.   Carpal tunnel problems usually occur with repetitive motions like typing or grasping and handling jobs.   Also, try ice packs on the wrist after work.   Let us know how it goes.\n\n",

When this pain arose, I would extend my foot outward into a point until I felt a pop near my knee.  that would make the pain disappear completely.  I went on with this issue for the next 9+ years, which brings me to today.  I now feel the pain in my knee, but I can't \"pop\" it any longer to make it go away.

    "content": "I have seen two different doctors and do not believe that I have had this correctly diagnosed, I do plan on getting another opinion however I want to be as well researched as possible before I go into the inital meeting.    Background information : My knee pops or grinds when I extend it to full length, The knee cap slides out of place frequently whether I am active or not. the pain gets worse with activity, sitting in the same position for long periods of time, and wet or bad weather.   The first doctor I went to took an X-ray, and told me I had simply strained a ligament. I was informed to take ibuprofen, and it would go away in 4-8 weeks. Over the counter pain medication does not touch the pain in my knee, and the 2 month mark came and went while my knee pain got worse.   The second doctor physically felt me knee more, Took an mri, gave me a perscription for a pain medication and told me that I had a cyst. He then told me to get physical therapy and that was it. After extensive research on the types of cysts that can occur in knees I have found that my symptoms do not match any of them, nor has it reduced or gone away with the remedys perscribed for any of them.   I have tried ace bandages as well as knee braces, and they do nothing except to make the pain worse, the joint can not handle the pressure from them. I have also tried both heat and ice, they work only while the object in question is applied, however as soon as it is removed the pain comes back.   I would really appreciate any insight before I go  to another doctor for this. Thank you in advance.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi baja38, Decadron is used to treat many disorders and is sometimes used in rheumatic disorders too, for example, gouty arthritis. Decadron (dexamethasone) is a corticosteroid medication that works by reducing inflammation. Since individuals metabolize and react to medications differently it would be almost impossible to give a time frame as to how long relief will last. Hopefully in your case it will be an extended amount of time. Best wishes! Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, If there is a specific pattern of pain down the leg and the character of the pain is numbness, pins and needles, or tingling, consider neurology. If the pain seems deep in the bone without the above symptoms, I would see your family physician for a thorough history and physical including any cancer risks.  Bone pain occurring at night in someone over 50 years old unrelated to injury, arthritis or obvious skeletal condition raises concern about a bone tumor or cancer. So good time to see your family physician for a check up.  Take care.\n\n",

    "title": "DeQuervains or something more complicated?",
    "content": "Nine months ago I experienced my thumb locking up and severe pain when I attempted to release it. I tried NSAIDS and ice for a few weeks, but it continued to worsen. I finally went to the Dr at week six and he sent me for x-rays. The films showed a radial fracture that had healed. Based on the physical exam and the x-rays, he put a splint on my wrist and prescribed ultrasound therapy, diagnosing DeQuervains tenosynovitis. After two months of this and no improvement, he gave me steroid injections. They worked wonderfully for about a month and then the pain slowly returned, along with some other strange things. When I wake up each morning my wrist and hand is in spasm, requiring me to massage it until I can move it. It is quite painful. I have tried sleeping with the splint on, but it makes very little difference. There are several swollen areas on my wrist, about two to three inches below the site of the injections, and they feel almost like bands of some sort. I have developed similar areas around my carpal bones. It is becoming progressively more painful The swelling is worse at night. Along with that, I have developed tendonitis in my hip and both heels. I am starting to wonder if all of this has some systemic cause, or if the wrist issue is seperate from the rest. I have no health insurance, so I have to be careful what tests I have run due to the cost. I would appreciate any suggestions as to what diagnostics would be prudent at this point, and what potentially could be causing all of this.\n\n",

I had to stop on the stairs and couldn't put weight on it for a minute or so, and even then I was scared to because it felt shaky.

Anyway, I got my MRI done and the only negative thing I saw was this, \"lateral downsloping of the anterior acromion narrowing the acromiohumeral space, predisposes the patient to subacromial impingement syndrome. clinical correlation is recommended\"  Could you explain what that means, and what exactly do tey mean by clinical correlation is recommended?

    "content": "Over the weekend I was injured in a rugby match when a tackler led with their knee into the lower right side of my back.  Since then I've had substantial pain- I have a welt over my spine which is sensitive to the touch, pain on my right flank which hurts upon palpation with no rebound tenderness, and pain around my glut and into my lower back when I lift my right leg.  Also, I just generally hurt when I move around at all and struggle to find a comfortable position to sit or lie down.  I have not seen any blood in my urine, although it feels like there should be!  Is this something I can wait out, or should I try to get to a doctor?  Thanks!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Lower back sports trauma",
    "content": "Thanks for the response.  I did see a doctor this week- after percussing my back, he decided that my pain was not kidney pain.  He said it was probably damage to one of my muscles, although I now forget the name.  It is definitely deeper than my lats, since when I flex my back, palpating is not painful.  The painful region is even with my naval and just to the right of my spine on the right side of my back.  The doctor's concern was that I may have a nasty hematoma beneath the surface that has been causing all the pain (surprisingly, there is no visible discoloration on my skin).  He recommended that I get an ultrasound just to be sure.  However, the radiologist (?) decided that an MRI was more appropriate.  My pain has been steadily (if slightly) decreasing, and my range of motion has been improving.  Since I am a poor grad student with only basic health insurance, I decided to forgo the expensive MRI, at least for the time being.  At what point in the future should I reschedule it if I still have not had significant improvement?  A week or two? A month?  Is an MRI really necessary at all?  If I continue to have steady improvement, when is it alright to start being active again (indoor soccer started last week!).  Also, are there any rehab exercises or tips for recovery that would help me heal and prevent further injury?  I realize that's a lot of questions--  a response to any of them is appreciated!  Thank you!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Improving pain and range of motion are good signs.  Lack of redness, swelling and palpable tenderness are also good signs and speaks against hematoma. Exercises include supine trunk rotation, single and double knees to chest, hamstring and quadricep stretching. Another good exercise (back stretching) is to position yourself on hands and knees (like a cat or dog) then move buttocks back toward heels while dropping chin and stretching hands forward.

I still have pain in my forearms and knuckles, which still get inflamed.  I didn't have any insurance at that time and I still have none now.  I am in a very dificult situation because I can't graduate until I perform my recital and I can't perform my recital because of the injury and pain.  I also can't get the injury treated because I don't have any insurance.  I also can't get a job because my injury renders my hands largely non-functional.

Basically, inflammation in the joints and soft tissue from repetitive overuse. Here are some idea for pain and inflammation relief. 1. Use liniment containing methyl salicylate or salicylic acid (e.g. Aspercreme) and a liniment with menthol (e.g. Icy/Hot).  Combine the two, apply to the arms and cover with moist heat pack for 20 minutes - use ACE wrap to secure hot pack. 2. Add Tylenol to Naproxen 3. If all else fails, see a physician for a tapering dose of corticosteroids.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "35 yo Male. 5ft 9, 170lbs. 4 day a week gym workout over the past 5 years. Mainly alternate between upper body free weights, legs and 45 minute cardio elliptical. No surgery history.  I seem to remember approximately 6 weeks ago, when working around the house, lifting my left leg and banging the top part of my knee cap into something. 10 / 10 pain at that moment. Walked it off and all seemed fine for the rest of the day.   Went to the gym the next day and warmed up with jumping jacks, squats (no weight) and treadmill. Went on to leg presses and dumbbell step ups. Noticed some pain / discomfort in my left knee. Stopped and continued with upper body.   Next day, left knee pain when walking steps, getting in or out of car, bringing leg from extended straight position to a retracted position and vice versa when sitting in car or laying in bed.   At its worst pain seems to be run a vertical straight line under the knee cap. At best it is a minor ache that also seems to be under the knee cap.  Definitely anything to do with steps either going up or down makes it worse. Leg presses also makes it worse.   Took a weeks off from the gym and things started to feel better. Took another week off, *felt* 100% fixed and slowly went back to a regular gym workout but the pain came back. I'm now favoring the leg by using the other leg first when getting up from a seated position. I'm also restricting how much the knew bends when walking.   I am concerned about repeatedly injuring what ever it is I injured. I would like to maintain my workout regiment, or at least my upper body work out, but lately anything involving weights where I use my legs for support aggravates my knee.  Pain / discomfort when; -Getting in out of car -Going up or down steps -Leg presses -Bringing leg from extended (straight) to bent position (in car or when laying in bed)  Priority #1; Resolving the problem in time for a month long vacation (first in a couple of years)  around Xmas. I'd like to be active and mobile for that.   Priority #2; Maintain cardio fitness. Would elliptical be ok? Or is there something better?  Thank you very much, -Giles\n\n",

    "content": "im 34 years old... male... 6'2, 190 lbs I still work out with weights 3 times a week... at least...  I played sports throughout my entire life including basketball in college...  I have never suffered any real knee injury that i know of or any recent trauma...  the only thing i can think of is once after a muddy flag football tournament about 5 years ago,  it was uncomfortable to sit on my feet, but that was gone after a couple of weeks.  recently, i have been experiencing some knee pain on the inside of my left knee. it is really sporadic and has no regularity to it except that it is only happens sometimes and only while i am walking or running.  it really comes and goes. it's not everyday but it sometimes it can appear in consecutive days. it usually lasts about 15 minutes and goes away but sometimes it may come back a little while after a workout, run, or something athletic.   i will feel/hear an even more sporadic popping in my knee but that symptom is really rare. it will only pop a few times when i bend it and then quit. sometimes it happens if i lounge with my right leg rested across my left one for a long time.  sometimes its slightly sore to the touch but not excruciating or anything nor is it every time. i never feel a lack of strength or stability in my knee but it can occasionally be really painful to start a run or a game of flag football. (which understandably can make me nervous or shy to put exert a ton of stress on it)  it never hurts during weightlifting... stretching has seemed to help alleviate the pain most of the time too... please help me\n\n",

    "content": "Hello.  About 10/1, I started having an intense pain (pain scale, a constant 7-8) in my right hip area.  The pain had radiated to my lower back area, and down into the groin, and front of my thigh.  No amount of Advil (800 mg), or even muscle relaxers would take the pain away - amount being the recommended dosage.   I still have the pain, but it seems to be centered in my hip joint area, and sends shooting pains to my low back, and still sometimes down the front.  I just took a Vicodin to help ease the pain, because I'm just sick of the pain.   Coincidentally, the pain started at the same time as I started my period, which has ceased, but was terribly bad  at the time (I am scheduled for a hysterectomy in November).  I am very active running, walking, and yoga, but did not participate in any activity that day as the previous sentence indicates and I was in no condition to exercise.   However, I do find that exercise does help, when the pain is at its worst, but it does not make it go away, and I continue to have pain during exercise, I just try to honor the pain and work at a less intensity.   I have had this pain before, and had an MRI, and xrays, and nothing shows up, but the pain is real and at times, almost dilbilitatin, affecting my sleep, and my life.   What could this be?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, From your description one would first think of a gynecological cause,among other causes, as the pain radiates to the thigh.Also you say that the pain is very severe. One of the causes of such severe pain is a twisted ovarian cyst (intermittent torsion and detorsion can occur). Other possibilities include urological causes such as urinary stones (renal colics)  and orthopedic causes such as an acute arthritis of the hip joint. Finally, one rarer possibility..... Extra-uterine endometriosis. I hope this information may be useful to you.Good luck!\n\n",

I would add that as a runner, hip pain is common.  It can send referred pain to the spine and groin.  You may consider a musculoskeletal cause in the hip from the repetitive pounding of running.  (The only bit of information to speak against this would be no change in pain with Motrin.)  Take care.\n\n",

In fact, if you are stumped about the diagnosis.  Ask your physician or orthopedist about triangular fibrocartilage complex injury or syndrome.  Your description of pain and location sounds a lot like this condition which involves the lateral wrist ligaments and bones - the complex even has a small disc which can be damaged. Clinical exam and MRI help in diagnosis. Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Your option for surgical correction vs non surgery seem limited due to your history and the current pain and dysfunction levels. I think the concern is about the possibility of infection with surgery or failed fusion after surgery. The bones may require fixed hardware to maintain the fusion - that is plate and screws which may need to remain in the wrist or hand to maintain stability. Rehab afterward will emphasize return to regular duties.   In the end, you probably will lose some motion in the hand or wrist in exchange for a more stable and less painful wrist. Infection control is obviously done by strict sterile technique and good post op wound care.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "In August of 2008 I had a bicycle accident which sprained both my ankle and knee on my right leg. It put me on crutches for about three days. I ended up being able to ski that winter with only mild stiffness. During the spring, I was playing basketball and got hit in mid air, falling over and severely twisting same knee and ankle, again injuring them to a point where I was on crutches for another 3 days. In both cases, I probably tore stuff in me knee and ankle, they have mostly healed by I have had stiffness in both the ankle and knee.  Two days ago I was playing basketball, I just made a small turn to catch the ball and I heard and felt me right knee POP... It wasn't a severe turn and at first it didn't seem like it was very severe, but when I tried to put weight on my right leg, I couldn't... as long as I kept my knee bent, I could put a small amount of pressure on that leg, but I could not and still cannot completely straighten my knee. I feel some resistance and pain on the left bottom portion of my knee cap when I try to straighten my knee.  When I mentioned it to a friend, he initially suggested it might be a torn ACL, but I think I would have been in a lot more pain and not able to put any kind of pressure at all on that knee. But also, it didn't seem like anything tore like when I've sprained my ankle and knee before, it just went POP.  If it was simply my knee popping out, should it be somehow \"popped back in\", or did I tear something and need to give it time to heal before rehabilitating it?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, From your description, it looks as though you might of suffered either an ACL tear or perhaps a subluxation of the patella which 'popped back in'. Please do not judge the seriousness of skeletal injuries by comparing with prior episodes.Mechanisms of various trauma are unique in many respects.Symptoms and seriousness of the injury don't always correlate. Pl see your orthopedic surgeon.Good Luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks very much for the reply. I looked up the symptoms of both ACL tear and subluxation of the patella, the latter didn't really seem to match what it felt like or the placement... but the ACL tear... Symptoms of an ACL Tear wrote:The knee is a hinged joint allowing for flexion and extension only.  The ligaments of the knee help to prevent any movement that the knee is not designed for. The muscles above and below the knee joint are the prime movers.  These muscles are what allow us to walk, run, jump, climb, etc.  If you injure your knee, you lose the ability to perform these activities.   An ACL injury normally occurs from some type of rotational stress applied to the knee.  Remember it is only made to bend and straighten.  When this injury occurs, the athlete may feel a pop with in the knee.  They will also experience a feeling of the knee \u201cgiving out\u201d.  The phrase \u201cTrick knee\u201d has long been associated with an ACL injury.  Other symptoms may include immediate swelling, an inability to fully straighten or bend the knee.  The most common symptom is the feeling of the knee \u201cgiving out\u201d or feeling unstable.   It is not uncommon for other structures in the knee to be damaged at the same time that one injures their ACL.That seems to pretty well describe what happened.. Heard a pop and the knee gave out, and I have an inability to full straighten the knee, restricted bending, and most certainly feels unstable.  What would be your suggestion for treatment and rehab? Thanks again!!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I agree with Dr Kamath's words.  Regarding rehabilitation of an injured knee suspected of having ACL tear, here are some measures to take.  Immobilize the knee initially; use compression (ACE wrap) to control swelling; non weight bearing initially. Over time, as the pain and swelling go down, start range of motion exercises without putting weight on the leg.  For instance, lie supine: bend and straighten knee using long belt around ball of foot for assistance.  Motion should be painfree.  Any increased pain and swelling means too much exercise intensity.  Over time as pain and swelling decrease and range of motion becomes normal, start straight leg raising strengthening using cuff weights around the ankle.  Lastly, do lunges or mini squats for quad, hamstring and glute strengthening.  Use caution throughout exercise program to avoid increase pain or swelling.  Restoring full range of motion and strength is vital in order to return to regular activiities.    If in doubt about any rehab measures or any increasing problems with the knee, see a physical therapist or talk to your orthopedist.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It would be important to assess the prognosis of the painful thigh by first reviewing the tumor characteristics and the extent of surgery done and discussing the expected outcome with the surgeon.  I would think that 6 months post op would be enough time to see some pain relief.  Other questions include, was there a certain pain level before surgery and did that level change?  Was there an expectation of worsening pain levels after surgery?  Finally, is there another potential source of the pain. sometime the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve can be traumatized and cause burning and pain in the thigh.  Treatment includes steroid injection.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I'm sorry if you already have this question..I tried to search for it in old post and on google even..so now I'm asking directly.  I'm not sure how long my knees have been misaligned but my patellas point distally and not forward the way they're supposed to. The points of my lateral/medial epicondyles are always quite sensitive and when my knees are having their bad days I can feel a lot of tension. They become most irritated while they're extended and there's weight upon them. Me being overweight right now or being far more sedentary than I'm used to isn't helping either but those are more obvious issues.  I had a bad habit when I was younger of splaying my legs out wide and my feet followed. My inner thigh muscles seem to be elongated and weak (anytime I attempt to hold my legs together for too long they start to become quite fatigued) and the outer shortened and tense. I'm not sure if this has anything to do with it but I know that my misalignment is quite considerable in my knees and it seems like all my muscles from the knee up contain chronic muscle tension.  I'm actually a graduated and soon to be licensed Massage Therapist and observed a lot of these problems while in massage school and started practicing a lot better posture and it helped my lower back a lot and my upper back considerably as well. However, once the every other day massages stopped I gained a lot of tension back obviously lol. I can't diagnose myself 'cause..well..me being a doctor is still a ways down the road lol. I just need some help with this and want to know what my options are. Does this technically classify me as Genu Verum since my patella deviates from it's sagittal plane, or is it something else? What can I do about it? Surgery? Maybe some other method?  Thank you, I appreciate your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi all,   I'm trying to figure out what type of injury I have as I'm finding it very difficuly to describe when I google it.   and looking for any advice you may suggest as I have not seen a doctor yet.  I started running 4 days a week  about three months ago. started very slowly & did a couple of weeks of half hour runs, 5 min running then 5 min fast walking. I did this until I was able to run for 30 min at a comfortable pace.  I now have progressed onto doing a 3 to 4 miles on three days then 5 miles on the last day of the week with Sunday being the longest run & that increases by a mile each week  The purpose of my training is not to push myself too much or break speed records but soley to get back into shape & lose weight, maybe even complete a marathon one day for personal achievement.   Anyway, I noticed in late July  I was getting upper thigh pain, just below my right hip joint, but not quite in my groin area (if that makes any sense)  I then rested for two weeks & was able to run on 7 more accasions before I had to quit & rest for another two weeks, I started again on the 18th of Sept but was only able to go out 3 times before my leg pain returned.  The only way I can describe the pain is that my right leg feels very week & sensitive, there is slight stiffness  when I walk, very similar to the stiffness you feel a day or two after a long run, if I stand on my bad leg & slowly bounce up & down I get a sharp shooting pain that starts just below my hip joint & shoots right way down to the  top of my thigh halfway down the top of my knee  I did on a few occasions try to continue running & cope with the pain but I don't think it will do me any good besides the fact that I'm trying to enjoy what I do not  to prove to the world I can run under stress...lol  I have booked my first 10k race on the 18th October & hope to be fit by then.Any advice will be much appreciated  Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I applaud you for taking on the habit of exercise in particular running.  Running can be an enjoyable sport however it does carry risks for lower extremity injuries.  Since the pain is localized to the anterior proximal hip, a number of structures are likely to be inflamed and causing the pain: iliopsoas muscle, rectus femoris muscle or lateral femoral cutaneous nerve.   Treatment involves ice or heat, NSAIDS, stretching and strengthening program.  If no improvement after 2-3 weeks then see a physician who may order physical therapy.  Also, the progression of the running program may be too aggressive.  In other words, when you increase mileage, it should be done so gradually...no more than 10% increase per week.  Since running is repetitive and using only certain muscles, it is important to do other types of exercise to balance the muscles groups.  This would include swimming, biking, eliptical machine as well as weight training, core strengthening and leg stretching.  The non running program is vital to long term running health.  Take care.\n\n",

My first thought was about retained foreign body from surgery but this would have likely shown up on imaging tests.    The lipoma itself is an easy removal and should not have affected the thigh to this extent.  The only other thought would be to examine the tissue with an open procedure (another surgery) and take a muscle biopsy.  This assumes that the muscle or deep tissue of the thigh is causing the pain and assumes that there is some \"thing\" in the tissue causing the pain.  Finally, a bone scan would be in order since most of the tests and treatments have focused on the soft tissue of the thigh.  Examine the bone.  Take care.\n\n",

    "title": "Limited Elbow Extension/Unable to lock Elbows",
    "content": "Hello, my name is Jovian and I'm a 18 year old male who has been working out with weights a little over a year. The reason why I'm stating this is because only a few months ago did I realize that both of my elbows were unable to fully lock out in a 180 degree position like mostly everyone else during a couple workouts as well as other people notice. My right elbow is unable to bend a little bit less than my left elbow, and during many excercises that require the arm to be fully straighten out causes both of my elbows to hurt, more so of the right. I have also seen a few professional olympic such as Zhang Guozheng or female Jackie Berube who are also unable to fully lock out their arms in a 180 degree position as well.  Now I'm aware from hours of research of certain things that could define this case such as \"tennis elbow\" or \"golfers elbow\" in which I know based on the symptopns I don't have. My elbows don't normally hurt and they feel fine except some days my right elbow will hurt or it feels like there is more strain or constriction in the joint. I don't ever recall any type of injury to my elbows which could have caused this so I'm wondering if it may be some sort of elbow tendonitis or calcium buildup in the elbow joints which is causing it? If anyone could help diagnose this or come up with some sort of advice for me will be very much appreciated. Not many people have what I have which is not serious as some elbow diseases but were looking for help and a answer and possible cure or solution for this.  Especially since I'm starting the FireFighter Academy in a month and my dream career of being a firefighter so I wish to know is this a potential serious problem now or could be in the future which may affect me in the long run. Any help would be very much appreciated.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Limited Elbow Extension/Unable to lock Elbows",
    "content": "Hello, The first step in finding out what is wrong with the elbow is to do an x-ray and have a physician examine the elbow. The examination will quickly determine if this is or is not tennis or golfers elbow (lateral or medial epicondylitis respectively).   The real issue is making sure there is no abnormality in the elbow joint which restricts motion.  If no joint defect, then resting the elbows and perhaps some rehabilitation would be in order especially as you are looking to start rigorous training which requires arm and elbow use.   Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "I had surgery on my right ankle over a year ago and it still bthers me. Something is also clicking in my foot. My knee also bothers me especially when I am standing or kneeling for some time. I injured it when I accidently kicked the ball over the fence and then climbed the 5 foot fence (a little over my height), and then twisted my body around to avoid my neighbor's garden and landed awkwardly in a hole. I fell and heard a huge pop. My ankle never healed as I had fractured it, also torn ligaments and damaged one of my tendons. This is why I needed surgery because it never healed properly. But it stil bothers me over one year after surgery. Could my knee also have been injured from that twisting I did?  Do you think there is still something wrong in my ankle after that surgery?  Any advice will be greatly appreciated.  Thank you. Cassie\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Wow what a dramatic maneuver over the fence.    Yes, the ankle can still be injured especially ligament, tendons or in joints (arthritis).   Also, it is not out of the norm to have ankle or foot pain a year out of fracture healing or fixation.  With regular activity there is much demand on our feet so any previously injured area can flare up.  Yes, the knee could have been injured too especially with the twisting motion of the fall so an MRI may be needed.  Take care and let us know how it goes.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for replying. I called my doctor a few weeks ago regarding the pain I had in my right ankle a year after surgery and he said it could be inflammation and gave me a cortisone injection in my right ankle.  I saw the physicians assistant instead of my ankle surgeon as that was the earliest appointment.  However, I am still have problems with the cortison injection I got over three weeks ago.  My ankle is still sore from the cortisone injection I got over three weeks ago. Why is it still painful?  The injection site is still discolored and large. There is still bruising around it and to the right of it.    I did call last week and talked to the nurse and she talked to the physicians assistant and he just prescribed prescription pain pills which gave me wicked headaches and had to stop taken them. I was so upset that he didn't the time to look at the injection site.   The cortisone injection didn't help either as I am still feeling the pain in my ankle and the pain from the cortisone injection, and also pain in my knee.  Since the cortisone injection didn't work, could there still be something in my ankle that my ankle surgeon maybe missed?  Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you in advance.

    "content": "My surgery went well according to the Doctor, but one week post surgery I have developed SEVERE pain in my right leg. I had a spinal fusion L4-L5 on August 11, 2009.  When I mentioned it to the surgeon he said it would go away. Well it has only gotten worse, I had a 50 mg Demerol shot that didn't even touch the pain. Now I am on 80 mg oxycontin 3 times a day and that's not helping either. I can't sleep or eat, and I can barely stand to stay in one position very long. What could possibly be the cause? I am concerned because I also have a muscle disease,Some type of metobolic myopthy . I  have had 2 muscle biopsies and the second one showed some denervation of the muscle. It feels like muscle pain. My whole leg hurts but the worst part is in my thigh muscle. It is exruciating and my foot feels numb most of the time. I also have episodes of dark urine as well. My doctor is clueless as to what could be the cause. Please help because I can't take much more of this pain. Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Because of the leg numbness continuing after surgery it will be important to follow up with your neuro surgeon for re evaluation.    Regarding the muscle pain and dark urine, you may be suffering from rhabdomyolysis in which the muscle tissue is breaking down (perhaps from the myopathy).  This breakdown of muscle tissue would cause pain and dark colored urine.  You will need to see a physician who will run some lab work (CPK, myoglobin, UA, chem panel) to look for signs of rhabdomyolysis.  Take care.\n\n",

Do you have any other medical problems or systemic diseases? Any recent viral infection or drug intake?  From this description it sound to be of myoskeletal origin, most probably a muscle pain. Muscle pain and spasm occur due to muscle injury.  Causes of muscle injury include: Traumatic Muscle fatigue , wrong posture Heavy exercise  Flu Metabolic abnormalities like low Magnesium level and Hypocalcemia Thyroid disease The last three causes result usually in multiple muscle affections.  - Any causes of pinched nerve should be investigated too, including: Spinal problems like vertebral discs prolapse,  Arthritis , shoulder joint problems etc Brachial plexus injuries.\n\n",

I am a 21 year old female and I have also experienced this same pain before. I noticed my increased sensitivity to poking/punching/pinching when my brothers remarked that I have a very low pain threshold on my upper arms (have had this for some time).   The pain is hard to describe - i guess it's like the sensation you would normally get from pinching etc but must be somewhat more pronounced then 'normal' people? It makes me cry out and get irritated when people touch my arms less than gently - which perplexes people eg my brothers!  I really want to know what causes this sensitivity. Is it just a brain related low pain threshold thing or due to more pain receptors/nerves in the arm than normal?  Dr. Safaa Mahmoud suggested that it could be related to muscle injury or an illness but I am quite healthy, don't suffer from any medical problems mentioned and have never sustained any sort of muscle injury/fatigue in my upper arms..\n\n",

It isn't so much as a sharp pain but a dull, numbing, achey pain but enough to where I am now can't put much weight on my foot. It is a deep pain not a superficial pain. As the morning progressed, the pain has gone into my shins.   I haven't done anything to irritate it. I played volleyball (Tuesday) but nothing out of usual. Just hitting (which includes a run and jump and attack).   I also have a bump on my toe. I thought it was just an ingrown hair, but it might have been an insect bite. I am not sure.   Is this something where I should go to the doctor or should I ice it a few times throughout the day and night and see if it gets better?\n\n",

Certainly, prolonged walking or standing on poor shoes could cause the sore foot. However, with the bump on the toe which may look like a bug bite, it would be worth a trip to the physician for evaluation.

My pain always gets worse before I go back to the regular back pain I've always had. My most recent injection was this past Tuesday 9/8/09. My SI joint was injected. I have been in bed since then because of the pain. I woke up this morning and my right arm and hand is numb and also my right leg and foot is numb. I get cold sensations in my hand and foot. The sheet I received after the injection states to call with certain symptoms and numbness/tingling is one of the symptoms. I called the doctors asst. and she said this was normal and not to worry. should I be concerned? I worry because whenever I call with different concerns she tells me the same thing. Its normal, take alieve or advil or ibuprophen. The only way to talk to the doctor is through her.\n\n",

When examining the finger, it is important to attempt both active and passive motion of the digit.  If both are limited then the joint itself may be sprained but if just active movement is limited the tendon is more likely the problem. Inflamed finger tendon can be injected with steroids to reduce inflammation and improve mobility. Take care.\n\n",

But he screams and won't let anyone touch him or comfort him and this goes on for hours at a time. Our pedi suggested it may be from working muscles during therapy but we haven't had therapy since thursday and every night since then he has done this. I'm just looking for any kind of possibilities at this point. We have tried massaging legs and arms and nothing works. He acts like every time we touch him it hurts him. I am currently looking for a new pedi that is does more with special needs kids but in the meantime I really can't let him hurt like he seems to be. No one can seem to figure out what may be wrong so I figured it couldn't hurt to get some random thoughts and opinions.  Maybe someone could suggest something we haven't thought of yet?\n\n",

Now i have figure out how to crack my knees like cracking your knuckles by just stretching you legs and by bending you knee backwards if that makes sense. So basically every day for like 2 months when i stretch my knees crack like when i wake up in the morning... now both my knees hurt & feel like if you put menthol/Bengay cream on your skin... but it tends to feel like that constantly. Not sure whats up or what i should or need to do?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I am not sure what part of the knee is cracking - the knee joint itself or the patellafemoral (PF) joint.  An exam by your family physician would help determine if the knee cap is in good alignment or if there is crepitus (crunching sound) in the knee.  PF syndrome can cause pain especially going down stairs, squatting and kneeling.   And occasionally the kneecap pops out of place.  You also may need a knee x-ray.  With the regular x-ray, obtain a sunrise view of the patella to check the alignment.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Okay well I'm 18, I have had this problem scene i was 7, my parents took me to a doctor and they dismissed it saying nothing was wrong with me. I find this hard to believe. Usually the stiffness has not been bad but recently it has been getting worse and more frequent. What happens is if i sit or stand for a period of time my legs tend to lock up or the muscles in my upper leg seem to freeze as i have to wait  for them to allow me to move them, but its not just my legs my neck fingers arms hands all lock up or stiffen up on me sometimes, its not constantly occurring but when it dose its brief but aggravating, and i fear it may be the death of me someday. I almost think its like Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis because of the stiffness and sometimes i cant swallow (rare but it has happened more then once). The stiffness is like i said temporary like if I'm walking and i come to a flight of stairs, its hard for me to get up the first 5 or 6 but afterwords once the muscle frees up I'm able to go up them with little or no problem. It seems its just when I'm using a relaxed muscle that it stiffens up, I was changing a tire on my car yesterday and when i picked the tire up my arms locked up and i had to drop the tire, after a min or so they freed up and i picked the tire back up and went on with no problem. Any input on what my be the cause of this would be appreciated to the fullest extent, i have live with this for so long I'm just so tired of it, i just hope its not to late.\n\n",

I have congenital fusion of 2 vertabraes, and was in a car accident 3 years ago, but I'm not sure if this is related because this only started around a year ago.

    "content": "Hello, Thanks for writing in.  The question is: Is the nerve type pain originating from the foot or from the lumbar spine.   To help differentiate the two, a physician would do some further testing.   For example, to test for lumbar etiology, check the tendon reflexes, leg strength and stretching the sciatic nerve.  Furthermore, an MRI or EMG may show some deficits.  I would start there.  Other possible causes are diabetes or localized nerve impingement.  But again, I would look at the lumbar spine first.

I couldnt run on it for about 4 weeks. After that i was able to play football again, although each session was a little bit painful afterwards.  Thing is one thing that has and still occurs is that every morning i have to put my foot on the floor and kinda roll it forward and over from left to right until it clicks (quite loudly) otherwise i can't put my weight on it ! Also i occasionally get twinges of pain on the top of my foot and can certainly feel it if i curl my big toe up.  I've started running again every other morning , and it takes a few minutes before i can stride properly without a slight hobble.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 19 year old figure skater with chronic left hip pain, snapping and occasional locking of the joint. I previously had surgery on my right hip to repair a torn labrum and to reshape the joint due to an impingement.  I had an MRI with contrast done on the left hip and asked that the report be sent to me after the doctor simply told me to do physical therapy without mentioning what the MRI showed.  These are the impressions:  1) There is a persistent appearance of linear contrast signal undercutting the anterior labral margin. Although an anatomic variant is considered, the current appearance is suggestive of a labral tear/partial labral detachment similar to the previous examination without an obvious paralabral cyst. Please note, a posterior sulcus is identified, a normal anatomic variant.  2) Soft tissue edema within the left iliopsoas musculotendinous junction consistent with interstitial strain.  3) Incidental note is made of lobular fluid signal tracking along the anterosuperior right acetabular labrum at the limits of the study which may be postsurgical in nature. Correlation with a dedicated right hip small field of view study may be pursued as clinically indicated.   I have no idea what number 3 means. Any insight?\n\n",

I do not want to have to go thru the same procedure again it I do not have to. My question is, what are the risks if any of having the gum not covering the bone.

    "content": "Hello, The movement of the patella is influenced by shape of the distal femur, the contours of the patella itself and the pulling forces from various muscles and tendons around the knee.   Without changing bone, the muscles and tendons are what is left to change.  This is where physical therapy helps. Stretching hamstrings and IT band while strengthening quadriceps including VMO (vastus medialis oblique) helps. Taping is another option for the knee especially if the patella seems to abnormally adjust at 60 degrees.   Usually the painful arc in runners knee is 30-60 degrees of flexion.  If you manage the knee well and no complications, you should be able to run and do boot camp.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Doctors, please could anybody help?  My rib cage has lowered drastically in a very short space of time. I am desperate to know if a procedure exists to correct this. The weight is taking its toll on my shoulders, neck and jaw. My jaw has receded significantly and I have limited mouth opening. The weight feels like constantly being on a really fast ride, with the g-force pulling my neck and head back all the time. It\u2019s a nightmare.  When walking there is significantly more weight being placed on my hips, knees, and ankles. My back doesn\u2019t feel able to support its own weight any more, and this seems to be taking its toll everywhere else. Not to sound too dramatic, but if I carry on like this I\u2019m likely to need hip and knee replacements pretty early on as I can tell I\u2019m wearing them out. I have loose, weak joints anyway. Not to mention a jaw replacement, as the whole weight of my rib cage feels like its hanging onto my jaw. I have friction and some crepitus in the jaw joints already.  My lower spinal joints also feel like they\u2019re being compressed under the weight, so I\u2019m probably looking at arthritis there too. I don\u2019t mean to sound dramatic or overly pessimistic, but I have pretty good foresight and a sense of cause and effect, and I know that these things will definitely happen in time, and can be prevented if there is some way of surgically aligning the rib cage and spine into a more desirable relative position. I should also mention I have scoliosis (relatively mild) and so already had rib asymmetry and a hump, which means the right side, which sank first, is weighing down quite a bit heavier than the left. The uneven weight means that my neck is being pulled into a curve. The neck-to-head joint is also under a lot of strain and feels like it\u2019s being pulled out of its socket. It is all extremely uncomfortable and worrying, and I am desperate to find out if there is any hope at all of having this corrected. Also if anyone knows what may have caused this in the first place, I would be extremely grateful. My NHS doctors are telling me I must be mistaken as it can\u2019t happen, but there is absolutely no way I am mistaken, it is such a huge and drastic shift. The weight of it seems to be getting heavier by the day, and I really have to clench my stomach muscles to support myself when sitting upright, standing, or walking. I am only 24 years old and feel like I have succumbed to the perils of old age already. Please please please please please can somebody out there help?!??!!  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The lowering of the rib cage sounds fairly drastic to cause so many symptoms.  I am trying to imagine how or why the rib cage would or could do this and feel so heavy.    I would want to see some x-rays or better yet a CT scan of the chest and abdomen to see if there are any masses in the thoracic cavity causing your symptoms.  Other considerations include overall weight (any obesity?) or large breast tissue?    In the spine, it would be important to strengthen the entire back musculature as this would add stability to the entire spine.  From the spine hangs the shoulders, arms and chest.  Your family physician can evaluate your situation fully and order CT scan and physical therapy.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Dr Plamondon, thank you so much for your response. In answer to your question, no I'm not overweight, I am actually very thin and weedy! I am being considered to possibly have Marfan's or a related condition. Having done some research, what I think have happened is that the fascia which holds up the posterior rib cage has become too weak and sagged; either that or atrophy of the upper back muscles, or a combination of both. Does this sound to you like something that could happen? I have yet to find a doctor who is willing to investigate this, but am determined, now that I have more knowledge of anatomy, not to be placated with 'that can't happen', and get to the bottom of it. Wish me luck!  Thanks again.\n\n",

    "title": "Severe knee and hip pain 13 months after DHS",
    "content": "13 Months after a DHS, I am encountering intermittent but severe knee and hip pain.  The History:   I presented to a hospital with pain ++ in  April 08, five hours after completing the London Marathon and with a three week history of increasing hip and leg pain.  I underwent open reduction and internal fixation for a fractured neck of femur. The Dynamic Hip Screw method of fixation was used.  The fracture appears to have united and mended very well (and the DHS appeared to be in place)  based on radiographs in February and I was delighted to be discharged as a result.  The issue:  I have encountered knee  pain since the operation - but frankly I thought it  normal. Since roughly Christmas time, the knee pain comes and goes and has become more severe. I walk a good few miles on a daily basis and can go days with very minimal twinges. Sometimes however, very severe knee pain can come on incredibly suddenly and then most of the time is accompanied by hip pain shortly after.  The pain is usually extreme. Sometimes it is limited to the knee and hurts when I move it - but not at rest. More often when it is hurting, I feel pain along the front of my leg about half way up, and pain on the side of my leg / hip. On a few occasions, my entire hip on the left side has felt so fatigued that I have had to stop and rest. I know it is not normal  Can you venture any opinion on what may be causing the pain and why it could possibly be occurring on some days but not others? The inconsistency is driving me insane and have been unable to find any similar stories online . Could the DHS be rubbing? Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I doubt that the screw is causing the pain as the pain starts at the knee and travels up toward the hip.  I would suggest evaluating the knee: internal ligaments, cartilage, tendons - \"the whole nine yards\" and include a measurement of leg length.    Any time the hip is fixed for fracture it is important to check leg lengths if the distal joints are becoming painful without reason.  Take care.\n\n",

If the curling of the fingers is due to spasm or increase tone, there may be an upper motor neuron lesion ie a problem in the brain... the spinal cord could be affected too but I would expect both hands to be problematic if the spinal cord was damaged.

    "content": "Hello, For athletes who have recurrent ankle sprains, I recommend bracing.  The duration of bracing is the other question.  The ankle should be fully rehabilitated and no incidents of pain and swelling in the foot, knee or hip for an entire season before considering going without the brace.  There will be trainers who may have their own protocol and of course each athlete is unique.    My view is that bracing can prevent ankle sprains but bracing is not the end of the story.  Exercise must be done regularly to retrain the proprioceptors in the ankle and to regain normal strength, mobility and functional activity with and without the brace.  The best time to go without the brace initially is during controlled settings - exercise or rehab sessions then progress to practices and then competition.   Again each athlete is different and should receive their own treatment plan for rehabilitating that injury.  Take care and all the best to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It is hard to tell what exactly caused the pain.  The posterior knee contains mostly tendons, some bursa, skin, some deep blood vessels and nerves then the knee joint.  Sometimes a baker's cyst develops in the back of the knee and this would be palpable.  If present have the knee examine for internal damage.  This is not to say the sitting position would cause these conditions but may have been enough to make you aware of them.  For the most part, the sensation probably meant the knee was in a stressed position too long and it let you know it when you stood.  If there is no pain, swelling or loss of motion or function (stairs, walking etc) then there probably is no damage.  Take care and let us know how it turns out.\n\n",

He specializes in rehab medicine and can do a thorough eval of the musculo-skeletal system and order any special tests or referrals.  I like to add anti-CCP to the rheumatological panel as it add sensitivity to the rheumatoid factor.    I agree with the idea that ganglion cysts should not causing an extraordinary amount of pain.    I have not seen pigmented villonodular synovitis but from what I read, the MRI should be diagnostic.  You may need to have the radiologist re-read the MRI.

    "title": "Carpal Tunnel? Inflamed Joints? Help...",
    "content": "I have been diagnosed by two specialists over the past 4 years. One says I have carpal tunnel syndrome and the other says it's inflammed joints. I have pain in my right wrist at the base of my thumb. About 4 years ago, I hit my right hand on the gear shift of my car and jammed my thumb. I was in pain and had a hard time holding objects such as a flashlight, a doorknob, and anything heavier than 5 pounds. I went to an orthopedic surgeon who told me that it was Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and to just ice and heat my wrist and base of my thumb as needed. He gave me a wrist brace to wear. I went for a few months with only occassional twinges. I used the brace and took his advice as needed. I finally decided I needed a second opinion and went to another specialist who said it wasn't Carpal Tunnel, it was simply inflammed joints and he gave me a cortisone shot and a new, sturdier wrist brace. I still have a great deal of pain and don't know if either doctor was correct. My wrist hurts a lot with repetitive motion and also with cold weather and rain. I want to know if anyone has another opinion on what is wrong with my wrist. Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Carpal tunnel syndrome occurs from compression of the median nerve of the wrist.  It can cause local pain, numbness in the fingers, hand weakness, and loss of motion.  Treatment is conservative (ice, heat, NSAIDS, exercise) unless symptoms worsen or nerve damage is found with EMG then decompression surgery.  Osteoarthritis is joint inflammation.  It commonly occurs in the wrist, base of the thumb, DIP and PIP joints of the hand.  Treatment is conservative.  Sometimes injecting the base of the thumb joint with corticosteroids relieves the inflammation.    A physiatrist may help differentiate the two and can do an EMG for carpal tunnel symptoms.    Occupational therapy may assist in restoring normal hand function with either carpal tunnel or osteoarthritis.  To me, this sounds more like osteoarthritis vs carpal tunnel.  Let us know how it goes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello I cut my rt index finger at the base where it meets my hand.  It is only about half an inch wide but deep enough to make the soft tissue poke out.  I also think that I severed the nerve in my finger.   As a result i have the numb tingling feeling and have almost no sensation on the skin of my finger.  I have full motion and it is not infected.  A recent layoff has forced me to stitch it myself just to close the wound.   It has been 24 hours since the injury and the finger is still numb.  I guess I just want to know if there is anything that can be done for the nerve.  I would hate to go to the Drs. and have them poke and prod, put some new stitches in and send me home with a big bill.  Thank you.\n\n",

The nerves supplying the muscles are more proximal and should not be damaged by finger laceration.  The numbness may not resolve if the nerve is completely cut but the other nerves (on the other side of the finger) should be preserved.  Take care.\n\n",

First, since the back is causing back down into the legs it is important to have the legs and spine assessed for neurological integrity.  This can be done in part in the doctor's office and in part from an MRI (to look at the lumbar spine structures).  Regarding the falls, with a history of severe headaches and balance problem you may need an MRI of the head to make sure there is no problem in the brain causing the symptoms.  Again, start at your physician's office to look at the neurological signs and symptoms and see if further testing is needed.  Take care.\n\n",

Regarding the supraspinatus,  if it is not torn then strength can be restored otherwise you will need to rely on compensatory muscles (eg lateral deltoid and other rotator cuff muscles) for the complex motion of the overhead serve.    The risk of repetitive overhead motion with abnormal rotator cuff is impingement, pain, inflammation, and secondary frozen shoulder.  The last being worse case scenario.

I don't feel the pain in any of my fingers, just my wrist, and it is worse when I extend it down and back. But even laying still, it's hard to bare. The pain is centered around the carpal bones of the hand where it meets the wrist at the indention on the mid back of my hand. When my wrist is sore, the indention there becomes much more pronounced and deep. But after a few days, the pain seems to clear up and it's fine again until it decides to flair up again. I can't trace it back to any injury, and there's nothing that sets it off. It seems to always come on gradually. Should I see a doctor about it? I haven't been taking it seriously, I've normally just taken anti-inflammatories and used ice-packs, but if it might be something like a stress fracture that could get worse, I'd want to know.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello. I inherited flat feet and without being realized about it, I played badminton for several months. I started having knee pain and being clueless that it could be caused by badminton, I continued to play another few months. Then I stopped after the pain gets worse. Later I joined gym and when I did treadmill, I had same pain again on my knees. I went few session in physiotherapist, and they suggested me to wear orthotics. It helps, but the pain is too worse that it hurts even standing few minutes inside house without orthotics. Which means I had to be on orthotics all the time to keep my knee pain away. It also hurts when I go for swimming. Is there anything that I should do to improve my condition? Btw, I do streching exercises like quadriceps.  Please advise. Thank you.\n\n",

You may also try foot arch strengthening by picking up marbles with your toes.  It is still unclear what is causing the knee pain and swimming shouldn't aggravate knee pain unless there is acute inflammation in the extensor mechanism (quad or patella) which is aggravated with kicking motion.    Take care and let us know how things turn out.  Are you still in physical therapy?  They should be able to tell you what the knee problem is.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  From your description, it doesn't sound like the finger is damaged to the point of disuse.  .1mm difference in diameter of the PIP joint is not significant.  You may try placing Coban self adhesive wrap around the joint for a week or so to add some support and compression (not too tight though).  Ice may also be beneficial.  If the digit continues to be bothersome or worsens, then see a physician otherwise we would chalk this up as a mild strain or sprain of the 3rd finger PIP joint and treat conservatively.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Certainly, increased tension in the neck can elicit popping or crackling noises.  Without pain, swelling or trauma, crackling noises in joints are commonplace.  Rotating neck to the right with crackling noises (but not to the left) may be telling of some asymmetries in the neck or shoulder muscles or extra tension on the right side but again nothing alarming.  I would recommend 10 reps of shoulder shrugs (squeezing shoulders up tightly toward the ears and hold 5 seconds then relax).  In the least, this will ease muscle tension and may relieve the sounds in the neck.  Take care and let us know how it goes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Even with the detailed description, it is hard to tell what extent of damage was done to the shoulder without a clinical exam.  Sometimes the rotator cuff muscle can be torn and the shoulder have full range of motion - due to compensatory muscle use.  I test the rotator cuff with the drop arm test, empty can test, and lift off test (place the back of hand on the low back and try to lift off the back).   With dislocation there is concern about the superior labrum which can tear along with the biceps tendon.  With this said, it is important to have a clinical diagnosis via the primary physician or orthopedist.  Take care.\n\n",

I was wondering if She put me on a Pain Management until the Sept. if this would be too much of a risk? She did give me Lortab 10  1 3x  a day and Soma 1 3x day. I would only take at the most 1 Lortab in AM and 1 in PM same with Soma. Some days I wouldn't take any at all. I am just worried. I have Never had any abuse problems but at same time these medications would make the pain bearable. Would it be safe to go on a Pain Management until I could get the surgery ?

It is hard to say how long these stages take.  Usually, a few months on narcotic pain meds is not a problem but remember you will likely need some pain meds post op too.  Other options are Ultram which can be added to your regimen.  It may take the burden off the need for too many Lortab.  It sounds like you are well aware of the potential problems with narcotic meds but also are getting some benefit.    Obviously, discussing this with your primary physician is the best route to take.

    "content": "It is possible to feel more pain a few hours later.  Sometimes our bodies do not hurt nearly as bad until several hours or even a day after the injury.  Many times the pain is worse later because of the compression of nerves around the area from the swelling that occurs. Also, IF it were a fracture, yes it could get worse.  You need to send this kid to the doctor.  He needs an x/ray if not already done.  The usual symptoms of a fracture are extreme swelling, bruising and the inability to move the limb.  Many times you will see an abnormal alignment of the bone or joint.  Excruciating pain is common of course with a fracture.   But yes, if it is a fracture and one continues to use or put weight on that area, it can become more injured.  Another concern would be that if a fracture occured and he did not get medical attention right away, the bone will try to heal in the abnormal state of alignment and hinder use of that area.  It is more difficult to do align the bone or joint after it has already began to heal the way it is.    Debra Van Ness RN\n\n",

    "content": "I injured my leg, about 2-3 inches above the ankle, playing basketball about 5 months ago. I was on anti-inflammatories (Naproxen) and it slowly got better. About 2 months ago I played basketball again and reinjured it. For the past 2 months I have been on Naproxen and also Vicodin to supplement it. I have gotten 2 MRIs, a bone scan, several x-rays. There is a lot of inflammation.  The doctors think it may be a torn interosseous muscle between my tibia and fibula but they do not seem sure.  The pain was getting better but after making several flights in a short time, it has gotten worse (I believe because of the elevation but I am not sure).  Since I have university insurance, it isn't easy to see another doctor without going through a lengthy process.  I just received a cortisone shot 5 days ago and it hasn't made my pain any better. The pain is horrible and it hurts even if I am sitting or laying down in bed after the medicine wears off. I get woken up most nights from the pain when the medicine wears off.  I would greatly appreciate any assistance as to what the problem may be, what I can do at this point, or how long I should expect for this problem to last.  Thank you so much.\n\n",

With a high level of pain and normal scan, I wonder if you are putting too much weight on the limb not allowing enough time for healing.   Bracing and crutches at this point may be in order.

They ended up doing more x-rays, another MRI, and eventually found a bone lesion right below my knee (even though the pain was right above the ankle).  They gave me a CT scan and thought it was osteoid osteoma at first.  After going to an orthopedic oncologist he thought it was something worse. I had to do surgery and a biopsy showed that it was osteoblatoma.  I'm recovering up right now and the original pain is 95% gone!  Thanks again for your help.\n\n",

If I lay down or sit and then stand up, it is very cumbersome and hard to get going. Every once and a while it will pop while I walk.   The area above the knee, where it joins the leg is still swollen, tender, very tight, and numb.  How long should these symptoms last for? When should I seek help from my physician?

    "content": "Hello,  I am not a doctor, but saw your post and familiar bells went off. This started happening with me when I was 16, and they diagnosed me with patellofemoral syndrome. Essentially the tendons on the inside curve of your knee are too loose and the ones on the outside are too tight, as the knee cap does not track correctly. The key is to strengthen the quads and hamstrings so that the muscles guide the kneecap properly. So any exercises which allow this, along with stretching of these muscles, will help stabilize.   Again, I'm just an average Joe, and please see a doctor if you're concerned. Just relating my personal experience. It's actually called 'subluxation' with what you're experiencing, since the kneecap goes right back into place. If it ever does NOT go back into place and stays dislocated, see a doc immediately. Let me know if you have any more questions on my experience, I'd be happy to tell you what I can.\n\n",

Perhaps bone bruise is the right term.  It sounds like the condition is in the quadricep mechanism (quad muscle, tendon, bursa, and patella).    Treatment is conservative and usually consists of physical therapy, avoidance of aggravating activities, NSAIDS and time.   I would expect 4-6 months healing time depending on the extent of the condition.  Take care.\n\n",

In addition there is associated vomiting and in severe cases shock. Acute pancreatitis is a medical emergency. It doesn't appear to match your symptoms although I am in position to judge given the limitations of the internet.

In fact, years ago, when I worked a very physically demanding job, I felt that my bottom rib \"turned under\" on that side as I used a pitchfork, etc.  Now, there is a nearly constant pressure and discomfort, bordering on pain.  It is slightly to the left, though sometimes it feels almost centered--more in the area of the stomach.  I have no noticeable stomach problems (bloating, early satiation, etc) or bowel problems (you could pretty much set your watch by my regularity.  Ideas?\n\n",

    "content": "I have had a dull pain, that occasionally gets worse, at the bottom of my ribs on the left side for over a year now. It occasionally goes away completely. It seems to be related to my bowel movements. I was diagnosed with IBS many years ago, but feel this was a diagnosis the doctor came up with because he didn't know what it could be. I've never had any tests. Since having my son 17 years ago I developed haemarhoids, which have been treated but which remain. My stools are often 'square' and thin. I feel that I have enlarged veins in my rectum and possibly in my lower colon that cause this. I cannot seem to get my diet right. High fibre foods such as bran make it worse. Sweet foods make it worse. Sugar, chocolate, alcohol etc.. make it worse. I do lots of meditation and anxiety reducing strategies, but  I'm just about coping and sometimes I despair of ever feeling well. These days I don't bother to go to the Doctor with it. I just get fobbed off. I guess he thinks I'm a hypochondriac. It's really hard to be taken seriously.\n\n",

I then tried a combo of Amoxycyllin and the Lo Pras and that didn't work either. The symtoms are very similar, I've a dull ache under the left side of the rib cage, accompanied by a funny little globule type thing that I can actually feed beneath my skin when I'm seated. When I feel around that area I can physically feel a little thing moving against the lower rib on the left hand side. Can anyone else as a matter of interest feel anything like this. What could that be, I cant see it being totaly normal. The doc reckoned it was some fat growth beneath the skin but I aint convinced! Very strange. It aint painful, its just uncomfortable. Its more noticeable after I eat. I do have more gas alright, but nothing massively noticeable. Again, its more noticeable with tight trousers, sitting down, driving that kind of thing. Drinking doesn't affect it massively. It is affecting sport in that if I am cycling, the compressed position seems to agitate it. It just feels like there is something there that I would love to put my hand in and rip it out whatever the hell it is! Any ideas???\n\n",

I went to the emergency room december 30th and got a cbc and xray which were all fine according to the doctor. They prescribed nexium since I have a history of acid reflux. I have been on new medication now for the reflux..which isnt bothering me, it is my front left rib area under my top left abdominal,with discomfort on my side that is painful to the touch then to  my back around my kidney area. I recently had fairly extensive blood tests done and the results were normal and in healthy range and another xray showed no rib fractures. I am a fairly big guy still at 232, normally I weight between 240-250, but at 14% max bf at my heaviest, and am 6-1\" in height. I am a former college athlete and recreational bodybuilder. My new doctor wants to see me in 6 weeks. I don't know if I can wait that long. I feel progressively worse each day, and the fact that the blood and xray results were fine means theres not too much new data that she can work with as far as diagnosing me. This doesn't feel connected to my stomach.  I also have painful to the touch knots in my abdominals in certain spots.  THe whole back left side of my body has been sore the past few days. I helped move heavy boxes for my church last thursday and its possible that I pulled a muscle in my back, although I do not remember doing so. I am very out of shape right now, and im used to being quite strong, so it it entirely possible.  I have read probably 200 posts of different people with this same problem on different sites.  but no one has yet to come up with an answer....I figured I would \"sign the petition\".....#201  Please help.\n\n",

    "content": "Wow!  So many people with the same problem.  I have this left sided ache under ribs since 1985- yes- for 14 years.  It comes and goes in severity- when it is minimal life is worth living, but when I have an 'episode' (lasting days or a week or so) life is definitely not worth living.  My left sided ache under ribs can be initiated by mental activity- yes- reading a magazine or doing computer work or driving the car.  I have worked out that these activities are a form of stress for my body, even though it doesn't appear to be stressful.  For example, I have always liked driving and computers.  There is some anxiety related to this condition.  The only positive treatments I have found are taking even a small amount of oxazepam (a muscle relaxant), running, and meditation.  After many negative tests, I think that my condition is called 'splenic flexure syndrome'.  If you Google this, a lot of hits come up.  The pain seems to be caused by trapped gas in the splenic flexure (a bend in the colon between the horizontal part of the colon and the vertical part).  Why it seems to be related to stress I do not know, but I would like to find out.  Anybody have any clues on this?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Left sided ache under ribs",
    "content": "Hello, For left sided abdominal pain,  anatomically, there are considerations of the ribs, the lung tissue, the spleen, the pancreas, the colon, the kidney, and the diaphram, and the abdominal aorta. Therefore the differential diagnosis is broad.    A thorough history and physical exam is warranted for persistent symptoms.  Imaging study like CT and some basics labs (CBC, amylase, lipase, and basic metabolic panel) usually are ordered.   One of the many diagnoses is pleuritic pain or pleurisy.  Pain increases with forced inspiration/expiration and located in the chest more than the belly (can locate under the ribs)  The causes of pleurisy forms a long list including viral or bacterial infection, inflammation, auto immune disorders, cardiac problems, etc.   Again, this is just one of many considerations which can be teased out from a history and physical exam by your family physician.  Take care.\n\n",

I would look at an underlying cause of the bursitis - walking mechanics, leg lengths, muscle tightness, strength testing, shoe wear, excessive genu valgum, etc.  If you can remedy any underlying cause, all the better.    I am not familiar with excision of bursa sac in the hip -- this would be considered as a last resort.  Take care.\n\n",

    "title": "Hit by Softball in Shin",
    "content": "A week ago sunday, I got hit in the right shin, just below the knee by a softball. I was able to just walk it off and seemed fine the rest of the week except I had a bump where the ball hit me, It hurt to touch and immensely if pressed. Friday my son accidentally pressed on it very hard, and it burned for a good 5 min. then saturday and sunday I did a lot of walking. I had been expirencing twinges in the shin and some sharp pains during the weekend when i walked too hardly, or started walking from a rest. By the time I was to play softball again sunday evening, I had a yellow bruise strait down the shin from the Knee to the ankle, and a yellow grey bruise on the inside of my ankle at the joint of the foot. I had a constant ache in the entire lower leg and the more weight I put on it, the more it hurt. I did not play. Today driving to work and pushing the pedal made my leg ache, I am experiencing the same full lower leg ache i did yesterday, and I'm also getting some twinges and sharp pains in the shin when I'm just sitting. Should I worry that this is more than just a bruise? Could it just be aggravated by the activity?  Thanks, Lindsay\n\n",

    "content": "I am 15 years old and I keep getting really bad backache when I wake up in the morning. It tends to be in the center to lower area of my back. My back feels really inflamed and painful when I wake up. I also need to click my back a lot and is tends to get really stiff if I stand for a while or if i'm sitting down in a lesson. I did go to the doctors about it, but my GP suggested it was due to inactivity (as I went during half term). She told me to do exercises, like touching my toes, etc. I have tried these things, but none are working. I have considered it being due to being overweight, as I am a UK Size 16 or possibly I might have a curved spine which I have heard people can get which causes back problems. I also thought it may have been due to having an unsuitable mattress, so my parents went out and brought me a special orthopedic mattress, but it hasn't made a difference. A few years ago I went on a bouncy castle at a party and I jumped really awkwardly into the side and I felt and even heard my spine move. It moved outwards and then moved back into place, if that makes any sense. My back felt sore for a day or two afterwards, but was ok'ish afterwards. But ever since then, my back has never been 100% ok. I'm really starting to get worried because i've been getting pain in my back for well over a year now, possibly two. I feel as if i'm being a hypercondriact by going back to my doctors, but I know something isn't right. My mum keeps saying take tablets to releave the pain, but I just want find out what's causing my back to hurt so much. Please, please could someone give me advice on what to do. I would be most greatful.\n\n",

I would recommend a physiotherapist to instruct you in the proper mechanics of spine exercises.  Walking should also be a component of most back pain sufferers regimen.    Taking some NSAIDS for 3-4 weeks should be ok in addition to hot and cold packs.

    "content": "I was very active until last may -- I went to the climbing gym twice a week and karate twice a week as well -- but I injured my legs somehow and they've never been the same. I've pursued both the rheumatological and the orthopedic angles, and what I've heard from both has been that I just need to condition myself more.   On Sunday, I drove and walked and stood quite a bit, perhaps a bit much; but since then, even touching a piano pedal for a minute or so has triggered pain near my heel; often, though the soreness when it comes is near the top of the calf, almost at the knee, and I don't think this is compatible with just Achilles tendon issues. It's really limiting what I can do, especially musically, and I'm in some degree of pain about 2/3 of the time, but I don't know where to go from here. Should I see another orthopedic doctor? Should I bug this one more? Is there another specialty that might be able to help? Or have I just somehow gotten too weak to do ordinary things without incurring pain? For what it's worth, I'm 32 -- not young, but not that old...  Thanks for any insight you might have.\n\n",

The plantar fascia sometimes is hard to inject accurately - its a long broad fibrous band with multiple potential points of inflammation.  So unlike a joint injection, you have to find the right spot. I would give this a few weeks and consider another injection. Some physical therapy may also help where they can do ultrasound or iontophoresis with a steroid cream. Take care.\n\n",

One doctor told me it was a ganglion and would go away, another doctor tried steroids for the lump thinking it was a ganglion and nothing happened. I had another look at it and an ultrasound was performed to show that my pisiform bone has actually raised up. It has not been sore until the last couple of weeks and has not gotten bigger over the time i have had it (roughly one year). Could the shot of steroids have aggravated the bone? I received the shot roughly 4 months before the ultrasound. Also, can a pisiform bone decrease back to normal size as i am not sure what happened for it to raise in the first place? I was told i could have the bone removed but am worried my hand won't function as per normal after surgery.  Thank-you for your help.\n\n",

The ulnar ligament and ulnar nerve travel in a groove (tunnel of Guyon) creating in part by the pisiform.

Base on MRI interpretation, it says that my left knee shows probable partial tear of MCL. And on September 2006, arthroscopic surgery of my left knee has been done. The next day after surgery I was advice  by the doctor that he did not find any tear inside my left knee. Since then and up to present, I notice that I can\u2019t lift heavy object, can\u2019t run and swim anymore without pain, my left knee is weak than before the accident and recurrent pain of my left knee occurred once in a while even while sitting or sleeping. My doctor request for another MRI only last  March 2009 and the interpretation said that:  Multiplanar MRI study of the left knee shows some intermediate interstitial signal abnormality in the ACL. Most of the ACL fibers remain intact.  There is a minimal fluid effusion in the suprapatellar bursa and knee gutters.  PCL appears slightly buckled, focal intermediate signal is noted in the medial meniscus posterior horn ligament. The lateral meniscus, medial and collateral ligaments including patella, quadriceps and patella tendons are normal. The femoro-tibia joint is not narrowed, there is no evident astheophytes nor subsubchondral cyst formations. IMPRESSION:  Minimal partial interstitial ACL tear.                            Minimal joint fluid effusion.                            Grade 1 medial meniscal degeneration.  Can I ask if vuscosupplementation will help? Can somebody help me what will I do so that I can I go back to my work as an electrician.\n\n",

    "content": "Recently I have had an injury to my right ankle due to either squats or jogging. The pain is at the medial mallelous. Originally, if you could visably see the pain it would have been, upon standing, in the shape of a cresant moon around the medial mallelous nearest the achilles tendon, near the area where the posterior tibial tendon is in relation to the medial mallelous. The pain is constant and moderate with occasional stinging pain. There is no increase of pain with eversion or inversion of the foot. However, there is an increase of pain with both extreme dorisflexion and plantor flexion. It hurts to walk on the foot/ankle but is not yet unbearable. It has been about a 3-7 days since the pain first occurred. I can rotate the ankle normally, outward or inward, with no additional pain. Today there seems to be some lateral pain as well that mimics that of the medial. There is no foot pain, not at the insteep or at the heel nor the achilles tendon. No pain in the toes. The area of pain around the medial mallelous has increased and is now most prominent near the top of the medial mallelous but still present around the side. There is no pain in the front/top of the ankle, where the foot meets the leg, even nearest the medial mallelous. There is now moderate pain that extends a couple inches above the ankle into the leg on the medial side. Pain is present when inactive.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I applaud you for your description - well done. This pain could be caused by a number of things. I would palpate the medial tibia from the proximal shaft all the way to the medial malleoli looking for tender spots.  The posterior tibialis may be inflamed along this route and most severe around the malleoli.  Running may worsen this condition.  Without traumatic event, an ankle medical ankle sprain is unlikely especially with painless inversion/eversion.  The question is : is the pain in the joint itself or in the tendon.  The reason for thinking about the joint itself is the onset of lateral pain.  I would do an xray to look at the joint; if negative then I would assess the tendons, bones, joints for range of motion, strength, tenderness etc. and also look at the feet (flat feet vs high arches).  Flat feet and running can cause medial knee and ankle pain.  Take care and let us know how it goes.\n\n",

    "title": "Upper Back/Neck/Left Shoulder/Left Armpit/Left Arm Pain.",
    "content": "Around the beginning of February, I injured my back/shoulder somehow.  I was very active playing outdoor hockey at the time.  The injury was not something that happened immediately following some activity, it appeared gradually with no known cause although the pain started a couple days after I lifted a heavy net over the boards.  The pain originally started in my upper back and neck with radiating pain into my left elbow.   It was quite severe and constant.  The pain eventually included my left shoulder and radiated all the way down my left arm into my hand, with most of the pain centering in the elbow.  The pain has now also moved into my left arm pit.  I do not have any tingling, numbness or weakness at all and the pain is lessened if I lay down with my head propped up and arms straight out and flat.  Standing and sitting for moderate periods of time increases the pain.  Also tilting my head upwards increases the radiating pain to my elbow.  I am able to turn my head either direction to look over my shoulders.  I have had an X-Ray of my C-Spine which came back normal and also an X-Ray of my left shoulder which originally came back normal, but I received a call from the hospital stating they thought it might be a slightly seperated shoulder.  I am not entirely convinced of this as it has not healed after almost 8 weeks and with pain appearing in new locations.    The pain is now not as sever as before but still there.  I have taken numerous drugs for the pain.  Ibuprofen, Tylenol, Tylenol #1, Arthrotec all did not work.  I was given Naprosyn and I am not sure if that helped or not.  I was also given Percocet, that was the only drug that helped with the pain, I only took it for two days as it is highly addictive.  Luckily after the 2 days the pain was manageable without medication.  I am scheduled to see a Physiatrist in 6 days and I am also supposed to be getting scheduled an MRI, but the wait time for MRI's is 1 year.  I'm mostly worried that it may be something permanent or serious.  I have already seen at 3 or 4 different doctors about it but they are unable to give me any reassurance or good information.  Any thoughts or advice?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  One question: in the course of all the exams and rule-outs, have you by any chance had even a cursory cardiological workup? It's a stretch, I realize, but the symptoms do follow a certain fairly typical nerve pathway and the orthopedic tests haven't yielded much. While there are other possibilities for sure, I always like to remove the big, ugly ones first. A resting 12-lead EKG and a listen via stethescope, at least, would seem in order.   Assuming that's either been done or will turn out negative, you must have somehow compressed or at least irritated a nerve somewhere along that pathway from your neck/shoulder down your arm. It could be either of the major nerves serving the arm and hand, but you don't mention any numbness or tingling in the hand on the affected side. You do, though, have pain in the elbow. The ulnar nerve (which also carries much coronary pain) passes across the elbow (your \"funny bone\", one end of the humerus) and the pain could culminate there. The question remains, if this is so, where the nerve has been compromised. If there's no cervical injury, it's still entirely possible you disturbed the brachial plexus/thoracic outlet, where the ulnar nerve and the blood vessels serving the upper extremities pass through on each side. Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) can cause the symptoms you describe and can  be caused by trauma, postural faults, heavy lifting or be congenital. What happens is the already narrow space between the collar bone and the first rib becomes more narrowed due to one of the above causes and sometimes compresses the ulnar nerve.  This is only a couple of suggestions. I seriously doubt the \"slight shoulder separation.\" The symptoms don't suggest shoulder separation and it's hard to have one's shoulder be \"slightly\" separated. It's a pretty traumatic situation and painful and again it isn't consistent with things you've reported here. It's not impossible, but it's extremely unlikely.   Hopefully this will be of some help in narrowing the field of possibilities as to what's going on. The fact that opiods are effective on the pain and anti-inlammatories do not suggests it's not an inflammatory problem but a mechanical one. This could include TOS.   Good luck toyou. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "A Dr did take a listen to my heart with a stethescope and never mentioned anything.  That was the first Dr I saw which thought it was most likely a pinched nerve.    I did have a stress test and ultra-sound of my heart done around august/september, and everything was fine and in good working order.  I'm also only 29 years old, so not really too old yet (altho i feel old), and theres no history of any heart problems in my family, exception of my grandfather having a heart attack, but he was also in his late 70's i believe.  Another Dr told me it was Rheumatism, and another Dr told me it was most likely my facet joints, because when he pressed on a certain area in my shoulder blade and in between my shoulder and neck there was pain.  The elbow pain I described is not actually right on the elbow.  It is about 2 inches up from the elbow close to or on my tricep and also about 2 inches down from the elbow on my forearm flexors/brachioradialis (sorry i don't know the muscle anatomy of the arms too well)  If I tilt my head up and look at the ceiling the worst pain that radiates is 2 inches up from the elbow close to or on my tricep.  Its a very sharp pain.  Originally I had to look down all the time and was not able to look up, I am now able to look up without much pain if any, it take me tilting as far back as I can with my head to get the severe pain.  Most of the pain is in the two spots near my elbow, there isn't much pain in the shoulder/neck area, it only shows up when i've been out walking or standing for a long time.  The pain will go away in about 45min to an hour if I lay down with my head propped up on about a 30-45 degree angle.  I'd also like to clarify that the shoulder 'seperation' we are talking about is not a 'dislocation'.  My take was that they were saying it was a Stage I AC Injury.  Thats my guess.  Sorry I'm trying to give as much information as I possibly can.  Given all this and what you think might be the cause, what would be the possible treatments and recovery times?  And thanks for responding so quickly.\n\n",

    "content": "After reading this and re-reading the original post, I think there must be some cervical hyperflexion (overextension) that isn't normal and that causes the ulnar nerve outlet to be placed under pressure. It almost always will refer further downstream, in the area of the elbow or outside of the left hand (down as far as the  pinkie). If this is so, even though imaging doesn't seem to disclose it, this may be because it looks relatively normal unless the neck is flexed the way it is when you're able to reproduce the symptoms. Also, since flexing your neck forward and keeping your arm in a certain position seems to relieve it, this is my best guess. However, since we now have on board someone  with a good deal of expertise in this area, I'm going to refer this to him and see if he can offer a better explanation. Please check back here in a day or so to see what turns up.\n\n",

It is in the same area all the time now, just below my left shoulder blade to the bottom left of my armpit.  I have also been under a great deal of anxiety due to this injury, so I can't rule out the possibility that some of these symptoms are anxiety related.    Just wanted to add that in for you or the other Dr. to consider.  Once again thank you for the reply and your time, it is really appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,       I am so sorry this is happening to you. I can say as nurse who has taken care of many people with work related neck injuries that I believe this is all related to your original complaint when you lifted that heavy object. It is not unusual that you might have pain that radiates down the arm or to another place on the arm even if you injured your neck. You mention that when you move your neck a certain way it intensives your problem. This is most likely because when you do this you are pinching the nerve that supplies that part of the arm. The nerves that supply our arms with sensation and movement all go through the neck (cervical region) There are several vertebrae that the nerves can move through. Depending on which area of the neck you injured or caused a herniation is where you get the pain.   From my own experience I had an injury in which I picked up a large carpet and inititally only my shoulder hurt then slowly I began to get increasing (as the swelling of the disc herniation increased) pain in my right forearm that was severe, deep and even extended to my right thumb. Xrays were inconclusive, I had an MRI that showed \"bulgling discs, but no herniation\", so they thought my injury wasn't \"that bad\" I was lucky to have a doctor who believed I was in severe pain and prescribed pain medicine, but the pain never went away, even with PT, traction or anything I tried.   I finally went to see a neurosurgeon who was concerned because I had no bicep reflex on the right arm. They did a myelogram, which is an xray with dye put in your spine, and they found out that my C-6 (sixth cervical vertebrae nerve) did not fill with dye which meant I had a completely compressed nerve at that point which is why my forearm, shoulder and finally my neck hurt so bad. I ended up having surgery to repair it and now it is fine and I have only minimal decrease in sensation because of the wait for the diagnosis.   I was wondering if you would have as long a wait for a myelogram as it is a series of regular xrays done with dye placed in the spinal column. It only requires a normal xray room and can give the same kind of information as an MRI, Just wondering. I hope things go well and that they find the cause of your pain.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I wanted to add to what you and John discussed.  Pain just above the elbow which increases with cervical extenstion (looking up) may be caused by a cervical vertebrae problem. This is where I would start investigating.  Look at neurological status: deep tendon reflexes, sensation and muscle strength in the arms.  Then asses the neck with variety of movements including a Spurling test of the neck.  The physiatrist may do a nerve conduction velocity test in the office to check nerve status.   Secondarily, look at the shoulder range of motion, strength and joint integrity and special tests for rotator cuff, impingement or subluxation problems.   If both of these areas are negative and normal then do general rehab on the shoulder, neck, and arm and symptopms should resolve with time and rehab.   Let me know how it goes and if you have any further questions.\n\n",

    "content": "I tend to think it is more of a compressed nerve as well, but I have extreme health anxiety and tend to look everything up.  Of course when I started getting the muscle twitching, I immediately went to google and guess what I found, ALS.  So now i'm all freaked out that I might have ALS.    I see the Phsyiatrist today, but I don't think I will get the results today and from what I've heard, he isn't a very good Dr.  They most likely won't even call me back or let me know anything.  So i'm not very optimistic.  I'd prefer to not have the myelogram done as I'm pretty sure that is very painful, I do not want to be jabbed in the spine.  I would rather try to get an MRI even though the wait time here is like a year.  I'd rather try and pay $700 for the MRI in a private clinic instead.  Are my symptoms which I have mentioned in my post/replies consistent with a compressed/pinched nerve?  Should I really stop freaking out about this ALS thing?  Honestly what are the chances of it being ALS when the only symptom that fits is muscle twitching?  Also since it has been about 8 weeks since the injury occurred (keeping in mind that the pain isn't as bad now and my condition has improved but not completely) could there be permanent damage?  Thanks again for the replies.\n\n",

You may try some cervical traction for a couple weeks and see how the referred pain does.  If this helps then continue for a few more weeks and add some neck range of motion exercises (rotation, side bending, and chin tucks).  You may also try scapular squeezes.   Of course, any exercise which worsens pain or symptoms should be stopped.  Take care and keep us posted.\n\n",

I tend to slouch forward when using a computer, I also finished a season of outdoor hockey which involves a lot of rigorous movements and which I spent bent over a lot.  I was out practically everyday for 3-5 hours a day for 2 months and when my back started hurting, I didn't think it was anything big and that it would go away in a couple days so I played through it.  Probably wasn't the best idea and made things 10x worse.  I am attempting to sit up straight in front of the computer and I have raised the monitor to eye level.  Unfortunately I am still unable to sit at the computer for more than an hour or so, anything longer and I start having extreme discomfort.  I generally have to lay down for roughly the same amount of time to recover.  I also find it difficult to breath for some odd reason when I sit up straight, probably because I am not used to doing so.  My father had the same problem with his back and told me that since it took a long time to get this way it will take a long time to undo it, would this be a correct assessment?  I go for physio on Monday, hopefully it will help out a lot.  I will keep you updated on my progress.  Thank you.\n\n",

I am a former 1 year, beginning adult hockey player who finished that season with low back surgery (not related to the arm pain). I too had EMG, MRI, X-RAYs, etc. with no significant problems being found.  During peak periods, when I would look down and/or to the left I could turn the pain on like a light switch.  People in the same room could sometimes hear my neck \"pop\" as I turned my head.   It usually starts in August as a stiff neck-shoulder in an area 2 inches down from that large bone at the base of our neck and 2 or 3 inches to the right.  If left untreated, by Christmas I am crippled to the point of looking like I am 90 years old.   Like you, because of the arm pain, coupled with the numbness, twitching, and pain in my left leg from the inadequate back surgery, I imagined all kinds of diseases that I thought I had, MS, etc.  When I had the MRI, even though I called ahead of time to let them know that I could not lay flat on a hard surface without my right arm going numb and hurting beyond description, they attempted the procedure anyway without treating the pain.  Needless to say, I had to reschedule for a time when they could knock me out.  The results?  NEGATIVE!  All that was found was some arthritis in my neck.  So, I said to the doc.; \"How about we treat the arthritis?\"  He put me on a drug called Daypro and I swear that within two weeks I was pain free!  A problem that had dogged me for eight years was gone within 2 weeks of taking the Daypro.  I would do a TV commercial about that drug for free!  Now, I only need to take it when I feel an episode coming on. The only problem that I have now is the insurance company of course only wants to pay for the generic drug which is called Oxaprozin (may be a bit mispelled).  It absolutely does not work on me.  I have to get the doc. to insist on the script that I only get Daypro.  Best of Luck to You!\n\n",

    "content": "I've now had two physio therapy sessions.  I still have pain but it is very much reduced and manageable.  I am able to do certain things again, like sleeping on my side, sitting at the computer longer, biking etc...  The progress has been very gradual so I am unable to say that the physio is what has made me feel better.  It could be the physio or it could be just my body healing naturally.  Regardless I'll keep doing the physio because I am getting better at the same time.    Most of my pain is in my shoulder and elbow now and i've noticed some minor tingling (pins and needles), almost like a mild 'asleep' feeling in my thumb, index and middle fingers, which is relatively new, as well as the same old annoying muscle twtiching in my side and middle back below the scapula..  I believe the tingling points to the ulnar nerve if I am correct.  The physio therapist believes that there is some minor irritation of a nerve that branches out from the neck that wouldn't necessarily show up on an NCV that would explain the muscle twitching and pain. My spine also is locked in certain spots, it doesn't move fluidly and my neck/shoulder and back muscles are not very strong.  Anyways we are currently working on my neck, applying interferential current, ultrasound, laser and heat therapy.\n\n",

I don't have a clue to what this is, i know i have seen a chiropractor many times in 2006 for a herniated disc in my lower lumbar on the left side.

    "content": "Hello, It is hard to tell what is causing the pain in the elbow without examining it and see the xrays. It is good that you have an orthopedic referral.    Tendonitis in the elbow can occur without playing sports.  It can be caused by any repetitive motion including a variety of jobs.  Also new activities may cause the pain e.g. raking or snow shoveling....or gardening.   Depending on the location and specific diagnosis, a cortisone injection may help.  It is also important to consider infection in the elbow joint.  Signs and symptoms include pain, swelling, warmth, redness, loss of motion.  The ER docs should have picked up on this if there were an infection.  Take care and let us know how it goes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  About 5 days ago I had a slip and fall at work. Long story short, I hit shoulder first on the ground. The knee and ankle issues are no longer of concern. The following few days I had some inflammation in my neck and upper shoulder. As that has subsided, I have continued to have numbness down my arm and in my hand and a stabbing pain in in various locations in my shoulder, with occasional pains coming down the neck. I have had X-Rays which came back as negative for any damage in the shoulder. I have noticed, when walking, my injured arm doesn't swing naturally as does my other arm. The times when the pain is most noticeable is when it is in a stationary position, also a position such as opening my car door from a seated position (left arm), making a right turn on the steering wheel, or if I am carrying something with the arm by my side. All of the previous movements, and walking result in heightened tingling and numbness for a time. I am taking an anti-inflammatory and hydrocodone, and the medications haven't really resulted in less pain, but have made it feel more localized. Like I can pin point the location of it better. I have the impression that the doctor doesn't feel it's of concern, and based on some comments about \"not wanting to get laid off\" that he may doubt my claims. I am seeking some direction for what the potential problem may be, and any information I can use to better guide my physician. Any help would be appreciated!  Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Good afternoon,  I rolled my left ankle playing tennis 2 weeks ago.  It hurt, but  was able to walk off the court and it didn't swell up until a few hours later.  I have been able to walk on it with little to no pain since the day I rolled it.  It bruised, but that went away within a week.  The swelling in the top of my foot went away after about 7 days as well.  However, there is still swelling around my ankle bone.  I have complete range of motion in my ankle.  I can walk with no pain.  I can stand on one leg - on my hurt ankle - no pain.  I can run - no pain.  I can walk up and down stairs - no pain.  The only thing I feel is some tightness in it, but fairly minimal.  It appears to be a low grade ankle sprain, but I am worried that the swelling around my ankle bone has not gone down.  I have been using an arnica (homeopathic) gel on the injured ankle several times a day as well as soaking it a few times a day in epsom salts (just started that yesterday).  I also have begun doing some ankle excerises to build up my strength.  I have not been to the doctor because I assume that if it was a serious sprain - torn ligaments/tendons or a fracture there is no way I could move on it the way I am with absolutely no pain.  So, with that said, is it customary for the swelling around the bone to last several weeks - more than 2?  Any other thoughts or rehabilitation suggestions would be most appreciated.  Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, With a lower limb injury including sprained ankles, swelling is the last symptom to resolve. I recommend compression (e.g. neoprene ankle sleeve), ankle pumps, mini squats, heel cord stretching, ice and NSAIDS for most people.  Double check with your family physician before starting any medication.  Otherwise this ankle will most likely continue to improve over the next 2-4 weeks.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Team, I am 37 years old and injured my neck several months ago. I have tried Chiropractic care and pain relievers with no improving results. I recently had a MRI done and it showed that I have bulging discs in C6-C7 which are pinching a nerve, I also have bone spurs. I have had on steroid injection and it did loosen up my neck a little to allow me more movement with some releif of pain. I guess my question would be; will my pinched nerve go away or is this a temporary cure to where I would have to have injections indefinately? My pain management physician had mentioned that these injections will not shrink my bulging discs. Would surgery be my best option? This pinched nerve has inflicted a lot of pain in several areas, I have burning in my shoulder blades, neck pain, and pain that goes into my chest along with a few other areas.\n\n",

If the condition worsens or not improving especially with neurological problems then surgery may be the best option.   Steroid injections provide temporary relief especially when structural problems are causing the pain.  Discussing the pros and cons of neck surgery with your neurosurgeon would be a good next step.

    "content": "Hello, A thorough evaluation of your legs and low back are in order as well as a good history.   With problems like this, we look for any likely causes from your history.  For example, I saw a young women who developed bilateral foot and ankle swelling.  No history of cardiac or peripheral vascular problems. Turns out she has been vacationing on the beach (walking on the beach barefoot) for a week and because of the structure of her feet (high arches) and tight heel cords, she developed posterior tib tendonitis bilaterally causing ankle pain and swelling.  I say this to make the point that a good history may bring to light the cause.  This may be something simple as tendonitis or arthritis both of which would not show up on xray.  You may need to see a physical therapist who can take some time with you to perhaps find a cause and certainly help rehab the injury.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "I am female, 22, diagnosed with Hypertension (taking 10mg Ziac once per day for it), and a 4L-5L Spondylolisthesis (diagnosed after severe back pain when I was 15).  The Spondy has caused me a lot of back pain (for which I was seeing a chiropractor to my relief but can no longer afford), and I have noticed poor circulation in my legs and feet as well.  For at least several (maybe 7 or more) years, I have had very tender shins.  It isn't the muscle surrounding the bone but the actual bone itself - if I bang my shins against anything it causes intense pain enough to take my breath away, and I cannot stand for even a 10-pound cat to climb up onto my legs.  Someone lightly squeezing that area causes sharp and significant pain (less pressure than you would receive from a massage).  My husband noticed today that it seems like the \"knobbiness\" of my tibia was far more pronounced than it should be - not noticeable through the skin but it can be felt clearly, and I have always noticed that about my legs.    Also, I experience occasional pain with no pressure at all - laying in bed before sleeping sometimes they will hurt, although not nearly so bad as with contact.  I have no pains like this in my thighs, knees, ankles, feet, calves, even the tops of my legs closer down to my ankles.  I have had no luck finding any information on this and was wondering if someone could help me with at least a rough diagnosis.  This pain doesn't interfere with my everyday life but if it's something more serious I'd like to know, and I cannot find more information.  Thank you for your time and consideration.\n\n",

What interests me in this list and from your history of poor circulation in the legs is the possibility of popliteal artery entrapment or one of it's branches e.g anterior tibial artery.  This may cause bone pain from poor blood supply. It is worth considering doing an arterial doppler to check the arteries in the legs.   It may turn out to be nothing more than shin splints from flat feet but worthwhile seeing a physician for examination and appropriate testing.  Take care and let us know how it goes.\n\n",

In the last 8 monhts I have gained about 40 pounds. Normal weight for my frame is 150 I am now at 197 pounds. I am under my primary doctors care. Two years ago I was referred to a surgeon as my tests showed multiple buldging disks. he did give me the option for surgery but I weighed the pros and cons and decided not to go that route.  Over the last two months some very odd things have been going on. I woke up three weeks ago twice with a completely dead arm. hard to wake it up with my other arm as Icould not mnove it dead weight. At the same time it felt as if my feet and hands were constrantly feeling some numbness, but that decreased. Now for the past three months I have had hip pain, wrist pain and feet pain. I was tested for my thiroid, reumetoid arthritis, gout, all tests came back normal.   Now for the foot pain. If get up froma sitting position and am literally limping in pain, both feet but right foot is worse and pain in right is the worst. It gets better with waling but I still limp some and can feel pain whgen pushing and maneuvering it. It doesn't appear to be swollen and I don't recall injuring it. I do notice all symptoms, back feet hands greatly increase when I get up from sitting too long. But no matter how long i sit, even five miuntes, I limp when i get up. Thanks for eny help you can provide.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The pain that you describe sounds like a form of arthritis.  The bulging disc in the low back would not cause all the the multiple joint symptoms.   You may re test the rheumatoid factor and add anti-CCP for better sensitivity and specificity to see if rheumatoid arthritis is involved.  Also checking inflammatory markers like sed rate and CRP add information for diagnosis.  I usually add ANA in the rheumatology panel too as lupus can cause arthritic pain.  Xrays of the painful joints may help with diagnosis.  If normal, then you at least have a baseline radiograph in case the joints worsen over time.   Has any anti inflammatory medication help relieve symptoms? Take care and keep us updated on how things go.\n\n",

A shin bone routine is where you jog with ankle weights to create micro-fractures in them and you then weight them down while sitting on your bed for about 1-2 hours, this stretches the bone and you then go to sleep and wait for them to heal up. Most people can lengthen their shins up to 3 inches.  Will doing this routine lengthen my Achilles tendon along with the shin?

Elongating the achilles (if it were possible) may give some extra height to a vertical jump but not any speed to running.

    "title": "Displaced and underdeveloped Sternocleidomastoid muscle",
    "content": "Hello,  First of all because of the individual nature of my problem it was difficult to categorize it, so my apologies if this is not the right section to post at. Also, I'm lacking the knowledge of the actual medical terms for some of the things that are involved, but I'll try my best to explain. First, some history that leads to my current state:  Soon after my birth I've been diagnosed with Torticollis on the left side. I'm not aware of the procedures that took place at the time as all medical records of that have been lost, but in my parents memory there wasn't any physical therapy applied. Soon after I aged 2 years a surgeon's advice was listened to - to have the problem corrected surgically. I have no information of what was done to it, but apparently it only did damage as later when I was 7 years old another surgeon (who my parents led me to because the position of my head was still not straight up) said there's need to do another surgical intervention. No record of that exists either, but since I have memory of the time and I can see evidence of the intervention even now, I know they've treated both the base of the left hand side of the neck and also the muscle area that is right under the left ear.  My head's position has been fixed with the latter and for about 10 years I didn't have any noticeable problems, except the numb feeling under and at my left ear (damaged nerves I assume) and the underdevelopment of my left Sternocleidomastoid muscle in comparison to the right one. Generally I was a very skinny person with not much muscle mass so there was not much stress exercised at my upper body in those years. That was until I started doing some bodybuilding in my 18s and then joined the army when I was 19.  Of course there was a lot of physical stress and constant exercising there, so my muscles reacted quickly. It was then that I noticed that while my right side of the neck is starting to develop further in both elasticity, strength and muscle mass, the left side was as if being pulled inward, stiff and shorter. The side effect was that my left shoulder, in mine and my body's attempt to keep a straight pose, would go up and forward a bit to compensate for that difference. I felt quite a discomfort from that so I began wondering what's causing it and also seek medical advice from different hospitals. Unfortunately nobody was noticing that something was wrong and on the outside I suppose the difference was too small to notice.  Since then a lot of events cascaded over time. It didn't take me long to discover that my left Sternocleidomastoid muscle was twisted and displaced in such way that it went somewhere behind the right Clavicle (I can easily trace it with my finger), so I realized that any physical exercise or effort was putting unequal pressure over the whole area on the left side in comparison to the right side. Because of the necessity of doing physical work (in my job at the time) the differences from the normally developed right side and the displaced and underdeveloped left side of my neck muscles began to cause overall lack of balance as the left shoulder along with the Clavicle and the shoulder blade moved their position to compensate.  The first side effect of the disturbed balance appeared as continually growing deformation angle under my knees as the weight of my body was not being distributed evenly over my legs. Then I noticed a rotation in the left side of my chest due to the left arm and shoulder tendency to return to their normal position (partially a conscious effort I suppose) all the time yet being limited and pulled in and forward by the problematic neck muscle thus restricting their range of movement. Of course all that happened over the span of a few years and was very difficult to monitor and notice, let alone explain to doctors who just couldn't see it.  I have went through various physical therapy programs during those years under the advice of some doctors, but since the neck muscle was not attached properly the difference always remained in the end. As time passed my right hand side really began doing part of the work of the left side while the latter kept becoming more and more underdeveloped.  All of that didn't come without effects on the spine. It both became bent and twisted to the right thus enforcing the process of increasing the disbalance. It sort of became like a closed circle at one point, with each area adding to the overall damage.  To save time, I'll skip to present days and my current state - nearly completely disfunctional left side neck muscles, both front and rear, left Clavical severely turned inward and forward onto the chest wall, along with the shoulder and arm, size and elasticity of pectoral and shoulder muscles reduced, left half of my chest tilted backwards, doing no function, very small in size, my pelvis rotated to follow all twist that with the left leg pelvis joint at an angle up and left and the bone running from the knee down bent at quite a noticeable angle to support the shifted weight. At the same time the right hand side being forced to take on the work and weight of the left side is beyond normal size, muscles very elastic and strong but also stressed all the time, the size of the right half of the chest almost completely taking up the whole chest size and doing all the breathing processes, my right leg just about supporting the majority of the weight, with its pelvis joint tucked in and behind the pelvis. The spine is twisted around itself, to the right and bent forward at its base and the pelvis pushed at an angle (it's what keeps the legs in their abnormal position).  It's quite a cascading effect of forces being applied to different parts of the body as a compensation or result of the asymmetry at the neck and the differences in muscles development and weight distribution. When I apply conscious effort to straighten up all that I can see how most problems disappear (except the permanent deformations in the bones like under my left knee and the chest) but the neck remains as it is due to the disfunction left Sternocleidomastoid muscle.  I don't see how any physical therapy can help correct this to a point that it would cause the opposite order of events to occur as to correct all those issues, unless the neck muscle position (if not size and functionality) is corrected first. The problem is I have totally no idea what kind of help to look for as I have gone through many doctors and nobody was able to give an advice or help, and many say it's not possible to treat it surgically at all. I strongly believe that if the neck muscle functionality and position (and thus the left clavicle position along with the shoulder and arm) is restored, at least partially, the rest is largely reversible through physical therapy alone.  I would appreciate any advice and expert opinion on this because it's totally ruining my life at the moment and it keeps worsening day by day. Especially during my sleep when I have no control over my position the disbalance just takes place completely and the bending and twisting are just reinforced on its own by natural forces. I wish I could have explained it in shorter manner, but it's very difficult without actually being able to show it visually.\n\n",

It is had to imagine the SCOM starting behind the left ear and attaching to the right clavicle.  This would cause problems with the trachea and esophagus.   Exercise may not correct all the deformities but may prevent further deformity.   Surgically, I would think an orthopedist would at least consider reattaching the SCOM to a better place on the left clavicle - the problem is the risk of damaging vital neurovascular structures proximal to SCOM.   An MRI may be needed to define the anatomy before any surgical considerations. Let us know how it goes and if we can answer any further questions.\n\n",

    "title": "Right knee pain after car accident",
    "content": "I was in a car accident two months ago, only going about 30-35 mph. No serious bumps or bruises except my right knee, which hit under side of dashboard. There was some pretty serious bruising, at one point covering the entire top half of my knee and lasting 6 weeks. At the time of the accident, it was obviously very sore. There was also some sensitivity when you touched it, particularly in the soft spot in the middle of the knee, between the bone and toward the inside of my leg. It felt like the skin had been rubbed raw and stung/tingled when you touched it. I had trouble bending the knee for a couple of days due to the swelling and associated pain. However, I didn't think it was anything more than bruising.  Now that the bruise has gone away, though, I'm still having pain. It is sore to the touch, and I can't put pressure on the knee (such as kneeling down) without it hurting. If I touch my knee in the right place, or if it even lightly bumps anything, I experience tingling and stinging, again in that soft spot between the bone on the inside of my leg. The tingling and stinging can persist 5-10 minutes.  When I've compared knees, it feels like the topmost bone on the right knee (the one that hit the dash) is a little bit softer than the other. My boyfriend did the same and said my right knee feels \"mushy.\" I'm not sure if this is just because I'm moving to a funny angle when anyone touches it, or if this might mean something.   Just kind of curious is this is normal relating to bruising and if it will get better on its own, or if it's something I should have checked out. Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Yes, you should have the knee and knee cap checked out.  X-rays are important to look for fractures especially in the patella since this bone probably hit the dash. If no fracture, then the retinaculum from the medical quadriceps may have been damaged.  If the knee cap is unstable and pops out of place the tissue supporting the knee cap may need to be repaired surgically...not likely though from the sound of your description. Let us know how it turns out.\n\n",

The pain is in a small area that hasn't changed, right at the end of my \"butt crack.\"  I am not even totally sure this is where your tailbone ends, however, it is still slightly swollen and a bit bruised.  It hurts laying down, but I am fine sitting up and leaning forward, but not leaning back.  I have iced it, but it hasn't seemed to help.  Any ideas if these are symptoms for a broken tailbone, or possibly something else?  Any suggestions to treat it, I am a broke college student and can't afford the co-pay, or to go to the clinic on campus, so a doctor visit is out of the question until the next pay check.

    "content": "Hello, The tailbone can be palpated easily.  If it is fractured, you will experience great pain with palpation.  The area of your pain is near the tailbone but may be a bit higher up toward the sacrum.  Without trauma, I would doubt any fracture.    Sometimes a cyst develops in this area and is very painful.  The skin itself will be tender with some redness.    Regardless of the cause, you may try some moist heat on the area with analgesics (acetaminophen or ibuprofen) for a few days to see it will resolve.  Otherwise, a trip to your physician will be in order.  All the best to you.\n\n",

    "content": "I was diagnosed with bursitis in my right leg and given a corisone shot in October. The Orthopedic doctor then sent me to physical therapy where I was given excercises and some kind of deep electric therapy on my upper leg.  I did this for 3 weeks, twice a week.  In December, I found that I was extremly bruised in that spot, and the area was painful, swollen and rashed.  In a weeks time, I saw my primary MD, Urgent care, Emergency room and my Dermatologist, who took a biopsy of the area and sent to Oregon Health and Science Institute.  I then had an MRI and X rays.  Nothing shows, but it is still discolored and extremely sore.  I can't sleep on that side. When I had the deep therapy at the physical therapy, the  head therapist there had to show the assistant how to use the machine.  I am wondering if there could be some kind of deep burn area there and she did not use the machine correctly.   I am about to give up on ever feeling good again or being able to do the things I used to do before this problem.  I am in otherwise good health. Thanks,\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, This sounds like you were treated for trochanteric bursitis.  The deep electrical machine in physical therapy was probably an ultrasound machine.   Did they put a gel on the skin and rub an flat applicator (hand held device) over the area for 5-10 minutes? If it was an ultrasound machine, yes it can cause tissue damage if not used properly.  You should discuss this with the physical therapist who treated you. Another concern with pain, swelling, and discoloration is localized infection.   Risks with cortisone injections include infection, discoloration of the skin (increased or decreased), pain, redness and swelling.  Sometimes a steroid flare occurs with the onset of redness and swelling however this resolves in 24 - 48 hours. Hope this gives you some direction.  Keep us posted.\n\n",

    "content": "Hey doc             I was just wondering if it is possible to have a partially dislocated shoulder. The reason i ask is because i have a little discomfort in my right shoulder, when i raise my right arm it feels as if it could pop out of place at any moment, and i even see a slight bone popping out in the back of my shoulder. it doesn't hurt at all though, just a little discomfort. I first noticed this discomfort after i woke up one night, i turn a lot in my sleep so i am thinking that i may have injured it in my sleep (awkward huh?) Do you have any idea what this might be? and if so Do you know what can correct this?

    "content": "Hello, Without examining the shoulder it is hard to tell if the joint is loose.  Anterior dislocations are more common than posterior dislocation; either way trauma is the most common mechanism.  Turning during sleep would not qualify as trauma unless of course you're playing ball or wrestling \"Andrae the Giant\" in your dreams.  All kidding aside, the bone sticking out is probably the scapula and not the humerus.  This may be the result of weakness in the upper back muscles or may simply be just the way you are made.  Checking the opposite shoulder for comparison is important. Best bet if this is bothersome is to have your family physician evaluate the shoulder. Take care.\n\n",

I went to the groud and for a few minutes had a slight numbing sensation down my shin. I stood up, could put weight on my leg, but the knee was unstable and I could not straighted in it 100%. I have been doing the RICE treatment sicne then. It has now been 2 days and I have no pain, but alot of pressure. I can walk on it, but it feels unstable and I just can't bend it all the way or straighten it all the way. I don't really have \"Pain\" at all, which is weird. There is some swelling and fluid build up as well. I am wearing a knee brace with side support and it helps tremendously. I am just concerned as to what happened. It soulds like a strain or sprain to my LCL, but I am not sure and want to know if I need to get an MRI? I have a huge deductable to meet and just got laid off so I sure don't want to waste money if I don't need to. I am very active and work out at the gym at least 3-4 days a week. I didn't get hit or fall on the knee, just distributed weight on it. (I could have leaned a bit to the left causing my leg to bow out when this happened). If you have any advice for me, it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, You certainly may have strained or sprained the lateral collateral ligament and the loss of range of motion is due to swelling.  Of other concern is the lateral meniscus.   The goal at this point is to reduce the swelling and regain range of motion over the next 2-3 weeks.   Bracing the knee is important since it feels unstable.   If the unstable feeling persists despite range of motion exercise, bracing, and controlling the swelling, then you will need an MRI. Take care and let us know how it goes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, This sounds like inflammation of the heel where the plantar fascia attaches to the calcaneus.  You may call this plantar fasciitis.  Treatment for plantar fasciitis: 1. anti inflammatory medication 2. In the morning, before you put weight on the foot, apply a moist heating pad for 20 minutes. Afterwards place a rolling pin on the floor and roll the foot over the pin back and forth for 5-10minutes.  This massages the tendon on the bottom of the foot and promotes circulation.  Do this every morning for 7-10 days. 3.  The heal may also benefit from a steroid injection if #1 and #2 do not help or do not help enough.  The injection should be given with a lateral heel approach directing the needle toward the source of pain.  Some physician insert the needle directly through the bottom of the heel.  This approach is too painful for most folks.  4.  Night splints help with chronic plantar fasciitis.  They place a prolonged stretch on the tendon. 5. Some people require orthotics (molded shoe inserts).  If all else fails consult a podiatrist or see a physical therapist.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I do not think the PIN is the culprit.  First, PIN is injured with trauma to the elbow or distal humerus.  The bicep repair on your shoulder was done proximally rather than distally.  Furthermore, the PIN innervates the wrist extensors muscles and not the thumb. The median nerve is responsible for the thumb.  So I would consider carpal tunnel problems before looking at the shoulder. Also, an EMG and nerve conduction velocity test would help with diagnosis.

    "content": "Hello, You can do a test at home called the Phalen's Test to check for carpal tunnel problems.  Simply place the back of the hands together with fingers pointing toward the floor and bring hands toward chest.  Hold for 30 seconds.  If this position reproduces the symptoms, it is carpal tunnel. Otherwise, the condition is probably coming from the neck and may be related to your work posture.  In this case, do posture exercises and correct the ergonomics at work. Lastly, for accurate diagnosis see your family physician. Let us know how it goes and if we can answer any further questions.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: left shoulder and arm pains",
    "content": "Hello, Thanks for writing in. You know at first, I thought this might be a cervical spine problem and it still may be.  But a cortisone shot in the shoulder area would not relieve symptoms if they stemmed from the neck...but the neurological signs sounds a like lower cervical problems or perhaps ulnar nerve entrapment in the elbow.  However the EMG was negative. So back and forth we go...maybe this or maybe that.  There is another consideration: thoracic outlet syndrome.  This is where the nerves and blood vessels leaving the neck and entering the arm become compressed causing pain, numbness and tingling.  Often this occurs in overweight women or in women with an aberrant first rib development.  Your physician can do the Adson and Allen test in the office to help diagnose.  May have to review them online as the tests are not commonly done.  It is also important to check your posture and the muscle length/strength relationship in the shoulder; in other words are the shoulders too rounded with tight anterior structures and weakened elongated posterior shoulder and scapular muscles.  This might lead to shoulder, neck, and arm symptoms  Lastly, an MRI of the cervical spine may be in order to may sure the nerves in the neck are not involved.  All the best to you and let us know how it goes.\n\n",

    "content": "Basically about 5 weeks ago i was playing tackle football and i was airborn vertically when a buddy came in full speed and lowered his shoulder right into my lower/outside butt cheak. I shook off the pain figuring it was just brused and continued to try to run full speed, thus possibly irrritating my hamstring more? My bottom felt seriously brused for about a week and a half. About 2 weeks after the injury I agrivated it at work by lifting a heavy object. And now it's irritating to sit down. So now it feels more like a pulled mussle and it seems to just be getting worse day by day. Unfortunatly i just started a new job installing floors wich requires me to bend over all day long and i don't have insurance yet or the money to pay for x-rays at this time. So I'm curious if theres a typical way to rehab an injury as such without having to take time off work?  It's a constant irritation! please help!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, This is an interesting injury.  In football and sometimes in basketball, players get hit hard in the thigh and suffer a deep thigh bruise.  In your case, this sounds like a deep gluteus muscle bruise.   Since this occurred two weeks ago, start with heating pad 20 minutes on and then stretch the gluteal area.  Check the web for \"gluteal stretch\" or \"piriformis stretch\".  To strengthen the muscle do deep squats.  Of course, use caution not to aggravate the area.  If it seems to flare up with pain, use ice packs and NSAIDS (eg ibuprofen). Perhaps the best exercise is walking... or swimming. Avoid deep massage as this might aggravate the tissue. Let us know how it goes and if you have further questions. Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Doctors,   I am a 32 year old female.   I have a history of back problems (slight scoliosis, Tarlov Cysts, syrnix).  Other than that I am healthy and on no current medications.  (I can't take meds, the side effects are worse than any relief that I get.)  Here's my story...   I have had some pain in my right knee for awhile now, but nothing major.   I remember back when I was a teenager I went sledding, went off a ramp and landed with my leg under the sled. For a couple of weeks I couldn't bend or straighten my leg all the way.   When I walk it feels like there is something inside and moving around in my knee closest to the other knee.   There are times when I squat down and try to get up my knee \"locks\". It takes a moment to \"unlock\" it.   I have had clicking, grinding, and popping in my knee as long as I can remember.   There are times when it will give out, as if someone is pushing it from behind.   Now, the new one is... when I am doing the flutter kick in swimming I also feel like something is in my knee (on the side closest to my other knee). And it hurts just to the left of the knee cap (side closest to my other knee). I don't notice any swelling. There is no brusing.   I don't know if any of these symptoms are related.   Any idea on what is going on with my knee?   Thanks!\n\n",

You know...this sounds like a meniscus problem and possibly a torn medial meniscus with plica (a fold of tissue near the inside part of the knee cap that sometimes becomes irritated) involvment.

    "title": "Re: ankle pain thats got to much!!! 15 months ive had it :(",
    "content": "Thanks for posting your case. Thanks for the picture too. It appears the pain is located in the ankle joint itself more anterior (front) and lateral (to the outside) where the ankle bends or flexes.   You say that orthotics helped but still get some pain. I suppose that you are a runner.  Before the pain started how many miles did you run per week? And was there any increase in mileage?  In other words, was this an injury related to running? Also, have you had any xrays or MRI done? Also, what type of foot do you have - is it rigid with a high arch or is it very flat with very little arch? Was the orthotic made by a professional or bought at the store?  The pain with calf stretch makes sense.  It would be better to do the calf stretch without weight on the foot to take pressure off the anterior cartiledge of the talus.  Structurely speaking, the anterior lateral talus may have a bone bruise from repetitive trauma of running.   Did the physio therapist assess the stability of the ankle?  Are the ligaments snug and not loose. With the morning stiffness in the ankle, the problem is likely to be in the ankle joint itself.   The solution is not easy.  Rest, acetominophen or ibuprofen, gentle stretching and strengthening.  The hard part will be returning to running as this will probably aggravate the injury.  Try pool running first to take weight off the ankle and progress slowly to land.  Some gyms have an apparatus / harness which you can strap yourself into in order to take weight off the feet and do walking or running.    Give me a bit more info... may have a few more ideas.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for replying ..I don\u2019t know if I miss wrote something but the pain is in the inside... I did run but the pain was before I started and just saw it as morning stiffness when I did start running. I could run through the pain, it would go after a while. I used to play a lot of football and paintballing so was very active, but don\u2019t no more due to this injury stopping me. And I haven\u2019t had and x-rays or MRI scans I got the orthotics made to suit me... They moulded my foot... Also my foot before the injury used to roll in... The orthotics though have prevented this and the angle they sit at is at an average now...Could the pain and throbbing be due to me coming back to normal alignment and its getting used to it.?????  I don\u2019t know about the ligaments whether there snug or loose..? And when I did the stretch (soleus,with knee bent) the other day It seemed as though my soleus is so flexible that I cant stretch it anymore and the only thing preventing me go further is my bone( could this then be causing the pain) \u2022\tMy arch is seems to be okay when standing but rolls in when walking. From knowing what you know at the moment about my ankle, do you reckon it could be better within...? \u2022\t2months??? \u2022\t3months???? \u2022\t4months?? \u2022\tOr 4+   Cheers....\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I understand now that the symptoms are on the inside (medial) part of the foot.  Makes sense.  Regarding the soleus stretch, with your kind of foot (tends to roll in), the soleus may be overstretched and indeed the stopping point then becomes bone on bone.  Instead focus the exercise on strengthening the soleus thus shortening it a bit.  Heel raises in weight bearing (standing) or toe presses against resistance will strengthen gastroc-soleus.    It is also important to strengthening the ankle inverters (muscle that turn the foot in).  Lastly, proprioceptive training is vital.  Exercise such as standing on one foot with eyes closed or sitting on exercise ball supported by only one foot on the ground (eyes open and eyes closed - but don't fall!).  Keep me posted on your progress.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The rehab exercises should not cause sharp pain.  Mild achiness for 24 hours is expected but not sharp pain or any increase in swelling.    Any running or hopping or jumping may aggravate the ankle until the foot is properly conditioned.  If brisk walking for 30-40 minutes is painless and no swelling then progress to jogging.  For your type of foot sprinting may be better tolerated than jogging.  With sprinting, the foot is positioned more on the toes/forefoot during weight bearing so less of a chance to roll inward.    Keep us posted.\n\n",

If it were my ankle, I might continue the running on flat surface, continue orthotic use, continue warm up and stretching, and continue cross trainging - bike and swim- and see how it goes. May ice afterward.  If all continues to go well, slowly increase distance but only at 10% increase per week.   Keep us posted.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  Now that  we know the cartilege is separated in one  place and torn in another,  PT would likely be less than a good idea for now. It won't help the tear to heal. In fact, what likely will help is either immobilization (via an elastic brace or soft cast) or, quite possibly, minimally-invasive surgery to repair the major tear, followed by immobilization while it heals. However, it is conceivable proper immobilization might  allow it to heal. Whether it would heal properly or not would depend.   This is important, because as long as it's being used and even pushed beyond its normal limits,  it's not likely to heal, let alone properly, and pain and even disability could result from this in time.  Please have the ortho eval and I'm  betting you'll at least come away with a brace for a while,  which could, with luck, be all you'll need.  I hope this is helfpul to you. Good luck with this. Please follow up with us as needed, and for sure update us after you've seen the ortho doctor.\n\n",

    "content": "Back in May 2008, I fell in the shower and injured both my left and right wrist. I fell on my outstretched hands. I got soap in my eyes and as I tried to turn around I slipped while I had both hands on the wall. My right one in back of me and my left on the side of me and as I fell, both hands went all the way down until I reached the tub surround.  I got left wrist surgery to repair the damaged ligaments on Dec. 17, 2008, but my right wrist is still painful and it clicks too and that is painful.  It has been a while and I don't know why it is still sore.  I didn't have it looked at because I wanted to get my left wrist taken care of first.  I probably should have had them both looked at the same time.  Can this be just a sprain or is it something more serious?  The fact that it is still painful and it clicks and is painful when it clicks worries me that it might be more than a just a sprain.  This was because when I got surgery on my ankle in April, a few weeks later, I tried to take a shower and not put alot of weight on my ankle and that is how I fell. As I turned around I slipped   Any advice will be appreciated. Thanks in advance!  Cassie\n\n",

There is alot of pain and clicking when I move my wrist around and I injured that back in May.  Do you think the reason why it is clicking is because there maybe a torn ligament or something?

    "content": "Hello, Clicking in the wrist can be caused by tendons rubbing over bone, if the tendon is inflamed then clicking will produce pain.  Also, clicking can be caused by loose joints - perhaps secondary to a sprain or damage to the joint - pain is elicited from inflamed tissue in and around the joint or from normal tissue being pinched or overstretched.   Clicking with pain is a concerning symptom and should be evaluated.  In the meantime, immobilize the joint with a splint or an ACE wrap and avoid painful movements.  Hope this helps.

    "content": "Hello, Thanks for writing in.  This could be tendonitis, overuse syndrome, acute arthritis, flare-up of old stress fracture.  There are several factors to consider regarding the wrist pain.  First, consider taking an xray of the wrist to rule out stress fracture and to get a inside view of the joints and joint spaces.  Second, consider asking your physician to examine the wrist.  He can test range of motion, palpate tendons, and assess for infection.  Third, consider a wrist brace, hot or cold pack and NSAIDS to relieve pain.  Fourth, if pain continues, ask for a referral to see an occupational therapist.  Generally, they do a good job at rehabilitating hand dysfunction.  Take care and keep us posted.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi.  I'm a 32 year old, very petite female ( 5 feet tall, 85 lbs).  Generally healthy.  I have Raynauds and vulvar vestibulitis.  Only medication is topical Gabapentin for the Vestibulitis.  For many many years now I have had periods of joint pain and muscle pain in my neck and shoulders, particularly, but also in my hips and knees.  I know of no cause.  Although I was hit by a car when I was 12 I don't know if that has any relevance.  It has been getting worse these last few years and, since about 2002, I have had major muscle spasms in my neck when i raise my left arm above my head and exert any effort (for example, I can't hug someone taller than I am without a muscle spasm that causes a severe headache.  Sometimes it even happens when putting on or taking off a shirt).  My left shoulder is painful and grinds and cracks/pops when I move it.  It sounds like the click is in my collar bone, though. My right shoulder doesn't do this.  I am having trouble sleeping and wake up in a lot of pain with my neck and head every morning.  I bought a new bed hoping it would help but it hasn't.  A few years ago (2005) I had a really bad episode of joint pain (left jaw, shoulder, hip and knee all at once!)  so I went to a walk in clinic and was tested for something called RA factor, I think.  Everything came back fine and eventually the pain died down on it;s own.  When these things happen, it feels like bone on bone but it doesn't feel swollen and I don't see any sign of swelling.  Do you have any idea what could be causing this?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Thanks for writing in.  At 5 ft 85lbs, you have a small frame and probably not much bulk in the shoulders and neck.    The problem with chronic shoulder and neck pain is weakness can develop.  Weakness then can lead to more pain..and so on.  A physical exam and history would be in order to rule out any neurological problem in the neck.  A testing of reflexes, sensation, muscle strength and special neck test should be done to screen and rule out nerve involvement in the neck.    You may also consider a neck xray to rule out bony spurs and abnormal curvature and dislocation of the spine - the general term would be spondylosis (abnormal formation of the spine).    Next step would be some physical therapy to condition the muscles and joints.  This may take some time and certainly would involve exercises at home.  Also, your family physician can recommend appropriate analgesics.  As to the exact cause of your pain, it is hard to tell without an exam, history, and proper imaging tests.  And, a clinician's hands are valuable tools when assessing conditions like yours.    Let us know how it goes.\n\n",

    "content": "If your knees hurt when climbing stairs, there is likely some underlying condition there more related to the knee joints or connective tissues surrounding the knees. I would think it highly unlikely that it has anything to do with any of the female problems going on.   I don' t believe it is an age related issue.    So, yes, I suppose that if the stairs are aggravating the condition and causing pain, then stairs could cause some further damage in the long run.  Please be sure to check with your doctor on this issue.  You may need some tests run such as some blood tests or x-rays to find out what is going on.  Stiffness is typical in diseases such as arthritis (many different types) and some other diseases such as fibromyalgia.  I am not diagnosing here by any means.  However, it is likey not due to an injury because both knees are affected.    Try to keep the stair climbing to a minimum if possible until you get some testing to find out what the cause is.

    "content": "Hello,  Morning stiffness can be a sign of arthritis.  Weight bearing joints like the hips and knees are prone to osteoarthritis.    It is important to maintain range of motion and strength in the legs and continue activity as tolerated.  Low impact activities like walking, swimming, and cycling are best.    If stairs are a must to maintain the activities of daily living, by all means continue.  Unless you bound up and down the steps two at a time several times a day, it is doubtful much damage will occur.    There was a study done recently on older individual runners to see if the repetitive pounding of regular jogging increased the incidence of osteoarthritis.  The results were inconclusive.    So, common sense is the key to exercise and activity.  If it hurts avoid it; if no pain or swelling then continue as a gradual easy pace.  Also, double check with your family physician before starting any exercise program.  Take care and keep us posted.\n\n",

    "content": "Greetings, I'll start with a brief history. Have had left leg fasiculations for 20+ yrs now due to compressed nerve in my spine. In 1985 had 4 compartment release on left calf. Been fine for 20 yrs now. 6 months ago started to have left ankle pain (like having a sprained ankle constantly). Don't recall ever injuring it. Saw Orthopedic on Aug. 7th 2008. Had Xrays, MRI and Bone Scan that clearly showed a lesion (Osteochondritis Dissecans). Has arthoscopy done this past Sept. Am now 3 months post scope and still have constant aching pain (it never goes away). I mentioned before the scope that the pain was lateral behind ankle bone but was told I shouldn't have pain there because that's not near where the lesion is. No harm done and fully respect Dr. since lesion was clearly shown and had to be cleaned anyway. My dilema now is this. Is it possible that the lesion was noticed but wasn't the source of original pain to begin with and something is being missed? I'm scheduled for a cortisone shot next week as a last ditch effort to get rid of pain. Would I be offending to the Dr. for me to ask him to take another quick look at my MRI since they have it readily available and only need to pull it up on the computer? After much research myself and at a loss as to why I still have chronic ankle pain, I have found my symptoms to be very much in line with a Peroneal Tendon problem. Pain is a constant ache even more so at rest and is located laterally behind ankle bone. Does this make sense? Any input would be appreciated much! Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Was the lesion on the talus?  If so which part?  The talus extends from the posterior aspect of the distal fibula (\"ankle bone\") forward to the mid foot.  In fact, two of the three main lateral ligaments which support the ankle attach to the talus (one in front and one in rear).  The peroneus tendons run over top of these lateral ligaments and could be a source of pain.  If so, then cortisone injection should help.   Also, it is not unusual to have a different loci of pain relative to a bony lesion.   Keep us posted.\n\n",

I still have constant deep dull aching pain. Worse so when I first get up in the morning, I have a hard time even walking for the first half hour or so. I'm hoping to get another MRI done next.

    "content": "Hello, Thanks for your responses. Just giving you an update. I had another MRI on my ankle this past week (first one since the scope). Followup today and am told the lesion is still there. Apparantly it was too deep or difficult to get to with the scope. The Dr. had told me prior to the scope that \"I can try the scope but may have to break your ankle to get in there\" so my expectations weren't very high going into the scope anyway. Not sure what Dr. said today, all I really caught was \"don't know if it can be fixed because it's risky\". Have you ever heard of having to break bones to get to a lesion. In a way I'm at least a bit relieved that something showed up on the MRI because it at least explains why I still have pain but I sure hope I'm not stuck with this thing because all it does is ache constantly. Now I'm being referred to another Orthopedic ankle specialist in Boston. Have first appt in mid March. Thank you\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, since I was able to get an appt. sooner than March 19th with a new Orthopedic I was able to obtain my MRI to provide to them on my first visit. Here is most of it: \"Osteochondral lesion involving the medial aspect of the talar dome. It is characterized by approx. 8 mm wide bony defect containing approx. 5 mm long probable bony fragment surrounded by a thin rim of T2 hyperintensity. This is consistant with an in situ fragment. The overlying cartilage is thinned. Deeper within the talus adjacent to the osteochondral defect are regions of moderate bone marrow edema and scattered cystic change. Compared to an MRI I had in June it has slightly increased in size.\"  From my own research I think I may be now looking at an open reduction with allograft. Will know more when I have my first appt. in a few days. Any thoughts on the open reduction/allograft since arthoscopy had failed? I will keep you updated. Thanks for all of your help!\n\n",

    "title": "Knee Cracking",
    "content": "I have a quick question about knee cracking. For many years whenever I bend down, and often when I straighten my knees they crack. I understand that this is normal if it isn't accompanied by any pain or negative symptoms (occasionally there is discomfort but it lasts for a second or two and is the same type of feeling that is often felt with finger cracking, though it's more frequent).  Eventually I started intentionally cracking my knees because I enjoyed the feeling, even when it hurts I actually find it enjoyable. The way I induce it is by planting my foot on the floor and twisting my body back and forth until a pop is heard and felt.  I'm just wondering if I can expect any truly negative results from this with regards to soft tissue damage or issues with my knee joints. My knees aren't more likely to pop out when engaging in sports or the like?  I'm guessing no but I felt it was worth asking because my knees oddly enough are quite important to me.  Also, if I'm asking about my knees, I might as well ask about my back.  In the last few months I've developed a habit of cracking my back and neck over and over repeatedly throughout the day. I don't just mean occasionally I mean ever 30 seconds to a minute.  When I really overdo this I do feel quite a bit of discomfort (a clear sign), but for the most part I don't overdo it to much.   Is this likely to lead to any issues with my back?   If the answer is yes I doubt I would have any problem at all breaking the habit.  I wouldn't still crack my knuckles if I didn't understand that it isn't bad for the joints, and isn't too too bad for the tissues. (I think)  Thanks for taking to time to read this.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Thanks for writing in.  Your question is about the detrimental impact of repetitive cracking of joints (knees, neck, back).  For the most part, cracking joints will not cause damage however (there's always a however), the manuever of planting the foot and twisting can cause some meniscal and cartilage damage over time.    The neck and back vertebrae are often cracked (self induced or by chiroprators).  I have not read of any detrimental long terms effects of this on a healthy spine.    The frequencey of popping your neck however is too much.  Although I have no research in front of me, I can not help to believe this is not good for your spine especially considering there is pain after the crack.  Keep us posted.  ps.  Your comment \"Also, if I'm asking about my knees, I might as well ask about my back\" reminds me of the enjoyable children books - If You Give a Moose a Muffin or If You Give a Mouse a Cookie.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Approximately two years ago I woke up one morning and could barely move due to pain in my left buttox (rated a 9). With motrin and help I was able to get to a DR which diagnosed it as a strained muscle and gave me Naproxen. Over the next several weeks the pain subsided and went away. Until just recently the pain would come and go, mildly, and motrin would help. As of late, 3-4 months, the pain has been almost daily and moved from the buttox to the front of the hip down into the inner thigh. It is not painful to the touch or noticeably swollen. I have had xrays and an mri which all came back normal, except for my left hip facing out slitely more than normal which was accreditted to a birth defect and no cause for pain. My Dr prescribed me flexiril, which did not help, and I am now on Tramadol and etodolac. These help manage the pain but it is not subsiding. It has begun to be painful to walk, and when i do my left leg and foot are angled outward more than normal. I also have had over the past couple of years lower back pain in the mornings when i wake up which goes away after I'm up and about. Your help is appreciated and sorry for the long post.\n\n",

My knee feels \"awkward\". the bone pops when I bend it. When I move it or put pressure (stand on it) on it, I don't feel pain, but a sharp discomfort. It's difficult to explain.  I usually try my best to just shake it out and try to realign the joints together. I have succeeded, before, while in other times, it just somehow goes away after a while.   I just wanted to know if there was a reason for this and if there was a good treatment for it. Thanks\n\n",

The weird noises and discomforts may be occurring from an internal knee joint problem (eg a meniscus tear, a ligament tear, or torn cartilage) or from a sloppy or loose knee cap or simply from arthritis or tendonitis.

In Jan 09 I went and saw my primary care physician regarding my hand swelling and they advised me that they don't know what is wrong and referred me to a orthopedic doctor. I had the appointment with the orthopedic Dr and they ran blood work for RA and all the tests came back negative. They now want me to go see a rheumatologist which isnt til late march 09. During all of this time my urine has also been a darker yellow than it normally is. My right arm today has started feeling heavy and the best I can explain it as numb. I am just getting frustrated because I have a 4 year old with diabetes and I don't have time for all this \"Well we don't know but we don't care enough to figure it out\" from my doctors. All I want is an answer as to what I need to do to take care of my body and have this all fixed.   Can anyone please assist.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Left hand swelling and numbness in full right arm",
    "content": "Hello, Thanks for writing in.  You have reported: over the past two months left hand swelling, darkening yellow urine, and heaviness in right arm.  RA workup was negative (labs should include rheumatoid factor, anti-CCP, CBC, sed rate, and CRP).    Causes of darkening urine include increases concentration of urine (e.g. loss of fluids), bilirubin or myoglobin in the urine.  A urine analysis will reveal these.   One of the causes of myoglobin in the urine is a condition called polymyositis.  Criteria for diagnosis includes proximal muscle weakness (shoulders, trunk), arthralgias, elevated CPK (blood test), elevated inflamatory markers (sed rate and CRP), muscle pain, and EMG changes.    It may be worthwhile to have an EMG done, some muscle enzyme tests, and specific anti body tests to add to the RA workup to formulate a working diagnosis and appropriate management.    And of course your symptoms could be as simple as a bit of arthritis in the left hand, some numbness in the right arm from overcompensating and the urine is darker from decrease hydration.  Hope this helps and keep us posted.\n\n",

    "content": "OK. My wife, child, and I were in a friends car (Friend was driving) after picking me up from work and on our way home. Over half way there a van strikes us from behind. The driver and child on the left side of the car was fine. The trunk caved in and split the seat I was in, it did a number on my back and hit my head a few times but, I suffered with Sciatic nerve pain for three months and got better after 6 months of over walking/moving, and lots of resting. However. My wife (who was front passenger) turned slightly back instinctively looking at our daughter to make sure she was not getting harmed in the middle of the slam. Over the past 7 months my wife has seen many doctors who have been nothing but rude, mean, and very quick with her without taking the time and take all measures to see what her problem could be. MRI and X-RAYS indicate that her lower lumbar is fine. Everyone looks at these and says they can't do anything for her since her spine is clean and one doctor even said she has Sciatica. Every time she see's a doctor she says her back does not hurt at all but her hip all through her left leg hurts severely. Her symptoms include: *Severe pain all throughout her left hip down to her back thigh. * Left foot sticks out causing unbalanced walk/limp.   I've been doing tons of medical research to back up my claim and many notes that indicate a dislocation or trauma of some kind at the \"Femur\" or somewhere around that region. She has tried hot baths, over the counter meds, Heating pad/ ice pack, a numbing patch, and nothing seems to work. She's been prescribed Mobic and Scelaxin which she found not only not work but ended up allergic to them. Vicoden  which sorta kinda helps but nothing relieving her pain. I constantly rub her and sometimes it puts her at ease  if she does not move for 15 mins but does not make the pain go away.  Seriously we are at the end of our rope here. She's been in and out of hospitals and doctors offices who seem to not even bother trying to dig further into whats wrong. Visible problems are her limp, foot pointing other way, Sacral bone area is no longer inflamed but still seems bumpier than usual and slight touch kills her and yet the x-rays only went as far as her Sacral bone and higher, MRI for lower lumbar. We don't know what to do anymore or who to turn to. Way too many doctors looking away and not taking the in depth time to look further. If you have anything suggestions that would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Thanks for writing in.  You report your wife has left hip and posterior left thigh pain.  History of MVA rear end collision with your wife turned to the left to look at daughter in rear drivers side (wife was in front passenger seat).  MRI and xray of lumbar spine are negative.  Chronic pain.  Foot is turned outward.    I agree that investigating hip pathology is right.  When she was turned to the left to look at her daughter, she would shift weight slightly to the left hip and rotate the trunk slightly left.  A force from the rear would compress the facet joint in the lumbar spine, compress the SI joint.  Some points on normal body mechanics, when we look to the left in a seated position with both feet on the floor, the left pelvis retracts and the femur internally rotates and adducts (toward to midline).  The rear end collision would have accentuated this posture and perhaps caused a stress/overstretch of the internal rotators and anterior joint capsule of the hip.  When assuming a normal stance, the toes would then tend to point outward.    Some imaging of the hip and pelvis would be prudent and if no fracture or structural damage then seek a referral to an orthopedic physical therapist.   Another area to consider is the facet joints in the spine,  arthritis in these joints could cause the same kind of pain (but does not account for the change in foot position).  Sometimes corticosteroid injection into the facet joints alleviates symptoms.    Let us know how it goes.\n\n",

All of these symptoms are also accompanied by extremely and severely,SEVERELY, dry skin, along with hair loss and headaches.  I have also been told I have IBS but I feel that diagnosis was given just to keep the doctor from looking further into my symptoms.I have had my thyroid function checked numerous times and each time it is within normal range.  I have been to many doctors but they only want to treat each symptom and not the entire problem or seem interested in finding out what is going on. I have been having these problems for the last 8 years. Is there any advice you can give me?\n\n",

You have reported pain down both legs to the feet, arm weakness, knotted up muscles in the trunk, chronic abdominal pain, hair loss, dry skin, headache.  With the leg pain, it would be helpful to screen for lumbar pathology.  This can be done in the office with history taking and physical exam and perhaps MRI.    Regarding the other signs and symptoms, I immediately think of endocrine problems or hormone imbalance.  It may be worthwhile to check some hormone levels (eg free testosterone, urinary 24 hour cortisol, estrogen, progesterone, pregnenolone).  Also, considering your menstrual cycle behaviors is important including its relation to headache.  Also, a referral to an endocrinologist may be in order.  Hope this helps get you on a right track.

It is my left hip that is acting up, some days are better than others and it seems to be getting better. The only issue I have is that my left testical aches. It is always lower than my right side. The tubes around the testical also are swollen, it varies from day to day. There is no discoloration.   Is it possible that the blood flow to my testical is being restricted because of my hip flexor? And would that cause a dull pain, swelling, and drop in the nut? I have also been trying to wear supportive underwear because that is what my doctor said I should be doing.\n\n",

The swelling is not from bursitis if the steroid shot did not help.  If the hip is not red, warm, and swollen and no pain with weight bearing, it is likely not infected.  So, there may be arthritis in the hip... or the pelvis may be mal-aligned from having a baby.  Loosened ligaments in the pelvis can allow a change in the alignment of the pelvis and throw the hips off.   It may help to see a chiropractor or physical therapist to asses the bony structures of the hip and pelvis and perform any needed mobilizations/manipulations indicated.    I would not aspirate (withdraw fluid) the joint unless it is obviously swollen and possibly infected.   Take care and keep us posted.\n\n",

Signs and symptoms include popping sound, lump in the muscle belly, inability to move the joint associated with the tendon, pain, swelling, bruising.  More commonly tendons are strained and ligaments/joints are sprained.  These can cause pain, bruising, swelling, and pain with weight bearing.

    "title": "Re: Spinal Injury & Fentanyl TD",
    "content": "Hello, Thanks for writing in.  You have reported that your daughter suffered a spine injury 9 years ago and is currently taking Lortab, Fentanyl, and tramadol.  Her pain medicine strength has increased over the years and in the past year Fentanyl was started and seemingly is causing dramatic weight loss.  This is an important topic because many people take narcotic pain medicine for non malignant chronic pain.  Research studies show conflicting reports on the efficacy of opioids for chronic pain.  Furlan et al 2006 found opioids were more effective than placebo for chronic pain relief while Martell et al 2007 found no change in pain levels.  Both researchers report a 16 week duration of study. Since most chronic pain sufferers use opioids for longer than 16 weeks, this information is of limited use.   General medical practice uses pain medicine in a step fashion: eg NSAIDS, then non narcotic meds (tramadol), low strength opioids,  high strength opioids, combinations of opioids.  Over time people develop tolerance to opioids and require stronger dosages.    The problem with developing tolerance is the potential for drug dependence (physical dependance) and addiction (psychological dependence).  When a person reaches this stage, removing the drug will cause withdrawal symptoms (agitation, anxiety, mood swings, hypertension, racing heart, sweating).  Weight loss may occur with Fentanyl and may be caused by other adverse effects (nausea and constipation).  Usually death from opioids are caused by overdose.  The signs of overdose are slow heart rate, low blood pressure, and respiratory distress and failure.    For withdrawal, a tapering dose can be used with adjunct medicine for withdrawal syptoms.  Buprenorphine and naloxone can also be prescribed.  This medicine binds to the opioid receptors in the brain...thus replacing the opioid without withdrawal.      For more information consult your pain management specialist or family physician.  Take care and keep us posted.\n\n",

The activity level does not match the pain level at all.He is a very physically active person who does painting and maintenance to rental units for a living.

He also has been having a lot of GI pain, enough to double him over in pain, over the last few years. No doctor has been able to diagnose this either even though he went to several. One said some levels in his blood looked like it could be his appendix but that wouldn't last for years, would it? Anyway, I read that certain dystrophys could cause GI problems also. He is 38 and has been having these symptoms for at least two years, and the GI symptoms for about 8 years. What do you think?

To be for certain, consult a physiatrist who can test the muscle strength, deep tendon reflexes, sensation of the arms and evaluate for tennis elbow or other tendonitis etiology.    Muscular dystrophy would likely present with muscle weakness with/without pain.  Again physiatrist can do the muscle testing (no biopsy or needles needed).  Take care and keep us posted.\n\n",

    "title": "Knee pain on impact while running",
    "content": "I have been suffering from knee pain for about 3 months now.  I first noticed the pain while running.  The pain is a sharp pain, upon impact, on the medial (somewhat anterior) side of my right knee.  The pain seems to be localized along the joint line.  There is very little or no pain except at impact (running or jumping).  I will occasionally feel an aching pain after a long run.  My family doctor diagnosed me with patellafemoral syndrom, and I have been doing PT for about two months, and have had no improvement with the pain despite an improvent in strength.  The orthopedist that I saw said that my patella was in the right place, and appeared to be tracking properly, but then told me that he still thought that that was the problem (and was unable to tell me how or why).    Some additional information:  About five months before the knee pain started, I was in a car accident where my knee was jammed when I slammed on the brakes.  Between the accident and when the pain started, I was doing primarily biking, and no running, and the pain began shortly/immediately after I began running again.  I also have very loose joints and my knees hyperextend  >10 degrees, and have always been that way.  I am a very active person and have run extensively in the past with no issues.  What are the possibly injuries that I may have?  Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Usually patella femoral joint problems will present with pain in, under or around the kneecap including the patella tendon.  The pain you described is along the joint line of the anterior medial knee which leads me to think about meniscus, knee cartilage, or plica problems.    The car accident mechanism makes sense with the patella femoral problem.  An MRI may shed light on a more accurate diagnosis.    Biking sometimes makes patella femoral problems worse.  Running can cause any and all sorts of knee pain.  Hope this helps.  Keep us posted.\n\n",

    "content": "I recently got the results from the MRI and learned that my pain is due to a stress fracture on the tibial plateau.  My doctor suggested that I consider having bone density tests done because there is nothing in my history to indicate why I would develop a stress fracture.  I was wondering if this would be worthwhile?  I do not drink milk, but I eat plenty of cheese and also take a daily multivitamin and a calcium+D supplement daily.  I have only had one broken bone (when I was 11, from a fall).\n\n",

Many other medical conditions can cause secondary osteoporosis (eg hyperparathyroidism, cushings disease).  So a review of history and any signs and symptoms will be appropriate.    In an otherwise healthy and assymptomatic young women osteoporosis would not be my first suspicion however it would be wise to discuss this in detail with your physician.  Keep us posted.\n\n",

    "title": "Wrist problems",
    "content": "Hi,  I'm 20 years old and have been having wrist problems for a few years now. I have had many tests done, multiple x-rays, an MRI, carpel tunnel, and have seen a RA doctor. All of which they can find nothing, but my hands are susceptible to the cold.  I am an active bowler and although my right wrist is much worse than the left, it is obvious that there is an underlying condition causing the other wrist to have problems without cause.   Sometimes I wake up in the morning and I just need to shake the pain away from my wrists. They become very stiff and annoyingly painful. They lock up and get tired from the smallest activities such as writing and typing. If my wrists bend all the way down or just hang there, when I raise them back up, it's like a broken hinge scrapping against the wood with resistance, but in this case, different bones. Making a normal fist I can feel resistance and it's not as easy as others.   My right wrist can dislocate? It's like my hand can go beneath the wrist or arm and then snap back up. I was told by an orthopedic surgeon that I would need major reconstructive surgery on it, but was never given any diagnoses. This was quite a few years ago and I still have that problem and my current doctor is still stumped.   The latest idea is that of which they are symptoms from another underlying condition. I've been tested for lupus, thyroid conditions, and other things I can not remember. I do not know if that is the case, but I also just had my second surgery on my legs for varicose veins.   I'm 6'1'', 228lbs, which is not huge at all. I'm active in basketball and 2-5 times a week I'm in the gym. My wrists have also made me leave the gym early at times because I felt like i couldn't support the weights and would feel like my bones were ready to shatter.   I've given as much information as I can right now.   Any input would be very helpful.   Thanks.\n\n",

Symptoms are: bilateral wrist pain and stiffness,  sensitivity to cold, easy hand fatigue, decrease ability to make a fist, perhaps some hyper flexibilty of the hands or wrist.  Do your hands swell? Do they change color (red, blue, or white) especially with cold weather? Any problems with feet or other joints in the body? What kind of lab work did they do for RA? Are you hyper flexibility in other joints (elbows and knees)?  Any other symptoms in the rest of the body (fatigue, fever, muscle ache etc)  Keep me posted and we'll take this a step at a time.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for your reply.  When I saw the RA doctor, he did no lab work. All he did was review my MRI and take a look at all my other joints. When I left there, the only thing he told me was that my knees were hyper extensive?  They have the ability to bend further back. If I were to  stand straight I am actually bending forward a little bit because of my knees.   A couple weeks ago at my last appointment I was actually told that the doctor also wrote down that I had reumosis in my hands? It was something near that word.   My fingers become very swollen in the cold and being a bowler that was a big problem, and the only thing i was told was to make sure I wear good gloves all the time in the winter. My feet and hands lose heat very fast too. I was told that it's because certain molecules or tissue are thin and that it was fairly common. There is usually so much I am being told at each appointment I can hardly remember it all.   Again, thank you for your reply and I'll be looking forward to your input.\n\n",

I use my hands all day long and when i go home at night my palm is swollen and my thumb is in alot of pain. I cant afford to get it looked at. I wanted to know how I can treat it at home?  I don't think its broken because it never hurt THAT much. I also never lost any movement in the joint. Most of the pain is in the knuckle at the base of my thumb. The knuckls is very large about twice the thickness of my other hand. I think I jammed or spraind it. I read online that some jammed fingers can take months to heal. Is there antyhing I can do to speed the healing? Is there anything I can do befor going to a doctor to know if its spraind or jammed?  thanks in advanced for any help\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I am sorry to hear about your thumb.  Is there any pain or difficulty holding, grasping, or pinching objects using the thumb.  Sometimes the ligament on the inside of the thumb gets sprained (gamekeepers thumb). Treatment involves avoiding painful movements, ice or heat packs, NSAIDS, and time for healing.  The joint at the base of the thumb is also prone to osteoarthitis (OA).  Treatment includes acetaminophen, hot packs, and gentle range of motion.  You may find wrapping the thumb with self adhesive wrap (looks like a small ACE wrap but adheres to itself - stretchy too) helpful.    Let us know if you have any more questions and if in doubt about the diagnosis, see your family physician.  Take care.\n\n",

My new question is about the swelling. The meaty part of my palm under my thumb has been swollen for months. Could this be dangerous? Blood clot or nerve damage?  The rest and ice seem to be working. Im just still unsure of the swelling.   Thanks so much for you time.\n\n",

    "content": "My names is Megan Garrison I am 18 I graduated from a town in alaska that did not have very good medical care, so i was forced to seek care eleswere for this problem, which started 3 years ago. I was a cheerleader in my highschool until a girl fell on me in a stunt and i was the only one who caught her, causing me to get slammed inbetween her body and the hard wood floor. at first i just thought it just knocked the wind out of me i sat down for a couple minutes caught my breathe and i was fine but the next day i started getting this severe pain in the upper left side of my rib cage (three ribs underneath my left breast) they also seemed to be inflamed, so i took some asprine to relieve the pain and help reduce the swelling well..8 months later this pain was getting worse, causing me to miss school, get very sick vomiting wise becuase of being in so much pain which is how my body respondes to pain is by puking. So we decided to go to Anchorage to seek treatment..bad idea as much as i told this doctor it was my ribs he was set that it was my stomach or pancreas. So he did an edoscopy.results turned up very little it just showed that i had sever allergies to god knows what (haha) and that what do you know i had acid reflux which ive had since i was 8 years old the doctor insisted on puting me on steriods which seemed to do nothing, and told me it was acid reflux which i was 17 at the time i knew it was not that. So we came down to washington and went to childrens hospital it took them all of 3 seconds to realize this was not a G.I. problem, but they still can not seem to figure out what is wrong with me!! im sure you could imagin this frustration, since this pain very much limits me in what i can do. i cant carry heavy things, cant work out or do yoga, anything strenuise basicly and me being a very active 18 year old this is horrible! all the doctors say they can do is keep prescribing me vicoden which never takes the pain away. im just getting extremly frustrated with this whole situation and im looking for any advice at all. I have had bone scans, cat scans mass amounts of blood work and X-rays done and i have had an MRI but it was of my stomach Soon i will be going to ANOTHER orthepidic doctor but my health insurance doesnt kick in till the end of the month which seems like years away for me. so PLEASE if you can help me AT ALL just let me know id REALY apriciate it. thank you so much!  ~Megan\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, With your history of blunt trauma, thorax pain, and vomiting, it sounds like the physicians have been ordering test to rule out internal organ problems.  It also sounds like the tests have come back negative.  If indeed the vomiting is from the thoracic pain, then relieving the pain should decrease the vomiting.  So, when you have little or no pain, is there any vomiting?  If this is a musculoskeltal problem and since you have not listed any reports of fracture then the rib cage and thoracic spine can be mobilized or manupulated. A chiropractor, osteopath, or orthopedic physical therapist may evaluate the rib cage and thoracic spine.  They will look for mal rotation of the spine or a rib being out of place...treatment will focus proper alignment, pain control, and exercise.    Hope this gives some help.  Let me know if you have any questions.\n\n",

So im not completly sure. I think that it may be tissue damage, but then again the tissue around my ribs doesnt hurt, its when they are pushed on directly if like a doctor is trying to feel around it just to get an idea, that is extremly painful but x-rays and such don't show that there has been a fracture or anything of the sort so honesltly im not to sure. thank you so much!!!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The anterior tibialis is primarily responsible for dorsiflexing the foot.  More importantly is the area of bruising and pain near the ankle.  You may have suffered a high ankle sprain.  It would be good to have the ortho doc or family physician check the ankle stability (anterior drawer of the ankle: test anterior talo fibular ligament), and assess for sprain.    Your treatment thus far has been right on.    I suppose a strain to the anterior tib could explain the pain and swelling.  It would be quite a case to have a sprained anterior tibialis.  Sometimes this muscle gets sore especially with its microattachments to the tibia (shin splints).    Grasping at straws...may need to see ortho if it doesn't heal on its own over the next 1-2 weeks.   Let us know how it goes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I'm just hoping for advice/input on my situation. I woke up one morning in early November with arm pain, I thought I had just slept on it wrong and I figured I could just \"walk\" it off and be ok. Ten days later I couldn't take it anymore and went to my Dr. he thought I probably sprain it somehow and put me on Flector patches, in a sling and resting it. I went back a week later worse yet and was given a coprtisporin injection which didn't help at all. I was referred to an Ortho Surg who after waiting 3 weeks to get in to see him in 4 minutes said he wanted an MRI and it may be rotator degeneration. With insurance drama I will finally have my MRI on Monday (1-26). But, I'm worried what if it doesnt show anything? I am in such constant pain I don't know what to do! I was given the chioce to continue wearing my sling or not and I chose not because of the fear of atrophy or frozen shoulder. Any advice or idea would be truly appriciated! Thank you for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Possible causes of worsening shoulder pain include: - rotator cuff tear or impingement - sub acromial bursitis - shoulder arthritis - frozen shoulder (adhesive capsulitis) - generalized shoulder strain. - AC joint sprain - shoulder dislocation - labral tear (internal shoulder damage) - referred pain from the heart (ischemia)...unlikely - diaphram disease (the phrenic nerve innervates the diaphram.  Irritation of the diaphram can refer pain to the ipsilateral shoulder)  MRI is a good choice because, the pictures will help the physician detect if any of the above are causing the pain (with exception of the last two items).    In the meantime, continue ice/ heat and analgesics.  You are correct in your concern over frozen shoulder due to prolonged immobilization.  Also, some visits to the physical therapist may help with the pain and mobillity.  Keep us posted.\n\n",

    "content": "I recently sprained my ankle, well in September 2008.  I got it checked out, and it was a 2nd degree sprain, I believe, and I was given an air cast.  However, I was stupid and was embarassed by the air cast at school, so I didn't wear it as soon as I was able to bear weight, which meant wobbling down hallways, but I was able to eventually walk normal.  However, it's now January, and it's still swollen, and every once in a while, pain occurs.  Whenever this pain occurs, I feel this almost spherical, ball-like object that, once pressed on in a certain direction, pops back underneath, or so it feels like.  After I press on it, and it's \"disappeared\", I no longer feel the pain.  It hurts really badly when I press on it to get it back in, but I feel instant relief afterwards.  Does anyone know what this ball is and what I can possibly do to get rid of this pain?  Thanks.\n\n",

It would be prudent to have an orthopedist evaluate the ankle and perhaps see a physical therapist for rehabilitation. The ankle over time should do fine but you will be prone to re injury so make sure you follow physician orders and rehab the ankle properly.  Let us know how it turns out.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I can remember falling from the top of the desk (30\" high) just before xmas when putting xmas light up. I had a little pain in my ankle but it went away right away. I was able to walk no problem. Then about 1 week later, I pointed my toes in bed to stretch and the pain was unbelievable. This is what I feel:  When I point my LEFT toes forward (like you would do when you do ballet to stand on your toes) I feel a SHARP pain on the left side of my foot that goes from the ankle to the about half way down my foot. The pain is burning and very sharp and it's straight down my foot and the pain remains until I stop pointing my toes.   I can walk and I can feel some pain in the same spot from time to time when I twist the ankle a little but I can walk with no real problem or pain. Also, if I put my ankle on a hard surface (like the bottom of the tub) the ankle bone (the bump that sticks out) hurts too and I don't have that pain in my right foot.  I have been wearing an ankle brace of neoprene for about 2 weeks now and it's not helping. My foot feels better in the morning even when I point my toes but it doesn't last long, maybe I should do crutches for a while?   Hope this help in helping me, I really want this pain to stop. Thanks for looking!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, This sounds like a lateral ankle sprain.  When you point the toes (like a ballerina), the ankle will naturally invert.  Since severe ankle inversion from a fall or twisted foot causes lateral ankle sprain, then pointing toes will hurt.    Treatment for acute lateral ankle sprain includes ice, ibuprofen, compression (neoprene or ACE) and elevation.  If painful to bear weight, an xray is used to rule out fractures.    At this point, alternating hot and cold packs, weight bearing exercise (e.g mini squats), dorsiflexion stretches, neoprene sleeve (or aircast brace), crutches if painful to walk, and analgesics.  But first things first, have the foot xray'd to rule out fracture.  Take care and let us know how it goes.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for your detailed reply. My questions would be this:  Since I can walk with minimal pain and the pain is mostly when I point my toes (looking at images online, the pain is right over the talus bone or the talus bone itself) or  When I touch the bone sticking out on the left side of my left foot... I'm looking online at images and I would say, it hurts when I push the \"Anterior talofibular ligament\" or the \"fibula\" bone right between the \"Anterior talofibular ligament\" and the \"Calcaneofibular ligament\".   Lets not laugh now, I'm just trying to help and boy do I feel important using those long words!!   ;-)  1- Lets assume that it was a small fracture, what would be the treatment?   2- If it is a small fracture and I don't get an xray, what can go wrong?  3- When you have a fracture, I though you would have swelling, but I don't?  4- When you have a fracture, I though you couldn't walk on your foot?  5- Since it's been over 3 weeks now, would a fracture still be visible on Xray?  If it is just a bad sprain, then I already know the treatment and it will get better with time.  Thanks so much for your time and help and I know that since you are a Dr. you feel get Xray is the best way to go and I really wish I could just go to the Dr. but it's financially a very hard decision for me and I want to make sure it's necessary.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Ankle/foot pain when pointing toes",
    "content": "Hello, Thanks for the description. With a lateral ankle sprain, we make a decision to xray the ankle based on: Does it hurt to bear weight. Is there pain when the distal tibial/fibula area is sqeezed. Is the 5th metatarsal painful. Is the distal fibula painful.  If a fracture is not displaced or angulated no reductions are needed.  The area is casted or splinted and left to heal.    If the ankle is improving with time and no swelling or pain with weight bearing, this ankle probably was just sprained.    In general the longer you wait for treating a fracture, the outcome again depends on the bone and the severity.  Big long bones like the femur need immediate attention because of the blood supply  and potential nerve damage.  Displaced and angulated bones do not heal well if at all unless they are approxamated and straightened...plus risk of infection especially if the skin is broken (open fracture).  Hope this helps.  Keep us posted.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 25 year old healthy, fit (not overweight) electrician.  I have very dense bones amd have never broken anything, nor have I ever suffered anything more than a minor sprain.  I have very developed legs which can take just about anything.  I suppose I had a sense of invincibility of sorts.  Last summer, I got into the habit of leaping off my boss's 3-foot deck onto asphalt on the way to the work van.  This was done in constrictive high-top flat-soled work boots with no support whatsoever.  After a couple months I noticed instability in my right ankle.  So, I bought supportive insoles and stopped jumping.  When it got worse, I switched to tennis shoes and concentrated on training the specific weak point little by little.  Now after more than 6 months, the strength is back but I have a noticeable lump (no longer swelling) over the outside of the ankle bone (tallus?).  Is it possible that a bone spur could be cutting into the muscle or tendon?  My mother has heel spurs.  I currently don't have health insurance, although I can afford it now.  Is this worth insurance and a trip to a specialist, or should I just exercise it?  Thank you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Lump on ankle",
    "content": "Hello,  It is hard to get a clear idea where the lump in the ankle is.  The normal bump on the outside part of the ankle is the distal fibula.   The ankle joint is made of the tibia/fibula communication with the talus.  A bone spur on the lateral ankle is uncommon and would need to be rather large and pointy to cut a tendon - very very unlikely.   The pain and swelling in the ankle may have been from repetitive jumping onto hard concrete.   The fact that the pain and swelling are gone is reassuring.  As long as the ankle and foot and knee (yes - always consider the joints above the injured area) are functioning properly without pain then the structures are probably sound.   If in doubt, have the ankle and foot xray'd and see your family physcian for accurate diagnosis.  Take care and let us know if we can answer any more questions.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Thanks for the pictures.  It is difficult to see the distal end of the proximal phalanx clearly but there may be a oblique fracture there with minimal displacement and some angulation.  If so, then yes see an orthopedist.    Did the radiologist report a fracture?  Looks like the PIP (proximal interphalangeal joint) may be hyperextended or dislocated.  Was this reported?  In general, a non displaced, non angulated finger fracture without neurovascular compromise (no numbness, tingling, or diminished pulses) can be splinted or buddy taped without an orthopedic consult.    Again, from this distance it is hard to read the radiograph clearly.  Let us know how things turn out.  What you do will depend on what you and your family  physician decide and based on the radiology report.\n\n",

    "content": "Trauma that cause hyperflexion of the distal phalanx ruptured the extensor tendon ( Mallet finger)  sometimes the end of the tendon may  have a bony fragment.  this is a Bony Mallet finger   It means that extensor tendon of the fourth finger ruptured from its insertion point with a bony fragment, ( avulsion fracture)  Bony Mallet finger healing time is earlier than the Mallet finger. Bone to bone healing is better, and earlier than bone to tendon healing.  this radiographs were taken with splint, and spints tries to hyperextend the proximal and distal interfalangeal joints to shorten the distance between the avulsed bony fragment to distal phalanx. if avulsed bone don't have any gap with distal phalanx and touch it, it will heal more rapidly with full range of motion without pain.  general information for phalanx fracture, if the fractured bone is not larger than the 30% of the joint surface it does not need any surgery.  Your fracture is small than the 30% of the joint surface, there is not any gap at the fracture site, so i think you will use your finger after 6 weeks splint treatment.  don't worry,  But don't remove your splint before 6 weeks  Take care\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I'm a 28 year old female. In the past year, I began working out and dieting to lose weight following the birth of my 1st child. While happy to report that I've lost 40 pounds and reached my goal weight, I now have knee pain in both knees after doing squats, lunges, or running on the treadmill. I can't even do the elliptical or stair-stepper due to the pain. The pain is mostly under and right below my knee caps. Usually ibuprofen will help, but I'd like to be able to do the elliptical machine and add weight to my squats/lunges to improve muscle definition, but it seems impossible. I tried taking a break from doing any weight bearing exercise, but we have stairs in our house and I have to carry our 30 pound son down the stairs occassionally and this causes pain. Are supplements such as Osteo Bi-Flex worth the money or does this sound like something more serious that I should have a doctor investigate? Thanks so much for your help!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Congratulations on your new son.  30lb boy is good weight within the first year!  Your knee pain sounds like patellar tendonitis.  Treatment includes ice packs; stretching quads,hamstings, and groin; exercise as tolerated (walking, swimming), and NSAIDS.  This can be a nagging recurrent injury and it is indeed a training injury.    Use of patella straps may help.  For linament, I like 50% salicylate cream / 50% menthol cream mixed and massaged into the tendon and topped with moist heat pack for 20 minutes.  Use 1-2 x a day for 1-2 weeks.    Gradually, return to squats, lunges, running, etc.  All exercise should be painfree both during and 24 hours after exercise.    If needed, see a physical therapist for supervised rehab.  Let us know how it goes.\n\n",

After surgery the surgeon informed me that I had only 50% of my anterior cruciate ligament left. I return in 6 weeks to have another check up but was wondering if you could tell me if it is possible that a person having only 50% of this ligament left would be able to return to play sport again without having surgery to repair the ligament?

    "title": "Re: Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury",
    "content": "Hello, I am sorry to hear about your knee.  Having 50% of an ACL in itself does not prevent participation in sports.  What matters is: 1. The stability of the knee.  Is there to much anterior translation or laxity in the knee.  Too much \"sloppiness\" in the knee can worsen the cartilage damage and cause problems with the meniscus.  However, some surgeons recommend opting out of ACL repair if the hamstrings and quadriceps are significantly strong and flexible and can handle the load and jarring of the sport.   2. How the knee responds to rehab including back to sport training.  Significant swelling, pain, weakness, instability, or locking sensation in or around the knee may be warning signs that the ACL needs repair.    Hope this helps. Keep us posted and let us know how things turn out.\n\n",

I got wrist surgery on Dec. 17, 2008 and I decided to use the Total Gym on January 9, 2009, Firday evening, for a little for my wrist even though I wasn't supposed to but wanted to try it anyway.  Five minutes later I got really dizzy and I could not see straight and things were turning around in circles and I felt nauseous that evening for an hour.  Then it got better and then I woke up in the middle of the night with it again and then all day Saturday, I still felt dizzy and nauseous, with still a little dizzy on Tuesday, January 13, 2009.  Can using my surgically repaired wrist too soon make me dizzy?  Maybe a drop or rise in blood pressure could have caused this?  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  Thank You.

    "content": "Hello, Consult with the surgeon before starting any exercise.  Yes, a drop in blood pressure could have caused the dizziness and nausea. Pain or fear can trigger a vasovagal response.  The blood pressure drops and the person passes out...or close to it.  Essentially the head (including the brain) does not get enough blood.  This is why before passing out people are described as turning pale.  ie \"Their face turned white as a ghost\"  If the nausea and dizziness continue despite stoppng the exercise and increasing fluids, consult a physician for evaluation of your symptoms.   Take care and keep us posted.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Treat acute inflammation with ice, rest, elevation and compression (ACE wrap or neoprene sleeve).  Maintain range of motion in the knee.   Before returning to running, ask a physician to examine the knee for meniscal problems, pes anserine bursitis, patella femoral pain, ACL laxity, medial collateral laxity or inflammation.  If you have a flat feet, leg tightness (hamstrings, quadriceps, achilles, groin muscles or hip flexors), leg weakness or fatigue then you will be prone to knee injury with running.  Use orthotics in shoes if you have flat feet.   In general, new runners or on-again/off-again runners should prepare the leg muscles for jogging with 4-6 weeks of leg strengthening exercise, stretching, and brisk walking (up to 30 min) before starting a running program.  This helps prevent injury and makes running more enjoyable and long lasting.  Take care and keep us posted.\n\n",

    "title": "Recurring but random Severe Hip Pain",
    "content": "Two months ago I attended a political rally and was on my feet for about 6 hours, standing, with only a couple of short walks from the location I was standing. That night, I experienced severe hip pain in my left hip. On a 1-10 scale it was 9. The pain was reduced by movement, walking, stretching, but returned within a couple of hours if I went back to bed. This continued for several days, it improved day to day and was no longer an issue.  Since then I have had several incidents of a similar nature, but without the extended period of standing. Currently I have experienced this again. I was fine, no unusual activities, and woke up during the night with pain in my left hip joint. The pain, on a 1-10 scale was 9-10. It was difficult to get out of bed, walk, or stand. I did get up, walked around the house for about 10 minutes, put a heating pad on my hip while sitting in an desk chair for about 20 minutes, and the pain went away.  I went back to bed, and slept for about 3 hours. I woke up, with the same pain. Again I walked for a few minutes, then a heating pad, and the pain went away. About every 2-3 hours this continued, until I was up for the day. This same pattern has continued for 3 days. During the day, if I am active, walk, and do normal activities there is no pain, only some soreness in my hip.  I had a complete physical in October, about a month prior to the 1st incident. I talked to my doctor about it after the first incident in November. He said it was nothing to worry about, and was likely due to the extended standing, imobility. I've called him since when it reoccurred, and he said to come in if it didn't improve, that it was likely bursitis.  I have no numbness, no other pain, anywhere. I have no other health issues, other than my blood pressure, which I take Altace, and nothing else.   I'm not quite sure what to think, about what may be causing the hip pain. My Doctor didin't seem concerned the 1st time, or since when I've talked to him. This current incident is worse than any prior, and has lasted longer.  Should I be more concernded? See a different doctor. Does this fit with bursitis? or could it be something else more serious ???\n\n",

    "content": "I have posted this in another area but have not been answered. I am so hoping someone can give me some clue to whats happening. First off I was diagnoised NOV.07 with stage111 breastcancer I went through and still am aggressive treatment. I have had pain since and still do from Chemo, They diagnoised this through a neurologist but he was perplexed cause its not in my feet or hands. It only effects my lower back and legs and feels deep within the bone I can not massage it out. I am on pain meds and heat which by the way I have severe like bruising from the heating pads although its low heat. I also had a problem in one area of my lower back and leg when driving or walking it would ache this was 2 yrs ago or more and would come and go also swelling in my ankles. 2 years ago I had a MRI of my spine and showed no disc problems so they just left it at that and I learned to deal with it when it would ache. I do have a history of nerve problems had 2 surgeries on left arm for ulnar entrapement during one of those I also had a carpal tunnel realese. I need the other arm done same as left but also a tendon release. Could all this be a problem that everyone is missing?  The chemo just aggravated every thing and its been since the end of July/08 that I finished. I had Radiation and it did not increase the pain. I am presently on Herceptin once a week until July/09 , also Tomixfen for 2 years no change either way for the pain issue. My oncologist said its not the Herceptin its not one of its side effects. I just thought I would be getting slightly better by now. I have had a full bloodwork up for RA and other autiommune disorders saw rheumatologist he ruled out all. My CR-Protein was elevated which indicates inflammation but he said that even a slight sniffel would sometimes elevate this he redid all bloodwork and am waiting to hear. But being a cancer patient with a high percentage for reoccurance I am scared I have Bone Mets and will be getting Scans in the next week or so. Also that certain protein can indicate a variety of other aliments. So so far I have seen those Drs and a neuroogist when he stuck the needles in my leg I could not feel a thing so his conclusion was I had mild neuropthy. I have been on neurotin, Lyrica no luck!!! I have lived with nerve issues and I just don't believe its nothing this pain is driving me crazy and is really putting a damper on my quality of life. I have had to give up employment cause I can't  be on my feet or sit or even laydown for extended periods. PLEASE HELP!! Who should I go see or do you have any clue what is going on, is it vascular or coritive artery I know my treatments have dropped my Muga Heart Scan down from 78% to 46% and we stopped Herceptin for 6 weeks and it only came up to 50%. Sorry so long but needed to try to explain. Thanks in advance for any imfo! I am going to see my Orthopedic surgeon in a couple of weeks any question shoud I ask him???\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Thank you for your questions.  Regarding the MUGA scan: the benefit of this test is to determine how well the heart is pumping blood either toward the lungs or toward the body (aka ejection fraction - this is expressed in percentages...which you gave).  The only bearing on the lumbar spine and legs would be a one of blood supply.  An ejection fraction of 50% in itself should not increase low back pain.  I agree that the CRP is a general marker for inflammation and high concentrations in the blood may be caused from a variety of conditions...so in isolation, not helpful in specific diagnosis.  The MRI was normal two years ago. Certainly, if low back symptoms with pain radiating down the legs has developed or worsened since that time, a repeat MRI is reasonable.    The bone scan scheduled is a good test considering recent history of stage III breast cancer.  It should be determined that the cancer has not progressed to stage IV which may include bone involvement and a potential cause for your back pain.    Lastly, since you have a mild neuropathy, have you been screened for diabetes?  Let us know how things go.\n\n",

But my thought is its not in my hands or feet just my lower back and legs and feels like its deep within. It does not feel like a total nerve issue, that is why I am trying to find out what else could cause this. I have not heard back on my bloodwork which I should have by now if something was up nor did they call on my xrays of pelvis and legs. Hopefully the scans will show something just not cancer is my hopes! I am unable at this time due to having a expander from reconstruction still in which contains metel hoping to have it out in April. I have been checked for diebeties and my levels have always been on the lower side. If my scans come back normal do you have any suggestions on where or who I should try to see? Or maybe my best bet is to go to a pain management clinic. And hope that things improve.      Also I am very upset with myself my last scans a year ago they did they were unable to inject the dye into me do to poor veins and only one arm to work with. I had forgotten all about that. I am in hopes the report to my doctor told them this. How important is that dye to show things?? I don't care if I have to stay all day they are going to get it in there. They are unable to use my potacath which stinks. I will update you on my scans as soon as I know.                                           Thanks again, Bridget\n\n",

    "title": "Radial dysplasia (elbows)",
    "content": "I hope this is the right forum for my question(s)  About 5 or 6 years ago I was diagnosed with radial dysplasia in my elblows, main issues are with my dominate right elbow. Pain, loss of motion constant crunching sound.  I was referred to a specialist to see what they could do to relieve pain and possibly improve my motion. But was told there was nothing they can do other than a scope to clear out some of the larger pieces floating around.  The scope did relieve some pain, so I resumed my normal activities, basketball, bowling and lifting weights. Was not long until my pain returned and my motion decreased yet again.  So I went back to the doctor to see again if there was anything that can be done and was told there was nothing and sent home..  My questions are is it really true that there is nothing that can be done for my elbow(s)? I would really like do something and the idea that there is no cure or treatment leaves my bothered as I feel there just has to be something out there.   But if there are some treatments what are they? And or possibly what could I do that may help my pain and ROM?  Thank you in advance for any help I get.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Radial dysplasia (elbows)",
    "content": "Hello,  To improve ROM and strength, some general principles for exercise are as follows: - apply heating pad before and ice pack after - use NSAIDS for inflammation control  - use supportive brace (neoprene sleeve) during activities like basketball for warmth and support. - focus on elbow flexion and extension gentle stretching without resistance ie weights until full painfree motion.  Also practice forearm pronation and supination. - gentle progress to weights.  Avoid bending and turning (forearm pronation and supination) in combination as this will place more stress on the radial head area.   - Let pain and inflammation be the guide.  Pain means stop the exercise.  Regarding more treatment options, I have not seen any further specific treatment in the medical literature.  Perhaps, you could describe the dysplasia in more detail.  I assume this involves the radial head.   Any some point, a second debridement may be in order.  In the meantime, conservative treatment is to be optimized.    Let me know how it goes.   Take care.\n\n",

And pls read last paragraph regarding humerus lesion - need I be concerned? I have read that one should monitor an enchondroma in the humerus - do you think further investigation on this one is required?  Thanks!  Here is what the summary is of the MRI:  1. Supraspinatus focal articular partial thickness tear measuring approx. 11 x 6 mm and extending 50% way through tendon 2. Supraspinatus bursal surface tendinopathy 3. Focal tear in the interior fibers of teres minor.  4. Focal tear in the adjacent joint capsule as the gadolinium signal intensity fluid flows into this defect 5. Irregular fraying of long head of biceps tendon just proximal to insertion into glenoid labrum 6. Minor fraaying or irregular nondisplaced tear high glenoid labrum anterior superior quadrant. 7. Biceps tendonitis  AND I have an Type IV acromion.  \"At the anterolateral aspect surgical neck of humerus, within the subcortical bone, is a 6 mm lesion which is T1 hypointense and T2 hyperintense and has a narrow zone of transition. The overlying cortex is intact. It is in keeping with a benign entity such as an incidental enchondroma.\"[/color]\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The MRI reports partial tears in the glenoid labrum (padding in the socket part of the shoulder which helps stabilize the joint), the rotator cuff, biceps tendon, and the teres minor (one of four muscles comprising the rotator cuff).    With failed or failing physical therapy, there is enough pathology (via MRI report) here to consider surgical repair... so a discussion with an orthopedist would be prudent.  The enchondroma is benign but some medical literature reports a slight risk of pathological fracture in which case a malignant transformation would be suspected.  In other words, if it starts hurting, have it evaluated otherwise it is non cancerous and no worry.   Let us know how things turn out.\n\n",

    "content": "Two days ago I suddenly, without any obvious cause, developed severe pain in my right big toe. It is down the left side and across the bottom of the cuticle. It hurts like an ingrown toenail would, but I don't have an ingrown nail. It also hurts across the top of my nail, on the toe, as if I had cut the nail too short, but haven't done that either. I have had no trauma to it all that I'm aware of. It hurts bad enough that I haven't worn shoes for two days. That hasn't seemed to help at all. No \"new\" or different shoes, no tight stockings, no stubbing, etc. It is hurting mildly when I wake up in the morning, seems to get a little better for awhile during the day, but then around 4-5 in the evening it comes back with a vengence. It doesn't seem to make a difference if I'm standing or sitting or laying. Only today I noticed that the entire toe is slightly swollen and mildly red, but doesn't feel like any heat in it. Otherwise, there is just no symptoms that I can see. The strange thing is that when I sit straight up with my feet on the floor, if I cross that big toe over the top of the one next to it, the pain seems to let up some.  The only thing that I have done out of the norm, is I dropped a fire log on the OTHER (left) big toe and busted the right side (meat, not nail) open. I doctored it up and it hasn't really bothered me at all. I know it sounds crazy, but is the right toe doing the \"phantom\" pain thing?  Or is there something else going on? I've looked up everything I could find on toe pain and my symptoms don't seem to match up to anything. Please help! Thanks!\n\n",

The pain & swelling is usually near the knee cap, over towards the left side on the frontofthe knee. The Ortho (Sports Dr) ordered xrays, ultrasound, blood work, etc. All came out good. He said there was no known causes for this swelling, other than he thinks I may have overworked it. He did say there was some fluid retention. Other than that, there was no known causes for he pain & swelling. This same knee acts up like every 2 months or so. Really weird. The other leg is ok and so is everything else. Right now it is swollen and its hurting. This is so very weird. Any ideas?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Structures that can swell in the knee are of course the knee joint itself but there is also a small bursa above the knee cap call the supra patellar bursa which can swell.   The main question to answer is whether this is caused by some damage inside the knee or outside the knee.    An MRI may help rule out cartilage, meniscus (padding inside the knee), bone bruising, and tendonities/bursitis.  A plain xray will not show these defects.  Treatment for pain and swelling are ice, rest, compression and elevation.  Keep us updated.  Write again if you have any questions. Take care.\n\n",

I had 5 stitches put in and kept them in for 10 days.  When I had them removed on Monday, it seemed that the stitch closest to the knuckle hadn't completely healed.  I have been trying to not use the thumb and the gap seems to be closing slowly over the last four days.  I have been trying to immobilize it at night so I don't do any further damage.  I have a couple of questions:  1. Am I doing the correct thing by keeping it immobilized at night and letting the cut completely heal or am I doing damage by keep it rigid like that?  2. When should I start trying to move the thumb and see if there is any permanent damage (the ER doc told me the tendon wasn't cut or partially cut)?  3. Is there anything I should be doing specifically to try to make sure I have full range of motion with my thumb?  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Which surface of the thumb did you cut?  On the palm side or back side?  As long as the skin edges of the wound are closing and no signs of infection, this should heal well.    You can start gentle motion at any time as long as it doesn't place too much tension on the skin causing the small opening to enlarge.  Just do not overdo it.  The opening can worsen and cause a non healed laceration repair (aka dehiscence)...and then healing takes longer.  You will not hurt the thumb by immobilizing it at night.  You will be able to regain motion after another week or so.  If in doubt, check in with your physician to have a look at it.  Take care.\n\n",

Also, it is important to probe her history both personal and family as well as social history (what kind of work does she do, hobbbies, activities).

Given that there was no trauma, or impact, or sudden sharp pain/pop incident, the condition should respond to rest, ice, compression (ACE wrap or neoprene sleeve with open patella), and elevation.   The sharp twinges of pain should subside and full range of motion return.  If any problems with worsening pain, swelling, or loss of motion have a physician evaluate the ligament and meniscus in the office.   No need for xray or MRI at this time.

Xrays and an MRI would help see any stress fractures or tears in the labrum (tissue inside the hip that provides stability)  The new hip pain may be simply an aggravation of a pre existing injury.  For example, regular walking can aggravate a pre existing hip injury.   See a physician who can order any needed imaging tests.  Keep us posted.\n\n",

    "content": "For the past few years I have been experiencing infrequent stinging pain in my collarbone and wrists. Recently it has spread to my hands and I have started to worry. I haven't visited my doctor as it only happens a few times a month and then only for an hour at most. To be honest, I only remember it when it is happening, if that makes sense. I broke my right wrist and dislocated my right index finger a few years ago (before the pain started) but I can't see a link between that and my collarbone. Does this need medical attention? What could it be/ how can I treat it? Thanks.\n\n",

Does the collar bone area hurt the same time as the wrists? Is the collar bone deformed?  It would be good to see a physician who can ask questions like these, evaluate the hands, arms and shoulders and order any needed xrays.  Keep us posted\n\n",

I awoke from sleep and got out of bed unable to put any pressure on my right leg due to a feeling of the top of my leg being \"out of place\". Once I sat back down on the bed for a minute and got back up I was able to put pressue on it. This happens frequently. Also, my range of motion is now limited. Having danced ballet at a younge age, doing yoga now, and exercising, I am not able to fully rotate my legs outward (as in doing a 2nd position plie). This is recent onset. It's irritating. What's my problem?\n\n",

Xrays should be taken and a thorough history and focused physical done.  Several conditions could be causing this pain: inflamation in the bursa (tenderness on the outside part of the upper femur) hip arthritis stress fracture (seen on MRI) groin pull muscle strain/sprain labral tear in the acetabulum (hip socket)  less likely causes: cancer gout referred from the spine  Loss of external rotation of the hip confirms the need to have it evaluated by a physician.

    "content": "This sounds like a patella-femoral problem.  Popping or crunching sounds (aka crepitus) are common reports.  Pain and stiffness may indicate arthritis under the knee cap.     Osgood Schlatter disease is actually is a condition where the cartiledge detaches from the tibial tuberosity (the attachment site of the patellar ligament - just below the kneecap) and causes localized pain and tenderness.  From the location of your pain, it doesn't sound like Osgood Schlatters.   It would be good to see a physical therapist who will prescribe specific patella-femoral exercises.  These should include straight leg raises, mini squats, and stretching (hip flexors, hamstrings, quadriceps, and IT band).  Avoid stationary bike and leg kicks and no deep knee bends or squats until painfree. Use acetaminophen or ibuprofen; ice or heat as needed.  Sometimes a patellafemoral brace helps.   All the best to you.   Let us know how it goes.\n\n",

    "content": "My son had a terrible case of strep throat, and went to a clinic where he was given a shot of penicillin.  It cleared up the strep in about 12 hours, but he started having terrible hip problems on one side.   He is a track and field athlete and actually runs in a race next week.  He was not injured in any way before this infection, and did nothing (but lay around) until he felt better.  He could hardly put weight on that leg the next day because  of the pain.  It is the opposite hip that he received the shot of penicillin.  Could this be related in any way...either the strep or the injection?  He has put heat on it and the trainers have tried to 'rub' it out for him, but to no avail.  Please let me know if you have heard of this before.  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Yes, strep bacteria can and do cauce infection in children's hips.  One source quotes the source of infection from the ears but I suppose any respiratory tract infection could cause it.    Although rare, septic arthritis must be considered since it is a serious condition. Infections in the joint can destroy the entire joint, enter the circulation, and may lead to serious sequelae like sepsis and death.     Ask a physician evaluate the hip for signs of infection (warmth, swelling, pain, and redness; and fever and overall health status).  Xray and CBC (blood counts) may be needed.    Septic arthritis is an orthopedic emergency so make sure the hip is not infected.    Non threatening conditions likely to cause this include tendonitis bursitis (inflamation of bursa on the outside part of the hip) musclar strain or sprain radiating pain from the back.   If a septic (infected) joint is suspected, see a physician right away.   Keep us posted.\n\n",

In your case, three years post injury, it is important to check the strength and stability of the ankle because this pain may be from a re-injury or a poorly healed original injury.  Either way, have a stress xray image of the ankle to see if the bones (tibia and fibula) stay together or separate (unstable) with weight bearing.  If the ankle is unstable, then surgery may be required to fix the bones with screw(s).    Let us know how things turn out or if you have any questions.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: pain in the patella",
    "content": "This is a classic patellafemoral problem.   The patella (kneecap) is a bone within the quadriceps tendon.  The quadricep is the large front thigh muscle that extends the foot (kicking motion) and provides power and stability during squatting and climbing.   Sometimes the tendons around the kneecap become too tight (in your case on the ouside).   Avoid knee extension exercises and deep squats until painfree.  Focus on stretching quadriceps, hip flexors, and IT band.  Strengthen the quads with straight leg raises and mini squats (less than 60 degrees knee flexion ... and light weight - either dumb bells or squat bar on shoulders) Remember to ice.   If this fails, see a physical therapist via your family physician. All the best to you. Keep us posted.\n\n",

    "content": "Yes, this can be rehab'd in 6 months with careful diligence. Yes, the tissue around the knee cap can be tight despite normal quad stretching.  Continue this stretch and focus on IT band.  Research VMO (vastus medialis oblique - a portion of the inner quadricep) strengthening exercise.  This will help too. A patella tendon strap may help too.\n\n",

It has been hurting for several years [at least three or four], and I can't recall ever injuring it.  If I ever step on a rock or any kind of uneven ground surface that makes my foot bend a certain way, it hurts like crazy.  And I know that stepping on a book shouldn't cause excruciating pain.  I have a job where I'm on my feet/walking 5-6 hours a day.  It's getting more and more painful every day.  The ankle will just hurt in general, and sometimes the pain spreads throughout my foot.  I have also been having pain in the ball of my foot, mostly on top of my foot where the joint is.    I don't have health insurance, or else I would have already gone to the doctor.  I was wondering if anyone here could help.  If it doesn't get any better, I will have to break down and go to the doctor.\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for your patience. This sounds like a chronic lateral ankle sprain.  With an ankle sprain, the ligaments supporting the ankle joint over stretch.  Since the ligaments are non contractile tissue they do not rebound easily (unlike a rubber band or muscle tissue).  Therefore the ankle is prone to further injury - even stepping on smal objects or uneven terrain aggravates the ankle.   Some simple measures to help the ankle: 1. When it hurts, apply bag of ice (10 minutes each application) - pearl: place a warm wet cloth on the skin before applying ice bag. 2. Do mini squats: stand with your back against the wall and slide down the wall under knee in flexed about 60 degrees.  Using a ball behind the back make sliding easier but watch your balance. 3. Advanced strengthening exercise: walk on heels and walk on toes.  Do not do if painful.   4. Practice walking up stairs leading with affected foot.  Advance to two steps at a time.   5.  Stand on a straight line.  Close eyes.  Maintain balance.  (Try with affected foot either in front or in back of other foot.)  Before you start these exercises, have the ankle xray'd to rule out fracture.   Any exercise which hurts stop.  Keep us posted.\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for your patience. With most limb pain especially pain without a cause, it is important to check the part of the spine that sends nerves to that limb.  In this case, have a physician exam the lumbar spine - range of motion, tender areas, deep tendon reflexes, nerve stretching manuevers (straight leg raise), sensory check.  If all is well here then move on to examine the hip joint and entire leg. In general, it is important to not only evaluate the portion that hurts but also the joints above and below.   In short, have a physician evaluate the back, hip, thigh, and knee.   Xray of the hip may be indicated too.   Have you tried any heat or ice or over the counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen? Keep us posted.\n\n",

In May 2008 following many months of discomfort & physio therapy an anteria lateral arthrotomy/arthroscopy was carried out to remove the bone fragment. This was then followed by physiotherapy for 3 mths. I continue to experience numbness in my toes, sharp electric pain in the top of my foot & toes, burning sensation in the top of the foot, stiffness and annoying/aggrevating discomfort when laying in bed at night. My two outside toes have dropped and are now curling under my foot. My last visit to the specialist voiced that there is no further treatment and that there could be permanent nerve damage. I am currently back at work full time, however after a couple of hours, pain sets in. At the moment, I am on alternative duties but don't know how long my employer will provide this option. Have one month before work cover will do a final assessment for permanent impairment.

    "content": "Thanks for your patience. Yes, one of the late manifestations of Lyme disease is arthralgias (painful joints) and arthritis (joint inflammation).  The joint problems may start from weeks to months after the infection itself starts.  Usually the symptoms resolve within a 30 day course of antibiotics.   If any joint would continue to be painful, it would be the knee.  The bones in general may also become osteopenic and some specific joint erosions may occur.  In fact, before Lyme disease was discovered, affected children were thought to have juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. In short, Lyme can cause some lasting joint problems especially in the knee.  Less common in the back. Have you had a bone mineral density test?\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 24 year old, otherwise healthy male.  While involved in intensive military training in November of 2006, I fell from a top bunk onto a hard floor.  Susbsequently, I began to notice a moderate pain in my left hip while I was running.  I went to the doctor and was told I had a muscle strain, given 800 mg motrin and sent home with a running exemption.    The pain progressed over the following days, significantly impairing my ability to walk at all.  I was precribed narcotic pain killers and was given a referral to orthopedics.  I was seen by an orthopedist who took an MRI and diagnosed me with a stress fracture on my femoral neck.  I was given crutches and told to stay off it for 6 weeks.  After 9 months of no change in my pain, my stumped orthopedist sent me out for a second opinion.  That orthopedist discovered a bone mass on my femoral head and three seperate tears in my labrum.  He removed the bone mass, repaired what he could of the labrum, removed the rest and inserted micro-fractures where he removed it, all arthroscopically.  I was told to stay on crutches for 8 week.  2 days later, I fell down a flight of stairs.    Six months later, I was still experiencing severe pain.  Having no explaination for it, my orthopedist referred me to a pain management doc.  About this time the military moved me.    The pain management doc I saw here referred me to a physical therapist.  After two sessions, the physical therapist sent me to an orthopedist, who sent me back to the same pain management doc, who sent me back to the same physical therapist, who has now sent me to an orthopedist.  Please, please, please... if there is anybody out there who might have an idea as to what the problem might be, I am begging for you to just throw out some ideas.    Thanks in advance.\n\n",

You may consider doing a repeat MRI or to do a bone scan looking for soft tissue damage or fractures.   If everything is sound structurally, then the process begins to rehab the hip.  With lots of pain this may take some time but I would think a combination of pain management and therapy would suffice.  Consider doing the rehab in a pool at first to take weight off the hip and progress to land activities. Keep us posted.\n\n",

    "title": "Severe Shoulder pain for 3 years, spreading down right side",
    "content": "I am a 21 year old female who smokes less than half a pack a week and has only smoked for 2 years.  After a car accident in late '05 I noticed my right shoulder hurting, especially at work (at the time I was making pizzas at a large franchise).  The pain radiated between the shoulder blade and the spine, heading up towards my neck and into the groove between shoulder and collar bone.  After a month, it spread to my bicep, and I began having numbness and tingling in my hand.  Sometimes I would loose circulation entirely.  I went to my primary care physician, who sent me to an orthopedic specialist, who sent me to a spine specialist, who sent me to a neurologist, who sent me back to my primary care, who sent me to PT, at which point I was out 1000$ and could no longer afford my co-pay and still had no answers.  I controlled it with medication as long as I could, but after a few months each type would stop working and I would have to switch.  Due to financial issues I am now taking over the counter only and my kindeys hurt.  I was given multiple inconclusive diagnosis'.  First was repetitive motion injury or a rotator cuff injury.  The MRI (right shoulder only - no neck, no chest) showed fluid, but no noticeable injury. The orthopedic specialist thought I had Thoracic Outlet - I loose pulse on my right side only when my arm is at chest level or higher.  X-Rays showed no extra ribs or spurs.  The neurologist did an EMG - which aside from being horrible came back normal.  I did physical therapy for 3 months - which made the pain much worse and my arm felt even weaker afterward.  I have continued doing the exercises and have not been able to gain any muscle mass in my arm and the pain and weakness continue to this day.  The pain is much like a knife lodged between the blade - I am unable to move my head when it gets bad. It has been bad enough recently to make me cry.  (I have a very high tolerance - when it's bad it's *bad*)    Shortly after the pains in my shoulder started, I began getting sharp pains on the right side of my stomach, nausea and weight gain (20lbs in last 10 months - my diet has not changed).  Blood work was run  and came back inconclusive.  Recently there have been pains in my chest - just to the right of my heart or down the whole right side - and severe headaches from the base of my skull or my right temple.  The pain in my chest is not so much sharp as it is more like the sort of tight squeeze your heart feeling you get when you are incredibly nervous.  Occasionally I have difficulty breathing.  (I have had these before, but they have been worse last 6 months).  When I cough and sometimes when I swallow, it feels as if there is a lump in my neck, just to the right of my trachea.  A month ago I became suddenly extremely lightheaded, could not breathe, and felt as if the blood in the veins on the right side of my neck had turned to sludge - I could feel it slowly moving through the side of my neck like thick mud.  I managed to grab my inhaler and took some antihistamines - which helped - but when my head cleared my shoulder was in agony and I could not move my arm.  I was not allergic to anything near me when this happened.    Is all of this related, or just horrible coincidence?  I have little money right now and can't spend too much on tests and false diagnosis - but I know I need to go back in for this pain.  What should I request done?  Does anyone know what these doctors have missed?  Please, if anyone can give me any answers, suggestions on what to look for, or general advice I haven't tried yet, it would be incredibly appreciated.  I can't live like this anymore.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Severe Shoulder pain for 3 years, spreading down right side",
    "content": "Thanks for your patience.  It sounds like the chest pain and difficulty breathing may have been a panic attack.  However, talking to your physician would help shed some more light on the etiology of the chest symptoms which sound unrelated to the neck and shoulder pain.    Regarding the neck and shoulder problem, it seems that the motor vehicle accident started the problem.  This mechanism of injury can cause all sorts of pain patterns and dysfunction throughout the spine and shoulder girdle. Were you wearing a seat belt and was this across the affected shoulder? Although not too reassuring, It is not surprising or unusual that you are having this much trouble.  From what I read in your account, the only other test I would recommend is an MRI of the neck to rule out disc herniation.  Since the EMG was normal, an alternate route is to do a series of neck xrays to rule out spondylosis (\"disease of the spine\" like bone spurs or decreased disk height) especially spondylolithesis (slipping forward of a vertebrae).  If xrays are normal then you could proceed with confidence that the structures of the neck are fine.   You could start addressing the shoulder and neck in one of two ways: 1: on your own, start gentle range of motion with the neck and shoulder.  The initial goal or phase is to achieve and maintain full range of motion (ROM).  This should be done gradually and slowly with the use of heat before exercise and ice afterward.  It may take 3 months to achieve this goal and hopefully be painfree.  Again the exercises should be easy and within a painfree limit and slowly increase limit over time. (Your therapist should have given some simple ROM exercises to do at home)  Afterward start a easy does it strengthening program.  Take 6 months for this phase.   2: See a chiropractor who also does a preceeding massage treatment.  Then do phase one and two above (time frames will be shorter if chiropractor helps).  Keep us posted\n\n",

    "title": "Sciatica, stenosis, or zaspopathy?",
    "content": "Severe pain down my left leg put me out of commission for about 2 months recently.  It was diagnosed as sciatica (had the same happen 2 years ago) due to a combination of a herniated disc and a stenosis of the nerve canal.  Unlike the incident 2 years ago, this time I had great pain in the upper frontal muscle of the left leg, having to constantly massage and apply heat/cold to it for relief.  Now that the spinal issue seems to have resolved again (including 2 cortisone injections), my left leg is still weak.  That is no particular surprise, except that it appears noticeably smaller than my right leg - but only the upper front muscle - the one that was in so much pain.  It is weak to the point that stairs are an effort, I cannot squat down on the left leg only (it is unable to support my weight), and I cannot push up from a squating position (knee more than 45 degrees bent).  Until this episode, I had no weakness in the left leg.  I am beginning to become concerned that this was not, at least solely, a herniated disc/stenosis problem.  I've not heard of anything that could cause a muscle weakening like this other than zaspopathy, but there is very little information available on it or it's symptoms.  It has been 5 months since the onset of the problem, and I see no change in the left leg.  In fact, exercise seems to aggravate the situation much more than strengthen the leg.  After even brief exercise I have to be particularly careful about attempting to walk down stairs for most of the day, as the leg has a tendency to \"give out\" much more easily and unexpectedly.  So I'm wondering, is this typical from sciatica/stenosis, or is there something else going on?  And if it's something else, how do I proceed to have it investigated effectively?  Do I need to find a specialist - and what kind?\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for you patience. Zaspopathy is a form of muscular dystrophy which affects the distal leg muscle more that the proximal leg muscle.  Diagnosis is made with history and physical, EMG, and muscle biopsy.  However, your case does not appear to be zaspopathy. The leg problem seems related to the nerve impingement and herniated disk.  An EMG and CPK (test for muscle enzyme in the blood) would help know the extent of muscle and nerve impairment.   A physiatrist can evaluate you thigh problem and do the EMG. Keep us posted.\n\n",

    "content": "Often bone spurs themselves are not the source of pain but the inflamed tissue around them is responsible.  Spurs develop from excessive pressure over time.   So perhaps there is a way to change the way you walk or change foot wear in order to change distribution of pressure in the foot.  It would be helpful to know exactly where the spurs are.  Inflamation can be treated with NSAIDS, ice and heat (if chronic).  Having a physical therapist evaluate your foot and gait may help find out why there is too much pressure in the foot causing the spur. Have you gained any weight lately? Keep us posted.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi! I'm a 28 year old female. I've been having problems with my right collarbone, arm and shoulder for over a year now. Last October, I noticed that my collarbone got enlarged at the place where it meets the sternum. The very place didn't hurt, but i felt pain in my arm, neck and shoulder. I felt some tension in my whole right side of the body. I've been going from one doctor to another.One said it was Cervical Spondylosis, the other Arthrosis.Three weeks ago i returned from the seaside. Since then my condition has changed.The pain disappeared and my movements are not restricted, but my right shoulder somehow sank, it's much lower than the left one, and the muscles near the shoulder blade are extremely weak, i don't even feel them. Ifeel weakness in the whole right side of my body, and when i walk i lean on the right side.My right collarbone seems much longer then the left one. The doctors have taken an X-ray of the right collarbone and the neck. Nothing is seen there. I did an MRI of my neck spine and the conclusion was - Cervical Spondylosis. I'm worried... Any ideas what could it be? Thanks in advance!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Enlarged and longer collarbone",
    "content": "Cervical spondylosis is a general term which literally means \"disease of the vertebrae\".  Specifically, the spine may show: narrowing of the disc space (between the vertebrae),  spurs or osteophytes which protrude out from the spine and may pinch a nerve including the spinal cord  Usually, these changes in the vertebrae are advanced by age and are found in older individuals.    MRI will show any nerve impingement or spurring or disc protrusions/herniations.  I would investigate the exact findings on the MRI and see why the dx of spondylosis was made.  Although one can affect the other, from what you have written, I do not see the relationship between the clavicle and ther cervical spine.       Certainly, neck and shoulder pain can be caused by a problem in the clavicle but I would make a closer examination of the entire shoulder complex including the AC (acromioclavicular), SC (sternoclavicular) and glenohumeral joint.  Also, since the shoulder blade muscles are weak, it is important to rehab this part of the shoulder as well.  Perhaps some physical therapy is in order.  Any scoliosis or kyphosis in the spine?  Mechanically, this would affect the shoulder and clavicle more that cervical spondylosis.    Keep us posted.\n\n",

I have a ruptured posterior tibial tendon  as well as 3 or 4 spurs in dorsal margin (whatever that means) and have seen an orthopedist and he suggests surgery to replace tendon and remove spurs. Most of the pain in my foot is on the opposite (outside) of my foot and ankle and I guess that is from the spurs. I can barely walk by the time I get home from work and I have a desk job. What are the dangers from not having the surgery ASAP, as my insurance carries a high deductible and have to pay all that up front first and don't have right now? I have tried braces, but they do not offer much help with the pain and my foot is beginning to feel very stiff, and can not turn it inward.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Ruptured Posterior Tibial Tendon",
    "content": "Thanks for you patience. The posterior tibialis (post tib) muscle originates from the posterior (rear) portion of the lower leg deep to the gastrocsoleus (big thick calf muscles).  The muscle's tendon wraps around the ankle medially (inside portion of the ankle) and attaches to a couple midfoot bones (eg navicular and cuneiform).  I assume the bone spurs are located at the attachment of the post tib muscle.   The lateral ankle (outside ankle) pain is from compensation.  Your foot probably doesn't like weight on the inside aspect so more weight is born laterally. Plus, since the post tib helps with pushing off during gait, you are probably changing the way you walk causing unusual stress on the foot.   Surgery is certainly a good option especially if the tear is causing more problems with the foot and an inability to walk.   May want to try some crutches or a cane (in the hand opposite to the painful foot) to take some weight off the foot.    Does the other foot hurt or the small joints in the hands?  In other words, could some of the foot pain be from an exacerbation of RA.  Keep us posted.\n\n",

I'm 32,6ft 450 pounds,..sounds like a lot but my Nutritionist I was seeing said if i were 0% bodyfat I'd still weigh 250-260 based on muscle and structure.I have good blood pressure and \"healthy\" for someone of my size.  My problem is I dislocated my left knee in January of '07 slipping on ice, I lost my job of 13 years due to severe Depression after losing my Gramma who raised me since I was 8, so obviously have no insurance ( funny thing of having the same job of 13 years making almost 6 figures with great medical insurance the only thing I saw my Doc for was the occasional tonsilitus and check ups,now that I don't have insurance hell broke loose with one problem after the next,.. story of my life)  so with dealing with the LCL injury on my own ( dislocated my right knee a few years prior and figured I could get myself through this one alone) well from limping I'm getting a severe pain in my right hip area ( left knee is now the problem knee) the pain makes it hard to stand and walk,it starts to shoot out a \"numbing\" feeling that runs down my right leg on the outside and around to my shin area to my foot.it starts to feel like my foot gets heavy and feel I'm ready to collapse, it comes and goes when it gets really bad,to the point I cant stand for more than 5 minutes without having to hold on to something to prop me up and a sharp pain as I walk in my hip.its to the point I have severe Anxiety (sp?) and feel theres no hope for me to ever being back to a productive human being...and sometimes triggers off thoughts of losing hope and suicide.  I don't know what to do anymore, I just need some kind of idea of what it could be and what to do to make things better,I cant take the pain anymore,I'm currently on Disability,I barely make enough to get by, I lost everything I had due to depression ( I know this has nothing to do with my problem,but I just wanna be back on my feet again;literally)  I never went to rehab for my knee because the lack of insurance, I thought by taking day by day and feeling comfortable walking without a cane would help help my LCL get stronger but doesn't seem to help. I go for walks around the block and theres been times I would seriously think of calling a cab to get me home because I felt so unstable and in pain to make it back, but stayed strong and did it.  I used to work out 5-6 times a week, lost 70 pounds in 6 months trying to turn my life around using the gym as my \"drug\" and not Depression medication,it worked til all of this happened, I went from walking miles a day to barely being able to walk from one end of a grocery store to the other without being in extreme pain trying to hold myself up...its taking over my life,.. I just need some kind info on what it could be ( I assume something to do with a nerve) I miss the joys of walking and working out,..in High School I was into hard weight training and power lifting and when starting it again in '06 I really felt great about my life and now feel hopeless with feeling I have limited mobility.  I wanted to throw that out there that I was on the road to getting back in shape and losing weight because I know the weight thing will be an issue off the bat,..\"blah blah blah,.. you should start by losing weight\" and when I hear that I go insane inside because if people only knew how hard I fought to lose the weight I did when I was getting back into it, I was at 440 pounds when I started seeing a Nutritionist and working out, and got down to 370 in 6 months and my target weight was 300.  I apologize for rambling so much, but I have a habit of of soing that to explain myself and I thank anyone who can guide me in the right direction as to what the problem sounds like and treatment. I wanna be me again,..I'm 32 feeling like I'm going on 82.  thank you for your time!\n\n",

Experiencing right thigh or hip pain that travels down and around to the shin sounds like it is referred from either the hip or the lumbar spine.   What's probably happened is that you have been shifting more weight to the right lower extremity (and thus through the hip and lumbar area) to ease the pressure from the injured left knee. I would recommend getting into a pool to work on some leg range of motion, pool walking, and general conditioning.  The water provides buoyancy and will ease the pressure on your spine and lower limbs.   Keep us posted.\n\n",

    "content": "I wasn't sure what board this was best suited for. This past Saturday morning I was shocked by an extension chord that touched the trailer frame or the boat I was climbing into in my driveway. My immediate reaction was that somebody had struck my right calf with a heavy object like a baseball bat. I'm not sure how or why it concentrated in my calf but this was where the immediate shock took place. I had a lot of trouble walking for the rest of the day. My calf was clearly swollen but did not show any external signs of trauma. By Sunday evening I was able to actually flex my leg and walk with a severe limp. Monday I trudged along at a normal pace and my leg seemed to be doing better. What was notable last night is that I have edema....if you were to push into my skin of the front of my shin the indentation would stay for several seconds. This morning the swelling was going down but it is still sore and starting to \"tighten up again\" as I've been using my leg relatively normally.   I did not go the emergency room nor did I call the doctor for this accident. I checked online and everything I read suggestiong medical attention when there are burns or potential cardiac issues or if it was a high voltage shock. At this point I feel \"ok\" but I'm a bit paranoid. My wife and mother are begging me to go the doctor. I have been taking 800 mgs of Ibuprofen twice a day and I would assume this has helped with the inflamation. I do not have a regular doctor. Now my wife and mother are suggesting that I could have a blood clot and that I need to go.   Based on what I've stated....would it be prudent to seek medical attention? I feel pretty good and I hate going to the doctor.\n\n",

    "title": "Many joints have suddenly started clicking",
    "content": "I\u2019m a 41-year-old male and about four months ago some of my joints started to click frequently and audibly. Although it was not too painful, it was uncomfortable. After a few weeks my right elbow became quite sore and I suspected tennis elbow. However I had not been placing any particular stress on that joint.   My job takes me abroad and this summer I spent several weeks in Asia.  Whilst there my left elbow became equally sore and so did my right knee joint.  I also noticed that many other joints in my body started clicking, e.g. my neck, wrists, forearm, ankles and shoulders.  On my return from Asia I visited my doctor.  I explained the problem and history and consequently he carried out a blood test.  I\u2019m not exactly sure what the test was meant to identify, but apparently it came back negative.    My doctor feels that the clicking is just a symptom of old age and inactivity.  Perhaps he is right however the frequency of the clicking has amazed me and perhaps I did not explain this too clearly to him.  Currently I would estimate that the total number of clicks (across all joints) that I 'notice' is between 150 to 200 times a day. Also I can make some of the joints click continuously by repeating the same movement.  Six months ago there was only an occasional click from my knees if I bent down and that was pretty much it.    To provide a little more relevant background my employment circumstances changed about 18 months ago.  Previously I was in a job where I would walk between 2 to 3 miles per day and be constantly in and out of chairs.  My current employment involves sitting at a desk about 90% of the time.  I weigh 103 kg and do not exercise that regularly, I realise I am overweight and do want to address this.  Apart from the clicking and 3 sore joints I feel as normal as I ever did.   Some days the clicking and the sore joints seem slightly worse than others.  Overall it does appear to be getting progressively worse as the weeks roll on.  My doctor instructed me to go back to him if it all became too painful and he would give me some pain relief.  However I find it hard to accept that this is the only option and I still wonder if there is something he has missed.  Thank you in advance of your time and advice on this matter.  Nigel.\n\n",

    "content": "In April of 2008 I had an Aneurysmal Bone Cyst in my right index finger. Most of the bone was destroyed so I had a hiliac bone graft to replace the bone in my finger.  The pathologist said it was unusual to have an ABC in that location. At my last check up the doctor said that the bone was healed, however I only have about 60% range of motion in that hand. Last week I noticed a new hard tender lump, about the circumfrence of a dime that is raised on my wrist.  I have been very achy in a lot of my joints and tired. I probably should have it checked, but won't have insurance again until September. I am concerned about what the new lump may be. Thank you, Buttons\n\n",

Also consider arthritis in the lower extremities or poor circulation (poor venous return).  Other causes of foot swelling include heart failure, cellulitis.  It would be good to follow up with family physician to do a thorough history and physical. The foot pain can be from the swelling itself or from underlying arthritis.   Again, see a doctor for a complete examination.  Your ob/gyn may shed some light on any correlation between the hysterectomy and leg swelling.  Any history of pelvic congestion syndrome?

    "title": "1-2 ribs \"jammed\" into sternum?",
    "content": "I have quite a noticeable bump at the top of my sternum, and it seems like 1 or 2 of my ribs are overlapped on top of the sternum and sort of \"jammed\" in place. I am a waterpolo player, and when doing any form of throwing motion, it puts incredible strain on the area, to the point where I have to stop playing. I have done physio and osteopathy (my osteopath confirms there is tightness of the ribs). An orthopedic surgeon and a radiologist said my x-rays seemed normal. I think the problem originates from doing dips at the gym. Any form of dipping motion or lateral pulldown exercise will leave me with tenderness and pain in the sternum for a day or two. Oddly enough, pressing and flyes do not seem to aggravate it.  The left side of my sternum seems to be worse off than the right, and when I press on it, I can feel tension in my back, along the same rib.   Trying to play \"around\" this injury has lead me to a shoulder injury that has put me off season for at least 2 months, I am looking to try and fix this sternum problem before I get back.  What gives? Do I just keep going to the osteo and hope it gets better? Because that's my plan right now. I'd give anything to be able to do dips again in the gym.  Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for your patience.  The difference between flys/presses and lat pulldown or dips is the plane of motion.  The former is in the horizontal plane whereas the latter is more in the vertical plane.  Since the ribs during respiration move in a \"bucket handle\" fashion, it seems the vertical plane exercise would be more aggravating to a rib problem.   Since there are no fractures or dislocation, continuing with osteopathy or physical therapy would be fine.  There are physical therapists who specialize in rib mobilization and treatment - it requires special training and practice to fix rib problems.    As you can tell, I do agree that thoracic cage is the culprit to your pain and dysfunction. Let us know how things turn out.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, for many months I have been having pains in my left foot/arch area. I assumed it was heel spurs at first, then platar facsitis. Painful for many weeks. I was treating it alternating cold and hot and trying to be off as much as possible. I was also wearing an ankle support that also offered compression in the arch. I am just a stay at home mom, so I don't have a job with prolonged standing or walking. Though I did for 10 years, but it has been 7 years since I gave up work for the Kids. Granted, I am overweight, about 220. NOW--Most recently I have something different going on. It is now on BOTH heels! Usually it's a dull/moderate throbbing when sitting. However, when I get up to walk, it hurts so bad! I walk funny, my son asked if I was limping, he thought I was joking around! Absolutely at it's worse either in the middle of the night, after partially sleeping, or first thing in the morning. It hurts so bad to even get to the bathroom. I dread it. I walk so crazy, like a very old woman. I am just 32! Please, if any of you guys know what this is and some ways I may relieve the pain, that would be great. I do not have any type of insurance and medical attention would be very expensive for me. I'd like to avoid it if it is at all possible. But given that it is as bad as it is, I feel it may be necessary. But if you know what this exactly is and any way to relieve this, that would be great. Thanks for your help.\n\n",

These have been shown in many cases to be just as effective as specially made shoe inserts costing hundreds of dollars.  There are some specially made ones now being sold for under $100.  The inserts take a while to get used to but eventually they can help.  You may also benefit from changing shoes to be sure you have one that will accommodate the insert.    If you are able to tolerate anti-inflammatory medication such as ibuprofen you may find this to be helpful over time as well.    Best wishes\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for your patience. With slipped capital femoral epiphysis, the leg tends to turn outward and away from the body - similar to its tendency now.   Since the initial problem with the grow plate was fixed, the external rotation may be caused from shortened external rotator muscles and/or weak internal rotators.  The position of the leg may have been slowly changing over time and suddenly noticed it - don't know for sure.   An xray and a physical exam of the hip would be helpful and if no instability or dislocation then a few weeks in rehab should help.   Also have your doctor measure the leg lengths - a discrepancy can cause abnormal rotation in either leg.   Keep us updated.\n\n",

    "title": "Unexplained Leg Weakness",
    "content": "In December 2007 I began experiencing left hip, groin and knee pain and leg weakness. Until then, I was an avid exerciser - running, weights etc. No specific injury, and a gradual onset- first with thigh weakness when running. After a month or so, I started to experience severe knee pain for a day or so after a run. Within the next month, the pain spread to my hip and groin, and was so severe that I could not bend my knee after being still for any length of time, sitting was painful, and I walked with a limp and dragged my foot. I went to an Orthopaedic doc for treatment - MRIs of knee, hip and spine negative, as was an EMG/NCS. I stopped all forms of exercise in early March, and the pain subsided in about a month but I was left with residual weakness, a limp, and the pain would return if I tried the least bit of weight bearing activity (walking, etc.).  In June the Ortho referred me to a Physical Medicine doctor for rehabilitation. After 8 weeks of PT and a gradual return to mild exercise, the limp is gone and I can tolerate moderate walking. However I still have weakness in my leg, stairs and hills are difficult, balance is a bit off and I have trouble finding a comfortable sleeping position (lower back pain). I've resigned myself to \"this is how it is\" and will continue with strengthening exercises on my own (stopped PT with concurrence of doctor). The Physical Med doctor working with me is excellent and he is stumped and can't find a cause - although we both agreed to stop looking at this point, further work-up seems pointless for the time being. I seem to be at a plateau and I would love to get back to my prior physical shape, but I don\u2019t want to waste any more time or medical resources. Out of curiosity, - has anyone ever seen anything like this?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Unexplained Leg Weakness",
    "content": "Hello -  What you're describing, while somewhat outside the scope of my expertise, sounds like a syndrome I've come across once or twice, which involves the lateral  myofacia of the thigh, and apparently often mimics both lower back spasm and sciatica, but is felt more on the lateral aspect of the leg. It can be quite painful and sometimes disabling, resembling compartment syndrome. It seems to respond well to intramuscular injection of a steroid combined with another anti-inflammatory drug, the name of which escapes me at the moment. At any rate, the \"cocktail\" is injected into the lateral aspect of the upper thigh and is  often produces relief within minutes -- assuming this is the problem.   The  syndrome I refer to can seem to start in the lower back, radiate  and eventually travel to the groin, and eventually affects the left left lateral thigh between the hip and knee.   I wish I knew the proper name of the syndrome, the anatomy and the drugs used to treat it, but they escape me. It is,  apparently, an often-overlooked condition that can be fairly easily treated if the orthopedist is familiar with it.   I hope that perhaps this will give you at least something to work with. Best of luck to you and please follow up with us and let us know if anything changes.\n\n",

If the insole supports resolve the problem, you guessed rightly. If not, you may need to have him see a podiatrist, as this may be a manifestation of some change due to growth (overall growth) which could,  possibly, require more specialized orthotics. I say this only because the cleats are  the  same type as he used before with no problem.   I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi again -  You're very welcome.   While arthritis can develop in only one joint it's more likely to be bilateral. It would seem most likely this is either due to an injury that went unnoticed at the time or has been caused by an intrinsic weakness in some part of the structure of the knee. The popping sound suggests you may have an inflamed bursa, so this may be simple bursitis. In any case it will need to be evaluated by an orthopedist to determine the true problem, and that will guide the treatment for it. While bursitis often resolves on its own, if it hasn't by now it's probably not going to (assuming that is the problem), so it would probably be wise to have an imaging study done of the knee (either CT scan or, preferably, MRI). However, sometimes a good orthopedist can tell just by feeling and moving the joint.   Non-steroidal anti-inflamatory meds like ibuprofin or naproxyn may help in the meantime, but if this continues you really should have it evaluated, because there is always the danger of making it worse. With three small children to handle you need your agility and range of motion to be at the top of its form.  Best of luck to you. Thanks for your followup, and please keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, about two weeks ago I started to get P & Needles in my thumb, index finger and middle finger ( left hand) ... over the time this changed to numbness .... today it is back to tingling pins and needles. I don't recall getting a knock of bang that might cause this  - but sometimes I do have a habit of sleeping in a crouched position on my left sholder - in the mornings I'd have pain in my shoulder and chest area - but this would dissapear in time. I'd try to desist from sleeping in that position and the problem would disappear. Recently I inadvertently slept in the same position and the pain returned  and the pins and needles then started for the first time. the Pain in my shoulder has now gone but the P & N persist... occasionally I get a pain on the outside of my elbow. I'm not sure if any of this is related to the P& Ns. I suspect I have damageda nerve or something but I'd like to know if there is anything specific I can do (excercises, rest, massage, ice pack, ????) that I could try before I attend a doctor ?  thanks in advance\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Pins and needles / numbness in thumb and index finger",
    "content": "Hi there -  You've somehow got your median nerve compressed or entrapped. It may well be due to the sleeping posture you've described, or it could as easily be due to repetitive motion  injury or could, at any rate, lie somewhere other than the shoulder. It's important to have this problem medically evaluated first, to be certain there's no mechanical cause that might require physical therapy or surgical release. A neurologist would probably be best to evaluate this, probably by performing a nerve conduction study to locate the actual location of the compression or entrapment. Once the location is known the nerve can often be released by manual manipulation or physical therapy, or sometimes even by home exercises and therapies, but while massage is sometimes helpful once the locus is established, the usual rest and icing are unlikely to help since this is primarily a problem of putting something back into its correct  position (either the nerve itself or the body part pressing upon it). There is a significant risk of loss of function if the problem isn't isolated and addressed medically early on, so I'd strongly suggest seeing a neurologist (or perhaps an orthopedist or even sports medicine specialist) sooner  than later.   I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you. Please keep us updated.\n\n",

    "title": "facial deformity - underdevelopment of one side",
    "content": "Hi Doctor,  I'm a female in my late 20s and at the age of about 13 I developed an asymmetry in my face (and body) that had not been present previously. It looks almost as though the right side of my face stopped developing prematurely, while the left side continued onward.  My left side looks more mature and is characterized by stronger cheekbones, higher eyebrow arch and more defined, forward placed jaw (amongst other things) than the right side. The right side seems to be smaller in three planes (height, width and depth/density). As a result, my face looks almost deformed on the right side - it looks like I lack a cheekbone (or it is very low and flat and the orbital doesn't frame my eye the way it does on the other side), and my nose twists toward in the more developed side. It is highly noticeable, particularly when I speak, as my jaw pulls toward the underdeveloped side.  Is there something that can be done to correct this? What could have caused this to develop suddenly during my growth spurt (no one else in my family shows similar abnormalities)? Is this something that I should be concerned about?  I would not ordinary concern myself with some asymmetry, as most people experience some, but this seems to be pervasive throughout my body and significant enough to make me self-conscious about the aesthetic differences. I'm also worried that there may be some kind of underlying condition that may cause further problems down the road.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  What you've described sounds like hemihypertrophy (sometimes classified as semi hemihypertrophy), which may actually be a misnomer, but describes the condition well enough. It is a relatively rare birth defect which doesn't usually become apparent until adolescence. It's caused by a mutation, so that it usually won't show up in the family history anywhere, and it appears to rarely,  if ever, have any significant effect on the general health of the subject, but can be, for some, a significant source of self consciousness. I'm  unaware of any specific long-term problems, although I can conceive of some that could happen in some specific instances. I'm also not aware of any specific corrective measures, although I would think there should be some, again, in certain cases.   While I have known of one person who actually has this problem, I  learned very little from her, as the condition was poorly understood. I can tell you, however, that had the condition not been pointed out to me specifically I might never have noticed it. These things are almost always more evident to the subject than to others, although some people are  bound to notice some discrepancy.   I've already done an internet search for more information (again, years after having met the one person I knew who had this \"problem\") and still can't seem to find anything pertinent. Perhaps discussing this with a specialist in genetic disorders could help shed some light on it. I may also try and locate the subject I'd been acquainted with previously (it's been a long time, but I'm  sure she'd be happy to share any new information -- if I can find her after all this time). Other than that, I've pretty much exhausted my very small knowlege base on this rare variant. I hope this is at least somewhat helpful.   Please stay in touch, follow up with us here as needed, and please update us if you learn anything more about this. In the meantime I'll try and locate the person I'd met a good while ago and if I can, I'll bring back  any additional information she may have accrued in the interim. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

Surgery scheduled for Nov. 12 to re-attach tendon with polyester stitches. Question: are there other options?   Are there issues with the time elapsed from date of incident to date of surgery? Surgery paperwork mentioned they may need to pin the joint.  Why would that be needed? Does this kind of repair last a long time? thanks\n\n",

I am now a student athlete and am experiencing pain in the same area although not as severe. It is very tight and no stretching seems to be helping. Running is still possible but with pain and I am very sore and stiff for a few days afterwards. I do not recall a specific time that could have reinjured this hamstring.

Causes (my list of causes from most to least likely):  1. inflammation from trauma (blunt or repetitive - like rubbing the elbow constantly on the table) 2. infection (particularly if the elbow is red and warm along with the swelling) 3. inflammation from rheumatoid arthritis or gout  What to do: If any reduced range of motion, may suspect fracture especially with trauma.  Xray it.   Besides the swelling, any additional sign of redness, warmth, tenderness, or fever; the fluid should be aspirated by a physician to check for infection.  Plain uninfected olecranon bursitis may respond to RICE (rest, ice, compression, elevation).  Beyond this, having a physician aspirate the fluid and injecting with corticosteroid may bring complete resolution.\n\n",

    "content": "I would look at the mid back muscles (rhomboids and middle traps) for weakness.   I would also look for winging of the scapula.  The serratus anterior muscle stabilizes the scapula and prevents it from winging (tested with a push up against floor or wall).  The long thoracic nerve innervates this muscle and could have been damaged with shoulder dislocations. Pain to the scapula could be referrred from the glemohumeral joint.  Seen an orthopedic physical therapist lately?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there. I am a 25 year old, slim build female.  A few weeks ago I was walking down the stairs and both my knees begun to hurt a lot.  The pain was located at the top of my knee, feels like just under the kneecap.  Then, it went away after a few weeks.    Today I was bent down and went to stand up and my right knee hurt so much it caused me to sit right back down, I was almost crying.  Now every time I am bent down and try to get back up I am in extreme pain,  but this only lasts until I am fully standing.    There is a history of orthoarthitis in my family, but over the age of 65.  I had no injuries to the knee.  My job requires me to be on my feet a lot, but I only work 2 days per week.  I also walk a lot.  Any ideas as to the cause of this?  Why would it appear so suddenly, then leave, and come back in only one knee.  Any information is greatly appreciated.  Ranna\n\n",

I was put on anti inflamatory, put in physical therapy and had my knee taped to help keep it tracking properly.  Unfortunately, I was allergic to the adhesive and had to stop using it but it helped.  The pain does come and go, but when it comes the pain is severe enough that I absolutely cannot bend or walk stairs.   This can last from a couple of days to a week.

    "content": "Specific location of knee pain, aggravating manuevers, swelling, giving way sensation, hx of trauma or injury, a person's sex, weight, previous surgeries, length of symptoms, duration of symptoms, any treatments attempted are all important bits of information in diagnosing knee pain.    Even when we know what is structurally wrong, especially patellafemoral problems, we may struggle to remedy the ailment.  Regarding anterior knee pain under or around the knee cap,  certainly this could be caused by a mal aligned or poorly tracking kneecap.  The best remedy for this is proper stretching and strengthening - usually strengthening the inner quadricep and stretching the IT band (lateral leg muscle).  Women tend to have this problem more because their hips are wider and the femur(thigh bone) angles inward creating more valgus of the knee (inward angulation of the knee).  Sometimes the knee cap can suffer from inflammation...or the bursa (slippery fluid filled sac that help tendons glide smoothly) are inflamed or the tendons or ligaments around the knee cap are inflamed.  All of these structures cause pain.  Certain movements cause pain: going down stairs, going up stairs, standing from a chair, sitting down from standing, reaching forward for an object on the floor (this manuever can be worse of all because a lot of stress is placed on the patella femoral joint).    Other problems of the knee can cause pain with the above mentioned movements - namely bone bruises of the tibia, femur or patella; meniscus tears; internal ligament tears; arthritis of the knee; tendontitis; or fracture.    It is important to treat symptoms.  Avoid aggravating motions.  Maintain the range of motion and strength of the leg (consult a physical therapist for this).  Use NSAIDS per physician.  Use ice/heat.  Remember Ace wraps for support (never met an ACE I didn't like...unless it's applied wrong)  For patella femoral problems, I like to strengthen the inner thigh muscles including the medial quad and the hip adductor muscles (which provide some support for the medial quad).  Do mini squats less than 60 degrees of knee flexion.  Avoid bicycle and leg extension machine.  Straight leg raises may help too.  Lots of quad, hamstring, IT band, and hip flexor stretching.    Again, your family physician can write for physical therapy and recommend NSAIDS (as indicated) and make any other necessary tests (MRI etc)\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Un-even Rib Cage",
    "content": "Hi there -  While it's possible you could have some sort of disease process going on that's causing this, it is really unlikely, and it is very common (even normal) for the left side of the ribcage to be somewhat more pronounced and, in some people, more noticeable than in others. The pain or soreness upon lying on it can  usually be attributed to the fact that the cartilage between the ribs and where they attach to the breastbone can be irritated and become inflamed, sometimes quite easily. When  this happens, pressure on the ribs on the affected side can cause significant discomfort,  but it's not anything serious and, in fact, usually will respond to over-the-counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatories like ibuprofin (Advil) or naproxyn (Aleve). If the problem continues despite home treatment with OTC pain meds, or if it becomes more severe, a doctor should probably be consulted, as it could be arthritic in nature,  although again, this is unlikely and fairly rare, especially in young,otherwise healthy people.  In short, the \"uneven\" ribcage is pretty common and usually normal, and the pain upon lying on one's side, especially the left, is not at all uncommon.   I hope this eases your mind and is helpful as well. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Foot flopping aka foot drop is caused by weakness of the anterior tibialis muscle which is runs just lateral (to the outside) of the shin bone below the knee. In your case, the weakness was apparently caused by a pinched nerve in the back.  Makes sense.  Practice feeling the anterior tibialis with your fingertips while working your ankle forward and backward (like pressing and depressing the car's gas pedal).  As the foot and ankle moves toward you (dorsiflexion) this muscle contracts.  Moving the ankle forward and backward with the leg elevated helps with the swelling.   Another simple exercise is walking on your heels or if this is not possible, stand at the side of bed and do toe tapping to a favorite song or beat - try to lift the toes fully off the ground.    Of course if the swelling and weakness are worsening follow up with the neurosurgeon who will probably do a repeat MRI of the spine.   All the best.\n\n",

    "content": "First, congratulations on running sixteen miles.  I gather from this information that you are an avid runner and log many miles each week. Has there been an increase in mileage more than 10% per week?  Intensity increases above this increase risk of injury. Second, it sounds like the extensor mechanism in the knee has been injured.  The extensor mechanism includes the quadriceps muscle, the quad tendon, patella, the patella ligament, and their respective bursa and the patellafemoral joint structures.   To me, it sounds like the quad tendon or the patellafemoral joint is inflamed.  Not surprising for a runner.  Up and down stairs stresses these structures so if they're inflamed....ouch.  Usually going down stairs is worse than up stairs. The treatment is ice, NSAIDS, rest, and avoidance of aggravating manuevers (this last point must be emphasized).  This is not an injury that you can \"run through\".  After 1-2 weeks, start gradual return to painfree activities; include painfree strengthening (e.g. straight leg raises, mini squats - 30 degrees knee flexion and progress to 60 degrees, and lateral step ups/downs); and plenty of stretching hamstrings, quadriceps and hip flexors.  Don't forget medial and lateral thigh muscle stretching and strengthening.   Some sessions with an orthopedic Physical Therapist will be helpful.  Pearl: many patellafemoral and extensor tendonitis problems worsen with cycling so use caution with stationary bike.  Remember, this recovery takes patience.   All the best.\n\n",

Then the teratology services evaluate whether or not there is any increased incident of birth defects associated with women who have used the drugs.  In this way we get a pretty good idea of what is safe.  NSAIDs can affect the blood clotting so doctors are reluctant to prescribe these in pregnancy.   However, risks and benefits are evaluated in forming the right treatment plan.  There are medications that are considered safe in pregnancy but each doctor must give the go-ahead based on the patient history and the doctor's knowledge of her case.  You should have your wife discuss the situation with the doctor taking care of her.  The Tylenol is considered safe in the meantime but better treatment options are probably available to her as well.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: repairing a torn rotator cuff",
    "content": "The rotator cuff is a set of four shoulder muscles which attach to the upper part of the humerus (upper arm bone).  A torn rotator cuff means a tear in the tendon or tendons of those four muscles close to where they attach to the bone.  With a complete tear, the tendon is re attached to the bone with sutures (stitches) and allowed to heal.  Bone removal or shaving is frequently done at the acromion (the outer and upper part of the shoulder blade).  When this bone is shaved (acromioplasty), it allows more room for the rotator cuff tendon to glide during motion of the shoulder.  In fact, after doing the acromioplasty the surgeon should feel between the acromion and the upper end of the humerus for adequate spacing.  Acromioplasty is standard procedure for rotator cuff tears.  Post operatively, caution must be used to protect the repair.  Gradual return to full motion begins before strengthening.  Strengthening is the last step of rehabilitation.  Depending on your occupation and the success of the repair, return to normal duties should be expected.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Kim -  A subchondral cyst is a cyst that forms after traumatic twisting of the lower body (or sometimes also due to degenerative collagen disease), and is found on the  pubic symphysis. It is extremely common among football players because of the specific contortions  involved in that game, and can cause sometimes exquisite pain. It  may be treated by steroids (oral of injected) and sometimes corrected surgically.   I hope this answers your question. Best of luck to you and please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

A little under a month ago i noticed a clicking in my hip during steep inclines but no real pain.

It's not the first time i've pulled something though so i assumed it was nothing big and did the usual R.I.C.E. and anti-inflamitories. A week after, most of the pain subsided, but my hip (feels like right inside the joint) still burned. I've done no stenuous excersizes since...none what so ever infact. And it still hurts like crazy.  Also, of note, when i squat down and stand up i still have the pop...but its not the actual joint...it feels like somethings grinding against the bone and i can even feel the band of muscle (or whatever it is slip) which i don't feel even remotely on the right side.  i've got a little over a week until i leave for boot camp and i have to admit i'm a bit paniced.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  It's difficult, of course, to guess with great accuracy without being able to do a hands-on exam (which means you should see a sports medicine doctor soon as possible), but it sounds as though you may have torn a muscle or ligament high in the quad area, which may now be pressing upon a nerve, causing the burning sensation. The fascia may be injured, affecting the nerve serving the thigh.   Usually these injuries are amenable to physical therapy and sometimes one or more steroid injections can bring rapid pain relief and aid in healing as well, so long as the muscle isn't overworked prematurely. It sounds as though you've done everything right so far, including resting the leg, but it's now time to get a professional  working on this,  especially if you're to report for duty on time.  I hope this is helpful. I wish I could give you a more specfic answer, but this area of the hip and leg is complex and requires a specialist. Good luck with this. Please let us know how things work out.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  Burning pain, especially when it seems to be close to the surface, is usually caused by an inflamed or irritated nerve. Arthritis can of course also cause pain both within the knee joint and by acretion of cacium and/or debris caused by inflammation and also by this junk pressing on sensitive structures which by nature involve nerves. It's not an unusual symptom with arthritic knee changes nor with pressure on a nerve almost anywhere between the base of the spine and on down to the foot.   If the pain should become constant there are medications to help block it if it is, in fact, nerve pain. If it's simple mechanical arthritic pain, there are cheaper, simple anti-inflammatory meds for this.   Hope this  is helpful. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I agree with Shelly.  As Shelly said, edema occurs primarily when the body retain and accumulate water, a condition caused by either a systemic illness (involving organs like the heart, kidney and the liver) or a local problem affecting the extremities.  Individuals present with peripheral edema (e.g. ankle swelling) should be checked for their liver, kidney and cardiac functions to exclude serious systemic causes.  The most common local problems causing edema are venous insufficiency causes by varicose veins or inflammation of the veins (thrombophlebitis). In these conditions the pump system that forces the fluids to move away from the extremities fails to do so, resulting in accumulation of fluids and edema. As you can imagine, veins in the legs and feet are more commonly affected.  Females and those who stand for long time are at high risk for varicose veins.  Some medications especially hormone containing (e.g. steroid, oral contraceptives) are known to cause fluid retention.  A thorough history and direct clinical examination is essential to reach the possible diagnosis and guide for subsequent investigations.  I would advise you also to follow up with her doctor who may recommend liver, kidney function tests and an EKG. Radiological investigations like Echocardiography and Doppler US on the lower limb are requested as needed.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 23 year old girl. For the past 6 months or so I have noticed a clicking lump just under my rib on the right side about 5 cm out from my sternum and a bit lower. It is not near my floating ribs and is not as hard as my ribs. I can push on it along a length of about 2cm and it will slip under my rib and pop straight back up again like a spring, other times I can't find it at all. I can rarely feel it when lying flat on my back but if I bend forward or change positions it clicks over my rib again. It doesn't hurt to press on it and I don't have any rib pain or pain when I breathe. Occasionally I have noticed that if I am sitting in a position where I'm leaning to the right for a while, that when I move again it hurts. And I occasionally get upper abdomen pain, but I have assumed that is from the gallstones that I know that I have. The only thing my doctor can suggest is that it is a glob of fat or a piece of loose cartilage, but I work with physiotherapists and they've looked at it and don't think it's cartilage. I'm worried about it but don't know whether I should be. I just want to know what it might be and whether I can do anything to get rid of the annoying clicking feeling. Jade  Australia\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  A swelling can be easier diagnosed if any associated symptoms exist. Your description is very suggestive of an extramuscular, subcutaneous mass mostly lipoma.    Lipoma is a benign tumor of the fat tissue. It usually affects the trunk and the thigh.   Lipomas is usually a soft swelling, painless and freely mobile (sliding). Lipomas are painful when they get infected or when they are big enough to cause compression on underneath neurovascular structures.  The condition does not usually need intervention unless reaches a large size or in a critical site causing mechanical compression.  Follow up with your doctor is essential especially if it enlarges or causes significant discomfort.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  It sounds as though you've pulled the tendons on the top of your foot, which can be really painful. You would probably do better with a crutch or crutches, especially if your ankle is already weakened by a previous injury. Go back and let the facility where you were treated and request a pair of crutches (and make sure they fit you for them before you leave). This will allow the foot to rest, take pressure off the ankle,  and will allow things to heal a whole lot faster, while avoiding favoring the foot, which can cause other problems from walking funny (which is the only thing you can do right now, without those crutches).  Hope this is helpful. Best of luck  to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi again -  This certainly has taken some odd twists (no pun intended). If you do have a stress fracture, those are generally more painful that anything else, and can be managed a number of different ways, essentially based on the location and what works best for the patient. These measures can range from a walking or soft cast to something as inobtrusive as an orthotic to be placed inside your shoe (or shoes, if balancing the effect is necessary). Generally it is more of a nuisance than anything else, but whatever device is used tends to make walking more easy or at least less painful, with the added benefit of helping the fracture to heal.   It's a pretty common finding, especially in sports medicine, so don't be too surprised if this turns up positive. It could be a lot less complicated than some other things. Good luck to you. Please let us know how things work out.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 33 year old female, no other health issues, no medications (except for Mirena IUS).  I have had recurrent trouble with my right shoulder for about 10 years now. The initial injury was a subluxation, the shoulder stayed out for approximately 1-2 minutes and then popped back in on its own as soon as I tried to move.  I was in physio for a couple months and eventually gained full mobility and was pain free.   Over the last 10 years I have noticed however, that the shoulder pops and cracks on almost every movement especially overhead, and sometimes feel likes it catches on the way up.  These sensations were not really associated with pain but if it happened too much would cause a vague aching that would radiate down my arm.  Last year, I was firefighting climbing down a ladder and got caught up, and my arm got pulled on.  I subluxated it again.  This time, I was sent to physiotherapy for a consult, and given exercises to do at home, but could not attend regular appointments because I was being deployed and they felt it was not serious enough to keep me at home. After a few weeks I was pretty much pain free and had full movement but my shoulder never felt quite right after that.. like it felt kind of out of alignment if that makes sense. I also had regular bouts of vague aching pain right down the outside of my arm, sometimes to my pinky finger.  These bouts of aching would happen with no apparent trigger that I could pin point.    A couple months ago, I once again injured the same shoulder.  It came out and went back in very quickly (within seconds).  This time they did x-rays.  They found a \"small spur on the anterior lip of the glenoid\"  and I was told this was more likely a result of a past injury and not from the most recent one (or the cause of it).  I am also back in physiotherapy and the physiotherapist mentioned 'instability'  I am awaiting a consult with an orthopedic surgeon, but in the mean time would like to know what will most likely happen from here and what is most likely going on with this shoulder?\n\n",

I just want to say that if the Ortho. surgeon you see wants to do arthroscopic repair, I would seriously consider it. Sometimes the results are positive, but other times, the result is very unpredicatable and can leave you worse condition- and they seem to leave that part out.

    "content": "Thanks for your response, but I was hoping to get some actual medical answers because I am in the Navy, and just leaving this issue alone is not an option.  It affects my ability to be deployed, and hence my career.  I did see the Orthopedic surgeon in the mean time since I posted this, and he suggested a possible Labral Tear as the cause of the catching and clunking.  And also the spur is visible on the xray, and he said that was a good culprit for the aching as was the possible labral tear itself.    He said surgery is a probability but he is sending me for an MRI arthrogram (with the dye) in the mean time.    Now that I have this extra information, I'd like a second opinion on whether a labral tear could be cause of the aching/clunking or not, and if surgery is really necessary.  As well, is the instability the underlying cause of all of this in the first place?   And how long is recovery from surgery (arthroscopic) to repair this - is there a lot of pain associated with this type of surgery? How long will I be out of commission work wise?\n\n",

    "title": "Ankle Sprain Recovery",
    "content": "I suffered an ankle sprain over four days ago while playing basketball. I went immediately to the ER and had X Rays taken. No fractures were found. I have been taking ibuprofen, resting, icing and elevating. (For whatever reason the doctor didn't mention compression and I've seen on other websites that they don't make it a priority for ankle sprains.) I have been using crutches and yesterday began walking on my ankle - with minor pain and taking very small steps. One concern that I have is that my ankle, foot and lower leg are still very swollen. Considering the information I've shared, I have the following questions:  1- Is swelling of the ankle, foot, and lower leg normal after four days? (Many sources seem to assume that swelling has subsided after the first couple of days.) 2- Should I wait for the swelling to go down before walking and beginning ankle exercises? 3- Should I continue taking ibuprofen, icing and elevating until the swelling goes down? (Many sources recommend icing for the first 1 to 2 days.)  Any help is very much appreciated!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  Swelling from a significant sprain can last up to a week. It should start to diminish by now, but may take another day or so, depending upon how much time the leg is vertical vs. horizontal and elevated. Icing probably isn't wise beyond the first few days, but ibuprofin for pain, and elevating to reduce the swelling are still appropriate. If things aren't better within a week, follow up with your doctor, but some sprains can cause residual soreness and muscle weakness for some time afterward.   I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Tenosynovitis in left ankle",
    "content": "Hello -  Tenosynovitis is usually more or less a chronic problem (although it can go away entirely for long periods and sometimes forever), and some people are prone to it. It tends to run in families,  as does the tendency to form excess scar tissue, which in your case seems to have aggravated the problem.   Has your doctor attempted to drain the synovial space and treat the problem with anti-inflammatories? This could possibly be a workable alternative to repeated surgeries, which would likely only cause additional scarring and continue the cycle of irritation and new problems.   I wish I could give you something more to work with, but this can be an ongoing and pretty uncomfortable problem, but anti-inflammatory drugs can often help get you a little bit ahead of the problem.  Best of luck to you. Please keep us updated.\n\n",

It says that I now have Tenosynovitis in the extensor digitum Longus tendons in my foot. This was just resolved through surgery in July for Posterior Tibialis Tendons. I also since July, have developed a bone spur, plantar fasciitis. I have been back to work for 2 weeks, and am at the point where i can hardly walk. My pain doesn't go away, ever. in fact, it seems worse than ever if that is possible. I guess i just don't understand that it seems like after i have surgery for one thing, 4 more pop up in its place. Why does my Tenosynovitis keep coming back?also can you tell me what small ankle and subtalar joint effusion means? My surgeon has decided to send me to a ankle specialist, but my wait time is 3 months, i am so afraid that soon i will not be able to walk, and will lose my job, any advice or suggestions would be great.  Thank you for your time, Jenna Sisler\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Tenosynovitis in left ankle",
    "content": "Hello Jenna -  I'm sorry to hear you're now having this problem. It is possible (I'm somewhat out of my depth wth this) that the recurrence of tenosynovitis is either a) the result of unconscious favoring of the foot due to previous injuries and surgery or b) that you have some sort of autoimmune problem that's been aggravated by all the injury and intrusion into the area. Then again, I've just recently learned, some of this is considered a \"variant of normal\" for some patients. I'm not sure how that could be, but it's what I've been able to pick up in my researching this.  Plantar fasciitis will cause sometimes excruciating pain, but is treatable. It's probably also related to slightly abnormal adjustments to your gait because of the earlier injuries and surgeries. This is likely the greater part of your problem right now, and the long term outlook for it is good, but it can take months to fully correct, even with the full battery of treatments available (including physical therapy, supportive shoes, resting of the foot whenever possible, corticosteroid injections, use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, etc.). Then the small effusion in the ankle and subtalor joint is just an accumulation of fluid in the ankle mechanism, usually not too big of a problem in itself, and probably secondary to all the other stuff going on in there.   Because of the plantar fasciitis alone, you may possibly be looking at a period of disability or reduced ability, so you may as well explore your options regarding this, in order to protect your job or at least your income. A lot will depend on how the treatment of that goes as well as the visit with the ankle specialist. The plantar fasciitis should be treated aggressively, though, so that it begins to resolve as soon as possible. The tenosynovitis will have to be evaluated in light of the overall foot/ankle problem, to determine whether or not you're going to need addtitional surgery. It may be avoidable if the other problems can be stabilized.  I wish I could give you a better answer than this, but for some people,once a jointed area of the body has been insulted, things become chronic, since each part is load bearing both separately and jointly. I'd go with getting the worst things better first, and I think right now probably the fasciitis is going to be your most disabling problem, but also the most readily treatable. Healing time will be the main concern.  Best of luck to you with this. I hope this answers some of your questions and concerns. Please stay in touch and let us know how things go.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 32 yo female, 7/08 I had a type 2 slap repair and posterior plication along with rc debridement. 11/07 I dislocated my r. shoulder that resulted in multidirectional instability, physical therapy held no benefit. After the above surgery was performed, within two days I noted a very anterior shift of my right shoulder, I remained pain free and very numb until day 8- then unbearable pain set in, not only in the shoulder but to the finger tips. I began pt in the 2nd week, at first prom was going well then it began to regress quickly, I began having severe skin sensitivity along my forearm and upper arm, no medication cut the pain, my right shoulder began to shift forward even farther, and I lost my posture, with my shoulder now sagging downward about 4 inches or so, my shoulder blade has no independent movement from my upper arm. I have no external rotation. I have the ability to elevate my arm about 25 degrees but nothing more if it my arm is not assisted. My arm does not even sway when I walk. The pain is intense into the bone, with severe joint tenderness in all jointed areas to the finger tips. Intermittent swelling in my hand also. I have a swollen lump that has developed below the ac fossa, and a tendon that snaps when I turn my hand (snap is in the area between lateral side of wrist and elbow). My surgeon did not address these issues other than the possibility of RSD, and maybe going in later and doing an arthroscopic release. This is under worker's comp. the situation is so bad, the surgeon would not communicate with my physical therapist after at least 9 calls to him, I never seen him after surgery until a demand to see him at 6 weeks because I was so miserable. WC intervened in this matter due to the rapid deterioration of my condition, I was sent to another orthopedist, at first he didn't want to give much of an opinion because he works out of the same network as the initial surgeon, he said all surgeons have work they are sometimes not proud of. He did at least note that there is very marked atrophy of my upper shoulder in the rc area, and it appears that my deltoid does not fire ( it is actually a painful knot in the middle of my arm.) He wanted me to go back to the first surgeon to see what he may have to say at this point, and I did (note: that I have an r.n. case manager that assists me to these visits now since I have received such substandard care) The original surgeon felt there was no problem other than possible rsd and to set me up for scalene blocks. My work place was so ticked off- they put their foot down so I did not have to go back to that surgeon since I have been treated so poorly. I then returned to the new orthopedist- he ordered for me to have an emg and to begin ganglion blockers- in which that appointment is still 3 weeks away. I am in so much misery I don't know what to do. My neck is starting to bother me, it feels like it is strained, and I now hear and feel slight crunching from time to time when I move my head. I would like to have some direction from a very honest ethical doctor that cares. They tried to now refer me to another orthopedic doctor but he felt the case was too complicated. Now they are talking with another orthopedic surgeon that is looking at my case to see if he will accept it. I don't want pills. They don't work. I want this repaired as much as possible, I want pain relief. I want to enjoy daily living. I feel very alone in this situation, I don't know if it's time to get a lawyer to help me. But dealing with worker's comp. is such a miserably slow process. This is jeopardizing my job. It is killing my livelihood. Please, some good hearted ethical doctor out there, give me advice of what to do. I just want to have my life back.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  I'm not a doctor, but I  can certainly understand your very clearly described problem. First, yes, you've received substandard care. I've seen this happen before, and these things can be repaired, but sometimes the process is far too slow, as you're discovering. I think, given the incredibly inept surgery (and I gather that worker's comp is also involved), along with the deteriorating situation -- which almost sounds as though the clavicle was somehow displaced, which may be causing gross thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS), that if you are unable to get anyone to act in a timely manner then an attorney is your next stop. The original repair sounds as though it was completely incompetent,  and while the legal process could also be quite slow, it should at least get some of the hired help moving, including the pain management specialist. It may not happen over night, but if you know things are starting to move you'll feel better even if you're still in pain.  Please follow up with us here as needed. I know of no specific medical advice that will help, but certainly you need a game plan.  The attorney is not usually a part of that, but in  cases like this (and they do happen) sometimes an attorney is an essential part of the team.  Best of luck to you, and please stay in touch.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  While I haven't heard of this supplement specifically, and while it would seem unlikely to cause any harm, I can tell you with reasonable certainty that it won't yield the desired result, either. Growth, especially vertical growth, is determined partially by genetics and partly by the workings of the pituitary gland. Nothing you can apply externally is going to cause any change in your height with the possible exception of platform shoes (not a permanent solution).   I hope this is helpful to you. If you really feel you suffer from an abnormally short height and are still in a stage of life where you might be able to grow, seeing an endocrinologist would be your single best bet, but if you are out of your early teens you're probably fixed at your current height. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, either.   I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It is unusual to gain height at this point in your life but some men have done it, though not through any external means, pills, powders, potions or exercises.  For some reason they have a sudden growth spurt, even at age 19.  I know of nothing to help this condition beyond painful and minimally effective bone-lengthening surgery.  I do NOT recommend this.    It is more important that you come to terms with the body you have, take good care of it and work on your strength and overall health.  Eating a good, healthy diet is your best defense against growth restriction but as you know, genetics do play a role. There are many cases where a child ate very healthy food with lots of vegetables and then he surpasses his parents by several inches.  There is no way to know if you are one of the exceptions to the rule of growth patterns in humans.    I hope you will come to feel good about yourself.  Building body strength can be very good for the self-esteem.  Your body becomes healthy, strong and attractive in ways that are not related to height.  I know this is not the answer you were hoping to find.  Best wishes.\n\n",

It is a common fracture when one falls on an outstretched hand. Yes, go get it examined! It has a poor blood supply and may begin to heal & feel better only to give loose latter. I had a bone graft taken from my left hip in an attempt to mend it Oct.'07. Unfortunately there was too much necrosis of the one (and only) vein that suppies the scaphoid and the boneis now dying. I now face further sugery in the winter when my Dr. will take another graft from a more veinious bone. Get this taken care of before your in my shoes. I'm 41 with 2yr. old twins and having a bum wrist sucks!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, have not posted here in awhile. My situation had improved and i now have a setback. I tore the bicep tendon originally on 11/2006 and had Pin palsy for 4 months afterwards.I recovered form the palsy but I have severe tenosynovitis on the back of my hand from too aggressive of a rehab regiment, I believe since 5/2007. I cannot move my hand up from the horizontal positon with fingers extended and have a lump on the back of my hand. 3 cortizone shots later and it keeps coming back. i read that recovery from this surgery is fairly quick. Can you shed some light on recovery time? Is it probable that the tendons will eventually rupture if I live with it. I fear surgery due to the nerve damage I suffered the last time I was operated on. My Doctor recommends surgery but I hate to miss work for a long time again.  Thank you for your thoughts, Mike T\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  It's unfortunate you had to have such a painful negative experience with the original tendon repair, but after three cortisone injections having not resolved the problem in your hand, surgery is probably the only good approach to making this right. It is impossible to know for certain whether the tendons will rupture in time or not, but if that were to happen it would only force the issue of surgery and make it more difficult since by then there will likely be some sclerosing of the inflamed tendons. Surgery for this is generally very simple and the recovery time relatively quick. Complications are not common. If it were me, I'd go for the fix now, while the odds still favor a fairly easy repair.   I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

Unless there is a gross difference between bilateral body parts there is almost never anything to be concerned about, and when there are gross differences there are usually other symptoms as  well.

    "content": "About 3 years ago the joint of my big toe on my left foot became VERY sore. It swelled, turned red and I couldn't even lift it. I didn't go to the doctor until the second time it happened which was about 5 months later. At that time I was diagnosed with possible Gout. I now have an episode every couple months which started in my left toe but now is in my right toe, both ankles, my knees and now my should. I was told I may not have Gout because each episode lasts anywhere from 5 to 14 days and no medication as of yet has helped. I was also diagnosed with a form of Psuedo Gout (doctors actual term) and they wanted to start giving me horse tranquilizers. My family doctor is great for treating a cold and giving physicals, but I need some help because the pain is just too unbareable. When the probem moved to my right knee, it swelled up to the size of a cantelope and I had to have it drained twice. My current situation today is that now my left knee has swelled up and very painfull (can't walk), I had it drained two days ago but it's getting large again. Also I know have a severe pain in my right shoulder. There is a bone on the top of my shoulder about 4 fingers length away from my neck that is swollen and I can't raise or move my arm. The best way to describe the pain is that gravity even hurts. I have even went to the emergency room a couple times because I couldn't stand the pain. I feel that only someone with the same problem can understand how bad it gets, because it's just unexplainable. I can't move when this happens. I am at my wits end and don't know what else to do. I can't believe that a doctor would tell me that this is just something I have to live with, which is what I have been told. Can someone please direct me to a diagnosis or at least the correct doctor/specialty to seek?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  It certainly sounds like what you're describing is widespread gout. While  gout almost always starts in the big toe, it can spread to other joints, and is often accompanied by hyperuricemia, which is diagnostic when present (it doesn't always show up, however). Gout can also be a misdiagnosis for chondrocalcinosis, which presents in a very similar fashion.  \"You're just going to have to live with it\" is rarely an acceptable response to a severe medical problem, and if you have gout or a similar, related disease there are treatments for it. While colchicene used to be the drug of first choice, now indomethicin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatories are preferred because the are more effective with far less potential side effects. Another  family of drugs with even less side effects are the glutocoticoids. There are, in other words, plenty of medications besides horse tranquilizers which work well with this family of diseases and should be tried before you're told to \"just live with it.\"   You need to have your uric acid levels checked (I'm sure this has been done), and you may need to be followed by a rheumatologist to be sure this is treated properly.   I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you, and please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

Then 4 days ago, I woke in the middle of the night (usually within an hour of falling asleep) in severe pain, there is numbness, burning, tingling, cramping and shooting pain that will eventually lead to my elbow.  There is a consistent throb in my thumb. My hand can be numb for hours. They (the fingers) feel swollen but they aren't. Massage, Nsaids, Ice and rest are not helping. I don't have medical insurance, being a single mom, and I am about ready to head to the ER. However,  if there is a possible home remedy for this, I would love to hear it. I have read about arthritis, carpal tunnel and trauma.. there was not injury, no repetitive movement and It is only one hand.  I am right handed and an artist, so this is affecting my work ... aand IT HURTS!!! (sorry for the caps, but I have an exceptionally high pain threshold and if it hurts me, it REALLY HURTS!)

    "title": "Re: Severe Pain and numbness localized in r hand",
    "content": "Hi there -  What you describe certainly sounds like nerve pain. It could be carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), especially since you are an artist and since this is affecting your work and involves your dominant hand. It could, however, also be ulnar neuropathy, which can be a part of CTS, of the more controversial thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS), or be due to a nerve entrapment that can happen sometimes without any obvious trauma.   CTS is worth consideration because it can cause compression of the ulnar nerve and cause the same symptoms (plus,somtimes,  swelling or puffiness of the hand). CTS is due to a traumatic, postural or congenital narrow outlet between the collar bone and the first rib, where the ulnar nerve (which serves the 4th and 5th fingers, the thumb, and the outer (pinkie) aspect of the hand.   Pain and numbness from ulnar neuropathy of any origin can sometimes be retrograde back to the elbow, and this is often the location of the nerve entrapment.   An  orthopedist or neuroligist (preferably the latter) can usually sort this out and, often with the help of a nerve conduction  study, determine the location of the entrapment. It then can often be resolved via physical therapy or minor surgery.   Carpal tunnel syndrome can cause similar symptoms, but is often erroniously diagnosed in place of CTS or ulnar neuropathy/ TOS.   I hope this is helpful, and I actually have known at least one artist who developed this problem as a result of unwitting faulty posturing during her work. Just a thought.  If ulnar neuropathy is the diagnosis and no medical therapy is helpful there are some home exercises that can be done which sometimes can ease the discomfort, especially if the impingement is located in or near the cervical spine. Unfortunately, it is impossible to show you diagrams of these exercises here on the site. A doctor could provide these, however.  Best of luck to you. Please follow up with  us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I will do my best to explain my history and where I am at now, for the purpose of receiving the most professional response from you as possible. I'm a 22 year old male, 6' 2\", with what I feel is almost abnormally large hands and feet. (12 1/2\" foot) (8\" from wrist to top of middle finger) About 5 years ago my toes started locking into a bent position and I experienced what I felt was a broken metatarsal bone in one of my feet from walking too much in sandals. They continued to get worse and eventually sealed into the curled position and very large caluses formed.  I decided to have surgery performed on all my toes, on both feet, at the same time. I think the doctor said he fused the toes and had to cut the tendons. Anyway, that was a year ago, and the mtp joint in my foot is now completely rigid and bent upward, and there is a huge callus under it, and it seams my heel bone is growing as well. It is very difficult to walk smoothly or even balance, and now me knees are starting to fail. When standing there is such a bad distribution of weight in my feet that it feels its all in my lower femur and knees all the time. The muscles on the outside of my thighs is growing large and the inside seems to be wasting away. Also, my upper legs seem to be angling inward and then my calves go outward, and its getting worse. The inside leg part of my knee seems to be pointing inward, and its making fitting into pants difficult as well. Almost resembles knock knee. I feel that this is all because of the surgery. Before it at least weight was distributed through the ball of my foot and toes, not its all my knees, heal, and middle of my foot, and my lower body is deteriorating. I would just like to know what you think is going on and what steps I should take from here. THis also raises the question of rhematoid arthitis? Please help. Thank you!\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 40 year old, fairly active female.  5'5\" and 140 lbs.  A few months ago I twisted my knee or something, no actual 'accident', and awoke the next morning to excruciating pain and difficulty to walk.  There was never any bruising or swelling, and ibuprofen and icing helped.  I have also bought a neoprene brace for when I'm hiking etc.  I exercise quite frequently, usually 4 - 5 times per week, cardio and weight lifting, and have made a point to be more cautious with any activities that are taxing on the knees.  And I started taking glucosamine, which truly does seem to help.  I am no longer in the pain I was before, but do have days where I just seem stiff, others where I have pain, sometimes if I sit or stand too long, doing the opposite will cause a bit of stiff pain or feel like the knee might give out, but it never has.   I have done quite a bit of research and had decided that its the medial meniscus which is probably bothering me and went to see an orthopedic surgeon a couple of weeks ago to get his impression and find out options.  I must note that I don't have insurance, so I pay my own way on everything, but often facilities will give me a 10% or so discount for paying cash at time of service.  The ortho suggested after doing some rotations with my leg that he thinks I have some tears on the medial meniscus cartilage, and that he would suggest that I get an MRI, and that the course would be to have arthroscopic surgery.  I am wondering if there is any way a regular knee x-ray can show such tears, cause as one compares $80 vs $600+, it becomes a bit harder to swallow.  I also understand that it will be about $3,000 for the surgeon's fees, but nearly $7,000 for the facility, even though it's outpatient.  I am somewhat accepting of the surgeon's fees, but think the facility is exorbitant... I am also wondering what alternatives there are instead of actually going through arthroscopic surgery... are there other ways of working to heal this sort of injury? and what types of exercise and activities are ok to pursue?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Medial Meniscus Tear",
    "content": "Hello -  I certainly can sympathize with your concern over the costs involved in treating this problem without insurance. It then becomes a personal decision based on what is feasible for you vs. being able to function over the long haul.   The problem with x-ray of the knee is that while it is sometimes possible to visualize some gross injury to the meniscus, it's not really worth the trouble and expense to do it, since it won't yield the specific imagery required to arthroscopically repair the injury if you decide on that. MRI will yield very accurate imaging and allow for a precise surgical approach.   There's not too much you can do to make the thing heal on its own, which is why surgery is usually the preferred route. You may be able, via use of a brace, to keep it from getting worse, and usually the limiting factor is pain and/or completion of the tear (rendering the knee not only very painful but unable to function).   I would suggest using pain as a guideline for limiting yourself as far as activity goes, assuming you keep it braced and don't try anything overly demanding, but still it is likely to remain painful and will probably get worse. You don't want to make the surgery an emergency affair for sure.   Continue to take the glucosamine if it seems to help (and a lot of people swear by it), but don't depend on it to cause proper healing (or any healing at all). Hopefully you'll find a way to finance the repair. It's a shame things have come to this, but it's all too common nowadays, and we have to weigh the possible risks vs. benefits of paying what seem like outrageous costs for healthcare that too often can become unavoidable.   Best of luck to you. Please do follow up with us here.\n\n",

    "content": "In December 2007 I began experiencing left hip, groin and knee pain and leg weakness. Until then, I was an avid exerciser - running, weights etc. No specific injury, and a gradual onset- first with thigh weakness when running. After a month or so, I started to experience severe knee pain for a day or so after a run. Within the next month, the pain spread to my hip and groin, and was so severe that I could not bend my knee after being still for any length of time, sitting was painful, and I walked with a limp and dragged my foot. I went to an Orthopaedic doc for treatment - MRIs of knee, hip and spine negative, as was an EMG/NCS. I stopped all forms of exercise in early March, and the pain subsided in about a month but I was left with residual weakness, a limp, and the pain would return if I tried the least bit of weight bearing activity (walking, etc.). In June the Ortho referred me to a Physical Medicine doctor for rehabilitation. After 8 weeks of PT and a gradual return to mild exercise, the limp is gone and I can tolerate moderate walking. However I still have weakness in my leg, stairs and hills are difficult, balance is a bit off and I have trouble finding a comfortable sleeping position (lower back pain). I've resigned myself to \"this is how it is\" and will continue with strengthening exercises on my own (stopped PT with concurrence of doctor). The Physical Med doctor working with me is excellent and he is stumped and can't find a cause - although we both agreed to stop looking at this point, further work-up seems pointless for the time being. I seem to be at a plateau and I would love to get back to my prior physical shape, but I don\u2019t want to waste any more time or medical resources. Out of curiosity, - has anyone ever seen anything like this?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  You may have a problem with a nerve being compressed, pinched or entrapped. Although no one has found any lower back problem on imaging, I can't help but feel there is something either involving the lower back or, perhaps, the sciatic nerve itself, which could  be caused by a non-orthopedic problem. This is unusual, but it can happen. Perhaps a neurologist could be consulted and might run a nerve conduction test to see if the muscles in your leg are even getting the message or if it's being short-circuited somewhere along the way. Sometimes we can develop peripheral neuropathy (inflammation of one or more peripheral nerves) for no apparent reason, too. An electromyelogran might help pinpoint  the source of the problem and then the appropriate steps could be taken to correct the situation.  I hope this is of some  help to you. Best of luck and please do follow up with us.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Finger swelling during swimming?",
    "content": "Hello -  While I can think of no disorder that would cause this only under the conditions described, there is a phenomenon, usually seen when walking or in tennis players, where the fingers and sometimes the backs of the hands, become puffy and uncomfortable during and immediately after exercise involving the repeated use of force and/or dependency of the  arms (them hanging and swinging as happens when  walking). There is a theory which makes some sense to me, that the activity involves a certain amount of centrifugal force, pushing more blood into the hands. The same would hold true for exercise involving the upper body and arms,  since swimming involves these (and pretty much all the voluntary muscles). Since it resolves after you're done swimming and causes you no other problems,  it would seem to be a benign change related to the activity, same as \"walker's hands.\"   Hopefully this is helpful to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi  I've had a pain near by left shoulder balde on and off for about the past 2 months.  The pain is over an area about the size of a hand and is centred between the top shoulder blade and spine.  It feels like a cut / open wound and applying touch pressure intensifies the pain.  It is really irriated by the normal movement of clothing over the skin and feels just like a scrape / spot / graze does.  There is no markings on the skin, no redness, spots or anything - there are 2 small moles in the area (which I've always had), but they do not appear to be the epi-centre of the pain.  The pain tends to get worse towards the end of the day.  It isn't any sort of ache or jarring sension and I've not sustained any injury to the area - the only way I can describe is as above.  I've tried searching on google, but I'm not sure how to describe it in a few words!  I feel stupid going to my doctor with a pain I find difficult to precisley pin point when there is clearly nothing visible on the suface.  Any advice would be appricated.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Pain Near Shoulder Blade - Feels Like Open Wound",
    "content": "Hello -  What you describe sounds very much like nerve pain. Sometimes a superficial nerve can become irritated or inflamed (peripheral neuropathy, shingles, etc.) and will be sensitive to touch, to clothing, and will often just be sore, exactly as you describe. Other than shingles, which has skin lesions at first, causes of this problem often have no visible signs.   My main concern here is the fact that there are moles in the general area of the pain, and because of this the area should be examined by a doctor to be certain the moles haven't caused any problems with nerves in the skin or underlying tissues. If not, then there are medications to treat this sort of discomfort, depending on how bothersome it is. But first you need to see a doctor and find out exactly what, if anything, is going on (sometimes these nerve pains have no traceable cause).   Good luck to you, and please do follow up with us here.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, sorry if this is not in the correct sub forum, this is the closest section I could find that deals with my sort of problem.  My problem is, after walking a very short distance, say 100 metres or so, my shins give me a lot of pain, and I can't bend my foot up or down to continue to walk, I'm not sure I explained that bit very well about the foot, what I mean is, I can sit here now, lift my foot and tap the floor with no problem, but when walking, my feet seem to seize up at the same time as my shins, so that there is no upwards or downward movement, so I wouldn't even be able to tap my foot for example, due to not being able to move my feet very much.  I have had this problem for many years now, I think it might be a result of my something I did years ago, which was walking about 36 miles in 10 hours, at that time, after walking all that way, the next day when I woke up, I could not walk or bend my feet for nearly a week, could that walk have caused some permanent damage to my legs?  Something else you should be aware of, I suffer from, severe social phobia, which I understand is now also called, social anxiety disorder, this means I do not go outside very much, I have not actually been outside my home since November 4th 2005, which means I get very little excercise, which will probably make my problem worre through lack of excercise I would think?  But during my life, my social phobia has affected me to varying degrees, sometimes not leaving my home for a year or more at a time, other times managing to get out and about when I used alcohol as self medication to cope with people around me.  So although I do very little in the way of exercise, this shin/foot problem has been with me for years, even through periods when I was quite active, any ideas what the problem could be? Thanks in advance for any replies, much appreciated!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Shin and foot pain when walking",
    "content": "Hello -  It sounds as though  you have thought through your problem very well and probably have hit the nail on the head. Over work of an underused part of the body (in this case probably the group of muscles and tendons involved in walking -- shin and instep) can cause inflammation, chronic tendinitis, even some mild correctable deformity.   What makes this a problem likely to repeat itself is the social phobia (or even agoraphobia -- it is sometimes difficult to separate the two). As you've mentioned, this can keep you inside (and so largely inactive or at least preventing regular dynamic exercises like walking). There are also, as you've implied has happened for you, periods of remission when the sufferer is able to \"break out\" for a while and do certain things, which are then often done in excess, such as your 36 mile walk. While an admirable accomplishment (a very impressive), if this is done without the appropriate and regular warming up and cooling down involved in regular daily exercise, it can cause some pretty traumatic irritation to the musculature and connective tissue in the area now affected.   Physical therapy would, of course, be part of a comprehensive program to correct this, you may need first to resolve the social phobia or anxiety disorder (it is actually both; the  terms are interchangeable). This would be a valuable challenge to undertake,  and the sooner you do, the sooner you can reclaim your life full time and begin to enjoy it a lot more, while also avoiding the associated physical problems it often incurs.  Best of luck to  you with all of this. Start with over-the-counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, taking them not only when you have problems with walking,  but also before you anticipate doing any significant walking. Then tackle the anxiety problem and associated agoraphobia, which may involve cognitive therapy. All of this will work together for good. Please let  us know how things work out.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  Depending on the angle, pressures, etc., involved, you could bruise or even crack a rib without sustaining a visible bruise. More likely, though, you strained muscle or connective tissue on or between ribs, which can be quite painful and rarely shows any discoloration at all. Anti-inflammtory pain meds like ibuprofin or naprosyn for a day or two will usually help a lot, and even if you had bruised or actually cracked a rib there is rarely anything more to do for it than treat the discomfort and try to not repeat the offending maneuver.   I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Pain in right lower leg and swelling",
    "content": "Hello -  Based on your description of the problem my first concern would be to rule out a clot in your leg (deep vein thrombosis or DVT). While it seems unlikely a clot would remain fixed in one location and not cause more problem,  they have been known to stay put (if they don't stay put there is a risk of one  traveling to the lungs, a potentially life-threatening condition). If a clot has been ruled out by D-dimer blood test and doppler ultrasound testing,  then cellulitis is also possible, but two months is a long time for it to remain in a stable state. I would think it would have improved or gotten a lot worse during that period of time.  Other  possibilities are compartment syndrome, which can  cause similar symptoms but can become chronic. It is rarely life-threatening but can injure the leg muscle if left untreated. Finally, a disorder of the lymph glands in the leg can cause similar symptoms also.  Having been through  a course of antibiotics I would think a lymph node problem or cellulitis would have gotten better at least for a while.   Are you athletic? A runner? Compartment syndrome occurs most often in athletic people,  but can also occur in non-athletes. An orthopedist who specializes in sports medicine might be your best bet if internal medicine hasn't produced any signifcant improvement.    I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck and please follow up with us here.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I am a fit individual who works out about 4 times a week ( weights, cardio, aerobics classes) and also I have had 2 reoccuring stress fractures in my left tibia in the last 6 years ( due to running) Since then I have cut out almost all running ( maybe 2-4 minutes at the most in a workout), but I still work out my legs. Just 2 days ago I performed a leg workout, and came home with a dull ache and stiffness in my left inner calf/ inner lower knee part as well, Not excruciating pain or anything, just a dull pain, also some stifness. My left hamstring is pretty sore too. The next day, different parts of my left calf, and hamstring have been twitching all day, when I am just sitting or laying. My right leg has also been a little bit too, but not near as much as my left leg. Finally I feel like the whole medisl part of my left lower leg has given out and when I stand and walk, my weight on my left leg caves inward.   I have also been diagnosed with a mal-tracking problem with my left knee. This has caused me some minor knee pain sometimes, however it's not prominant right now. Any suggestions of what it might be? I am trying to rule out the stress fracture so I can at least not worry about that again. Can overloading the legs with weights cause stress fractures? I always wondered about that.\n\n",

    "title": "Baker's Cyst or Sarcoma?  MRI Report - Help",
    "content": "Hi.  I've been living a nightmare for 3 years thanks to unusual signs and symptoms.  I've yet to recieve a diagnosis and just recently obtained a firm assessment of generalized lymphadenopathy.  A node biopsy was delayed due node location and nature of the procedure.   Meanwhile, I developed a firm lump deep beside my knee, preceded by tenderness and swelling.  The lump itself did not hurt.  Over the course of 7 months, other small lumps and nodules formed in/near my feet, and in my palms. Dr. finally ordered knee MRI with contrast.    After endless hours of research, I've been suspecting a sarcoma as these can have significant delays in diagnosis.  My Dr. felt it was a baker's cyst, but I thought these originated from behind the knee, not beside it.  A brief version of the radiologist's report:  MRI of knee no contrast. Marked device is at medial aspect of knee at the level of the distal femoral metadiaphysis delineating location of patient's palpable abnormality.  In the general vicinity of this marker, is the most cranial extent of a multilobular, multiseptated Baker's Cyst which dissects to the level of the distal femoral metadiaphysis.  Measures up to approximately 1.7 x 1.6 cm (AP by transverse dimension) at the most cranial extent and roughly 3 cm craniocaudal dimension with a thin neck extending back to the origin between the medial head of the gastrocnemius and semimembraneous.  Regional musculature is normal. There is a small amount of residual hematopoietic marrow within the distal femoral diaphysis/metaphysis.  Impression: Multilobular, multiseptated Baker's Cyst with cranial extension as described above.  My questions, remarks:  This doesn't strike me as a simple Baker's Cyst.  All I've read states that it's common for a sarcoma to be misdiagnosed by MRI, appearing very similar to what this radiologist just discribed: multispeptated, multilobular, cranial extension, etc.  Now that I have this report, I'm even more concerned.  So, do you think I should let this go and accept that it's a cyst?  DO Baker's cysts form on the side of the knee?  In light of my other symptoms, lumps, nodules, lymphadenopathy, should I insist on seeing an ortho specialist?  Too, since all of this began 3 years ago, I've developed cysts on my ovaries, cysts in my breasts, cysts in my skin, and now this in my knee.  Is this common?  I've read that multiple cysts can herald or accompany malignancy.  Do you know if that's true?  Any response, insight, or advice would be much appreciated!  Thanks so much!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  While I am inclined to accept the radiologist's  reading of the MRI, and Baker's cysts do, indeed, form on the side of the knee on occasion (although the most common presentation is on the back), you have such a history of cyst formation that  I think a second  opinion is probably warranted, especially for the sake of your own peace of mind. Many people  do have a history of cysts  everywhere, for reasons that aren't  always clear, and yet never develop any malignancy. Others do, of course, but this is  an odd area. I don't know that an orthopedist would be of special help with this,  but perhaps an internist who, if any doubt arises, could refer you to someone who specializes in this  sort of thing -- even an oncologist would  be able to rule out (or, less likely, in) potentially malignancy. You might even try asking about this under the  oncology subject here at The Doctors Lounge.    I hope this is helpful. It seems you are destined to have an ongoing problem with these things, so you may as well clear the air with a proper consult. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Proper foot posture / knee pain",
    "content": "I am a 25 year old bodybuilding enthusiast of about 8 years with no past injuries.  About a week ago, I started to get a continual pain in my right knee, whether sitting, standing, bent or straight-legged.  My father has arthritis and several knee problems, but I've always been rather strict with my posture with working out and felt that, by keeping the joint healthily active, I might avoid some of the problems my father has.  Recently, though, after receiving my personal trainer certifications, I began reading about proper posture - specifically in regard to foot alignment.  Most texts seem to state the our feet should both be pointing straight forward.  As one of my feet tends to point about 15 degrees out if the other one is straight, I made a conscious effort to correct the stance.  This was also the case during potentially hazardous exercises such as the squat - normally I would keep both of my feet pointed out to allow for range of motion, but I've begun pointing them straight forward (and lowering the weight) to perform what I thought was the \"correct\" method for squatting.  I cannot find too many references to proper foot position aside from a casual mention during posture articles - which mostly focus on back and shoulders. I cannot help but feel that keeping my feet pointed straight is actually harming my posture a tad, first being displayed by this knee pain.  Even though many articles state feet straight forward, I'll then see example pictures where toes are pointed slightly outward.  Is this just an acceptable natural deviation, as long as the knees are aligned and the outward rotation of the foot is not too extreme?  Long question, sort of vague.  Thanks for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -   There are sometimes slight natural deviations from the classic alignment, usually due to positioning in infancy or delivery of a breech birth, which will cause usually one or sometimes both feet to naturally point outward (\"slewfoot\"). Attempting to correct this through sheer will can sometimes be quite painful, and the most vulnerable joint between the hip and ankle is, naturally, the knee. The ankle and hip will not give nor correct by age 25, so attempting to keep the foot straight would potentially be very irritating to the knee. Unless the angle of the foot actually interferes with function or is so far out of alignment as to cause a problem with gait, etc., it's best to just work with it as it is. Hopefully this will allow the knee to recover from the strain and  15 degrees isn't really much of a deviation (i think my right foot is off by about that much, in fact).   I hope this is helpful and that the knee starts to feel better shortly.\n\n",

    "content": "I have been having severe neck and arm pain for over a year now. It has been a progression of pain, Upper back and side of neck pain comes on with no rhyme or reason, then pain radiates down both arms and even into my head. Sometimes the pain does radiates under the left breast as well. I have had an MRI and have seen a neuro surgeon who immediately states that I have a pinched nerve and will need surgery. States that injections will not be a long term solution. I might add I have has some physical therapy that simply did not work. I was just wondering if these symptoms are consistent with a pinched nerve. The MRI was done of my cervical spine. Could moderate pinched nerve cause this much pain? Thank you for you response..\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Severe Neck and Arm Pain",
    "content": "Hello -   The  short answer to your post is yes. Yes, a pinched nerve could cause precisely these symptoms. Most likely culprit areas would be C-4, 5 and C-7,  T-1 (disks). Even a slight bulge or nerve root compression in these areas can cause disproportionate pain which can appear in areas continguous to or served by these nerves, sometimes at a distance from the site of the pinch/compression.  They can also be difficult to locate at times.   Epidural steroid injections can sometimes shrink a bulging disk and relieve the pain, but results vary. Physical therapy also can sometimes correct the problem, at least for periods of time. Surgery is probably the best long-term bet, but of course is not without its own risks in terms of solving one problem and creating a new one. This does not happen very often, but these risks do need to be fully explored. A really good surgeon of course reduces the risk automatically be many degrees.   I hope you find a satisfying solution to this problem, and I do believe, given your detailed description, that this is being caused by a pinched or compressed nerve.  Best of luck to you and please do follow up with us.\n\n",

    "title": "Is it Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome?",
    "content": "I have been reading information from the internet on hypermobility syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. I was born with congenital dislocation of the hips and didn't walk til i was 20 months old. I have had a broken wrist at the age of 6 and a dislocated elbow at the age of 9. There is hypermobility of some of my joints, especially both my knees. They can bend back quite a way from the straight position. The fingers on both my hands have extra bone growth at the knuckles, a bump can be seen on every knuckle apart from my thumbs and they too can bend farther than the straight position. I was told that as a child my fingers could have been operated on to file down the extra bone but was decided against it thinking it wouldn't course me any problems. About 7-8 years ago my hands started to lock if my fingers are straightened for a short time are very painful to get them to unlock. At present i am experiencing alot of pain in my hips, especially lying in bed which i making sleeping difficult. Other symptons i have which were on the Ehlers-Danlos site are IBS, easy bruising, gum recession and depression. Can you tell me if this is Ehlers-Danlos or hypermobility syndrome and if i need to see my doctor about it. Thank you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Is it Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome?",
    "content": "Hi Suzanne74 -  What you describe sounds very much like it could be E-D type 3. It also could be Marfan's syndrome, but you have extra details in your excellent description of the abnormalities which make me think it is probably E-D. It would be very helpful to you to know if this is the case (and if not, just what it is) so that you could find the proper specialists to help you manage the problem.   To put this in a somewhat better light, while  E-D (and other connective tissue diseases) is no picnic, the type you would probably have (type 3) is a lot less dangerous than the vascular type, and the types rarely overlap. While the loose joints may be very annoying and painful, you should be able to live out a productive, fairly normal life, setting aside the occasional orthopedic problems you may endure.   If you have, instead, Marfan's syndrome, which I am doubting, but which is possible, you would actually need to be followed more regularly and not just when there is a specific problem. Some E-D/3 patients manage to go for long periods  without any disabling or extremely painful problems. Knowing how to head these off helps a lot.   One thing you didn't mention, which is usually seen in this form of E-D is very soft, pliable, stretchable skin.  This is sometimes overlooked, since it's not especially bothersome and may even be seen as an advantage by some.   Please do follow up with us and by all means do have yourself evaluated for connective tissue disease, with an eye toward E-D. Good  luck to you.\n\n",

Unfortantly i have had to come to my own devices to try and figure out what is wrong with me i know that it will sound crazy but my life is hell i don't have a day with out pain and i feel like i am slowly dieing, i know that sounds bad but its true. Every time i turn around there is another problem to add to the list. Given that i don't know why my dad fell apart and i can not get his medical records i am determined not to have the same fate. I am only 95 lbs up from 82 last year i try like heck to gain weight and my doctors are convinced that all my problems are anorexia which i am not, my doctor had me to the point of tears because i was defending myself on something so stupid i love to eat and i am embarrased to look the way i do and feel. Because i was in tears he told me that its more proof that i need to seek mental health. I did i saw mental health but they say to see a nuerologist that theres nothing mental ill about me. If i am mental ill it must run in my family because 2 sisters of mine have the same exact problems i have as well as the same diagnosis or should i say differential diagnosis. I was so afraid that it was mental illness that i have no sought help for one of my problems my eyes don't fully close odd i know but i think that when i sleep they are open and for some reason i am awake but i cant move most of the night like a hallucination or being paralized or something my husband can tell because i will hold my breath at him to give him a sign to move me to disrupt it giving neither of us rest then i have headaches all darn day. Its really scary. Plus is see glowing bugs the fly all over the room but then quickly diapear i cant focus on them though, as you can tell i am afraid to talk to my dr about those. My elbows bend the wrong way and my hip and shoulders sublax my skin is softer then my 5 year old daughter and i can stretch it pretty far basically i have every single symptom of ehlers danlos vascular form, my gastroenterologist even told me that i am missing the adipose tissue that cushings my organs that my abdomen is very scafoid. I know that i suffer from postural orthostatic tachycadia syndrome and thats how i found ehlers-danlos syndrome i know that i found the golden ticket, i even have the gorgens sign, weird skin nodules just eveything about this even the starring gaze. Thumb to my wrist, elbows bending backwards,knees bending backwards wide scars that keep getting bigger i swear is should be on a poster for it. Now im afaid to mention this to my doctor because he already thinks that i am crazy, plus how do you mention to your doctor that you think you have something rare? I see othopedics on the 14th is this something that he will notice and is trained for? If a patient aproached you and said that i have elhers-danlos prove me right what would you say? My joints are popping out of place so much that they don't hurt anymore because i numb to the pain i suppose. I just know that this is it i just don't know what to do about it, i know that i have nothing to lose but mentioning it but ahhh i don't want to get another doctor! My sisters are also convinced that this is it and we know that as soon as one is diagnosed well all will be and life will be easier knowing. Do you think that i have this and is this something i should mention? I mean i can leterally take me left hand and sulux my proximal humerous anteriorly with no problem and vice versa. Step just right an pop my hip out and my jaw all i have to do is yawn or yell. The last doctor is say told me \"not to make light of the situation but you should join the circus\" which i didnt find funny. Please tell me what you think i know its a lot to swallow. Thanks alot\n\n",

If another health professional takes your symptoms lightly and suggests that you \"join the circus\" which is appalling in itself provide them with the information. This syndrome must be appropriatly treated and due to the genetic factor testing for other family members would be warranted. I would strongly encourage you to seek the medical evaluation of both an Orthopedic and Rheumatology specialist. Best wishes. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "Since my Previous post i have been formally diagnosed with Ehlers Danlos Syndrome Classic Type. Its amaising how much a person thinks is normal about ones self when indeed it the opposite. I am very happy to have been diagnosed and to have answers to my issues.  Life with the diagnoses has been more difficult then thought, its very difficult to find physicians who are aware fully of the syndrome. Everything that i am afflicted with has been linked to EDS but no one knows how to treat the syndrome. Currently i am having issues with my shoulders subluxing and am no longer allowed to carrry even in a gallon of milk with out losing it. The orthopedics in my area don't know how to treat the severe instability, the physical therapist are also not trained for such a thing. In physical therapy being that was my only option i lost my right wrist and elbow to the exercises. Its hard not to cause harm to other areas while treating the current problems. I am learning new ways to do things from support groups but changing your everyday habits is more difficult then i thought. I do know understand why mentally and phyiscally i feel the way that i do. Pain is something that i am trying to over come and have some what over come. It has its prices you can only ignore so much of it before you effect your emotional well being so i am trying to work on both.  Its very alarming how much of my health issues are due to the EDS and im left having to deal with them because there no help for what i have. Currently i suffer from insane diarrhea that i need to get checked but collagen is everywhere in the body and my digestive trac is most likely effected and theres nothing i can do about it. Theres no plus to having an invisable disorder but i am trying to make the best of what i have. I don't appear to be afflicted with vascular EDS but i am going through routine testing on my heart and major arteries. I would much rather not know.  If you know something wrong it probably is....Trust your body and fight for the answers you deserve. So much has to go right in your body for you to function the human body is amaizing.

    "content": "Hi Mike,  From the description you've given it sounds like you have done some damage to the nerve that runs near the elbow (the so called \"funny bone\").  Initially, unless there is numbness, it is generally safe to watch these injuries and see if they improve.  If the tingling/pain is not getting better over the next few days you should have it checked out.  If it gets better the nerve may simply be bruised or \"stunned\" from the injury and needed some time to get better.  If it is not getting better, there is the possibility that there is some external compression of the nerve such as from swelling or actual damage to the nerve.  Any injury with actual numb areas should be evaluated right away because of the possible damage to the nerve that may need intervention to help preserve or restore nerve function.  Best wishes.\n\n",

BUT, like i said it happens often. i am also about sick of it. it seems to happen more ofte when i am pushing or pulling as well.......i don't have insurance and i would seriously like to know what might be causing all these catches, since they come with EXTREME pain!  i would like to know what i might have to do for this...and would also like to know what might be the problem causing it as well. i know without either xrays or scans it really is impossible to tell, but some1 should be able to kind of narrow it down to a few possibilities for me with all these symptoms. what is wrong with my shoulder?!?!  please tell me an opinion! it would be tremendously appreciated!     thank you very much.

    "title": "Hip joint pain during the night",
    "content": "I have been having pain in my right hip since Sunday (03/02/08) morning.  The pain is sharp and severe.  It starts around 4am, waking me up in the night, and continues through the morning finally subsiding around 11am.  On a scale of one to ten... when I wake up it is a solid eight.  While I am getting ready around the house in the morning it is a variable six.  The rest of the day it subsides to a two or is barely noticeable. It is only in the left hip and the pain is deep and localized.  When I am in bed with the pain it does not matter how I position my leg or body.  I will move it and it will be fine for about thirty seconds before the pain begins to flare up again.  When I walk the pain stabs if I move my leg in any deviation from straight, especially if I should rotate that leg at all.  When sitting and bringing my legs to a 'butterfly' stretch the pain stabs sharply if I try to lower the left leg/knee out to the side.   I am 28, excellent weight/height proportion and generally healthy. I have not done any exercises or anything to warrant an injury so I really am not sure what is going on.  I am trying to get in to see a doctor but they have no openings this week and I am on stand by.  I have taken ibuprofen and that takes the edge off.  Even with that I can still feel that something is going on there.  Any ideas?\n\n",

You might have some beginnings of arthritis or a pinched nerve in your back - could even be sciatica.  Hopefully you are able to get a good diagnosis and some help with the pain.  Physical therapy and/or massage can be very helpful and some people find that adjustments by a chiropractor make a huge impact.  Good luck.\n\n",

Any doctor worth his title would be happy to make sure you understand the condition and what you should do about it.  Be assertive; it's OK.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I assume your mom's doctor has made other recommendations beyond the cortisone injections such as immobilizing the thumb and wrist, keeping them straight with a splint or brace to help rest your tendons.  She should also avoid repetitive thumb movements as much as she can and avoid pinching with her thumb when moving the wrist from side to side.  Heat and NSAIDs such as ibuprofen and naproxen can help reduce the swelling.  These are the conservative treatments which can be very effective if started early on.  Physical therapy and/or chiropractic care may also help but if the repetitive activity that caused the problem is not discontinued, the pain will likely return. I am not sure of the appropriate amount of cortisone by injection but some doctors don't like to do more than two or three of these.    I would recommend the combination of conservative treatments in conjunction with alterations in wrist/hand use before moving to surgery but it will take a while to see improvement.  My best to you and your mother.\n\n",

It has been this way my whole life. My toes are strangely small as well.

However, I've read taking  HGH after adolescence can lead to growth of the hands, feet, and chin. I would like to know if this is a viable option for me, or if any other medical options exist to increase hand size at my age. It is particularly frustrating because I am a guitarist. Thanks.

    "content": "Five days ago, I slipped and fell on a patch of ice.  Outside of the shock, I initially felt okay.  The next morning, I noticed a very sharp pain in my hip when walking or turning my leg a certain way.  The pain is eminates from the front of my right hip, in the joint area between the top of the leg and my waist.  If I turn my right foot outwards, I feel the pain, as do I when trying to walk normally.  When walking, if I turn my foot in slightly, and do not bend my knee, it helps take the edge off.  The area is painful to the touch, and it will throb some if I sit or lay for a long period of time, or lay on that side.  My hip, leg and knee are also stiff, but I feel no pain, aside from that joint area.  I don't see any obvious swelling or bruising, but am not sure if it's there, considering the stiffness.   Over the past four days, I've tried ice, heat, aspirin, aleve, tylenol, and rest, but nothing much has changed.  Looking around online, I see several \"possible diagnosis,\" that fit some of these ailments, and they range from \"Go See a Doctor Right Away\" to \"Ice It,Rest It, and It'll be A-ok\".  I'm just hoping one of you folks can point me in the right direction.  Thanks so much for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Sixtysix,  Falls onto the hip can cause a variety of injuries.  These range from mild bruises to fractures of the hip or leg bone (the femur).  Given your symptoms it is hard to say for sure that there is not a fracture present.  Since your pain is not getting better I would recommend you see your doctor for an evaluation to determine if any x-rays are needed.  At the least, I suspect you have a very severe bruise that is going to take some time to heal but determining if there is a fracture is important to be sure that things heal properly and you don't loose function of your hip.

    "content": "Hello, I would not expect more than 90 degrees' on this, but if you're saying you just don't flex back as much as desired for guitar, I would concentrate on learning to adapt.  People with limited resources are able to accomplish great and even unexpected things when they are determined to find a way.  If you find you just can't make it work (though my experience is that the wrist moving inward to reach the frets and strings is more important), you could consider learning to play the dobro - similar to a guitar and used more frequently in country and bluegrass music.  I don't know what style of guitar you want to use but I do believe you can make it work with desire and determination.  You could also see an orthopedic or hand specialist to see if there is anything to be done to improve your range of motion.  Genetics appear to be a big part of your problem, but often there is some improvement to be made with physical therapy.  Good luck.\n\n",

I would appreciate any advice you have that can help me convince her that she needs to seek help from her doctor before it is too late.  Thanks, putmanrp\n\n",

If this is the case, your friend could get helpful treatment.    Self care includes:  No smoking, regular exercise to improve circulation, avoid caffeine, reduce stress (something you have identified), take care of hands and feet, using protective coverings against cold and environment to avoid additional injury.  Thank you for looking out for your friend who is busy looking out for others.  Please encourage her to take care of herself as well.    Best wishes.\n\n",

Then, about 8 weeks ago, I feel down stairs and got a massive bruise in the exact same spot. Then, about 2 weeks ago, I fell on ice snowboarding on the exact same spot! My upper left butt cheek has a ton of swelling - so much that it's forming a shelf/dent in the middle of the cheek (all discoloration has gone away).   Is there anything I can do to avoid having a VERY large, hard lump form under the skin? I fear it will be permanent like the small one I had after the fall in 2001 -- only this time, it will be much larger.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello SusieQ1,  Carpal coalition is a condition where two of the carpal bones did not properly separate and remain fused.  The carpal bones are found in the hand, though.  There is a similar condition called Tarsal coalition that affects the tarsal bones of the feet.  Tarsal coalition is present from birth since it is a developmental problem that occurs while the baby is developing.  Generally, it does not present with problems until the bones begin to mature (usually around puberty time).  The symptoms range from no symptoms at all to very severe pain when walking or standing.  Management is basically determined by symptoms.  Those that are asymptomatic do not need treatment.  For those with pain, often orthotic devices (shoe inserts) and anti-inflammatories are tried.  In severe cases where medical management is unsuccessful, surgical repair of the fused bones may be necessary.  If there is concern about this, seeing an orthopedic specialist would be appropriate.  Best wishes.\n\n",

It may be that getting some custom orthotic inserts for your shoes may help relieve any pressure that may be causing the bones to shift.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a active and fit fifteen year old female high school student with a family history of hip problems.  My aunt has had six hip replacements and has severely shallow sockets.  Although I was checked as a child, this issue did not arise in me until around a year ago.  I dismissed my pain for a year, but i recently had it checked at an orthopedic and fracture clinic.  X-rays were taken that show my left hip socket has about 25 degrees of coverage and my right has 15.  (My doctor said between 20 and 40 is normal).  He told my that eventually an Osteotomy will be necessary, but he has no idea when.  I've been told its my decision when this needs to be done but it will be obvious when I'm having \"more bad than good days\".  Since going to the doctor my symptoms have increased, although its only been a few weeks.  I understand a lot of this is my focus on the problem and it is a mental issue.  I accept that I will live with pain and discomfort (and have sadly learned this probably wont change after the operation) and decreased flexibility.  I have also noticed that my hip is weaker.  Moving my leg backward and directly out to this side in a standing position is comfortable, however i can hardly gather the strength to lift my leg straight in front of me while standing.  I also notice this when i try to cross my legs (as i usually have to assist the motion with my arm strength).  I also have lost the strength to push things with my leg or kick.  Is this muscle loss something that goes hand-in-hand with my pain and decreased flexibility?  Am I also facing a hip replacement in my lifetime?  Is it possible that because of my young age and my active lifestyle that my recovery will be closer to 6 months than a year and will i possibly have better results and decreased pain after the surgery because of this?  Can some doctors do horizontal incisions rather than vertical across the crease in my groin to avoid an obvious and unpleasant scar?    I really appreciate your time seeing as in office visits are hard to schedule and there are often time limits.  I understand the questions I've asked have a large range of answers that are hard to predict, but a ballpark estimate would really help me understand what I'm looking at.    thanks again\n\n",

The soreness moves around. some days it is in my left arm and everything else feels 100% fine. sometimes in my left armpit and everything else fine. Then sometimes in my right arm or armpit and the left side is fine!! ocassioanly at the end of a breathe I feel it in my sternum area. I also get some upper back pains.  NO lumps that I feel.  the pain/soreness isnt extreme - doesnt wake me up - doesnt hurt more with exercise.  last for a few hours at a time.   I am generally in good shape.  I went to my GP.  He did blood tests, EKG. I am scheduled for a stres test, but nothing has come up abnormal.  HE thinks it just skeletal/muscular.  But it has continued for 6 weeks!\n\n",

    "content": "It is not unusual for musculo-skeletal disorders to last 6 weeks, or 6 months, or 6 years.... Sometimes the doctor is able to diagnose a particular problem such as osteoarthritis, tendonitis, or fibromyalgia, in which case there could be helpful treatments, but often because of the transient nature of such disorders, there may never be a name for it.  I suspect this is why your doctor responded as he/she did.  It is important to rule out underlying problems that could be serious and could lead to other problems so that is probably what was done with blood work.  They were able to rule out something that might put your life in danger even though they do not have an actual explanation for your symptoms.    As time goes by I would recommend you keep a diary or journal of your symptoms.  Along with the time of day, and date, describe what you were doing near that time.  If you were sleeping, what position were you in, if there were other symptoms also, what were they.  If they were exacerbated by anything, what helped; what didn't.  By noting a pattern, you may be able to eventually get the answers you seek.  Best wishes to you.\n\n",

    "content": "The Thalamus is the gland that is called the brain's relay station.  When we experience a sensation, our nervous system sends the message and the message is interpreted.  We respond accordingly.  People exhibit a vast array of responses to pain and other stimulus.  Some have a much higher pain tolerance than others, for instance.    If you have a hypersensitive response to a painful stimulus such as you describe (what should feel like a light bump is experienced as excruciating pain) it could possibly be Thalamic Syndrome, sometimes called Dejerine-Roussy or a number of other names, a rare neurological disorder resulting from damage to the thalamus.   I do not know if you have this condition, but it is one possible cause of symptoms such as yours.  If so, this falls in the category of neurological disorders as you search for treatment.  Neurotransmitters can also play a role in pain sensation and various central nervous system disorders could be at play here as well.  This system is very complex so a neurologist would be the right doctor to consult with.  Good luck.  Best wishes to you.\n\n",

I would recommend you have this evaluated.  There may be something going on with your nerves giving the sensation of itching and causing the weakness.  A careful neurological examination is needed.  Follow up with your doctor is important.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Deltoid pain when throwing (former catcher)",
    "content": "Hello, As a child I played baseball, and when I from around 11-13 I played on a team as their only catcher. I threw more than anyone on the team. I threw in practically every play, and caught for every pitcher. Toward the end of the last season my arm started hurting REALLY bad when I threw. Being a boy I just kept throwing until it became unbearable and I finally told the coach, and we rotated another player in as a backup catcher and it really helped. I still just threw through the pain though. I don't remember any specifics about it though, other than my my upper arm hurt (ie. it wasn't my elbow or shoulder or anything)  After that I started getting out of sports and lost my interest in it due to many things, so it never bothered me since really. The few times when I like throw rocks or the such though my deltoid hurt, and I always thought it was just from not being used to throwing. Just recently, however, I've started throwing (baseball) again with friends, and my deltoid hurts after the throws. If I warm up it seems to not hurt actually until after i've been throwing for a bit. But if I just pick up a baseball (or acorn, or rock) and throw it cold I get a shooting pain in my deltoid (Kinda of feels like it's knotting up!).   It feels like it stems from the bottom of my deltoid though. Does anyone have any ideas about this? Is it possible that it could be leftover from my childhood? The coach thought maybe I had out thrown my arm back then, but we never really did anything about it. I am 22 years old now.  It doesn't bother my ever unless I'm throwing or unless I do some extreme range of motion with it, like attempt to scratch my back over the top (then it doesn't really hurt it just feels kinda tight...)  Well any help would be greatly appreciated!! I'm just wondering if it stems from back as a catcher as a child, or if I re-injured it, or if it's nothing at all...  Thank you!\n\n",

It almost seems to be a muscle running down the back of my deltoid. I'm not very knowledgeable about muscle anatomy though.   Thank you for the information though, and I may see a sports doctor about it, but I was mainly worried about if it would affect me aside from baseball. I can easily avoid that and avoid the problem. I was just wondering if it might start causing problems in everyday activities later on in life or something.  Thank you\n\n",

On this recording is there also a message that says if this is a medical emergency etc. etc. My point is,  the number that's given to you is probably the hospital where he is practicing. If you aren't getting any results from the office, call the hospital, ask the operator if this doctor is on call, have him paged and give them your telephone number. When he calls you back, explain what happened. Now for your swelling, most of it should have considerably subsided by this point unless you have been letting it hang downward. If this is the case, elevate it on pillows above the level of your heart. This will not only decrease the swelling but also the pain. I hope this information is helpful. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

Everything from my hair-line and hair thickness, to the size of my feet. What happened, did something go wrong with me as a child?? Is this a disease?? As a kid I didn't exactly eat healthy and I still don't but I don't see why that would result in deformation like this, my younger sister had the same eating habits etc. as me yet shes very symmetrical. My mother is also, as is my father, so I'm really unsure of how this came about. Being mis-shapen like this really really really bothers me, and makes me very self-conscious. Plus, its not an imperfection that can just be fixed with surgery or something!! Idk what to do, or if I can even do anything period.

    "title": "Re: Body Asymmetry",
    "content": "Hi Sunset429,  What you are describing sounds like hemihypertrophy.  Hemihypertrophy is an asymmetry in the body when comparing the right to the left with one side being larger than the other.  It can range from only involving one hand or arm to involving the entire side of the body, including internal organs.  It can occur as an isolated finding or can be associated with other syndromes, such as Beckwith-Weidemann syndrome, Klippel-Trenauney syndrome and neurofibromatosis.  Most of these are associated with other symptoms that would have made the syndrome obvious before age 18.  The one possible exception would be neurofibromatosis, although this is commonly diagnosed in childhood as well.  Determining which specialist to see for this can be difficult.  I would suggest that you see a dermatologist for further evaluation.  Seeing a geneticist is also a good idea to see if there may be any underlying genetic issues that may help to determine the cause.  Best wishes.\n\n",

My only thought is that if you have not yet tried it, using a strong anti-inflammatory such as high dose ibuprofen or a steroid for a week or two may help to alleviate the inflammation.  Also, generally these symptoms are brought on by repetitive use injury such as straining while typing.  If there are any ongoing issues like this it will delay or even prevent healing.  Occasionally, in office type settings, companies will have an ergodynamic specialist to help analyze the work environment and correct any issues that may be contributing.  Sorry I can't offer much more.  Best wishes.\n\n",

The area of compression may be in the foot rather than higher since the numb area is located only in the toe.  I would recommend you see a neurologist to help determine where the problem may be and what the problem is.  At that point, a proper treatment can be determined.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "49 female In August I began having pain at the back of my ankles and heels of my feets every morning when I got out of bed, I could hardly walk. After I started walking around it would get better until about 2:00 in the afternoon then I could hardly walk again. My whole foot (both feet would start hurting from standing or walking on them. I also was getting swelling in my legs and feet from the knee down. I went to the doctor he though it might be MS or my back so he took and MRI of my brain. Nothing showed up. Then a month ago my knees started hurting, especially the left knee, I can not bend it with out severe pain. I tried to do the exercises discussed in forum but I can't turn my feet out to the side without severe knee pain to the left knee. It is hurting more and more. I can't get comfortable in bed because I can't bend my knee all the way and I can't straighten it all the way. If my other knee touches it, it hurts. Do you have any suggestions. I don't know what to do? Especially when the doctors doesn't know what it is? Do I need to go to a Specialist?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Zenbob,  It takes about 18-20 minutes to walk 1 mile.  If you are planning on doing 40 miles a day it will take 12-14 hours.  This is if it is done at a leisurly pace.  So yes it can be done.   Obviously a great pair of walking shoes are essential.  This will keep your feet comfortable and free of blisters or rubbing.  You may need more than 1 pair.  Some of the medical issues that may arise from long distant walking is knee and hip pain.  Knees and hips are areas that can get bursitis.  Bursitis is caused by the repetative motion.  The bursa of the joint becomes inflammed from the friction.  Another issue is dehydration, be sure to drink plenty of water.  As far as the time I would plan on taking a few rest days to enjoy the scenery, and if weather is an issue.  Good Luck  Sandy Tracy RN\n\n",

I saw an othopod the next day who said it was just a sprain (x rays, no mri or anything else).  It has been a bit better as of late, but not gotten any better beoynd this.   The issue is as is.  My right knee hurts as much as my left knee which I am having sugery on Friday.  I can tell i atleast pulled a muscle that attaches from my knee to my high thigh area.  When I go up stairs especially it bothers me the worse.  I guess my question is... Is there anything in particular that I should question if it doesn't get any better?  I will give it honest time.  But it doesn't feel like just a sprain.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Don't underestimate the damage and pain associated with a sprain.  You have injured soft tissue which can be just as painful as injuring a bone.  It also takes quite a while to heal and there is danger of reinjury with a sprain since you are not casted.  You must give it several weeks to heal but it certainly doesn't hurt to be in touch with your doctor.  Some fractures do not show on x-ray right away but may be apparent later.  Good luck.\n\n",

There are some new techniques to help this condition surgically and the synovial fluid can be improved to cushion and lubricate the joint.  Your prognosis at this point is hard to predict since it will rely on newer and better techniques that may be available in the future but are not at the current time.  I would suggest getting a consultation with an orthopedic specialist or rheumatologist to see what can be done.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Paul,  There are a few things that may be going on.  The pain and numbness may indicate that you are having some nerve problems.  It sounds like you have had back trouble in the past so it is possible that you are having some pain due to some compression of the spinal nerves.  You may also be developing some arthritis in your joints.  This may be simply from \"wear and tear\" of the joints or it may be due to a condition such as rheumatoid arthritis.  The joint distribution is less consistent with rheumatoid arthritis, though.  Seeing your primary care doctor is probably a good place to start.  From there, if needed, you can see an orthopedic specialist, a neurologist or possibly a rheumatologist.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, As you have learned, people do respond differently to medications.  While one pain reliever is very strong for one person, the same may not be effective for the next.  It is also possible to develop a tolerance if these are used frequently.  This makes it hard to say what would be stronger for you but the Lortab should be the same as Vicodin.  Tylenol 3 is similar but it is with codeine, whereas Vicodin and Lortab both combine hydrocodone with acetaminophen (generic equivalent to Tylenol).  The combinations with acetaminophen or Tylenol and a narcotic pain reliever seem to work better than the single ingredient alone for most people.  Percocet would also be considered on a par with Vicodin and Lortab for strength and it combines the acetaminophen with oxycodone as the narcotic analgesic.    Often the decision is made based on which the patient tolerates without side effects and trying one or another is about the only way to know how you will do with it.  After surgery most doctors prescribe a couple of options so if one does not do the trick, an alternate can be tried.    Good luck with your upcoming surgery.\n\n",

The area around the joint and down the side of my hand are only slightly stiffer than my other pinky.  Any info and advice would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks ahead of time for your time and cosideration.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Nugget96,  From the repeated trauma it is possible that you have developed a stress fracture or have damaged the nerve in that area.  Repeated trauma may have lead to some thickening of the bone or scar tissue formation that may be compressing the nerve causing the pain.  If this isn't getting any better I would suggest you have your doctor take a look at it.    Seeing an orthopedic specialist may be helpful as well.  Best wishes.\n\n",

His foot was xrayed, but the doctor could not determine if it was broken.  He was sent home, told to keep his foot elevated and iced, a radiologist would look at the xray the next morning and let him know if it was broken.  When no one called my husband the next day, he called the doctor's office, was told his foot was not broken and come in to the office on Monday (12/2).  He went to the office; the doctor hardly looked at this foot and gave him a 'return to work' slip to return to work on Tuesday (12/3).  His foot has turned all colors of purple from bruising, but there is still a lump on his foot.  It is rather red and the redness radiates out from it.  He said it was soft, but it has now become a hard lump.  His foot is still sore.  Does this sound normal for an injury like this?  He is afraid to get a second opinion due to possible retaliation by his employer.\n\n",

Health care has been limited (mostly primary care physicians..long story).  BUT, about 3 months ago I began developing soft tissue swelling on the palms of my hands and soles of feel, then hard little nodules formed and grew deep in these areas.  A month ago, I further developed a lump the size of a quarter to half dollar on the inside of my left leg just beside my knee, almost to the bend of knee, but NOT behind it.  This lump is firm in the middle, but feels squishy on the sides, and is irregularly shaped.  Didn't hurt at all at first, but then became tender and sore if I poke it, put any pressure on it, and seems most tender in the evenings.  When I put my knees one on top of the other, I aggravate it (lying in fetal position).  Tech told me the Xray I had done today looked normal, but radiologist could get a better view.  My question would be this:  should this be ignored even though my PCP can clearly feel this thing?  What comes after an Xray?  Any thoughts on the matter?  And, did you other folks get Xrays?  Thanks so much.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 21 year old female who use to be a competitive gymnast.  I had an injury on the bars where I was swinging around them and injured my left shoulder.  I went to an orthopaedic surgeon who did an MRI and wanted to do surgery to tighten up the muscles.  I was 16 and didn't want surgery, so I opted out of it.  I instead quit gymnastics and did extensive physical therapy.  No luck.  The should has had zero improvement and has been giving me increasing problems.  I have to wash my hair one handed because I cannot keep my other arm raised above my head that long.  I also can only drive with my right arm.  A few weeks ago I did a few tumbling passes out of curiosity and was thrilled when my shoulder only had mild pain and decent weakness afterwards.  However, the next day I was in so much pain I couldn't move my arm for two days.  Simple tasks with my arm always lead to a strong burning sensation around the part that rotates and a very very weak feeling.  My shoulder muscles leading up to my neck and around the upper part of my shoulder blade are always sore/tight and have many knots.  I can pop my shoulder around, but it never comes completely out of socket.  I also cannot raise my arm straight out in front of me above 45 degrees without popping it and then continuing up.  Does this sound like I have since torn the rotator cuff or is it possible it is still just stretched?  Could it be something else?   I really wanted to avoid surgery but I am afraid this is going to affect me caring for my children someday and having a health care career.  Also, if I have to have surgery, how long is the recovery? I am a full time college student who plans to graduate in 2009 and head straight to graduate school for 3-4 years.  It is really hard to find much time off school to have a surgery!  Thank you!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Misspuppychow,  The initial MRI that was done should have gotten a good look at your rotator cuff.  If you are able to get the report of it it may tell you that there is or is not a tear in the cuff.  The rotator cuff is made of several different muscles, tendons and ligaments so if one of them is torn it can cause your symptoms.  If surgery is needed, recovery time is variable but will most likely involve several months of physical therapy.  The answer to this really depends on how extensive the surgery needs to be.  I would recommend you see an orthopedic surgeon again to have your shoulder evaluated.  If there is a tear needing surgery, having surgery sooner rather than later is likely to improve success and decrease recovery time.  Best wishes.\n\n",

In general, I recommend avoiding spine surgery unless there is no other option.  Recovery from spinal surgery is long and there are often many complications.  Occasionally, the surgery ends up not improving the initial symptoms or simply exchanges them for other problems.  That being said, there are spinal surgeons because there are cases where surgery is an appropriate option.  I believe most surgeons would agree with me that surgery of the spine is not something to rush into so be sure to get all the information so you can make an educated decision.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 21 Year old Female and have had knee pain and particles in my knee for a few years following a fall. I went to my doctor a few years ago and she did an X - ray and said nothing was wrong with it. I now have a new doctor and I went to him today and he said it could be a cyst but there is one big particle that is soft and moves somewhat but also feels attached it is right above my kneecap but along with the big particle there are little particles(about the size of a small pebble) and I can freely move them around my knee and above my knee I can see the big Particle being a cyst but can the little particles be cysts too? He is sending me for an X-ray and if that doesn't show anything he will send me for an MRI and maybe to an orthopedic doctor. The last X-ray showed nothing so I don't think this one will either I should also mention that along with the pain and the particles my knee also gives out occasionally he does not think this is connected. I also have lower back pain and shoulder pain(L) I mentioned this while I was there and he said I have slight Scoliosis and sent me for an X-ray of my back as well.   So my Questions are: What can the Particles be? Can they be cysts? Is the fact that my knee gives out connected? If the X-Ray comes back ok Should I go for an MRI and See an Ortho doc? If they are cysts what can be done for them? I have had my Spine checked many times at school and they never mentioned scoliosis is it possible it just showed up and if it did, can it progress? What should be done about this?  Other than allergies and slight asthma I have no medical problems.  Any help will be greatly appreciated.Thank You. AngelTurtle\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Angelturtle,  I suspect that the x-ray will again be normal.  They are often not particularly helpful for knee problems because most of the issues are with the cartilage of the knee, which doesn't show up on an x-ray.  However, it is a good first step since it is fast and easy.  If something does show up the MRI may not be necessary.  Most likely the MRI will be the best thing to answer the questions.  These lumps may be cysts although it seems a bit unlikely that all the areas are cysts.  They may also be small areas of scar tissue that have formed from the original injury.  The MRI should clear this up.  Seeing an orthopedic specialist may also be very beneficial.  Your knee giving out may or may not be related to this but there is a decent chance that it is at least partially connected.  Regarding the scoliosis, x-rays are fairly precise way to follow the scoliosis since the actual angle of curvature can be assessed objectively.  The physical examination may not pick up a slight scoliosis.  These are unlikely to progress much but it is worthwhile keeping an eye on periodically just to be sure.  Follow up with your doctor is important.  Best wishes.\n\n",

My left (fretting) hand experiences very localized pain in the tendon for my index finger, about \u00be inch from the knuckle, about \u00bd way in between the knuckle and the beginning of the raised region.  This occurs after playing for about an hour or two and can progress to the point that I can't lift my finger.  I suppose I stop playing before this problem gets too far during practice, but during a gig we play for about 3 hours.  I can not feel any bumps or differences between hands but I can press on the painful spot. Taking IB can help and being very conscious about keeping a light touch helps postpone the problem.  Vitals are age 45, 5-6, 140lb, M.  I generally take no medications except for IB rarely, but have taken Cosamin DS in the past (for a knee issue that cleared up) and started taking it again for this hand issue.  Thank you! Jeff\n\n",

    "content": "MY mother, who will be 70 in 12/07, had episode of severe left hip/groin pain upon getting out of bed...no history of a fall. The pain was so severe she could not put weight on her left leg or move/bend at the hip. Her doctor sent her for xrays suspecting a hip fx based on his exam.  Xrays were normal, sent her home with a pain med and muscle relaxer.  Two days later, she still has pain but is now able to walk.  The doctor has told me if does not get better he will order and MRI and look for vascular capuslitis.  Are there any other possibilities for this sudden onset of pain?  She does have a history of arthritis is multiple joints, HTN, Gerd, and is a heavy smoker.  Currently on Tylenol#3, Parafon Forte (new RXs), Toprol XL, Exforge, celebrex, prilosec, enablex, and lexapro.  She has never had surgery or previous injury to either hip.  She does have a history of herniated discs and a crushed disc in her lower back.\n\n",

If, after a week, her pain continues I would recommend a repeat x-ray.  At that point it is likely that a fracture may show up.  An MRI is also a good idea if the pain persists.  Other possibilities include a pulled muscle or a tendonitis/sinovitis.  The MRI can help look for these last two.  Best wishes.\n\n",

The strange thing about this is that when I get up and walk a short distance, ie the bathroom, and then get back into bed, the pain has subsided. I do not get the pain during the day when I am active, only early in the morning. I am sleeping on a new mattress so I don't think that would be the cause. I was quite active in sports when I was in college and walked alot well into my 40's.I have had no fractures and am in good health otherwise. Could this be arthritis or something else?

    "title": "Reoccurent Shoulder Injury Problem",
    "content": "I am a 24 yr. old female with a history of asthma, hyperthroidism, inappropriate sinus tachycardia.    Seven years ago, I worked at a restaurant and a co-worker accidently tripped and dropped a 50 pound box on my left shoulder.  The weight of the box landed directly on top of my shoulder and the corner of the box went into the back of my shoulder blade.  I was in immediate pain and could not hold the arm up at all.  I went to the doctor the following morning, and an xray was normal.  He prescribed me pain killers, and told me to let it get better.  The pain was bad for almost a month and I could hardly move the affected arm.  Anyways, since that time the shoulder has been known to pop while moving.  It happened every once in a while over the years and it was more of a strange occurance than a nuisance.  However, within the last 7 months, it is popping constantly and being extremely sore for most of the day.  There is no one activity or movement I do that induces it.  In fact I can move it on my own and pop it numerous times.  I mentioned this to my primary care doctor who referred me for xrays (again normal) and then to an orthopedic surgeon.  THey also tried a round of steriods and then anti-inflammatories (which made my asthma flare up)  The interns who examined me were able to pop it numerous times just by pushing my shoulder back or turning my arm in a pitching type motion.  When the regular doctor examined me he was able to pop in a completely different place.  His initial thoughts were that there was a labral tear and a possible second injury related to the shoulder/neck.  He referred me for an MRI.  That day I was horribly achy from the repeated popping and it continued into the following morning.  While at work, I turned in one direction and that should snapped (loudly enough for my coworkers to hear) and I was in immediate pain.  I went back to my regular doctor who examined it, put me in a sling and ordered x-rays.  The x-rays again came back normal, and he suggested that my shoulder was just inflammed from the repeated motions from the orthopedic visit, and that I should wear the sling for a day or two and let it heal.  It's now been a week, and the pain seems to be increasing.  Not only is the shoulder completely sore, but I get almost a radiating pain in my bicep and forearm region.  It varies with intensity, but basically I am still not able to extend my arm at all without severe pain.    I am not scheduled for the MRI and follow-up ortho. appt. until next month, and I am wondering if possibly something is missing here?  Any suggestions?  Also, is there a usual cause for a shoulder to pop (it feels like it goes out of place/but the doctor said it's not dislocated), and is the usual treatment for this kind of injury surgery?  Thank you in advance.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Dacubster,  Often, shoulder popping is due to a tendon slipping over part of the shoulder.  In your case, there may be some scar tissue or bony spurs that have formed from the original trauma that are now causing pain.  The MRI will be very helpful.  If your pain continues to get worse I would suggest you see your doctor for a follow up.  It may be possible to expedite the work up for you.    Treatment often will not require surgery but may.  Many times, rest and physical therapy can be helpful.  Best wishes.\n\n",

It was excrutiatingly painful for a few minutes then got better for 24 hrs. Then I found that I suddenly couldn't bear to raise my knucle as the pain was agony in knuckle and palm of hand and the path of tendon in palm is extremely painful to touch up to where it ataches to knuckle after which it doesnt hurt. My whole arm aches up to shoulder. Saw my Dr today who confrimed I had not dislocated my knuckle but saod I had torn or badly damaged the tendon where it attaches to knuckle on palm side of hand. She has strapped the two fingers together to keep them in normal position as I was curling fingers under fo pain relief. Even with fingers strapped the slightest upward movement of knuckle is agony and I cannot hold anything because of palm pain.  She said it could take at least a week before any improvement.  AS I am effectively one handed life is dificult. She did not give me any other advice and I wondered if there is anything else I can do to help it mend as I know tendons take ages to heal!\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 30 year-old male. In December of last year, I hit my wrist really hard against a wooden desk. I hit the knobby part on the outer side of the wrist. I went to a doctor who did x-rays and said nothing was broken or fractured. He said that a nerve runs right along the place where I hit my wrist, but that any injury I might have would get better on its own.  I didn't have much of a problem until around July of this year. I noticed a dull pain in my wrist and an odd twinging feeling, as if my fingers were about to move on their own. Also my wrist got sore easily, sometimes with a burning sensation, when doing something like using a computer mouse. I saw another doctor at the same office, who told me my wrist was just sore and that I should wear a splint. That was about three weeks ago. I wore the splint all the time for a little over two weeks, and I've been still wearing it most of the time.  I think the splint might have helped the soreness, but it doesn't seem to have cured the twinging feeling, which may be worse than before. I feel pain specifically at the same part of my wrist, and the twinging feeling in my fingers. I don't feel it much when I wear the splint, but when it's off and I use that hand, the feeling comes back. However, I think sometimes the splint intensifies the feeling because it presses against that part of my wrist. Sometimes I have a hard time getting to sleep because I can't find a position for my arm that doesn't cause my wrist to hurt. I don't know if the splint is helping or hurting overall.  I'm not sure what to do. I'm not in constant unbearable pain, but something isn't right.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Xyzp,  It is possible that there initially was a very small fracture that was missed on the first x-rays.  This can happen when the fracture is small and is not out of place.  In this case, it may be that a callous has formed where the fracture was that is now pressing in the nerve.  Depending on where your tingling is, carpal tunnel syndrome or another over-use type syndrome is also possible and may be unrelated to the initial trauma.  This seems less likely given the pain is in the same area as the trauma.  Seeing an orthopedic surgeon again is probably the best thing for you at this point.  You may need some repeat x-rays or an MRI of the area to help figure out why you are having these symptoms.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I hope I'm posting this in the right category - I asked a question last week regarding blood tests from ER visit for a shoulder problem and this one relates  to the MRI report from the shoulder, I didn't think it should go in the same thread - sorry if I should have posted there....  One month ago I awoke with acute L shoulder pain, went to PCM, ordered xrays and MRI, sent me home with vicadin.  About 24 hours later, I went to ER due to horrific pain, ROM of 2 degrees, was given IV anti-inflammatories and morphine.   The sharp pain continued for the next couple of weeks and was unable to move my arm.  A couple weeks after initial onset, I accidently put weight on the shoulder and felt a pop, shortly thereafter, the sharp pain subsided (still had achy pain) and I was able to move my arm again, with limited ROM due to pain.    I received my MRI report today at my (first) visit with the Ortho and was told everything looked fine, that he wasn't sure what has caused the problem, but listed off several possibilities.  Was told to continue Naproxen for one month (been on it for one month so far), take muscle relaxers 2x daily for a month (my muscles are spasming and I have lumps in two areas), and continue physical therapy.  However, once I got home and read the report, one sentence stood out.  Everything else on report was normal.  \"On coronal images, there is anterior angulation of the acromion with mild impingement on the suprapinatous tendon.\"  I understand the impingement, but what is the anterior angulation?  Also, my xrays, taken on 8-5, show calcium deopsit in bursa v. tendon, but do not show on MRI, taken 8-23.  Doc says the MRI did not show this view?  and that possibly the \"pop\" was dislodging the calcium and it moved down my arm, hence the pain there.......Does this make sense?  I'm feeling somewhat uneasy with this Doc as I was the one who pointed out the calcium and impingement in the first place after he said there was nothing on the MRI, and he never even looked at the xray until I urged him...I am just looking for a little reassurance.  Thank You.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Layla,  Unfortunately, this is not my area of expertise so I'll basically need to say that I would recommend you see an orthopedic specialist for a second opinion if you are still concerned.  Anterior angulation means the joint is angled towards the front of the body.  This may have been due to a mild dislocation (but, again, this is not my specialty so this is a bit of a speculation).  I cannot comment on the possibility of dislodging the calcium deposit in the tendon.  Sorry I can't be of more help to you.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, i am not sure if this is the right forum to post my questions,so my apologys if it is the wrong forum.  I am male and in my mid twenties. I am having trouble with back pain (lowr back) and shoulder pain, mainly after working all day (manuel labour) but not always. My doctor does not really know what is causeing the problem, but thinks it is probally due to the fact that i have a bad posture and rounded shoulders. My questions are:  1. Are there any exercises you could suggest to improve my posture and flatten my shoulders?  2. Are there any products you could suggest to improve my posture and flatten my shoulders?  3. Are there any websites you could suggest that offer advice on how to improve my posture and flatten my shoulders?  4. What other options do i have to improve my posture and flatten my shoulders?  5. It is possible to improve my posture and flatten my shoulders?  Sorry for so many questions, thanks in advance.\n\n",

    "content": "I don't know of specific techniques or products for flattening your shoulders, but low back pain often responds to toning of the abdominal muscles which support the back.  If I were you that is where I would concentrate my initial efforts.  Exercises such as situps can help.    Also, you may want to wear one of the elastic support belts people often use when lifting heavy objects.  It can really help protect your back when you labor.  If you get accustomed to wearing one of those whenever you work, you may find it to be helpful.    For posture, it is really just a matter of committing yourself to being conscious of this problem and working at doing better. I don't know of any special products for it.  A determined effort to sit up straight at all times and not slump over when sitting, standing, walking, etc. should help over time.  At your age, you can probably make a difference this way.  Be sure you are also getting enough calcium and vitamin D for your bone health.  If you use dairy products, this can usually be obtained that way.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Lindzyb,  When you stepped wrong you may have stretched a nerve causing your pain and numbness.  If it is just a stretched nerve it is likely to get better.  If, by chance, the nerve was severed it needs to be addressed as soon as possible to see if the nerve can be repaired.    I'd suggest that you have this evaluated to get a better sense of the possible nerve damage.  It is much more likely that this is simply a stretched nerve but its best to be sure.

It is worse in the mornings but better after I take a shower. I use my hands all day at work and they seem to be fine but in the evenings when they are not being used, the problem appears again. My hands feel swollen but do not really look as if they are.  I went to the doctor. They took x-rays and blood tests to rule out arthritis. Well it evidently is not arthritis and they do not know what it is and just told me to come back in another month if the problem worsens.  Any ideas?\n\n",

If your pain doesn't begin to improve you should see your doctor.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Peabody,  This is a bit interesting.  Perhaps it has to do with your or your wifes musculature being relaxed causing some changes in the positioning  of the way you are standing.  You may want to measure yourselves before and after to see who is \"changing\" height.  I've never heard of this happening before but it may all be related to muscle tension changes.  For example, if the muscles of the body are more relaxed it may be that your wife is standing taller rather than hunching slightly if she does hunch.  It may also be that your muscles are tightening a bit causing you to hunch slightly more than usual.  I can't say this is a definite cause but it's about the only theory I can come up with.

This is actually a fairly common occurrence.  It can be induced by trauma to the area.  It may be that some time ago you hit your leg in that area and it subsequently caused the atrophy to develop.  These areas are rarely symptomatic and are basically incidental findings.  If you notice that it is getting bigger at a fast rate or much bigger in size you should have it evaluated sooner.  Otherwise it is fine to wait until your next check up and ask your doctor to take a look.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello again.  At the age of 10 I was diagnosed with Left Tarsal Correlation (an abnormal cartilage fusion in my left foot). I was told that I could either, undergo surgery (which would make the foot very stiff) or take steroids. My mother refused both treatments because she didn't want me to take steroids, or for my foot to stiffen up. I am currently doing a lot of exercise and find that I am having severe pain in my left foot whilst running on a treadmill. I have tried to search for 'Left Tarsal Correlation' on the Internet to no avail. I was wondering if the treatments mentioned above are the only available treatments at present? I would love to be able to exercise without the pain I have been experiencing. Please advise.   Age: 18 Sex: Male. Past diagnosis: Left Tarsal Correlation. Past surgeries: None. Family history: None. Current Medications: None.\n\n",

    "title": "After foot surgery -- how long to build back muscle in leg?",
    "content": "Hello everyone,  I'm a 22-year-old female who just had bunion surgery (osteotomy) on her right foot five days ago.  Since then, my foot's been in a cast. It'll stay in this cast until I reach the two-week mark (i.e. 11 more days). For the third week following, I'll be in a walking cast with a \"negative heel\" that puts all weight on my heel (i.e. not on my former bunion). At the start of the fourth week, I can start using oversized shoes to start walking/waddling around.  Starting that fourth week, my surgeon says, I can also start swimming for an hour every day, to start to re-build muscle strength in my leg and to re-habilitate my foot.  Here's my question -- today, just 5 days following my surgery, I can already feel that the muscle in my right leg has altered completely (when compared to my left leg which I am using normally) -- it has lost shape and strength. My legs are among the few body parts I am pleased with, and would like to know how long I can expect it to take until my right leg will look like my left leg again. Assuming that I will be swimming every day for an hour after having not used it for three weeks, and, of course, walking around like usual. And how soon can I start other forms of exercise (say, weight-training or yoga)?  Thank you!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Lolabelle,  It will probably take several weeks to get your muscle strength back after the cast is removed.  Start exercising gradually and don't over do it so you don't end up with a muscle strain.  I am not sure how long your doctor will recommend waiting before beginning more complex exercises such as weight training and yoga.  I would recommend asking your surgeon about this.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I know nothing of my family history on my mom's side (she was adopted), but I haven't found anyone on my dad's side that has had the same problem as me.  About 3 months ago I woke up and couldn't move because my hip was in a lot of pain, and it's been ongoing since then.  I can't do any of my normal activities, because it hurts almost 24/7.  I went to a doctor, and he thought I had pulled my groin, which I didn't agree with, so I went to a chiropractor, and she had suggested hip cancer. The pain starts in my hip joint and pulses down my leg.  When it pulses down my leg, the pain is emphasized in my knee, ankle, and naturally, my hip.  I've had x-rays and ultrasounds done, but nothing has showed up so far.  The only medications I'm taking is Ventilin and Minovral.  This is very frustrating and I'd love a couple opinions!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi  xXcenobiteXx,  There are a few possibilities for your pain.  First, cancer of the hip is possible but much, much less likely than some of the other things.  It is possible that you may have a stress fracture or some arthritis of the hip, although it would be unusual to wake up suddenly with these.  It may also be that you have a compressed nerve in your back causing the hip and leg pain.  The pulsing pain you describe shooting down your leg is pretty consistent with nerve type pain.  Another possibility is that you have some pulled ligaments or tendons in the hip joint although it would be unusual for this pain to continue for 3 months.  I would recommend you see an orthopedic surgeon for an evaluation.  These are the muscle/bone experts and are likely to be able to help you get answers.  You may also need better imaging of the hip joint with an MRI.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Stretching your feet and leg muscles regularly can help this.  If this persists you may want to see your doctor to have your electrolytes checked (particularly your calcium, magnesium and potassium) since abnormalities of these can increase risks of muscle cramps.

    "content": "Hi Volleyballinjury,  Am I correct that she is having pain in both legs?  If so, this may be a lower back problem, potentially aggravated by the jumping and activity.  it may also be an overuse injury lower in the legs that is causing problems (particularly if she has grown a lot fast).  I would recommend she see her doctor for an evaluation of this.  If there is a sports medicine specialist in the area this really would be an excellent resource to help determine what is going on.  One note, sometimes athletes will take some pain medicine then go out and exercise or play sports.  This can actually make the issue worse because the problem is still there but the pain is taken away so the player doesn't realize the injury is getting worse.  Try to avoid having her do this.  If the team has a trainer or physical therapist it is also going to be helpful for her to really stretch the areas well before and after practice/activity.  Best wishes.\n\n",

This is considered a normal variation and, as long as there are no symptoms from it, no treatment is needed.  It likely is mostly genetic in terms of a cause.  The bump at the bottom of the sternum you are seeing may be the xiphoid process.  It is a small bone attached to the end of the sternum.  In some people it can be angled forward away from the spine.  Again, this is a normal thing and does not cause problems.  In some people this can be quite significant causing some cosmetic issues as you are describing.  There really isn't a great treatment for this issue.  Best wishes.\n\n",

When you pop or crack a joint, you stretch the joint capsule, causing a rapid release of gas which forms bubbles. It's the bursting of these bubbles that causes the popping sound.  In order to crack the same knuckle again, you have to wait until the gases return to the synovial fluid (25 to 30 minutes).  Another cause of  this \"cracking\" is the movement of joints, tendons and ligaments: When a joint moves, the tendon\u2019s position changes and moves slightly out of place. You may hear a snapping sound as the tendon returns to its original position.\n\n",

My knee has had a dull ache in it off and on. Yesterday, I woke up and it was so painful when I bent it, kneeled down or got up(especially squatting down). Today, I woke up and it hurts to even walk. If I squat, I can barely get up. It causes major pain. It hurts on the left side right above my kneecap. It hurts to even press in that area. Do you think this is from arthritis or do you think I turned wrong and didn't notice at the time.\n\n",

I had x-rays done and nothing showed up as far as broken bones. the dr. i saw at the time mentioned that it could be some kind of tendon pull-associated more with runners who run on their toes in stead of their heels. i'm not a runner-i was given crutches to use and told to stay off my feet. Since this occured now on my other foot i'm staying off of it and have it wrapped and applying a heating pad to it, i'm also taking naproxin hoping it will help as well.  I already missed a day of work but i don't want to irritate my injury any further can you please give me advise on how long i should stay off of my foot? thanks for taking time to read this.\n\n",

Using the anti-inflammatory medications such as naproxen can be helpful but caution should be used so as to not put too much exertion on the injured foot when the pain is down due to these medicines.    If the pain is not improving over the next few days I would advise you to have your foot evaluated.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Now it's football season and I'm on the football team. The first week went great, top of the game and no pains. but this second week was very painfull. During the practice my shins would have a very very severe thumping pain. And just today at practice I was literally crying, and thats not something you would find me doing very often, because of the pain. And I should include the past 3 or 4 nites I could not go to sleep because of how painfull my shins were.

You may need to see a sports medicine physician or an orthopedic surgeon for further evaluation on how to best prevent this from happening.  Your doctor can also help control the pain.  Here's the key with pain medicine and these types of injuries: often the people who get these injuries are driven to play sports or exercise.  When the pain is made better by medicine, they go out and exercise hard again.  This only worsens the injury.  When you take pain meds for such an injury it is important to rest during that time to avoid worsening the injury while the pain is masked.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Kzak4151,  It appears that the cartilage in your knee is wearing down.  On the inner side there is an area that is wearing probably due to a small bone spur.  On the outerside (the lateral meniscus) appears to be breaking down also.  I suspect this is probably the beginnings of osteoarthritis.  Cartilage can wear out overtime, especially if there is repeated trauma to the area.  I would recommend you see an orthopedic surgeon for an evaluation of your knee and MRI to see if there are treatments that might help.  Best wishes.\n\n",

The middle knuckle of this finger is noticeably swollen, especially on the side of the knuckle closest to my middle finger. The outer side of the knuckle is also swollen, though not as much. The finger is stiff and I have less range of motion in it than in my other pointer finger--I cannot bend it all the way. The knuckle is also tender to the touch. It seems to be more painful as I am warming up to pitch, after games, and the day after I pitch a game.   Are there any ideas as to what this might be or what I could do to make it better? (I have tried icing and ibuprofen.) I have 4-5 weeks left in my season, and cannot afford to take time off. However, I do not want to risk doing permanent damage to my finger.

The best management strategy really depends on what actually caused the pain/swelling.  Given you are continually using the finger to pitch a stress fracture is quite possible.  I would recommend you have an x-ray done to look for this.  No matter what the cause, a big part of getting your finger better is going to be resting it as much as you can.    I would recommend you see a doctor for an evaluation of your finger to get the best recommendations about how to treat it.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for your reply, Dr. Lowe. I never had any direct trauma to my finger, as usually seems to be the case with jammed fingers. The pain is something that has developed over the course of the season. I did have a period of about 2-3 weeks of time off. When I started practicing and playing again, the finger pain was still there.  If this were a stress fracture, would I still be able to use the finger to pitch, as I am now? Also, the swelling that I mentioned on the side of my knuckle closest to my middle finger is hard; it's not like the soft fluid build-up one would have with a sprained ankle, for example. I know you can't make a diagnosis without actually examining the finger, but I am just trying to determine the likelihood of a stress fracture. Thanks again!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi again,  I agree that if you had jammed it you would remember.  It's hard to miss something like that.  It may still be that you have a stress fracture, though.  Having a fracture would not necessarily limit you so you were unable to pitch with it.  Continuing to pitch with a stress fracture may cause the fracture to get worse to the point where the pain is too much to pitch, however.  I think your finger is in need of an x-ray.  If it is positive, you can get proper treatment.  If it is negative your doctor can pursue what may be going on.  Best wishes.\n\n",

It also revealed a previous injury/tear to that should that I was unaware of.  The orothopedic surgeon said that it was a \"complicated\" case and didn't recommend surgery.  He did however give me a steroid shot, which didn't help.   I went for a second opinion and the second surgeon also said that I wasn't a good candidate for surgery but that he wouldn't rule it out.  He didn't think it would help and might make the problem worse.  He also gave me a steroid shot that also didn't help.  When I get home from work, I use ice constantly, but it's only a temporary relief.  I'm in a tremendous amount of pain but am unable to take pain medicine other than Asprin or Tylenol, because everything else bothers my stomach.  I'm also a diabetic contolled by medication.  I'm at a loss of what to do next.  Neither doctor really had an answer.  My daughter heard about a chiropractic office that practices low level laser therapy (Erchonia Laser (FDA approved)) for pain relief.  I'm not sure what do do at this point.  Any suggestion would be appreciated.    Thank you in advance for your response.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Rocko,  You have a few options.  One is to see your orthopedic surgeon again and discuss your pain with them.  If the pain is too much for you it may be worth trying a surgical repair.  The surgeon can give you all the risks/benefits of the surgery and you can make an informed decision together.  Physical therapy/occupational therapy may also help.  Sometimes with muscle related injury physical therapy can be of tremendous help.  A third option would be to see a pain specialist to see if there is a different pain management regimen that will give you better relief.  I am not familiar enough with the Laser treatment to comment on its effectiveness.  Best wishes\n\n",

I am 47 and menopausal for 3 years now, I had benign lumps removed from breast 20 years ago and had an ovarian cyst drained 7 years ago, think thats the past history covered.  7 months ago I woke up and had to \"snap\" what I thought was my tendon in my right ankle before I could walk, since then both ankles are excruciatingly painful, swollen around whole ankle and I am now walking on the outside of each foot, I was on crutches for a while but no longer. The pain is a boo boom,  pulsating constantly and also goes into muscular spasms.  I have had blood test for rheumatoid Arthritis and x- ray for brittle bones and both were negative.  Just found out today that the waiting list to see consultant at my local hospital is 3 years!! I cannot imagine having this pain another day never mind 3 years.  I was on anti inflammatory tablets but they did nothing for the pain so I take normal over the counter medication for pain.  Incidently, both my wrists are in the early stages of similar pain but without huge fluid swelling around the joint.  As a lone parent to my children,.I am anxious that whatever I have, is nipped in the bud before it gets so serious that I am no longer on my feet.  Any reply greatly appreciated and thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Holistic-lady,  Do you have joint stiffness also?  And, does it get better throughout the day?  I ask because your symptoms make me very suspicious of rheumatoid arthritis.  If you have a skin condition known as psoriasis there is a related condition known as psoriatic arthritis that may also be causing your pain.  In a small number of cases, the rheumatoid factor may be negative.  I would also recommend testing your ESR and CRP (markers of inflammation).  X-rays can be done to look for osteoarthritis if they did not look for this on the initial x-rays.  I would recommend you continue to follow up with your primary care doctor.  Perhaps your doctor can discuss your case over the phone with a rheumatologist to get some more advice while you are waiting to see the specialist.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I believe that its R.A myself but as the blood test for this came back negative I just accepted this.  I do get eczema but not psoriasis  I do not know if this is linked and I had forgotton about it but my left arm tricep and bicep muscle has been aching in left arm, I am right handed and is generally weak, as in cannot put my weight on it to climb a chair etc, falling to bits I think, ha ha.  I will certainly request the tests you mentioned so I can get this fixed as the pain is driving me insane.  I live in rural Ireland so believe getting a rheumatologist will take as long as consultant appointment but I shall try.  Thank you so much.\n\n",

I have had 2 kids since my last surgery and gained quite a bit of weight since then. Ive gone to my surgeon who did both surgeries and he wont touch me because Ive had two surgeries and he said he wouldnt do the third. He sent me to another specialist who basically said deal with it. The MRI didnt show much. The past few months my right knee has been popping and grinding alot and it hurts so much sometimes I can barely walk or stand! Ive been on many anti inflammitory medications and none have seem to do much. Ive tried to work out and get in shape but that seems to make it worse! I also take 1-2 motrin 800's a day to help with pain and swelling but doesnt help. I also try heat and ice which once again doesnt help. Im not sure if I should look into another surgery or just PT??

    "content": "I think the key to being able to answer your question regarding how best to treat this lies in what actually is causing your pain.  If you have a torn meniscus (cartilage pad) in the knee this can cause significant pain and a \"catching\" sensation.  Scar tissue may also be a factor.  These things may be more treatable with surgery.  If the problem is due to some arthritis of the knee (quite common after injury) surgery is likely to do more harm than good.    I'm a little surprised that the MRI didn't show anything.  You may want to consider seeing a sports medicine doctor to see if there are some muscular components to your pain.  Getting a second opinion from another surgeon is always reasonable simply as a fresh look at the case.  I do understand your surgeon's hesitancy to do more surgery since each surgery adds to the chances of scar tissue or complications developing.  I hope you are able to get some relief.

If it is occuring in both feet I would strongly recommend you see your doctor to have your heart checked out to make sure it is doing OK.  Sometimes when the heart is not pumping well it can lead to dependent edema.  If it only involves the leg that the surgery was on it is a little more complicated.  It may be that the area still has some inflammation in it preventing normal circulation and uptake of the lymphatic fluid (fluid that normally leaks out of the blood vessels into the soft tissue that subsequently is picked up by the lymphatic tissue).  It is also possible that during the surgery one or more of the larger lymphatic vessels was cut.  Both these issues should resolve over time.

If you have any other signs of infection, such as redness, tenderness, discharge or swelling you will most likely need to take antibiotics to help clear up the infection.  If none of these are present it may be that the skin was not actually infected but simply was not strong enough to heal well.  In this case, removing the weakened area and reclosing the incision may be enough.  I would recommend close follow up with your surgeon and watch for any signs of infection.  If it appears that infection is developing I would recommend you see your doctor for an evaluation and antibiotics as soon as you are able to prevent the infection from getting bad.

Rotating the arm the full length around led to considerable pain and continuous clicking/popping sounds in the region.  My guess at cause for the pain was an injury occurring 8 yrs earlier.  A co-worker dropped a 25 pound box onto the shoulder and the corner of the box went into the back of my shoulder blade.  A clinic doctor x-rayed it and said he didn't see anything (a MRI was not performed).  Instead I was put in a sling, given painkillers, and painfully went through the next couple of months.  My current doctor thinks the original injury tore something, but wasn't seen because I was not given an MRI.  Furthermore, from his assessment, he thinks that my rotator cuff may completely torn.  He didn't offer many suggestions, but suggested I talk with an orthopedic surgeon and get an MRI.  My question is how do they usually decide who is a better candidate for surgery, versus strictly going through rehabilitation exercises for the injury.  I am wondering if the long time frame (8 years) will have any effect on what type of treatment options I may have?  Thanks for any advice.\n\n",

In deciding how to proceed with treatment (surgery vs. conservative therapy) many factors are taken into account.  These include: what is damaged and how badly is it damaged?  Is there potential for worsening illness if it is not repaired or will it heal well?  What will the future activity levels be for the patient and will these activities be putting significant stress on the rotator cuff or not?  In the end it comes down to a decision that must be made between you and your surgeon.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Without being able to assess you in person, it is difficult to determine exactly what part of your body \"under your collarbone\" hurts as you describe. But I would like to throw out a possibility for you to consider.  You state you have been having this problem for about 3-4 years, which means they began as far as you remember when you were about 15 or 16 years old.  Young women who may be \"late bloomers\" with accelerated breast development in their mid and late teens, need to use special bras when playing competitive sports - especially ones in which running plays a large part. \"Well-endowed\" women are particularly at risk. There can be a strain on the pectoral muscles with the movement of the breast tissue without adequate support.  You may wish to consider investing in a good sports bra and see if that helps.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 23 year old male. I have no past surgical medical history nor am I on any medication. I am posting here because I cannot post in the sports medicine forum. For the last couple of years I have experienced excrutiating pain in my throwing arm after throwing. It does not always occur but most often occurs when I throw several days in sucession. It is like my arm does not recover. Often if I do not throw for a couple days the arm feels fresh and strong when I resume throwing.The pain often sets in after I am done throwing and the arm hangs at my side. It is a slow, pulsating pain that is often nauseating. The pain is annoying across the medial side of the elbow(from the inner forearm to the inner tricep) and extreme in the laterall head of the tricep(long head) which ties into the elbow. My arm goes extremley cold, my forearm, triceps, and bicep become extremley soft, my arm shakes violentley, and the velocity at which I can throw the baseball is extremley reduced. It is hard for me to grab things. I am right handed but structuraly my right arm feels unstable, the area surronding my right elbow also seems to be smaller and have less muscle surronding it compared to my left arm. My right tricep is not as defined as left especialy where it ties into the elbow. At this point there seems to be a hard mass covering the area where the tricep ties into the elbow. Oddly enough my arm strength has steadily been improving. Latley I have had the feeling that my arm has died I am not getting the same carry or velocity on the ball as I have been. Also the pain is not as extreme as it has been in the past. I do not pitch. I will be seeing a specialist on the 24th but I have the feeling that they are going to simply tel me to use the R.I.C.E. method. As I live in a country with public medicine they reserve things such as MRI's for emergency situations. I know this is a lengthy post and I also realize that sports medicine may not be your field but i'm hoping that you may be able to provide some ideas as to what the orgin of the pain my be. Thank you for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Smile23, Have you discussed lateral epicondylitis (more commonly known as \"tennis elbow\") with your primary care doctor?  The mechanism if injury is in keeping with your passion for pitching.  The concern is that if it is indeed lateral epicondylitis, it may be a degenerative process that is exacerbated (made worse) by your continuing the repetitive throwing movements that may have caused the original injury.  The fact that you experience some relief when you rest the arm, and that it starts to \"act up\" when you actively use it again, seems to support this supposition. You may need to see if extended rest may allow the tendons to heal.  You may also want to consider that if your passion is contributing to your problem, you may need to find another passion.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear edcarta, Osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis are two different manifestations of arthritis (inflammation in the joints).  The interesting thing about them is that there is a generalized way to differentiate them from a lay person's perspective.  Osteoarthritis is one where there is pain and limitations in movement when beginning activity from a rest, which gets better when the affected limb is loosened up. In other words, the condition is worsened by rest and alleviated/improved by movement. Rheumatoid arthritis, oppositely, is worsened by movement and improved by rest.  What you are describing, coupled with your statement that you already have been diagnosed with osteoarthritis, seems to strongly lean toward this \"finger\" phenomenon being a flare up of your arthritis. The fact that you are able to release the \"frozen\" joint with first passive then active range of motion, certainly strengthens my supposition.  The best thing to do is keep active, keep all your joints mobile, maybe explore some of the OTC (over the counter) joint support neutraceuticals, and be sure to let your doctor know that your symptoms seem to be getting a little more complex, and aggravating.\n\n",

Since you indicated you had nearly 2 and 1/2 months of inactivity I am not surprised that you notice a smaller Left Leg than Right and have also discovered how easily these atrophied limbs can be injured! As far as strengthening goes - your local gym probably has a trainer that can assist you with equalizing your lower extremity strength and size.  I get the impression that you are an athlete who probably has immediate access to a trainer or a sports medicine physician.  Use your resources! A strong commitment to recovering your pre-injury strength and flexibility is the best key to achieving our goal!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  The median nerve which innervates muscles of the hand runs from the forearm into the hand crossing over the wrist joint.  When the nerve is squeezed at the wrist, numbness and pain in the muscles supplied by the nerve occur, a condition known as Carpal tunnel syndrome.  Carpal tunnel syndrome is usually due to increased pressure on the median nerve and tendons in the carpal tunnel and not due to an injury in the nerve itself.  The carpal tunnel is smaller in some people leading to congenital predisposition to the syndrome.   Factors involved in the disorder include: -  Direct trauma or injury to the wrist resulting in swelling that adds pressure on the median nerve. -  Swellings due to hormonal disturbances like pituitary gland hyperactivity; hypothyroidism; rheumatoid arthritis; -  Work stress, repetitive movement can cause tendonitis. -  Fluid retention due to hormonal changes  - In some cases there is no apparent cause.    Treatments for carpal tunnel syndrome are preferred to start as early as possible. Underlying causes should be treated first.    General measures include: - Rest of the affected hand and wrist for at least 2 weeks and immobilizing the wrist in a splint to avoid further damage from twisting or bending.   - Medications like NSAID - Finally surgery is recommended to complicated persistent cases for 6 month after conservative measures.  In the majority of cases rest through immobilization using a splint and other conservative measures will alleviate symptoms.  Age per se is not a contraindication for this type of operation if the general condition allows. Surgery however, is a decision taken by the neurosurgeon after complete physical examination and proper investigations to confirm the underlying cause and to exclude any contraindication for surgery.  I advise you to follow with your doctor. Keep us updated, Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  This could be Posterior interosseous nerve (PIN) palsy.  This is due to injury of a branch of the radial nerve that supply muscles of the hand on the dorsal surface that result in motor dysfunction. It is uncommon but seen after trauma or iatrogenic during fixation of fractures ordeep traumatic injuries ( nearby the tendon of the biceps).  Traumatic PIN palsy have three types:  of them Type I complete PIN palsy affects extension of the wrist ,at the metacarpo-phalangeal joints of all the fingers and the thumb, and weak abduction of the thumb.  Type II the xtension of the little and ring fingers are lost sparing the index, thumb and middle fingers.  Type III  the index and the thumb extension is lost and loss of abduction of the thumb sparing the other fingers. (as in your case)  Radiographs to detect  forearm fractures, dislocations or instabilities and EMGs (3 weeks after damage may become abnormal) are helpful in the diagnosis.  A 6- to 12-week waiting period is followed by some doctors,if there is no recover of function, exploration of the nerve is indicated.  Exploration and primary or delayed primary repair or nerve grafting is performed if complete nerve damage occur. The results depend on the nature of the wound and the extent of nerve injury.   Keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

Successful surgery mandates an attention for possible complications like nerve injury and ectopic bone formation.   Single-incision technique is one of the approaches aiming to avoid as possible fixation damage, avoids PIN injury, and minimal ectopic bone formation although injury of the radial nerve is still of consideration.  I hope, it is just a mild injury and you will recover soon. Keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

Yet my second Doctor seems to think it's very unlikely that the nerve is entrapped. He thinks it's a compression injury. Another surgery is an option but could set me back further. I am not sure what I should do? I wish I knew which function I will regain first. I read about an ultrasound machine that can detect nerve lesions. I just want to make the right choice, Also for what it's worth, he damaged the sensory branch of the Radial nerve too as I am numb on the inside of my forarm. My arm is atrophied badly below the elbow. Here is the link to the ultrasound equipment. .  http://www.medical.philips.com/us/news/ ... graphy.asp  It's getting very difficult to remain positive.

I've already had both an ultrasound to check for blood clotting in my right leg and I've had an xray of the right knee. Nothing was found on either test. My problem is this, my right knee on the outside is a little swollen and sometimes hurts. Sometimes pain radiates UP my right leg from the site of the knee. Although I say Knee, my knee really isn't affected only the side of the knee area. In addition, the bottom of my right foot had been itching for months, in the same spot, just before the arch, dead center. Sometimes it hurts too. For the life of me I can't tell if the two are related or not. I noticed when I wore high-heals it sent a new and more dramatic pain up my leg. On a scale of 1-10 when wearing heals, I would say it was a 7. The pain continued on like that for hrs, even though I took the shoes off within mins of the start of the pain. I need a direction to go in here. Any suggestions? This has been ongoing for several months now, maybe close to a year.\n\n",

I went to an orthopedic surgeon...I believe he said (it was very long ago!) I had torn tendons or ligaments under the knee cap and recommended I stop dancing or always wear a brace. Instead of listening to his advice I went with acupuncture. I have had no swelling or pain since except sometimes when I kneel and I experience a sharp horrible pain that seems to come from under my kneecap. Recently my knees would be achy after dancing so to protect my knees, since I kneel  a lot during a routine, I have been wearing a compression brace. I have also started going to the gym to build the muscles around my knee. Since the gym and the brace, I have been  experiencing popping, clicking and grinding  whenever I move my leg back and forth. The clicking is in both knees. I am worried this is something serious!! Any advice would be greatly appreciated...I have no insurance so getting to a doctor is difficult unless its absolutely necessary! Thanks!\n\n",

It is also possible that you have some arthritis in your knees (where the cartilage is worn down and the bone is scraping bone).  This is very common in dancers and other athletes over time.  Strengthening exercises are generally helpful but if they are causing pain you should be cautious.  If your pain is worsening or not improving I would recommend that you see a doctor.  There are often clinics that offer reduced fee schedules for those that have no insurance.  Your local health department can help point you to them if needed.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "pain in the right side at the bottom of the ribs On Feb. 8th my husband came down the flu or a real bad cold, it lasted about 5 days, then on the 16th he went to the restroom that night and came back out and said he could not go, and it made his side hurt, it got worse, it is right at the bottom of his ribs on the right side, he could not sit, walk or lay right, he could not cough, sneeze or blow his nose without bad pain, he even had trouble using his right arm because of the pain, he is still hurting but a little better, does anyone have any idea what it could be. To add to some more info, he has not been vomiting or anything, but for as long as I have known him (10 yrs now) he has had server heartburn at time gagging him, and always a soft or sometimes runny stool, I don't know if that has anything to do with his side but I thought It could.\n\n",

It only very mildly aches while sitting and moving my foot side to side or with dorsi or plantarflexion.  It is only when I am putting weight on it that I get the greatest pain.  Theres is a pocket of very mild swelling over the spot where it hurts.  Thank you for your time!\n\n",

    "content": "Limitation of ankle joint range of motion could be due to  osteophyte (bone spur) formation at the front of your ankle joint. This would retrict your ability to dorsiflex the foot on the ankle.  Another possibility is talar dome fracture although normally I would expect this to be associated with some trauma to the foot/ankle and you did not mention any.  If this were the case however, it is possible for a fragment of the talus bone to be loose in the anke joint.  Tight posterior leg muscles can restrict ankle joint dorsiflexion though it sounds more like you feel its an issue at the front of your ankle.  I agree an orthopedic exam would be important. Some plain radiographs may be very helpful, CT scan more helpful still. Good luck!\n\n",

In either case the problem is treatable although the surgeon may want to scope the ankle to remove any floating pieces.\n\n",

It sounds like your surgeon wants to get in with the scope (arthroscopy)  to better appreciate the extent of the damageto both talus and tibia  before deciding on a treatment plan. Treatment plans do vary depending on the size of the lesion. If there is a loose body (bone and/or cartilage fragment) floating around it would need to be removed or fixated at your surgeon's discretion.  Sometimes a procedure called subchondral drilling is performed to help reestablish blood supply to the damaged area of the bone.  Other lesions of thistype could be treated with a bone graft. Again, the size and extent of the damage will determine which treatment would be necessary.   Hope this helps.  PAF\n\n",

I am also  a fan of Sweedo braces (if you're not familiar its kind of a canvas lace up support that you can wear inside a regular shoe).    I am sure many of your therapy patients go home temporarily in more pain than before the therapy (especially when just beginning therapy as a new patient ).  I know after a visit with my chiropractor  I can expect pain that escalates over the 48 hours or so following the visit ( and THEN I finally start to feel the benefits of the treatment).  If someone is poking around in any area of your body you are likely to feel some pain afterwards, particularly if that body part was hurt before the poking started  :-)  Hope this is helpful.

Whenever I get up from sitting there is also a loud pop from one or both of my hips. I had to stop playing field hockey in college because I wasn't able to do all of the sprinting and the drills that were required, and sometimes when I run I can feel something in my hips catching and popping (it's quite gross actually). I can't even stand and raise my leg up without causing pain, and when I have to sit for long periods of time, I start to feel a pulsating ache in both my hips. Please help!! My doctor gave me a couple stretches to do, but I can't even bear doing them, although I really try.\n\n",

When exercising the feet/legs need more blood flow and can't get it so pain occurs.  This condition can be associated with high blood pressure and is due to peripheral artery disease.  It is fairly rare before the age of 50 but can occur.  I would recommend you see your doctor for an evaluation of this.\n\n",

    "title": "Restricted dominant forearm rotation",
    "content": "Dear Doctor,  I am a 22 y/o left-handed male and my left forearm has had a  restricted motion range for as long as I can remember - I first noticed the problem when I was 6.  If I put both my palms face down on a flat surface, I can easily rotate my right palm about 150-60 degrees, close to the face up position, but I can only rotate my left palm about 60 degrees to a near sideways position.  This makes it impossible to exercise my arms symmetrically, and forces me to use my non-dominant arm for many tasks, from using scissors to tennis and sometimes even turning doorknobs, although for some tasks I can partly compensate with wrist, elbow and shoulder movement.  Nevertheless, this problem has made me somewhat ambidextrous, but sometimes quite uncomfortably so.  Externally, there is no visible sign of any abnormality in my left arm, there is no pain, and the reduced range of motion \"feels\" normal, although movement is more sluggish with slightly greater resistance.  When I was young, it was noted that when I write, my posture and the way I hold my pen is very unusual, although this has not impeded my capability to write quickly and clearly.  I do not know, however, whether this was the cause of my problem or an adaptation to it.  I recall no major injury to my left arm.  Although I consider this a very minor disability, I would like to achieve full use of my dominant arm, and I would be grateful if you could advise me whether that is possible, and in what way I could go about achieving it.  Thank you for your help.  Jonathan\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 77 year old male. The only surgery was repairing severed tendons in my right hand. Full use restored.  My father died at 76 of congestive heart failure after suffering many years from emphysema (mustard gas in WWI and lifetime smoker).  My mother died at 97 with no acute problems at the time.  My sister died died at 66 of brain cancer.  I currently take Benazepril 5mg daily,Verapamil 240mg daily, Lovastatin 10mg daily.  Atrovent 4 puffs, 5 times daily and Albuteraol PRN (rarely)  The foot  condition started about 10 years ago on my right foot only. My family physician at the time suggested probably arthritis - \"learn to live with it\". About 4 years ago my current FP referred me to a Podiatrist, who gave me no explanation, but prescribed special shoes - which were declined by my insurer.  I never purchased on my own, as I had already tried OTC inner soles and knew that I would have some relief  - but not an answer.  It is now much more intense and in both feet.  There is NO PAIN associated with the discomfort - just the feeling like I am walking on soft marbles.  When I am barefooted, it actually affects my stability.  When shod, that affect is not as noticeable - but still there. There is also the sense that the body temperature in my feet might be less that elsewhere - but that does not prove out on feeling the feet.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Chartsmalm, There are a variety of foot ailments that could be what you are referring to, and without a personal assessment of your feet, I can only offer general descriptions of a couple in hopes of helping you.  What kind of shoe did the podiatrist recommend?  I appreciate your comment that you had already explored the use of OTC innersoles, however, not all innersoles are the same.  An orthotics specialist may have an answer for you if returning to the podiatrist is not an option, especially since it sounds like you did not appreciate the lack of information from the one you saw. Your city should have several orthotic/prosthesis companies.  There are also a number of \"foot\" stores available in many large cities that specialize in custom or nearly custom inserts to correct stance, gait, and bone structure abnormalities.  Some abnormalities are actually normal for age and wear and tear on the feet: callus formation as an example.  Changes in the impact velocity on the metatarsals also occurs as we age, causing variations in where the foot contact to the ground is made.  Both of these examples can cause the sensation you are describing.  I suggest you consult an orthotics company, or even do some research online into companies such as HappyFeet who may give you insight into the top of the line specialty shoe manufacturers who strive to provide footwear for \"happy feet\".\n\n",

With that in mind:  If we consider the possibility that the perception of coolness is indeed related to the above scenarios - then it could be that the nerve endings interpreting the topographic changes in your feet as soft marbles, may also interpret ambient temperatures differently than sensors in the rest of your body.  It is also possible that other factors may be at play - for instance an undiagnosed peripheral neuropathy, a misalignment in your spine, and even simply a natural tendency to over-read symptoms when trying to discover cause for an existing concern.   If the problem persists, and becomes a serious concern to you, it would be a good idea to bring it to the attention of your primary care physician.  Thank your for your feedback, and for using Doctors Lounge.\n\n",

It's noticable underneath clothing and it's always made me a bit self-conscience about my body, 'specially when it comes to things like wearing swimming suits. My ribs stick out even further when i lay on my back--I look like some starving person, even though I'm at a normal weight for my height and age.   I talked to my family doctor about it and she told me, \"well, it's different,\" and that it really shouldn't be an issue as long as I'm breathing normally and there's nothing with my spine. She also said she could only think of surgery--which, of course, neither her or I would want--but other than that there's nothing that could be done.   I asked if there is some sort of brace that could maybe help, but she said she hadn't heard of such a thing. Though, I've been looking around on the internet and I've found there's other people with the same problem who suggest corsets. I've even found this site with a supposed doctor who recommends them: http://www.staylace.com/medicaladvice/med_36.htm  What is your opinion?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Tanner, Sounds like you may have a bout of TMD - temporomandibular joint disorder - more commonly referred to as TMJ - which is the name of the associated joint.  The most common cause of associated pain is myofascial pain dysfunction syndrome, which is noticeable mostly when chewing or as you indicated whenever you have your mouth open for a while.  It seems that whenever the joint \"popped\" it did not remain displaced, but it will be sore for a while. You did not mention if you are still having problems masticating.  If so, or if the soreness persists, you would be wise to check it out with your doctor - who may - in severe cases cross-refer you to an Dentist to explore why the problem occurred to begin with, and what needs to be done to fix it.  If the joint is not now displaced, warm compresses may help the pain and discomfort, and increase circulation to the area to speed healing.  I would be cautious about chewing hard food for a while!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear PinkPenny1uk, Sometimes the best way to handle an anxiety issue is to face it square on - have you considered getting a mammogram?  Did your doctor suggest that?  That is the number one way for you to eliminate breast cancer as a possible situation.  It is recommended at about your age that you get a baseline mammogram anyway.  From a health anxiety perspective, or panic attacks, please remember, we can always handle what we know we have a lot easier than the giant monsters of problems our fertile minds are able to create!  Then after having faced that scary question head on, you can lay that fear to rest.  Bone density is done to determine if the bones have become affected by any disease that attacks bone.  If your doctor tells you these tests were fine, it implies that you do not have reason at this time to be overly concerned.  CRP (c-reactive protein) is a test to see if an inflammatory process is at work in your body.  Again, if this test is \"fine\", it implies you do not have anything serious at this time to worry about. You did not mention if you smoke.  Smoking will aggravate a panic disorder, and can cause pain with breathing.  Panic itself can cause physical pain, and this pain can lead to more panic and a vicious cycle begins.  Are you taking your antianxiety meds as prescribed?  They should help you be in control enough to calmly pursue a mammogram as suggested above, and to keep the giant monsters of your mind at bay.\n\n",

    "content": "hi Marceline , thanks for the reply. i am on medication for my anxiety and panic attacks yes. i take citalopram 20mg. my doctor didn't mention anything about me having a mammogram. maybe i will go and ask him to refer me for one. i got the impression that a c reactive protien blood test shows any imflamations which includes cancer. as i understand it it can'r pin point the cause only that there is something happening (i gave in and googled). i have had this achiness/pain for over a year now and my doctor did inform me when i first went that pain is a later stage of breast cancer we usually display other symptoms first. as i stated, i have checked regularly and found no lumps or noticable changes. someone else did say to me that acid reflux can cause pain as well. i did use to smoke but i gave up just before christmas last year. i know having panic attacks and anxiety doesn't help and i am currently seeing a councillor to try and help me through these issues. the trouble with health anxiety is if i did go for a mammogram and everything came back ok, i would them most proberly start fretting about sometghing else. its a vicious circle.  many thanks for your advice.  pp1\n\n",

The chills show up a little after the pain. First I get cold and after about 20 minutes, I start to tremble and the skin under my nails turn purple.   This all clears up with a couple ibuprofen and a hot bath or shower. I take atleast 6 ibuprofen a day. This has been a constant pain for the past 4 months.

The acronim RICE provides good treatment for these injuries: Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation.  Rest your wrist and be self limited in terms of using it.  If it causes pain, don't do it.  Ice is good initially, not as helpful after a few days.  Wearing a compression type brace or bandage can be helpful to provide some extra support.  Elevation helps keep the pressure of gravity and the rest of the body off the injury until it heals.  If your wrist isn't getting better in a few days (not totally better but getting better) you should have it examined.  Best wishes.\n\n",

They curve in slightly from the first knuckle to the tip and the curve is towards my ring finger.  I am a hobbist guitar player.  It would be easier to play guitar if my little finger on my left hand was straight -  I could reach further down the neck of the guitar.    I can bend my left pinky finger straight without causing any pain. My question is this.  If I put a splint on my pinky finger to hold it straight while I sleep at night, would this eventually cause my finger to stay straight?  Thanks\n\n",

You did not mention if you had injured your knee, or if you ever had knee swelling in the past.  If your knee is swollen due to trauma, such as a fall, the swelling is the body's natural defense to injury, and sometimes rest and propping your leg up on pillows will help to reduce the swelling,  I am concerned that you may feel the over the counter pain medications available at your local pharmacy are not going to be effective due to your high \"tolerance\".  The method of action of NSAIDS (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), as its name implies, is to reduce inflammation. This swelling may be the source of your discomfort, and helping it to go down should give you pain relief.  The medications work independent of your body's pain receptors.  If you have already tried the OTC meds, and you still have pain and swelling, it would be a good idea to go to your doctor or clinic, and ask them to both evaluate your problem, as well as tell you what will be the best medication in your specific case to help.  Other diseases (\"dis-ease\") can present with similar symptoms, and your doctor is the best one to help you determine what is wrong.\n\n",

General bone xrays show nothing according to the pediatrician, just a bone prominence growing outward and laterally across his chest. Went from 1inch wide to 4 inches.  He is 33lbs, very small for his age, but healthy otherwise.  He had an echocardiogram, normal results.  Complains of chest pain from time to time after increased daily activity and at night.  No scoliosis per pediatrician.  Could this be symptoms of some sort of bone cancer or other problem his doctor is missing?  No history of bone cancer in family, (aunt, breast cancer and grandpa, skin cancer and kidney failure).  He has had his tonsils/adenoids removed at age 4, 2 1/2 weeks premature with rough pregnancy (breathine, procardia, mag). singulair currently for allergies. Thank you, Kim\n\n",

Typically, nerve pain is described as burning or stabbing.

I'm currently taking O.T. 3x wk. since 3/6/7 for my RT shoulder and RT. wrist..which MRI showed had a tear in ligament and tendon injury.. I wear a thumb spica Titan splint.   I have had x-rays and MRI. X-rays didn't show anything. MRI showed small rotator cuff tear. I have horrible pain in my right shoulder.. the only way that I can describe it is like a giant absess toothache pain in my shoulder.  Sometimes it's a dull ache, but usually an awful deep ache with sharp shooting pains at times. I have pain raising and just in general moving my arm and shoulder.  At night especially I will wake up crying out with the pain... laying half on my stomach on my left side with a pillow shoved tightly up into my RT armpit seems to help a little.  It also feels like it's getting harder and harder to lift and move my arm without using my other hand to help pull it up. When I bring my arm down from a raised position.. and move it in certain ways  it will catch and feel as if it's sliding out. My O.T therapist does not believe that I have a frozen shoulder that doc is saying it is.  She says it's anterior shoulder instability. When I do the arm raises with her she will grip my humeral and push in hard while I bring my arm down and this helps with the catching. She has done ultrasound treatment on shoulder 1x and it hurt!  She was worried about humeral head fracture and quit and called doc - doc said x-rays and MRI fine keep going minus the ultrasound. Can you have anterior shoulder instability and a frozen shoulder all at the same time? What else could it be? Thanks in advance for your help! Zippy :-)\n\n",

    "content": "The term frozen shoulder essentially means limitation of shoulder movement for reasons that cannot be explained by a torn tendon, etc.  In these cases, the shoulder isn't really \"frozen\" as it would work fine if the muscle were attached to the bone to allow proper pulling on the bone.    A frozen shoulder may occur for no known reason, or from trauma.  Often, physical therapy is helpful although surgery may be needed in refractory cases.  \"Cure\" of a frozen shoulder is a long process and may take several years to fully get mobility back.  Anterior instability results when the ligaments/tendons are damaged in such a way that the head of the humerus wants to slip forward out of the shoulder joint when the right stress is placed on it (movement similar to pitching a ball with the arm drawn back and rotated some).  Anterior instability may need surgical repair as well.  If the issue is minor, often strengthening of the rotator cuff muscles can help overcome this laxity and protect the shoulder joint.  If you are beginning to experience limitation in your joint mobility you may be seeing the beginnings of a frozen shoulder.  Continuing with physical therapy and range of motion exercises will likely help.  Continued follow up with your orthopedist is important.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  For a couple of years now I have experienced pain in my right hip upon standing after I sit in a chair and rest my foot slightly higher than ground level.  A guess would be 90 degrees sitting with feet on the ground and 70 degrees when my foot/feet are raised.  This does not bother my left hip - only the right.  The pain is sharp and I cannot walk until my hip settles (maybe back into place?)  I have learned not to sit this way and all has been well.   Recently (the last month or two)... my right hip began to hurt no matter how I sit (maybe 25% of the time) and even gives out on me as I am walking (at random times) (around 2-4 times per day).  I do not fall... but I feel pain & begin to limp (maybe a 5-6 out of 10 for pain?).  It also hurts and gives out if I twist to the side the \"wrong\" way.    The reason I am writing is not to ask for a diagnosis... but to ask you what questions I should ask my doctor (I plan on making an appointment in a month or so?).  My mom has many osteo problems (osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, spinal stenosis, degenerative disease of L4 & L5... she is a mess :)  she is 59.  I am 36 w/recently diagnosed scoliosis (24 degree curve) which does cause back pain and stiffness.  My paternal grandma has Paget's disease of the bone.  I am female.  No meds.  Diagnoses include scoliosis, ovarian cysts, uterine fibroid.    I am wondering if I should ask for a bone density just to check on things or will they tell me I am too young?    What kind of tests will she order (if any) for this kind of problem or will she send me to a specialist?  Any insight would be most appreciated :)  Thanks so much!!!\n\n",

    "content": "Seeing your primary care doctor first is the right course of action for you.  At that point you may be referred to an orthopedic specialist.  It is likely that you will need to get some x-rays of your hips to look for any bony changes.    Your doctor(s) may want to order other tests such as some blood tests to look at your calcium levels, etc. and possibly a bone density test; however, it is unlikely this will help much at your age unless it appears that you may have some bone loss on your plain x-rays.  When you go to your doctor just tell the story as you have here.  That should lead your doctor to be able to ask the questions needed to make a specific diagnosis or guide your work up.  Best wishes.  If we can be of any other help to you please feel free to post a follow up.\n\n",

    "content": "I am 51 yr old male and have recently had an acromioplasty performed on my right shoulder to remove a spur and repair torn muscles/tendons.  Prior to and leading up to this for three years, apart from the shoulder pain, the following sysmptoms have developed and increased. Pain in the arm, a hard bump on the right upper sternum where the first rib attaches, bilateral carpal mtunnel syndrome, all my joints on the right side of my body have to be cracked frequently throughout the day in order to have proper flexibility and rotation/movement - the sequence is usually crack my rt elbow, then my rt fingers, then my neck crack to the left and then lift my rt arm high to crack the clavicle joints.  This is done to relieve pain as well.  I have attempted to get an MRI/CT scan to on all these areas of my body to determine how all are affected and connected to each other but all I could get from my doctor and ortho surgeon was an MRI on the acromion only for the shoulder operation.  Now that there are problems after the surgery - 2 months ago - he has ordered another MRI of the same small area.  The sysmptoms have been going on for about 3 yrs and now I am losing muscle in my rt arm and there is pain at the bicep tendon attachment areas.  Do any physicians out there have any idea what is happening to such a large area of my body or if the MRI/CT scan I mentioned is a valid request/expectation on my part - is there some info I can print off to convince my doctors that this is a serious problem and not old age?\n\n",

    "content": "While I am far from a specialist in this area I'll give you my two cents worth.    If you are loosing muscle mass this may be due to one of two main problems.  First, you may have nerve damage.  If the nerves are not stimulating the muscle properly the muscle begins to shrink.  The nerves that may be involved start in the neck at the spine.  A careful neurological exam should be done to isolate any nerve type signs.  Second, the muscle may be becoming smaller due to lack of use.  The injury you have may be limiting your ability to exercise the muscle.  Muscles require adequate use to maintain bulk.  I would recommend you continue to follow up with your orthopedic surgeon and discuss your symptoms.  Also, it is within your rights to request a second opinion if needed.  Best wishes.  I hope this helps a little.\n\n",

The only other change is that my joints and muscles seem to be stiffer and more rigid/firm to the touch sort of like they are becoming wooden.  This is happening in both arms.

    "content": "I am a 79 year old male. I have had progressive hearing loss for many years, and have worn hearing aids for at least 20 years. I have moderate osteoarthritisI in my neck, shoulders, elbows, hips, and knees. Both of my parents had hearing loss and arthritis. I am not taking any medications.  I was in the habit of taking out my right hearing aid and using that ear when on the phone because I could hear better with that ear under those conditions. Suddenly, one day, when trying to hear on the phone, I realized that I couldn't hear out of that ear at all on the phone, or with the aid in for normal use. I have no idea what happened, or when. I felt no pain or sudden change when this must have happened. In searching for the cause, I found that the ear canal had become completely closed. The two bones that the canal passes between, and that surround it, had changed position somehow, and were now touching each other, blocking the canal. One of these bones seems to be the jaw bone. The other seems to be part of the skull. With one of my fingers, I am able to reach into the canal and push these bones apart, but they close up again as soon as I remove the finger.  What could have caused this problem, and what could be done about it?  Thanks for any information you can give me.\n\n",

    "content": "Chronic low back pain is a common and difficult problem to manage from a physician point of view.  Diagnosing the actual cause can be quite difficult as well.  It sounds as if you've seen all the right people and had the right tests done.  I have found that what ever the initial cause of the pain, the pain is almost always added to by muscle pain.  This is because the muscles of the back are always tensed up trying to protect the back from moving and causing pain.  This, in turn, causes the muscles to begin to hurt.  Physical therapy can be helpful.  Back strengthening exercises may help some.  Keep following up with your doctor.  If you've not seen a neurosurgeon this may be another avenue to pursue.  Generally, back surgery should be a last resort because it can sometimes cause more problems but in some cases it is necessary.  Best wishes.  Hang in there, back pain can be very difficult to deal with.\n\n",

I had an MRI and this was confirmed that i had a high grade level 2 tear. i was put in a brace for 4 weeks. until mid november  it still sometimes bugs me and causes pain, especially in the cold. i am aiming to be back playing sport in 1 month. should i go and see the Dr again, or go to see an ortho surgeon. i really want it fixed as my last netball season was full of injury, and i have worked hard, then my knee. i just want to be able to play!!  thanks for taking the time to read it, sorry its so long!!

Sometimes, surgery is not needed as the knee can often do OK without one of the ligaments intact.  Generally repair is recommended for those that are very active.  You may consider visiting an orthopedic surgeon to discuss possible treatment options for you.

    "content": "There are a few possible causes of your pain.  Commonly with respiratory illnesses, the lining of the lungs (called pleura) become inflamed.  This can cause intense pain that is typically referred to as sharp and stabbing.  Another possibility is that you have strained a rib muscle with coughing.  These muscle strains heal similar to other muscle strains-slowly.  Ibuprofen is good for this pain as it helps relieve inflammation.  I suspect this is what has occurred in your case.  While it theoretically is possible to induce a hernia with coughing, it would be very rare and one would likely need to have some underlying predisposition for this to happen.  If your pain is not improving over then next few days I recommend you see your doctor.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "There are a few possibilities.  You may have had a severe strain of the muscles causing the pain/swelling.  These can take a long time to go away.  The MRI would most likely have seen any tendon damage, bone fractures or ligament damage making these less likely.  Also you may have some nerve damage.  These can be very painful.  Diagnosis is mainly clinical unless one wants to do nerve conduction studies that are somewhat painful and difficult to do.  Peripheral nerves do regenerate but it is a long process.  Reflex sympathetic dystrophy is a syndrome of pain that occurs after an initial injury happens.  The injury heals but pain persists and can be quite severe.  It sounds as if you may have this.  Treatment is a little painful as it basically requires that the injured part be moved and stretched to allow the nerves to \"reset\" back to normal.  Physical therapy may be helpful for you.  (This is a bit of a simplified explanation of this syndrome.)  You may consider being evaluated by a sports medicine specialist.  They are the specialists that deal with muscle injuries, sprains, etc. and may be able to give you some help.  Best wishes.\n\n",

One problem you may face with having this repaired for cosmetic reasons is that insurances often are reluctant to pay for cosmetic procedures.  However, if you are having pain it may not be a purely cosmetic surgery.    In general, if surgeries can be avoided I would recommend it.  But, there are times when surgery is a very good treatment and can make a very big difference in a persons life.  I suggest you discuss this with your doctor.  You may wish to speak with an orthopedic surgeon about the actual surgical procedure.  (It may actually be a cardiothoracic surgeon that would perform this surgery but I think it is ortho.)  Cost for surgery in general is pretty high.  I do not know any specific numbers.  Hope this helps some.\n\n",

    "content": "Im a 20 yr old female, diagnosed with arthritis at the age of 14. I have some pain in my joints and weakness in my joints, but all in all, it doesnt bother me all that much except for on occasions. I was writing because about a year ago, all of a sudden, I started having pains in my collarbones. I thought maybe it was arthritis, but it got to a point where I couldnt lift a 10 pound box of Coke cans. The pain I am experiencing does not feel like my normal pain. This pain is sharp and almost feels as if I have broken my collarbones and they are grinding together. I can push on the bones and the muscles around them, and not really feel much pain, so I don't think they are broken, but the pain is so bad and I am so stiff sometimes that I cant even change/remove my shirt and have to have my boyfriend help me get dressed, because the pain is too much. It feels as though they are out of place and sometimes I wish for people to push down on them because they feel as though I am shrugging my shoulders. No doctor has given me an answer, mostly just that its arthritis, or tendinitis, but I have had those problems for 6 yrs now, and this pain is not the same. Can someone please help me if you have any idea what is wrong?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  This could be due to a muscle spasm. Muscle spasm alone can cause this pain which can be an unidentified cause but in many cases is the result of inappropriate posture for long time like traveling, driving and certain types of work. Arthritic changes in the shoulder region may result in muscle spasm as a protective mechanism to avoid joint movement.  In these cases, self care and avoiding the precipitating cause will lead to a gradual but clear improvement in the pain. Home treatment includes the use of analgesics, cold or hot therapy. Rest for maximum two days is also beneficial.  Plain X ray or MRI on the shoulder may be requested to exclude other causes which result from bone and joint changes.  Direct clinical examination is essential. Keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "There is a way to lengthen the toe although it is not an easy process. If you have a short metatarsal bone that is making your toe look shorter than its neighbors, the metatarsal bone can be lengthened with a technique called callus distraction. Basically  the metatarsal bone is cut in half surgically  and an external device is attached to each end of the cut metatarsal with pins. The surgical incision is closed and you would be left with an external fixator device on the outside of your foot (usually made of metal bars with a \"key\" for you to turn daily that will gradually pull the two ends of the cut bone apart from each other.The space that is being created between the two ends of the cut bone as you turn the key ( a little each day) will fill in with new bone.  Over a period of weeks (perhaps 10 weeks or so) your metatarsal bone will be lengthened to a more normal length and your small toe will be pushed out so that it looks much more normal. You will likely  be required to be non-weight bearing during healing so as not to disrupt the new bone formation. A podiatric surgeon or orthopedic surgeon could perform this operation.    Good luck!\n\n",

This is a mystery to me since I have never felt this type of pain, the only thing I think it could be is Gout since I have the eating habits that would make me potential to gout, also I have British blood all around. But gout is usually manifested in the big toe at first and in older people (I\u2019m 24). What else do you think this pain could be?

Other unlikely causes include: -Osteoarthritis affects mainly big toe and in older age. -Raynaud's phenomenon:is a vasospastic disorder causing discoloration of the fingers, toes, and occasionally other extremities  -Erythromelalgia is a rare disorder that affects the extremities and especially in the feet, in which blood vessels blocked and inflamed, causing a painful burning and throbbing sensation and red skin and tend to be worse in summer.

You said you have not switched shoes recently but do the shoes you have squeeze your toes at all? Occasionally nerve damage can result from ill-fitted shoes and can last for weeks or months after the offending shoes have been discarded.   Another possibility could be arthritis in the toe. Xrays would help to determine if there is arthritis , fracture, or other problems with the bones in your toe that could be causing pain.  Although gout is not out of the question, its unusual to find it only in a small toe.  Symptoms of gout are a red, hot , swollen toe that is extremely tender (some patients cannot stand even the bedsheet to touch the area).  Hope this helps. Good luck! PAF\n\n",

    "content": "ronirains- I would definitely recommend a follow up Xray and MRI. It is possible that you did not break a bone but you may have severly sprained or torn one or more ligaments in the ankle.  Once the ligaments (which hold the foot and leg together) become torn or severly stretched it becomes more likely that you will have a repeat of the same injury. An MRI would be a good way to image the soft tisses (ligaments and tendons)  around your ankle to see if they have been damaged.  Some such injuries can be treated with formal physical therapy and /or supportive devices placed in the shoes.  More serious injuried may be best managed with surgery to repair the torn structures. A podiatrist or orthopedic surgeon could help you diagnose and treat an ankle injury.  Left untreated, such an injury could be come a chronic issue.  Good luck,  PAF\n\n",

    "title": "achilles tendon",
    "content": "Hello alliecat- Once an achilles tendon has become very inflammed it can be difficult to get relief as it is stretched with every step you take. It is certainly possible to rupture an achilles tendon, particularly one that has become chronically inflammed over a long period of time.  In many instances the treatment of choice might be immobilization of the foot to reduce further trauma to the tendon and allow healing to occur.  Immobilization might mean a cast with crutches or a pneumatic walking boot depending on your doctor's preference and the severity of your symptoms. Once the tendon has had a chance to 'settle down' your doctor may then have your return to formal physical therapy (as you return to a normal shoe) to help gradually rehabilitate the foot and leg.  Depending on how quickly your tendon responds to immobilization you may need to be in a cast or pneumatic walking boot for a number of weeks followed by several weeks of therapy.    Oral antiinflammatory medications and daily icing are often part of the treatment for tendonitis as well.  Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello tthoney- You can definitely get sesamoiditis in both feet. This problem can occur as a result of activity or job which causes undue stress on the ball of the foot. Examples of this might be ballet or a job requiring many hours of squatting while on the balls of the feet.  It can also occur in patients who have very high arched feet since often these patients have excessive pressures on the balls of their feet (and heels) just during normal ambulation.   I would be sure you have the foot xrayed to be certain the sesamoid is not fractured. If there is no fracture but the area has become inflammed and irritated, a non-surgical approach to treatment might involve special pads (called Dancer's pads) worn short (or long) term to reduce pressure under the sesamoid bones.  Also icing the area can help reduce pain and inflammation.   A short course of oral antiiflammatory medication prescribed by your doctor in conjuction with the icing and pads may reduce or even eliminate your sesamoid pain withour surgery.  Good luck.\n\n",

Not thinking about it, I shut my door behind me w/ my left arm, and holy cow did that hurt.  Arm was extended appro.60 degrees.  Aches w/ arm straight at my side, it's better if I bend it at my side.  Medial elbow is mildly swollen and the pain is distal to the medial epicodyle, deep, &  closer to the ulnar olecranon process.    In the last three months I have; sprained my foot bowling (no trauma, just woke-up and couldn't even walk on it), grade 1 AC joint seperation doing my P.T. exercises, knee strain putting my pants on, bilateral elbow pain (Rt. worse than Lt.), and now this.  I have multiple tender points, not just at joints, but in the muscles as well.  I just seem to be getting all of these soft tissue injuries to the point that it is affecting my job and life.

    "content": "I am a 47 year old female. Post menopausal, partial hysterectomy.  About 3 months ago my L knee started hurting with mild stiffness.  It has progressed to where I cannot put my weight on the leg, can hardly bend it.  There is some swelling and warmth but no reddness.  When I do bend it, it grinds and clicks.  The swelling seems tobe all around the knee.  My father and sister have both had Knee surg.  Exact reason unsure.  I have not injured the knee that I know of. If I try to put my weight on the leg, it is extremely painful and the knee buckles.  Thankyou for your time.\n\n",

However, if the pain has been slowly worsening for 3 months, an infection is incredibly unlikely.    There are a few other possibilities so evaluation is important.  With a family history of knee problems there is a possibility of a rheumatologic process as well.  There are some treatments for osteoarthritis to hopefully avoid a knee replacement if possible.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Zena,  Any joint in our body is surrounded by a capsule...what seperates the capsule from the bone itself is a special fluid called (synovial fluid) it resesmbles and feels like the egg white,very slimy to help the bone glide easily and there would be no friction in movements.The bursae are small sacs of these fluids that help with this process as well.  Imagine that this fluid or the capsule surrounding the joint is inflammed for any reason,and has not been treated properly! The body's defensive mechanism will attack vigorously and causes alot of immune complexes (cells) to be deposited in these small spaces, that inturn will adhere and impair the movements.  To prevent that,proper management of bursitis or capsulitis should be obtained...and if for any reason it has been neglected /misdiagnosed/ mistreated, the patient should be put on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicaction and after resolution of the symptoms he is  encouraged to do physiotherapy which aims to tear the adhesions and regain the  shoulder's maximum movement range (ofcourse it will be painful during exercises) I hope that has helped, and we are here for you if you have further questions.

    "content": "Hello,  Two major problems that affect tendons: tendonitis and tenosynovitis.  Tendonitis, inflammation of a tendon and most commonly seen in the wrist and fingers.   Tenosynovitis is the inflammation of the lining sheath of the tendon.  Causes include strain, overuse (writing), injury, or excessive exercise.  Carpal Tunnel syndrome gives also a similar clinical picture and is due to repetitive,strong motion with the wrist bent for long periods.  Symptoms are mainly in the form of Parasthesia in thumb, index and middle fingers, and the thumb side of your ring finger and never the little finger. Weakness and loss of sensation may develop.  A neurological examination and certain test can help in the diagnosis. Treatments include  activity modification like intermittent rest, avoid  bending your wrist and to keep it relaxed, do not overuse or do a hard gripping.   Direct clinical examination is essential. Best regards.\n\n",

I have had no complications from this procedure however, in the past week, I have been experiencing this burning, spastic sensation in the back of my upper right thigh.   I thought it was because of the chair that I sit in at work but, it seems to get agrivated when sitting on the couch and sometimes while laying down. I did not injure this area.  If I rub the area, even lightly, the burning sensation gets agitated. It does not hurt to walk and there does not seem to be a lump.  This burning feeling resembles that of a bad sun burn INSIDE the back of my upper thigh and makes my muscle tighten slightly like a spasm.  Any thoughts on this would really help.

Then I began to notices that my small finger was numb and that the numbness just stayed all day and never went away.  Then the numbness moved to my ring finger as well.  Now I have numbness down the small finger side of my hand and top of my hand.  I also am experiencing muscle weakness that has become a problem with my everyday life.  I went to a hand specailist and he sent me to have a nerve conduction test and an EMG (that was yesterday)  The most horrible and barbaric tests I have ever had by the way!!!  The Dr that performed the test said that he is \"pretty certain\" that it is Ulnar nerve entrapment at the elbow.   My questions are: 1.  Because the muscles are \"wasting away\"  does that pretty much mean I should have the surgery?  2.  What happens after the surgery?  Everything that I have read says that the pain is horrible.   3.  I am a stay at home mom with a 1 1/2 year old, so I need to prepare for having some help around the house..Will I be in a cast or just a bandage? For how long?    4.

Sorry this is so long but I don't see my Dr for the test results until tuesday and I am trying to prepare myself  THanks so much\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Momof,  I would suggest you should have the surgery.  The ulnar nerve is being irritated, or put under pressure as it winds behind the inside of the elbow.  The symptoms are of two kinds...those related to the irritation, and those related to loss of function.  Irritant sysmptoms are pins and needles and pain.  Loss of function is numbness and weakness.  If the numbness stops being transient and the weakness leads to muscle wasting, then it implies that the neorons are bit by bit being knocked off.   Decompression involves releasing the nerve from structures trapping it and rerouting to the front of the elbow (so that the nerve isn't stretched when you flex the arm)  Surgery itself is not painful, but often the elbow feels sore for as much as 6 weeks afterwards, and the area remains sensitive.  Irritant sysmptoms disappear immediately usually, but function recovery depends on how much of the nerve and how badly it has been damaged and it may be incomplete.    Different surgeons use different techniques, many apply a removable splint or a  cast afterwards, but some do little more than a bandage.  This usually is for a couple of weeks...again this depends on the surgeon doing the operation.  Usually it is  done as a day case with most people going home the same day.  The wound has to be kept clean and dry until healed, as with any operation.  Restrictions are minimal, but you will probaly find that picking things up is quiet uncomfortable, as the nerve is often re-routed through a muscle in front of the elbow.  pain is what determines your level of function.  Treatments can also involve the use of night extension splints, occassionally local steroid injection...but in your case I would suggest surgery may be what is required, if you are having muscle wasting and sustained numbness.  Regards  saif\n\n",

Rrepeated impact or sustained pressure over the ulnar nerve will make this worse.  Breakdancing causing damage to the ulnar nerve is perhaps more likely to be at a different point to that of the previous poster.  This may cause entrapment or damage at Guyon's canal at the base of your hand, near your wrist.  Paradoxically although less of the nerve is damaged, the contracture (clawing) is greater. BenjaminLok wrote:2. Will it recover even though it has been this way for over a year now? If you are developing clawing, Ii do not recommend waiting any longer before consulting a specialist. The recovery is variable, and depends on many factors I have already alluded to in the previous post. BenjaminLok wrote:3. Do I need surgery?Thanks. Possibly...hard to say without examining you formally  Saif\n\n",

My ring and pinkie fingers tingled incessantly and the portion of my hand below the pinkie finger also became numb.  I saw a neurosurgeon who also conducted the nerve conduction and the EMG.  The neurosurgeon said I have nerve damage, then said that where my nerve is entrapped could not be operated on.  Also, the neurosurgeon wrote a prescription for Gabapentien whichrelieved the tingling sensation.  I took it for about two months and then discontinued it and the tingling has stopped, but the numbness persists.  The orthopedic surgeon said that the place was operable.  Later the meurosurgeon stated that if I was going to have the surgery I needed to do it soon.  The neurosurgeon also stated that with surgery the nerve heals itself at the pace of about a  millimeter a day (or something like that),which is slow.   I would like to know the results,  the lady that had the surgery in Feb 06, obtained and what she has experienced as well as any information regarding the surgery she could supply..  Also I would like to know if the scars (I understand there has to be two places that are opened) are very noticable.  I would very much appreciate any help.\n\n",

    "title": "Knee MRI",
    "content": "Hello,  Recently I did something to my knee and was examined by an orthopedic surgeon.  I can pain in one area, minor discomfort, and stiffness, and some swelling.  He said it was either a sprain or a meniscus tear and gave me a script for a MRI.  He told me to wait a week and to see if the pain was still there.  He said if it was to get the test, if not to not worry about it.  Its about a week later and the pain in there, but comes and goes and is not as intense.  It is really intermitten.  I found that sometimes these heal on their own if it is a tear and that a MRI may or may not be needed.  I am a 26 y/o male who is not an athlete, but active.  Should I just get the MRI or should I wait longer to see if the pain disappears completely?  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Was just diagnosed with an irritated ulnar nerve. My orthopedist gave me an elbow pad to wear, assuming that might be the source of the problem. But I understand it could also come from my neck (I have slight arthritis there) or elsewhere. Are there any tests to determine the problem's origin and would the treatment differ if the elbow is not the issue? Also, since March I've had a myriad of hand problems, including carpal tunnel, arthritis and tendonitis in both hands. Never had any trouble prior. The only change in my lifestyle is that I went off of hormones in October of last year. Any thoughts on what might be causing this\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,   The ulnar nerve is one of three main nerves that innervate  the hand. The nerve goes down the forearm, divide across the palm then pass into the little and ring fingers.   Ulnar tunnel syndrome is mainly due to pressure on the nerve. Excessive pressure on this nerve can result in a loss of feeling and/or muscle weakness in the hand.  Sometimes the cause of pressure is difficult to be diagnosed but some swellings, like cysts in the elbow region are found.  General measures include: Rest of the arm and avoid keeping the elbow bent for longe time. Keep the elbow straight at night when you are sleeping  - Use of cool to reduce swellings if any is present.  - medications like NSAID - Finally surgery is recommended to complicated persistent cases after conservative measures or to remove any possible cause of pressure like cysts.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Every few months I experience pain in my thigh and has happened for several years. It seems to be occuring on the front part of my thigh. I'm unsure if it happens on the same side all the time, but it feels like it does. It's more noticeable and seems to happen more when it is cold though I can't be certain since it only happens every few months.  When it does happen though, it does so for an extended period of time (a few hours at least). Some things that help would be to take Tylenol or to raise my leg while I lie down.  I'm wondering if there is anything I can do to prevent it from happening again or of it might be a symptom of a larger problem?  I apologize for not being more specific in describing this problem. Any help is greatly appreciated!\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 41 year old Female.  In October 2003 I had hysterectomy with a resulting MRSA.  May 2005, I had a Bartholins Gland cyst with MRSA, had 5 surgeries during 9 day period of time for this.  August 2005, had MRSA in right elbow, and lower left abdomen.  Had 2 surgeries for this.  In May was on Zyvox for 3 weeks by IV & then by oral form, August was again on Zyvox for 2 further weeks.  May 2006, I developed severe pain in my right upper thigh on the outside.  Feels like a very deep muscle ache.  Had MRI, Xray, and Ultrasound--all with no results shown. Pain suddenly stopped (no resulting numbness, etc), and is now on Left upper thigh, occasionally in hip.  Have had all same tests, again showing nothing.  I was on Tramadol since May 2005, recently switching to hydrocodone.  Pain is deep ache at times, but also very tender to touch, causing burning sensation.  Firm pressure is less aggravating to the leg.  I am diabetic, currently on Lantus, 20 mg per night.  Diabetes is not well controlled, but this does not feel like normal neuropathy.  I have had 2 c-sections, the 7 surgeries due to MRSA, an appendectomy at 10 years of age.  Current medications are Tramadol or Hydrocodone as needed, Trazadone for sleep as needed, and Lantus 20 mg.  It has been suggested that perhaps the length of time I was on Zyvox caused a problem, but MRI's, Xrays, and Ultrasounds seemed to rule that out.  Any insight would be so helpful as doctor seems to be stuck at a guess of tendonitis, and not entirely sure of that.\n\n",

    "content": "My son (6 y/o) has had left knee pain for over a week.  He woke up crying friday morning because it hurt so bad.  I got him an appointment & our primary doctor thinks it is Osgood-Schlatter Disease.  He has some asymetry (edema) and a tender spot below the kneecap.  She is giving him a week of limited activity.  We will then go to a specialist.  I have not gotten his x-ray results yet.  I am concerned because most everything that I have read about this states that it will stop once the \"adolescent\" stops growing (most sites say this occurs in boys that are 13-14 years old).  Can this happen in a 6 year old?   If so, what kind of treatments are we looking at?  I read that worst case scenario is surgery or a cast for 6-8 weeks... I just worry that he may have to deal with this for a decade.  Any info will be much appreciated & help me to relax before this week is over.  We have been applying ice packs and using ibuprofen... he says it helps a little.    No surgeries or past diagnoses.  No meds.  He is active but no more than any other 6 year old.  He is not involved in any organized sport - just normal play (which does include running & jumping)!  Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!\n\n",

    "content": "Spensaid003; As you know, this disease occurs in young boys who are typically in thier growth spurts.  Typically 10-14 years of age.  While its not common for a six year old, as you now know its not impossible.  As far as treating it, we use anti-inflammatory drugs, usually ibuprofen in someone age 6, along with ice and rest.    I would look into some physical therapy to get the legs stronger especially the quads and hamstrings, and then discontinue whatever is causing the pain until the knee(s) settle down.    As far as \"how long will it affect him?\"  If properly managed, it can be managed effectively so that it doesn't affect him.  If ignored, it can spell lifelong knee troubles.  It sounds like you are doing everything right.  Do not let him \"play through\" the pain, or try to talk you into doing activities that you do not feel he should.  In a few months he should be able to resume all activities and not notice any problems.  I'm not sure I told you anything new, but I hope its reassuring.  MStanley, MD, Orthopaedic surgery.

    "content": "Thank you so much for replying (& yes, that was my question about the c-sections - I appreciate all the responses!).  My son is still having pain - but now it is in his ankle (and sometimes hip... and of course, still the knee too occasionally).  He cries sometimes, other times just complains about it.  I give him ibuprofen & ice.  I am keeping a journal of what hurts, when & degree of pain (and if there are any other bits of info that seem relevant (like if he does not want to go to bed or eat dinner)).    So far it is unrelated to any activity that he does not want to do... it happens when he is having fun or just resting.    I have a gut feeling that it is something other than OSD or growing pains... but x-rays (of his knee only) were normal.  U/A & blood tests (routine) were done 6/06 (approx) and were normal.  He has always had some type of problem (RSV as a baby, ear infections, asthma now, other minor probs).  I consider him healthy... but sometimes I wonder.    Are you able to reassure me that it is just growing pains? Or give me ideas of what could be causing his pain? Or even maybe some questions to ask my doc?  I don't want to over react... but when he cries because of the pain, I just want to fix it!  He was put on Singular 5mg since my original post (the cough from asthma returned).  Any insight would be most appreciated!!!  Thanks for donating your time... we all really appreciate it!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Each disc is formed of a central gel-like inside (nucleus pulposus), surrounded by an outer ring (annulus fibrosus).   When this softer component ruptures (herniates) through the outer ring it can press directly on nerve roots and irritate adjacent nervous tissue.   Your MRI report (according to what you mentioned)  informs that you have disc herniation at the level of the Thoracic vertebrae Between T6-7. Since I did not personally review your MRI, I cannot be so accurate to confirm that it showed no clear nerve root compression although it is touching the sac that protects the nerve roots (thecal sac).  These conditions can be treated in the majority of cases with medical and conservative treatment (non surgical).   Non surgical treatment includes, physical therapy, certain exercises, weight reduction, epidural steroid injections, non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory medications, and decreased daily activities. The pain usually improves faster than the numbness and the weakness if present.   Surgery for disc herniation is only considered if symptoms are not controlled after at least one month (6 weeks) of medical and conservative treatment, or in very complicated cases with serious symptoms.   A spinal physician is the one able to determine if surgery is the best treatment for the patient.\n\n",

Past diagnoses of systemic diseases and surgeries are of great value in the diagnosis.  Common causes of wrist pain  include:  - Tendonitis (inflammation of the tendon sheath) : a common problem which result in wrist pain and swelling.   - Carpal tunnel syndrome : the nerves in the wrist are compressed by swellings. The pinched nerves cause pain and numbness in palm and  fingers (thumb). Pain and numbness increase with wrist movement.  -The condition could e due to repetitive use of the wrist like typing on a computer keyboard, using a computer mouse or due to other systemic and local diseases.  - Wrist sprains are common injuries to the ligaments around the wrist joint.  - Arthritis results in wrist pain, swelling, and stiffness, in RA it is usually bilateral.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi pt_i_am, If you have researched Avascular Necrosis then you are probably aware that it is also known as Osteonecrosis.  Avascular Necrosis is essentially a disease that causes death of the femoral head due to interruption of blood flow. Avascular Necrosis in the earliest stages are typically not detected on xray, and usually found during a MRI. Very small lesions may resolve but larger lesions, generally speaking, progress until there is collapse of the femoral head. There are four stages of Avascular Necrosis. Careful attention and monitoring should also be done of the unaffected hip as there of course is a risk that it may become affected as well. There are a variety of causative factors increasing the risk of this condition, one of which is long term corticosteroid use. Nonsurgical intervention may include partial weight bearing for a period of approximately six weeks and then re-evaluation but in many cases progression of the disease, noted with larger lesion, may ultimately result in total hip replacement (Total Hip Arthroplasty). Discuss with your physician regarding available treatment options as mentioned above including, for example, core decompression, etc. so that you will be making informed decisions regarding treatment. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "title": "Bulging disk",
    "content": "I have a bulging disk between L1 and L2 and have been doing some research online to see what kind of treatments there are for a bulging disk, as I have tried just about everything. I have had cortizone injections, been to physical therapy, had back adjustments, have been on muscle relaxants, pain killers, and steroids.  Well a couple things confuse me. First my MRI report said there is no (not sure what the word is)...something about my nerves and that the bulging disk is not affecting my nerves. However from time to time my right half of my butt and my my right leg go numb. It doesn't happen very often, but it does happen.  Every website online also says that a bulging disk is usually not painful and just a sign of old age, well I am 21 years old and have been like this since I was 19. I am far from old! I am also angered because after my MRI the doctor never called me back to tell me about the report and then on one occasion I went to the ER and the doctor there told me he read the report and there wasn't a damn thing wrong with me. So finally I went to a different doctor who told me I had a bulging disk, but thats all the info she gave me. I didn't even find out where it was until today, when my chiropractor showed me the report and explained it to me. So he is going to work with me and try and help me with all this terrible back pain. But is this the appropriate treatment? What else can I do?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I would like to emphasize that MRI results are very important in the diagnosis of vertebral changes, but the clinical picture, I mean your complaints and the physical examination are more important in determine the management.  Muscle spasm alone can cause this pain which can be an unidentified cause but in many cases it is secondary to spinal or bone problems.  In these cases, self care and avoiding the precipitating cause will lead to a gradual but clear improvement in the pain. Home treatment includes the use of analgesics, cold or hot therapy.  Non surgical treatment includes also, physical therapy, certain exercises, weight reduction, Stretching, non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory medications, and decreased daily activities. The pain usually improves faster than the numbness and the weakness if present.   Surgery for disc herniation is only considered if symptoms are not controlled after at least one month (6 weeks) of medical and conservative treatment, or in very complicated cases with serious symptoms.  A spinal physician is the one able to determine if surgery is the best treatment for the patient.\n\n",

    "content": "27 year old male, no history of problem with 'this' knee, no current medical condition.  I've had no apparent injury to my right knee, and havent had any problem with it until the last couple of days. Right at the bottom front of my knee, around where the patella stops, is extremely painful, especially to the touch. Walking on it causes me to limp slightly because of it hurting, even sitting down i can still feel a slight throbbing. It feels like its right where the lower bone in the leg meets the kneecap itself. Slightly swollen, no fever in it. I tried last night to get on all fours to do something to my tv set and the pain then was excruciating. I literally could not put my right knee down and put and pressure on it that way. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.  I used something similar 2 years ago to ask about my left knee, which in turn was a torn meniscus and required surgery.  If it hadnt been for the help of an online doctors diagnosis, i would've just dealt with the popping for who knows how long. Thanks again.\n\n",

Muscle spasm is a body reaction to injury in tissues  Causes of muscle injury include: Muscle fatigue, wrong posture Heavy exercise Flu Trauma Metabolic abnormalities like low Magnesium level and Hypocalcemia Hypoparathyroidism  The correct diagnosis is easier when other symptoms exist.  Self care and avoiding the precipitating cause will lead to a gradual but clear improvement in the pain. Home treatment includes the use of analgesics, cold or hot therapy. Proper posture is important.   If the condition is progressing or other symptoms like numbness of upper limb exists, more investigations should be done to exclude cervical problems.  Follow up with your doctor is essential. Hope you find this information useful.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Ladysmith52,  Scoliosis in many cases does not cause pain.  Severe scoliosis on the other hand results in many complications especially if it starts early in life.  These complications include:  Lung and heart damage: Curvature of 70 degrees of  or more make the lungs and heart are pressed by the rib cage and their movements become restricted. Recurrent Lung infections are common.   Back problems: chronic back pain and arthritis of the spine.    In general the treatment depends on the degree of curvature and the age.  At your age with mild scoliosis, severe complications are less likely to happen although regular checkup is important.   I advise you to follow conservative measures like electrical stimulation of muscles, chiropractic manipulation and exercise as it will improve your overall health.  Follow up with your doctor is essential. Only by complete history and physical examination, the correct diagnosis can be reached.   Hope you find this information useful. Best regards,\n\n",

As I felt myself begin to fall I turned to my right to grab the chair that I had just passed in hopes of preventing my fall. As I twisted to grab the chair I felt a burning sensation on the inside of my right knee.   Instead of helping, the chair fell with me, or should I say on the outside of my right leg.  A bruise formed on the inside of my knee (it is fading now) and ther is pain on the inside of my knee when it is bent.  I especially notice this being strong when getting out of my car.  My knee has a slightly shakey feeling.  I can walk only a slight limp.  This is just very aggrevating.  I have two young children and this is slowing me down.

Pain generated from a herniated disc that causes nerve compression is treated differently from that of a muscle strain. Thus complete history,clinical examination as well as investigations are critical in the management of pain.   In most of the cases with back pain, strain of the back muscles and ligaments, is the primary cause. This usually results from wrong or heavy lifting, or following a sudden improper movement. Muscle spasm alone can cause the back pain which can be an unidentified cause.  Pain due to Disc prolapse is usually associated with numbness and weakness.  These conditions can be treated in the majority of cases with medical and conservative treatment (non surgical). Non surgical treatment include, physical therapy, certain exercises, weight reduction, epidural steroid injections, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, and decreased daily activities.

    "content": "Dear pawprints,  Numbness in the lower limb with or without lower back pain that is centered in the lower spine and radiates down to both legs is most probably due to compressed nerves in the lumbosacral area.  If the same problem is felt in the upper part of the body (neck and upper limbs), the compressed nerves are those in the cervical region.  Nerve compression can be due to many reasons, including herniated disc, spondylosis, arthritis, spinal stenosis etc.  These conditions can be diagnosed by imaging studies like MRI (of choice).   Your condition needs follow up, please continue to update your doctor on your condition.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Dear wtjameson, These conditions can be treated in the majority of cases with medical and conservative treatment (non surgical). Non surgical treatment include, physical therapy, certain exercises, weight reduction, epidural steroid injections, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, and decreased daily activities. The pain usually improves faster than the numbness and the weakness if present. Surgery for cervical disc herniation is only considered if symptoms are not controlled after at least one month (6 weeks) of medical and conservative treatment, or in very complicated cases with serious symptoms. Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 24 year old male in reasonably good health, I quit smoking around 6 months ago (had smoked for about 5 years), and the only illness in my family history is heart disease.  No current meds, one surgery 8 years ago to correct a perforated eardrum.  For about three years now I've had a sometimes aching and sometimes stabbing pain which seems to emenate from under my middle left rib cage, between my spine and left shoulder blade, and down the back of my left arm to my elbow.  These pains came and went in the past, but now they seem to always be there although they vary in intensity.  The pain in my arm seems to worsen when I do the following:  Lie on my left side and breathe in deeply  Turn my head to the extreme left in any position  Cough (I actually have a bad cold right now)  I also have developed an aching sternum pain as of about a year and a half to two years ago.  This is aggravated by certain movements such as pushing or pulling against resistance across my chest (like working out on a butterfly machine), or lying a certain way.  Sometimes (especially when first waking up) I can \"crack\" my chest by reaching backwards as far as possible.  I can hear and feel the crack which seems to alleviate the pain temporarily as well as feel very satisfying almost as if I am relieving tension.    I saw a doctor for the first time about this last year and he did an EKG to rule out heart problems.  He basically told me to take aspirin when I had pain and that the pain was due to an inflammation of the connective tissue of the ribcage (Costochondritis?), but at this point I don't want to live on aspirin every day.    I've been through countless websites which attribute rib/shoulder pain to everything from metastisized cancer to heart attack, but I think its safe to say that at my age those diagnoses are probably remote.  What can I do to alleviate this pain?  Can I modify my sleeping position, see a chiropractor, etc...?  Thanks,  Matthew\n\n",

Costochondritis may involve factors such as trauma, recent illness, or may be indicative of other disorders such as psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, fibromyalgia, reactive arthritis, inflammatory bowel disorders, etc. etc. Treatment typically consists of minimization of stressing activities that seem to aggravate the condition, anti-inflammatory medications, and in some cases physical therapy. If there has been no diagnostic studies to identify the causative factor, I would suggest that you inquire with your physician regarding this matter. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

In mid  november i had it debreated and he looked around my wrist but did not see any problems. I wore a splint for 9 weeks and went to see a hand therapist. I was out of the splint for about 2 weeks before it hurt bad enough that i had to go back into it. Simple things like writing, typing, and gripping hurt. As the doctor recomended i have kept it imoblized and taken 4 Alive a day. That was about four weeks ago and it has not gotten much better. It does not hurt to bad in the TFCC. It is more of a sharp pain up and tward the thumb a bit. What could be wrong?\n\n",

I switched to sprinting High Intensity Interval Training and after I did that about 5 days later my knee just felt different.  It basically felt weak or more instable.  Nothing serious but I really like my body to be working perfect I am a nut when it comes to that.  My problem is I am feeling a clicking sensation.  It's very hard to hear so it's not like that.  I can feel it deep inside my knee.  I am so scared that I hurt my ACL but I don't think I did because there really is no pain and I didn't experience any pain during my sprinting or some of the leg workouts.  This slipping sensation feels like something like a tendon slipping onto a bone.  That kind of feeling.  I was thinking it could be a ligament (possibly ACL) that is inflamed but not torn.  I don't know if that's possible.  The time I feel the slipping is when my leg is fully extended.  If I didn't explain it well enough please let me know and I will try to explain it better.  Thanx to anybody that responds or even reads this whole thread.\n\n",

Occasionally, damage to the surface of the joint, torn meniscus, etc., may produce clicking noises but typically are associated with pain, swelling etc. You may want to tone down the high intensity or aggresive training to see if this alleviates the symptom and if not or other symptoms present be sure to have an evaluation by your physician.

    "content": "Thank you so much for reading this. I too had a problem with popping and clicking of my knees, along with a tremendous recuring pain in the right knee. I went to my PCP who said I was going to wind up having surgery and sent me to an orthopedist. The ortho doc sent me for an MRI and said it is a torn lateral meniscus.  I am scheduled for surgery in mid-June and have a few questions. 1. Would it do me any good to try some other type of therapy before surgery? 2. Last year I had a long-running bout of tachycardia. My pulse is not running as high lately, but it is still frequently over 100 bpm resting (normal BP). They want to use general anesthesia for the knee surgery, should I avoid that and opt for an epidural if possible? I really don't want an epidural, had a bad experience with it when my son was born. 3. I have always exercised, doing yoga, pilates and aerobics. About how long  after a meniscus tear removal can a person start normal exercising again?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi leamea, A MRI is an excellent diagnostic tool for identifying a torn meniscus. Chronic knee problems may be treated with physical therapy and anti-inflammatory medications but the risk of course may be enlargement of the tear if left surgically untreated. When symptoms arise surgical treatment (Arthroscopic) is the preferrable method. Small incisions are made to allow visualization of the joint by inserting a very small camera. This allows the surgeon to identify the tear and treat accordingly. If you had a negative experience with the epidural and general anesthesia was the recommended choice, then listen to their advice. Generally speaking, prior to the surgery, an EKG, chest xray, standard labwork, are all preoperative tests. After the surgery, pain medications are administered. Instructions regarding signs or symptoms of infection/complications are given, ie, increased pain, redness, swelling, fever >101, any unusual symptoms to alert the physician too. Crutches are typically given for at least the first couple of days and then weight bearing (along with the assistance of the crutches) is added a small amount at a time. Depending on the severity of the tear, would indicate the length of time needed for recovery. In smaller tears, normal activities are permitted after a few days. Of course these are certainly questions you want to ask prior to the procedure so that you will have a general idea and you will go into this informed. Also, make sure you have a friend or family memeber accompany you (this will be necessary anyway with general anesthesia in particular) because you will not be able to drive, or make any improtant decisions for the next 24 hrs). The person accompanying you will also be able to listen to the post operative instructions and help you remember appointments etc. because most likely you will be somewhat \"groggy\" after the procedure. I hope this has been somewhat helpful. Good luck and best wishes! Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

They asked me if  I had any any questions at my last appointment, but my mind was fixed on the word \"surgery\" and I couldn't think of any. The fact is they asked me when I did it and I couldn't be sure because I frequently have little aches and pains and my knees have snapped for years. It's only when the pain got so bad , while I was driving actually (I wanted to scream) that I went to the doctor. I hope the possible old age of the original injury doesn't negatively affect the  surgical outcome. It's a substantial tear they said.  Once again, thank you for being here to help people, it is much appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "I am 20 years old/female/good health but not very active. Problem: about a month ago, and 2 days after getting an ultrasound of my leg, I got a huge painful leg cramp that was worse behind my knee and extended down into the calf, and was very painful to walk on. It lasted about a 1/2 an hour. Since then, I have noticed it a few times very mildly. But for 3 days now the cramping behind the knee has been fairly continous during the day, but is a mild form of cramping. Possibly related to this is that I have had continous leg pain(without cramping) for 4 months now. One doctor suggested a baker's cyst caused the cramping. I do not have a lump behind my knee, though, only sometimes a very slight puffiness/hot feeling and a very blue little vein.  I have been very concerned about dvt before, so often i hold that leg very straight and I notice my joints in that leg get very stiff from me holding it like that sometimes. The calf is also somewhat tender/ sore in the back and sides with lots of pinching pain there. could it be a baker's cyst but not have a lump on the back of my knee? and could a small cyst cause calf pain almost daily? Thank you!\n\n",

I even had some new painkillers prescribed and those don't even do anything..I had knee pain all through the healing months, but never as bad as it is now. Is this normal? Also, my doctor says I had a delayed nonunion, that was back in January...and he also told me that my knee pain could be from my top screw that had apparently moved a bit, like it got loosend up. He said this was fine and just to leave it...I had an xray done last week and the on duty doctor there said it was still nonunion. I've even been using this ultrasound machine since january...but I guess its not helping and it seems the screw has moved a little more. Does anyone know how long you need to wait until the doctors asses whether or not a bone graft may be needed or what can be done to help the knee pain? So far its been around 18 weeks and the bone still hasnt healed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Erigirl,  It may be one of your parasternal lymph nodes that is a little out of place. They are lymph nodes that are normally located next to the sternum in the intercostals space, between the ribs. Did you notice it because it was sore or because it was a bump? Lymph nodes are sometimes hard to see on X-rays but when they are swollen, they\u2019re doing their job. Try not to bother it for a week or so and see if the soreness goes away. If you don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s getting any better you can request bloodwork be done to see if you have inflammation or infection \u2013 C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, fibrogen levels, CBC, etc. If you still feel like you have something wrong you can request your Physician do a biopsy of the bump. Before any poking starts happening, try not to touch it and see if it will go down on its own.\n\n",

My doctor can't see me until Thursday and I worried because everything I see in internet searches in cancear. I know I need to be seen but what are other possibilities of that this could be?  I am a 33 year old female and nothing of this sort runs in my family.  I did have lower extremity bypass surgery 2 months ago and am not taking lipitor 10 mg, niaspan 500 mg, and comadin 5 mg  The first I noticed of this was 2 days ago.  I did have a lung xray prior to my bypass surgery and a lot of blood work. I also had a recent stress test. I am wondering if this was present at the time.\n\n",

    "title": "Sudden Generalized Joint Pain in 28yr old",
    "content": "I'm not certain if this should be in the orthopedic topics or not...but that's where it started...so I'll start here.   About three weeks ago, I began having sorness and tingling in my left foot and calf.  My big toe and across the top of my foot was very sore, and the outside edge and the two smallest toes on the same foot went from tingling (like when your foot falls asleep), to being numb. This went on for about a week. I thought I must have done something, and figured with some advil and a few days it would get better.  But, instead of getting better..it started up in the right leg and foot as well.  Then it got to be both feet, legs, and my lower back.  Although I couldn't think of anything I had done...I still figured I must have hurt my back somehow, and it was probably just a pinched nerve or something, and that with taking it easy and some time it would get better.  Then on Saturday I woke up and every joint in my body was sore and stiff.  I felt like I had the flu x 10...but I haven't had any other flu like symptoms (no fever, head or chest congestion, etc.).  The joint pain and stiffness seems worse in the morning, and gradually over the day will get a little better.  I've had arthritis in my wrists from an old injury for years, but they usually only bother my in really cold weather, or when I've done something repetitive and over-used them. Then they will swell and be stiff and sore.  All my joints feel like that right now, but there doens't seem to be any swelling, redness, and no previous injuries. So, I don't know what's going on.  If I wake up tomorrow and it's as bad as it was this morning, I'm going to call and see if I can make an appointment with my doctor.  I'm just wondering if anyone has any idea what this might be?  I've had family/friends suggest lyme disease (haven't been near any woods or animals...haven't seen any ticks), flu (no other flu symptoms, and it's been going on for 3 weeks), rhematoid arthritis (don't know much about this...so couldn't say), and multiple sclerosis (only because my aunt was diagnosed 2 years ago, and hers began with numbess in her feet and legs).   I thought maybe it was just a virus or infection...but it's been going on for 3 weeks now...and besides the joint pain and not sleeping well...I haven't had any other symptoms.   Thanks for your time and help! J\n\n",

All types of autoimmune disease must be considered and also low back problems also must be taken in consedration but i think that systemic disease is more important.  Till you have these blood test you may take some non steroidal anitinflamatory drugs like diclofenac ( cataflam or voltaren). or any other similar drugs.  waiting for new data  thank you.

He named off several things it could be...but said he didn't think it really was any of them (post-viral arthritis, gout, allergic reaction, back problems).  He had me go to the lab to have some blood work done.  He ordered a CBC with diff, ANA, CMP, Sed Rate, Rheumatoid Factor, and one other thing that I can't make out in his chicken stratch writing.   He made a follow up appointment for one month from now (July 1st).  He said if any of the tests come back showing anything before that he would call and have me come in earlier.  In the meantime, he told me to take an OTC anti-inflammatory (Advil, Aleave, etc) twice a day.  He said hopefullly it is something simple, and will begin to get better while we're waiting on the test results.  If not, hopefully some of the tests will help us figure out what we're dealing with.  So...for now, I wait......\n\n",

    "content": "Dr. Fawzy,   Thank you for your reply and taking the time to help answer questions and calm nerves for everyone on these message boards.  I came home from work today and the doctor's office had left a message on my answering machine.  They said my bloodwork (see post above for what they ran) came back and did not show any clear answers as to what could be causing the joint pain.  They said to call them back on Monday if I was still having pain and they would refer me to a Rheumalogist.    I'm definately still having joint pain. However, today it's not only been my joints, it's been my muscles too.  Mainly the muscles in my legs. They have been very sore and tired/weak feeling today. It feels like I've ran a very long hard race, and my muscles are tired and tight and my legs are heavy.  Just standing up from sitting in a chair takes more effort, and when walking my legs feel heavy and sore and it's slow going.   I'm going to call the doctor on Monday. But, I'm beginning to get really worried now.  If the blood tests didn't show anything that would indicate Rheumatoid Arthitis or Lupus or any of the other things he thought it may be...then what else is there....something better...something worse....?  What would affect the joints and the muscles...but not have any other obvious symptoms...?    Thanks for your time and help.\n\n",

    "content": "I feel your pain Txjessy!  I too am experiencing unexplained migrating joint pain.  I just turned 29 in May and about a month ago I woke up with some minor pain in my ankles but couldn't for the life of me figure out what I did to make them hurt.  About a week later, my left ankle started to swell on the lower part and on the inside only.  Then the area that was swelling started turning pink and felt sort of warm.  About a week into that, the right ankle started swelling too.  My primary care doc did the usual blood work, all of which was normal.  He sent me to an ortho specialist who ordered more labs.    In the meantime, I am hurting!!!!  The very next day after I went to the ortho specialist for my initial consultation, I woke up with every joint in my body hurting like crazy!  And it's been that way ever since.  It's only been a few weeks but it feels like an eternity.  I've been taking Naproxen but it's not really helping.  I feel like I am stuck in an 80 year old's body!  I assume, based on my labs, that I probably don't have lupus or RA, but that I probably have some sort of infection or immflamation in my body.  It's wondering what kind of infection that is bothering me this weekend - other than the pain!!!  My mom was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis a few years ago and another family member (not first line though) has Myasthenia Gravis.  I know some researchers think these autoimmune diseases are hereditary, but some don't.  Who knows!  I don't have any anwers for you, but I thought I'd share my story and let you know that you are not alone.  I know when I found this website it was because I was searching online for answers and I felt like I was the only young adult who had this problem.    Let me know further progress and I'll keep you posted on my diagnosis too if you'd like.  I expect to hear from my doc tomorrow afternoon after he reviews my labs (He was out of the office on Friday when they came in).    sweetsugrbriches\n\n",

    "title": "Lab Results",
    "content": "We got the lab results back.  They did a \"CBC with Differential / Platelet\", \"Comp. Metabolic Panel\", \"Rheumatiod Arthritis Factor\", \"Antinuclear Antibodies Direct\", and \"Sedimentation Rate\".  The doctor says that although there are some items elevated,  there isn't anything  that conclusively tells him what is causing the joint and muscle pain.  So, he wants to refer me to a Rheumatologist.  I called and can't get an appointment until July 25th.   So, for now I wait...and keep wondering.  There were 4 things in my lab results that showed to be elevated.    White Blood Cell Count 11.3 H x10E3/uL Limits 4.0-10.5  RDW 16.0 H % Limits 11.7-15.0  Neutrophils (Absolute) 8.2 H x10E3/uL Limits 1.8-7.8  ALT (SGPT) 46 H IU/L Limits 0-40  None of these seem to be very high over the limits.  But, in February, before all this started, I had a complete physical, and all these were within the normal range. So, it is quite a change in 4 months. Not sure if it means anything, or helps to figure out what's going on.  The RA Factor, ANA, and sed-rate, all seem ok (see below).  Rhematiod Arthritis Factor - RA Latex Turbid. 6.6 IU/mL Limits 0.0-13.9  Antinuclear Antibodies Direct 33 U/mL Limits: Negative <100   Sedimentation Rate - Westergren 15 mm/hr Limits 0-20  Antistreptolysin O Antibodies 31.6 IU/mL Limits 0.0-200.0  Does any of this help to give a clue as to what's going on?    I also asked my doctor about \"Cat Scratch\" disease/fever.  Several months ago my nephew (he's 7) began complaining of his leg hurting. At first his parents just thought he pulled something playing rough or jumping on the trampoline. But when he kept on talking about it, they got him down and realized the lymph nodes in his leg/groin area were very swollen and hard. They took him to the doctor, who did lots of tests, and an MRI. They could see that something had many of the lymph nodes in his leg swollen, and his WBC was elevated on his lab results, but they couldn't figure out what was causing it. They tried two rounds of anti-biotics, with no improvement. They finally sent him to a Children's Hospital to see an oncologist.  The oncologist first wanted to take some blood and do a culture for \"Cat Scratch\" fever.  It took 9 days to get it back, but it was positive.  They gave him a different kind of anti-biotic and he recovered quickly and has been great since then.  As I said, I asked my doctor about this, because I had also been around my nephew's new kitten, but the doctor doesn't seem to think this could be a possibility.  Granted, I don't remember getting scratched...but neither did my nephew, and they could never find a scratch on him.  I even called back to the doctors office Friday morning, and asked that since we have to wait a month for me to get in to see the Rheumotologist, could we go ahead and test for the \"cat scratch\" just to be sure.  The nurse said she would ask the doctor, and someone would call me back.  It's Tuesday night, and so far no one has called back.    I'm not sure what to do at this point......\n\n",

    "title": "got a few answers from my doc",
    "content": "Hi Tx!  Good to hear you are hanging in there.  How's your pain?  Are you taking an OTC anti-inflammatory or did your doc prescribe one for you?  I was taking Naproxen (Aleve), about 600 mg a day, but it didn't help me any.    When my ortho doc finally came into the office to review my labwork (this was last Monday afternoon), he had his nurse call me and schedule an appointment for the following Thursday and his office called in a prescription of steroids for me to start the next morning.  I think it was Methylprednisolone or something like that.  It was one of those six day packs that you take six the first day, five the next, four then next, etc.  They were a God-send!!  Within two days, almost all my pain was gone from everywhere.  My ankles were still a little stiff but for the most part, my body was pain free!  The swelling in my ankles was starting to go away and I couldn't have been happier!  Well, except for the fact that I've been on prescription diet pills for the past six months and I've lost 35 pounds so far - WOO HOO for me! - - and while on the steroids I had to stop the diet pills and I was soooooooo hungry!  Thankfullly I only gained two pounds while on the steroids last week and this past Monday I started my diet pills again and hopefully I can drop at least five pounds this week.  But anyways...  I went in to see my ortho doc last Thursday, after having been on the steroids since the Tuesday prior, and told him that my pain was gone and the swelling was going away.  I'm not sure if I mentioned in my previous posts that I also had some discoloration to my skin where the swelling was but it started out pink then turned more purple and even a little grayish.  Even though the swelling was going away, there was still some discoloration.  Just a little though.  My ortho doc was happy that the steroids were working and he wrote me a prescription for Mobic.  Mobic is supposed to be the newest anti-inflammatory on the market, and he gave me 7.5 mg a day.  He told me that since my Sed rate and CRP was elevated, he believed that my problem was something systemic.  I think the discoloration on my swollen ankles was an indicator too.  He told me to take the Mobic daily and to let him know if it controls my symptoms.  If it does, we'll continue with that and if not, or if I have \"breakthrough symptoms\", he said he could refer me to a Rheumatologist for further workup.    He couldn't give me a specific diagnosis but right now we're going with Unspecified Polyarthritis.  He hasn't ruled out an autoimmune disease but my ANA screening was negative and my RF was normal so it's probably not lupus or RA, but since my doc is an ortho doc and not a Rheumatologist he really couldn't diagnose an autoimmune disease.  So, Monday I woke up feelin' great and took my Mobic and my diet pill.  This morning, same thing.  But by about 6 pm, my ankles started feeling a little achy.  I carefully examined my ankles and low and behold...swelling!!!!  It's not bad like it was before, but it is starting again.  I don't have any joint pain and my ankles don't hurt really bad, but I am getting worried now that the swelling is starting again.    I took another Mobic this evening around 7 pm and we'll see if it helps with the swelling at all this evening.  I am going to call my ortho doc in the morning and ask if he wants me to continue with two Mobic a day or just go to a Rheumatologist.  I don't even know of any Rheumatologists in my town!!!  I'm sure I'll have the same problem as you and have to wait for a month or so just to be seen and then have to drive for 1/2 an hour just to get to the doctor's office!  I assume none of your labs came back elevated/low since your doc said he couldn't give you any clear answers, right?  I wonder what your CRP level was because mine was 15.4 and it's not supposed to be over 3 or 5 or something like that.  I just assumed that 15.4 was extremely high based on the normal range but I don't really know what extremely high would be.  Have you had any other symptoms other than joint/muscle pain?  Like dry eye or mouth ulcers?  What about fatigue?  And I know this is probably too personal and none of my business but have you noticed any decrease in your sex drive?  I'm not sure what to make of my symptoms.  Are they all unrelated?  Could they all be related to some systemic disorder and I just never connected them before?  It's all so confusing and I am getting so frustrated with not knowing what is wrong with me or how to prevent any of my symptoms.  Good luck and I hope you find some anwers...and some pain relief!!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there again Tx!  I guess I responded too soon because after I submitted my reply, I noticed that you posted again.  I too thought about Cat Scratch Fever because I have  cats.  My mom and I rescue cats and between the two of us we have 13 cats so I get scratched all the time.  I used to be a vet tech so I have a little bit of knowledge about Cat Scratch Fever, but not much.  I even thought about Toxoplasmosis but I don't think I have that either.  Here are my labs:  Blood chemistry was all within normal limits (electrolytes, blood sugar & kidney function was all normal). My liver function was normal too - - ALT was 12 (range is <45) and AST was 20 (range is <45).  TSH was normal (1.835 with a range of 0.35 - 5.50).  Red Blood Cell count was normal.  RDW was 13.9 with a range of 11.5 - 14.5.  White Blood Cell count was also normal at 5.2 with a range of 4.0 - 11.0.  However, my Neutrophils were lowered at 40% with a range of 42% - 77%.  But my Lymphocytes were elevated at 46% with a range of 16% - 43%.    My RF was within limits at 25 (range is <43).  ANA Screen just said Negative.  No range given.  Sed rate was elevated at 29 with range of 0-20.  My CRP was elevated at 15.4 with a range of <=5.0.  What was your Antistreptolysin O Antibodies test for?  Sounds like they were testing for strep, is that right?  I also considered that maybe I had a staph infection but I don't know where I would have gotten it from as I don't have any open wounds but I guess I could have gotten it from bad food or just airborne.  My ortho doc definitely thinks my problem is something systemic but he doesn't know what.  This is so frustrating!!!\n\n",

    "content": "I'm so glad that I found this page. I'm experiencing many of the same symptoms as stated above. My systoms started in January. My pain started with a pulled groin muscle. Then, it happened a few weeks later on the other side. Then the pain jumped to my arm muscle. Then, a few weeks later, I experienced pain in my shoulder. During the past few months, the pain seemed to jump all over my body but it wasn't too frequent (about once every 3 or 4 weeks). Lately, the pain is occuring every week! I can't stand it!  The past few weeks, the pain has been primarily in my legs and on top of my foot. I have also noticed some discoloration! I finally went for a physical and visited a great nurse practictioner. She sent me for some blood work.  My ESR rate was very elevated (42H). My Cardio CRP was also elevated (29.9). My Uric Acid rate was high (4.9). My Glocose reate was in the normal range (97). My Rheumatoid Factor was in the normal range also (13).  My blood work did not help my nurse practicioner to diagonise anything. I've been on two rounds of antibotics (just in case I have a staff infection), i'm also taking Flexeril (muscle relaxor - helps me to sleep when I'm in serious pain) and Tramadol (Prescribed Acetaminophen) which does help somewhat. I've recently just started taking Mobic too - which if I take it right on the onset of the pain, it does seem to help.  Anyway, I have an appointment with a rheumatoidolist on Aug. 16 (took over a month to get this appointment)! I hope I can get some answers.  Again, I'm so glad that I found these postings. I explain my pain to friends and family, but I'm only 35 years old and I think they think I'm going nuts (and at times, I do feel this way). I will pray for all of you - I hope you all feel better. Please feel free to contact me or to keep in touch with me regarding your diagnosis.  Best of Luck to You All, Stephanie\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Stephy123 -   I understand what you mean about trying to explain your pain to friends and family.  I feel like maybe I am becoming a hypochondriac with all the symptoms I try to explain to others.  I truly feel like I may go insane somedays.  My pain has subsided for the most part.  I last saw my doctor at the end of June and he told me to discontinue the Mobic and just take Naproxen (400 mg twice daily).  All anti-inflammatories can cause some water retention but everyone reacts differently to each different drug.  He thought maybe the Mobic was causing me to retain more water than Naproxen and since we got everything under control with the steroid pack, he thought maybe Naproxen would keep everything in check.  It took several weeks, but finally the swelling and discoloration started to go away.  I haven't had any other joint pains and the swelling in my ankles hasn't come back yet but they hurt everyday.  They aren't just horribly painful but they ache everyday.  Being on my feet a lot and when my feet get cold seems to make it worse.  The pain isn't bad but it's really annoying.   So I take 400 mg of Naproxen twice daily and just pray that it keeps the strong pains away.  It's all my other minor symptoms that keep me frustrated.  I did a lot of research on autoimmune disease and I know that a lot of them share symptoms.  I just hate not knowing what is wrong with me.  Right now, my biggest problem is dry eye.  I never really noticed it before but when I tried to wear contacts for the first time in March, it became really bothersome.  I tried so many different brands of contacts and finally gave up at the end of June.  I scheduled an appointment with an opthamologist and he tested me for dry eye.  The tests came back that I had mild dry eye, more so in my left than in my right eye.  He prescribed Restasis but told me that it would take at least 6 to 8 weeks before I noticed anything.  I've only been taking it for about a month so my eyes still bother me, even though I'm not wearing my contacts again yet.  Hopefully I'll be able to try contacts again in a few more months.    I've also been getting a lot of mouth ulcers lately.  Just one after another for the past few months.  They are REALLY annoying!  And I have ZERO sex drive!  My poor husband is really frustrated with that!  I am only 29 years old - I'm not supposed to feel like this!  I just feel like it's one thing after another and I'm too young for all this!  I wish you luck and hope it all works out for you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi sweetsugrbriches,  Thanks for the quick reply. I'm glad to hear that Naproxen is helping you. I may ask the specialist if it may help me too. I'm hoping that the specialist won't put me on the steriods because I hear too many bad things about that kind of treatment (I have a friend who has been on steroids for years and can't get off the drug, which has destroyed her adreanal gland and more).  Today, woke up with a pulled muscle in my arm. I'm so sick of this. My aunt is worried that my symptoms sounds like Muscluar Dystropy (MS). Frankly, I'm a bit worried too although I have no family history of this disease. But, for the most part, my pain has been in muscles versus joints. I have some joint pain now and then, but not compared to the pulled muscles all over my body.  I'm beginning to feel crippled. It's hurting just to type this so I'm going to cut this short...  Oh yeah, about the cold thing. Heat does really help me. I have a gym membership that I'm totally not using, however, I have gone just to sit in the whirlpool. It really helps! Perhaps you may try that when you're in a lot of pain.  As for the dry eye, I just resently had my eye doctor try 5 different contacts on me! I finally settled with Bausch & Lomb SofLens. I also use Bausch & Lomb Renu with Moisture Loc. Perhaps you might try different lens? The thin, scratchy ones really aggreviate dry eyes. I hope this helps...  Have you seen a specialist or just a family doctor? I hope that you continue to feel better. How long does the doctor want you to continue to take the prescriptions for your pain?  Again, thanks for letting me know that I'm not going insane. Your letter made me feel better!  Take Care, Stephanie\n\n",

All of a sudden my knees starting aching, which quicky moved into my ankles, then moved to my lower back, elbows, wrists, knuckles, feet, and neck. The first time it happened (two weeks ago) it only stayed around for two days. Thought it was some fluke.   Then, last week, it happened again. Came on in the knees last Tuesday night and I couldn't fall asleep. Had it this time until Friday afternoon. So, I went to see the doctors.   I'm still waiting on my rheumatoid factor and lymes test, but SED and CBC came back normal.   Have you (others) found anything to help treat the pain? Ibuprofen or excedrin do not help me at all. Laying down, sitting up, standing, all hurts if i do it for more than 30 seconds at a time. grrrr.    TIA.\n\n",

I could hardly walk for 2 weeks, or even put my shoes on, with the pain worse in the morning. I thought I had somehow hurt my back, orth. doc. put me on steroids.  Another similar story, Methylprednisolone, 6 day pack, which helped the back pain, but just when I thought it was over, started having additional symptoms. Dry/bloodshot eyes, cold sores on my lips and weird migrating joint pain, all over my body, very sharp, cutting, waking me up at night.

    "content": "I have had pain in my chest or upper left abdomen for about a year & a half. I have been to my doctor several times. The first time she did a chest x-ray because she thought I might have pneumonia, when the x-ray came back they found a spot on my lung. The very next day I had a CT scan, that doctor could not see anything unusual. So i figured great, nothing wrong with me.  The pain never goes away. I am tired all the time never hungry, (I eat hoping it will make me feel better, but it never does.) My doctor does not do anymore tests. She decided that I have anxiety. I have been on Zoloft 100mg for the last six months, yet my condition has only worsened. I don't bother going back because I feel she doesn't listen.  Now the spot where the pain has been is enlarged, kind of like my rib grew. The exact location is left of my diaphram and directly below my breat. My husband even said I should get it checked because it is hard  and protruding. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Joy\n\n",

No wonder people put off going to the doctor and are so cynical towards the medical professions.  I believe the problem should not go UN-CURED!  Your reply sounds like this person should go to the doctor so in case they DIE from their affliction, then the doctor at least had a note of the problem (which would be a good malpractice suit it seems).   We are more often as not fed cookie-cutter solutions to our (often times life-threatening or altering) medical problems...  the doctor listens to us for about 60 seconds, checks pulse, breathing, blood pressure, etc., and then puts the patient into whichever category allows them to prescribe the newest drug they learned of on  their last pharmacutically-paid trip to hawaii.  Then if this doesn't fix the problem, oh well, no biggie, cuz the patient gets to come back for multiple visits and tests and the doctor can bill the insurance out the ass and buy another porche.  I'm sick of it.    And yes, there are a FEW good doctors out there who actually shun pharmacutical manipulation and care about their patients... but the vast majority are giving the entire profession a bad name.  And if you don't have insurance, plan on not getting better, since you can't afford all the tests and doctor visits they don't bother with you.  Gotta love the HIPPOCR-I-TIC oath.\n\n",

I believe the injury resulted from being bit by a brand new electric fence charger (supposed to power up to 30 miles of fence), which really hit me hard. I swear I felt my heart stop!  I have gone to two local hospitals who claim all is well on x-rays and have labeled me as a chronic rib pain case, and have also been seen by a chiropractor who said he couldn't help me but recommended either cortisone or having the rib removed.  Can you help with advice?\n\n",

Honestly, I am leery of a regional block, mostly because they are repetitive. He also said that he would be cautious on cortisone in lieu of puncturing a rib or lung. That made me wonder as to his ability...  I would not have the rib removed unless no other option were available.  I will be going to the V.A. soon, since the local hospitals have written me off.  I have a large dislike of 'brain' medications, such as anti-depressants. I feel that they are over-used and for the most part unnecessary in anyone's daily life. That is beside the point, though. I have seen the effects they have on acquaintances, though.  I would not consider taking them unless you could change my mind. Enlighten me.  Steve\n\n",

    "content": "Hi!  When I mentioned the antidepressant/antiepileptic usage for neuropathic pain, do not be misled by the terms used to describe these medicines. Eventhough the terms imply its usual indication in depression or epilepsy, there can be more than one use for a single drug. And the dosage used for its antidepressant action or antiepileptic action is different from that when used for its analgesic action.   Another fear among the medical profession as well as the society is the addiction potential of analgesic drugs like opioids. It would be enlightening to note that there is no ceiling effect for the use of morphine, as long as pain ramains. Multiple studies have indicated that because of this common 'fear,' such medicines are underprescribed, leaving patients to suffer pain at the expense of an unrealistic addiction potential.   As for your doctor's reluctance to anesthesia, I would presume it to be medicolegally founded. Risk exists even in prescribing tylenol, let alone surgical procedures.  I hope the experts in V.A. figure out some way to release you from the pain you suffer.  Warm regards,  bill\n\n",

Pain will last for days after onset and has reduced me to bed for long periods of time. The pain is typically at the costal margin of the lower 4 ribs.  Symtons appear whenever I use my abdominal muscles (sitting for over an hour,  lifting anything bent over, driving, etc.)    I have tried the Proto therapy with no luck. Went on to Cryro nerve desensitivation - extremely painfull (10) with no long term effect.  Tried radio nerve desensitivation - using heat to desensitive the area.  Lasted about 4-5 mmonths.  Am taking 10/325mg Hydrocodene 4-5 X a day and 10mg  baclofen 1-3X a day (new).  The baclofen leaves a copper taste and does'nt do allot except make me a little sick to my stomach.

I haven't been able to work in a hospital since developing this condition. The pain is constant, in my right rib cage and medication only helps tolerate the pain, it does not go away. I am  taking Hydrocodone 10/500 4-6 hours, Neurontin 600mg TID. The Neurontin (anti-epileptic) seems to help alot in combination with the Hydrocodone. When I want to do something (Physical) I get a tapering dose prescription for oral steroids, whch helps reduce inflammation and gives me the ability to get around better, only used these three times.  I have been to three neurologists, 11 spinal blocks (no help), 3 MRI's, Nuclear Medicine, oxycontin, morphine, the patch, anti-depressants, nothing helps. Like most, I just want the pain gone so I can get my life Back. And yes...my right rib cage looks bigger than my left??? I am now going to Mayo clinic, waiting for results of last MRI, ran me through the tunnel three times. What is this stuff?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Pianist  Initial treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome generally involves resting the affected hand and wrist for at least 2 weeks, avoiding activities that may worsen symptoms, and immobilizing the wrist in a splint to avoid further damage from twisting or bending.     Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and other nonprescription pain relievers, may ease pain.     Also , cool (ice) packs and prednisone (taken by mouth) or lidocaine (injected directly into the wrist) can relieve swelling and pressure on the median nerve and provide immediate, temporary relief.      If symptoms last for 6 months or more, doctors may recommend surgery to sever the band of tissue around the wrist and reduce the pressure.  The good news is that recurrence of carpal tunnel syndrome after surgery is rare.  At the meantime, you may want to use Advil to ease the pain, or have something prescribed by your doctor for the same purpose.  Thank you very much , and all the best in your concerts..\n\n",

    "content": "Hello All:  Have for some time now had some ulnar nerve issues....had hoped PT might get rid of it, but no such luck.  Today, have my EMG, and the news is somewhat alarming. I'd researched the problem, and working on the assumption of compression at the elbow knew my options, though have had a hard time finding hard data on the risks if I go for surgery.  Today, found out I have a double compression....ulnar compression is at elbow, and at the wrist...was told I needed to have surgery.    1.  Should I get both compressions done at once? 2.  How much does this complicate the surgery, and the recovery process. 3.  My life is my hands...what are the negatives of this surgery, the real risks?  4.  I have read recovery times from 2 months to a year and a half...can any one give me more concrete answers on this, as my business will be completely shut down during recovery. 5.  If the surgery is not successful, what is my worst case scenerio here?  Thanks  Dream Dragon\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Need some advice...Ulnar Nerve issues.",
    "content": "Hi there DD,  I'll try and answer... Ulnar neuritis sysmptoms are partly due to irritation of the nerve (pins and needles and pain), and partly due to loss of function of the nerve function (numbness, weakness).  If the loss of function is established, then this is a result of nerve damage, and recovery is based on how damaged the nerve actually is.  Indications of the severity of the damage may be a) whether the numbness is persistent or just transient b) whether there is muscle wasting or not c) whether there is clawing of the fingers or not. DreamDragoninNY wrote:1.  Should I get both compressions done at once? Depends on the findings of the conduction tests...if only the elbow is done, then sometimes the clawing gets worse...called the \"ulnar paradox\" DreamDragoninNY wrote:2.  How much does this complicate the surgery, and the recovery process.? The extra procedure, if done, will not greatly complicate the surgery except in that with two operations, you have twice as many sites for wound related problems. DreamDragoninNY wrote:3.  My life is my hands...what are the negatives of this surgery, the real risks?  Apart from wound related problems, there is I guess nerve damage during the procedure.  The most significant complication is that the nerve function may not fully recover...particularly likely as the problem has been around for a few years. DreamDragoninNY wrote:4.  I have read recovery times from 2 months to a year and a half...can any one give me more concrete answers on this, as my business will be completely shut down during recovery. Nope, crystal ball not working today  DreamDragoninNY wrote:5.  If the surgery is not successful, what is my worst case scenerio here? Worst case is that nerve does not recover, you have clawed, hand with numb little and ring fingers, and reduced ability to do fine movements of the hand.  Despite this, ulnar nerve problems may be resonably well tolerated.  Best case...you recover full function, in record time, and win the lottery...  Hope this helps  Saif\n\n",

    "title": "UNDIAGNOSED FOOT PAIN HELP??",
    "content": "Hello,  I am a 38 year old female that has had progressively worsening foot pain for the past 10 years. It has gotten so bad that it hurts to walk for any period of time. The pain always starts in the 3rd through 5th toes and the pads of my feet. It starts as a burning/stinging sensation then with increased aggrevation from any weight bearing it starts a painful numbing sensation and eventually almost total numbing in the toes and pads. Sometimes it will move to the entire outside of my feet and if I continue the agrevating activity my entire foot will go numb. It started about 10 years ago and was initially mild with symptoms only occurring when I ran or stood in place for long periods. It has progressed over the years to occurring eveyday with any prolonged walking, standing and rapid increased symptoms with running, elitical machines, or any althletic activity. I have seen several specialist and no one seems to be able to diagnose. (Thought it was mortons nueromas at one point and went through injections and the only result was painful muscle spasms 8-10 times per day). X-rays show nothing, MRI's in 2002 showed bone marrow edema (unknown why since I had no activity for several months due to the nueroma traeatments, second opiniion resulted in MRA that showed no nueromas) Currently ortho thinks maybe tarsal tunnel syndrom, new MRI show nothing. EMG shows no nerve reaction in the bottom of either foot in the outside nerves on bottom of feet, but nerve reaction in legs and top of feet are normal. Just sitting here right now, my feet aare partially numb, a stinging/throbbing/ numbing sensation if that makes any sense.  I've invested hundreds of dollars in different shoes, orthodics, and everything I can think of to relieve the pain.       This posses a real problem for me because I am a US Marine with 17 years of active service. I have built up a pain tolerance to get by, but it is becoming increasingly more difficult. I have to keep physically fit to continue serving to be able to retire, but I really getting worried as this condition worsens that I will be able to continue passing my physical fittness test. It has gotten to the point that it is sheer will to get through the pain when I have to run 3 miles, stand in long formations or wear my dress unforms because of the shoes. I can no longer wear any kind of heels without a great deal of pain. I buy all my civilian shoes a size bigger and wider. I must have a lot of padding on my feet. walking barefoot on hard floors triggers pain a numbing within a few minutes.  Military docs can't figure it out. I also have pain in lower back, but MRI's show slight bulding within normal range.    I'm concerned if it continues to worsen sooner or later I may not be able to walk. I have three kids, I want to be a good mom and be able to do normal activities with my kids.   If you can offer any suggestions, I would be greatful.  LADYMARINE\n\n",

    "title": "Chest Wall/shoulder/neck pain",
    "content": "Hello!  Thanks in advance for taking the time to read and answer my legnthy post. I will try to be as brief as possible.  I am a 38 year old male in relatively good health. I have been having a constant problem with a fullness and sensation of pressure in my chest and epigastric area as well as neck sorenes, tenderness, pain in my left shoulder and arm as well as tenderness to touch in these areas. Occasionally I feel light headed and have a sensation of not getting enough air or a choking sensation in my neck. This all came on suddenly about 6 months ago while I was at work lifting a heavy object over my head. I went to the ER and was hospitalized for observation and further testing. The following were performed, multiple EKG's, chest x ray. cardiac enzymes and an Echo Stress all were negative and ruled out cardiac cause. Tidal volume and PulseOx are good even with the tightness in my chest (100% on room air) I have also had an MRI of my thoracic and cervical spine with the exception of a slight \"bulge\" at T-1 it was normal. I have also had a normalhead CT w/contrast.   the pain in the chest is the most bothersome. When I do something that moves my left shoulder back it is the worst. The pain occurs just adjacent to the edge of my breastbone a little ways out from where the ribs meet itand starts at my collar bone and goes down to just below my left nipple. The tightness sensation is mostly in the left side of my chest and covers most of the left chest from the shoulder to just below the last rib. My neck pain varies in intensity and is mostly a vague stifness. There are points in my chest and neck that are sore to touch and sometimes even a light breeze on my chest feels like a lot more pressure than it should. It is better when I lay down but it is always there. The soreness and stiffness in my chest is definitly worse first thing in the morning and gets a little better with some gentle stretching and moist heat from the shower. It is the fullness and tightness that really concern me. I should also mention that there are activities that bring on a numbness sensation in my back just below the left shoulder blade. Doing dishes and driving are activities that make that prevalent. There is also one spot in my left chest near my shoulder that is very sore, feels like a knot and when I press on it I get severe pain down the legnth of my left arm. I also have the sensation sometimes that the end of a rib near the sternum is pushing out against my skin although I cant actually feel a lump or obvious end of a rib poking out there. Sharp pains between ribs in varying locations front and back and sometimes sharp pain in the middle of my back just below the shoulder blades.   My PCP keeps saying its a pulled muscle in my chest wall but the amount of time this has been going on (6 months) makes me wonder. He says the other pains are part of getting older and have nothng to do with the chest pain. I have been going to physical therapy for four months now and there is NO improvement. I would appreciate your opinion.   THANKS!!!\n\n",

I have never had any major medical issues (acid reflux the last few years along with off/on lower back pain), but have recently had a battle with chest pressure and at times feeling light headed.  My symptoms are very similiar to what you guys have listed minus the shoulder pain.  A/C seems to really bring it on especially in my car.  At this time physical activities doesn't seem to aggrivate it.  It seems to be more prevalent while sitting.  I had blood work done along with EKG in the emergency room and a follow up appointment.  All were negative.  My blood pressure had been 120/80 for the longest time until recently.  It jump up to 130/92.   On another website there was someone diagnosed with sleep apnea (sorry for the spelling) / I guess chronic snoring.  He had  similiar symptoms also.  Full recovery after treatment.      I have another appointment next month, but don't expect alot.  I don't think the doctor felt anything was wrong during first visit.  He talked about a possible strain.  He will probably recommend a cardiologist.    Hopefully someone will find a solution soon.           brian90254 wrote:Shalaelae & Peterug 13,  Have either of you been able to resolve this problem??

They did all the cardio tests (CT Scans, EKG, treadmill stress test, bp, etc) and couldn't find anything wrong.  This has been very frustrating and I have severely cut back my travel schedule for work.  I am continuing to try to figure this out.  It certainly seems that if there IS going to be an answer to this -- it will be up to me to force the issue w/ doctors.  Until now, they have been stumped (and even a bit \"uninterested it seems).  My next steps:  Another MRI of my neck/chest on Monday 11/21, appt w/ pulmonologist, new internal med doctor, and a new cardiologist over the next 2 weeks.  I have a family and 2 little babies so I want answers.  My number one goal now is to rule out anything potentially life threatening.  Please let me know if either of you have found a resolution to this problem.  Thanks, Brian\n\n",

    "content": "MRI turned up nothing.  Pulmonologist also couldn't find anything wrong.  Went to an Ear, Nose, Throat doc earlier this week and he said maybe it was an acid reflux problem.  I highly doubt this, but will try what he perscribed (Prylosec) for a few weeks.  It seems like a stretch to think acid reflux would be causing my constant neck, chest, shoulder pain as well as shortness of breath and a sore ear & throat.  Besides, the symptoms are always there (not just after eating/drinking).  This is hugely frustrating.\n\n",

    "content": "Hey all,  I'm just checking in because I've been experiencing pretty much the same symptoms that everyone here describes for the better part of six months.  Multiple chest x-rays reveal nothing.  Blood runs indicate nothing.  CT scan on chest wall shows nothing.  X-ray on the thoracic spine reveals nothing.  37 year old male - used to smoke, quit nine months ago.   Everyone keeps trying to tell me it's muscle/chiropractic, but it just doesn't seem right.  I've also been down the Zantac 150 for gastric reflux route on this.  30 days @ twice a day for the heavy duty Zantac does definitely have the sternum feeling slightly better, but my most painful spot is basically under my left arm in the ribs.  Most constant symptom is basically that my ribs on the left side are always tender and sore.  Gets better and worse, but never goes away completely...  I would definitely describe a general tightness in that area as well.  Seeing the head of ortho on Tuesday to see what he recommends as a next step... Is anyone getting anywhere with this thing?  Thanks much, -adam\n\n",

Being treated for acid reflux since about four months ago.  The reflux was somewhat confirmed after I noticed pain in a specific spot in my throat.  I was scoped and they found a contact ulcer near my larynx.  Like others on here, I have made trips to the emergency room in the past and the EKGs, chest x-rays and CT scans come up negative.  I was treated for reflux previously, about seven years ago, but never had the pain/stiffness/tingling in my neck and up to my right ear before.  I hope someone finds a doctor that is interested enough to come up with a diagnosis and solution.\n\n",

I suffered from fibromyalgia off and on since 1996 but never experienced this.

There was a posting about apnea - has anyone else been diagnosed or suspected of having an apnea problem. - perhaps the issues are relative to oxygen levels in the muscles , etc?? This is all very strange, my symptoms come and go , sometimes with dizziness, sometimes without.. Also suspected stress in upper body from prolonged work sitting with computer and improper postures creative a nerve issue. Has anyone else had arm problem, sorenss in points when pain has subdued??\n\n",

    "content": "Sorry if this gets long, but I want to give you sufficient information.   A while ago my right knee begin to get sore. I have 3 flights of stairs to go up and down (due to the apartment I live in) everyday. Now recently (past 2 weeks) for some reason I have repeatedly twisted the knee in everyday activities (ie. getting in the passenger side of car, turn my body around and twist my knee) I also have 2 kids so I'm constantly squating down and such. The pain has progressivly gotten worse.  Okay, walking does not really bother the knee. The pain comes with bending and especially unbending the knee. For example, if I'm squating down or sitting down, when I stand up I must put all of my weight on the other leg because the right knee hurts so bad straightening it out and putting the weight on it. The worst horrible pain is on the 'inside' of the kneecap and also minor pain on the right and left sides of the kneecap. I went to a doctor and the x-ray was negative so the bones are okay. She said there is only very minor swelling (I can't even notice it).  She gave me a ace bandage to wrap it and said if it still hurts see an orthopedist. Well that was on Saturday Nov 6. I still have pain and it is no better.  I would like to know what the problem with the knee could be and what would an orthopedist would or could do. I don't want to waste money if the ortho can't really do anything or if he/she just tells me to wrap the knee like the first Dr. did. But I'm 30 yrs old and feel like I'm 90 because I can't bend and unbend my knee without horrible pain.  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Pballgrl,  Sorry to hear about your knee problem...I will try to help.  It is difficult to assess on-line as it were, but let's have a go anyway.  There are several features of your symptoms that suggest possibilities as to what the the cause of your pain is.  If I can just decribe the knee joint to you first as a way of explanation.  The end of Femur (thigh bone) artculates with the top of Tibia (main bone of your lower leg).  On the front  of your femur, is the knee cap, the patella, and this moves up and down as you flex and extend your knee, travelling in a groove in the femur.  Between the femur and the tibia are two cresent shaped bits of cartilage (the menisci) which act something like cushions.  Twisting injuries can lead to injuries of the menisci, and typically these cause intermittent pains, aching in the knee, periodic swelling and locking of the knee...although none of these are absolute.  What is more likely in your knee, from what you describe is something called Chondromalacia Patellae.  It is a poorly understood condition, and orthopaedic surgeons themselves oten disagree as the significance of thsi sometimes.  Essentially the problem is due to some damage of \"softening undeneath your knee cap.  What this does is cause pain when the pressure is maximal between the patella and femur is greatest,  typically, when load is applied to a bent knee.  This occurs when you go up and downstairs, get up from a chair or from the floor, squat, kneel etc.   This seems to be what you are describing.  Why this occurs is difficult to explain in a short space, it is more frequent in young women. There are several therapeutic options,  the simplest initial treatment is to exercise your quads, in particular your VMOs (Vastus Medialis Obliquus).  What you do is lie in bed, legs straight out.  Turn you foot outwards, and lift your legs up and down.  You should feel some tightening of the muscles on the inner side of your thigh.  Do this twice a day, for about 10 minutes.  It taks a while to settle down, and sometimes needs more drastic action...  Try these, I am happy to discuss further, but if I carried on I have no doubt you'd fall asleep with boredom...and this is no substitute for face to face contact...  Best wishes  Saif\n\n",

CMP can also cause these symptoms,  and typically occurs on both knees, and in women more often than men.  Other causes such as meniscal problems (cartilage tears) rarely affect both knoees simultaneously.  Some orthopeadic surgeons feels a fold in the knee, called a plica can also cause these symptoms, but plicae are also found in normal asymptomaatic individuals.  Saif\n\n",

    "content": "I will just list a few of the more important medical conditions that could be associated with foot pain.  Arthritic Conditions. Arthritic conditions, particularly osteoarthritis and gout, can cause foot pain. Although rheumatoid arthritis almost always develops in the hand, the ball of the foot can also be affected.   Diabetes. Diabetes is an important cause of serious foot disorders. It is discussed in a separate section.  Diseases That Affect Muscle and Motor Control. Diseases that affect muscle and motor control, such as Parkinson's disease, can cause foot problems.  High Blood Pressure. High blood pressure can cause fluid build-up and swollen feet. The effects of high blood pressure on the nervous and circulatory systems can cause pain, loss of sensation, and tingling in the feet, and can increase the susceptibility for infection and foot ulcers.  Osteoporosis. Osteoporosis, in which bone loss occurs, can cause foot pain.  Of note is the fact that you have a family history of both diabetes and parkinson's disease. However, I would doubt that these diseases would present with foot pain. I would take a careful look at the possibility of arthritis or osteoporosis.  A calcaneal spur is another condition which leads to intense pain which generally originates from the heal but could be felt in the sole of the foot as well. All 3 conditions (arthritis, osteoporosis, spur) can be excluded by an x-ray.  Best wishes,\n\n",

    "content": "I have been having problems lately with my left knee.  I have been trying to work-out lately by riding a recumbent exercise bike.  However, I seemed to be hindered everytime I do because of the pain in my knee.  It seems to be mostly on the inside of the knee but sometimes seems like it's in back or on the right side.  It is not a sharp pain but more like a dull ache.  I exercise in the morning and my knee aches all day.  It's nothing too horrible, but it just feels like I can't sit in any comfortable position.  Should I be seeing a doctor about this?  What could be causing this?  Is there something I should be doing at home?  Would a knee brace help?  Thanks in advance for any answers that you can come up with.\n\n",

    "content": "I also have knee pain.  I am a 22 year old female medical student.  Over the past 4-5 months, my right knee has been hurting more and more whenever I run.  It is a very specific pain located on the lateral part of the knee inferior to the patella.  After jogging even small distances (1/4 of a mile or more), the knee becomes mildly inflamed for about 2 days then goes away.  NSAIDS help a little with the swelling but it is still painful. Pain is produced by passive or active movement and is not hurt by touch/pressure.  I don't think it is a ligamental tear because there is no noticible instablility in the knee.  Is this consisant with a small meniniscal tear?  Does anyone else have other ideas.  I would like to make an appointment with a specialist - what type of specialist would be reccomended?  Thanks for any input!!!\n\n",

Orthopedician 1 - My right ribs no 5,6,7th broken and maybe my right shoulder rotator cuff tear and at the moment no surgical treatment is require. These are why I can\u2019t lift my right arm.  Orthopedician 2 - My right ribs no 3,4,5,6,7th broken and my right shoulder socket that attached to the right arm bone was broken and at the moment no surgical treatment is require. These are why I can\u2019t lift my right arm.  Orthopedician 3 - My right ribs at least 5 bone was broken and it could be my right shoulder important veins or tendon was broken and maybe need a surgical treatment. These are why I can\u2019t lift my right arm.  As what I can see is all  the 3 Orthopedician opinion are different. So which one should I trust ? Aren\u2019t all the Orthopedician can give a correct number of broken ribs by looking at the X-ray ? I had taken actually 9 X-ray at my shoulder and chest within these 3 weeks and will these give any side effect ? According to the doctor advice that it is best to take another X-ray only after 6 months.   It looks like the Orthopedician itself is not sure what is the actual cause. So I\u2019m sure that if I go to a fourth Orthopedician it will give me a different opinion. I  really don\u2019t know what to do now. Can someone please advice, as I\u2019m not a doctor, I\u2019m only a technician.  All help are welcome.  Cheers, YFS  P.S.  The wound of a sword may heal but wound of words never.

    "content": "Dear Veronica,  The vast majority of clicky knees are not associated with any significant pathology within the knee.  Occassionally torn menisci, damage to the joint surface, or a fold within the knee (called a plica) can cause the clicks. These are worth treating if they are associated with pain, swelling or instability (the knee giving way).  You clearly are atheletic, and do enough activity to sustain any of these injuries, but as I say the vast majority of such clicks are completely harmless, and without the above features would not warrant any further investigation or treatment.

The only explanation I have gotton to this point without an MRI is an  ULNER Nerve Entrapment. The impingement causes the numbness. Pardon the spelling...good luck\n\n",

    "content": "You have the classic symptoms of an ulnar nerve entrapment.  This is usually caused by damage to the ulnar nerve, usually at elbow or hand.  Do you rembember hitting your funny bone or have you hurt your wrist on the pinky side recently from a bang?  Do you lean on your elbow much? If the problem is with your elbow, try to adjust your sleeping posture.  You may need to keep from sleeping with your elbow bent.  I would see a doctor and ask for a nerve conduction test called EMG - this is not expensive.  See someone about this even if it doesnt go away, because it might come back to haunt you later.  If you think you have a circulation problem, there are easy ways a doctor can check your blood flow.  If the problem is with your hand and you cant wait, search the net for \"Allen Test\" this is an easy way to check for a curculation issue.  Make sure: any diagnosis a doctor gives you is solidly backed up with diagnostic testing proof; Don't just take their word.  Ulnar nerve problems can lead to permanent wasting of the hand muscles if left untreated, making it hard to use your hands for finer movements.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Nikki,  By the number of replies you have had, (and really quite helpful advice, I might add), you will see that it is a fairly common accident, and as you have experienced, fairly painful too!  Typically, the person doing this has caught the little toe against a door, or a table leg, running in barefeet.  The toe is often broken, but it doesn't need to be to be painful, and strapping to its buddy is the most commonly recommended treatment.  Bruising and swelling is also very common, and sometimes causes more concern, but even then the problem is not too bad. You say there has been some bleeding...this is not so common.  A cut to the skin technically makes this an open injury, and often orthpaedic surgeons tend to be a bit more aggressive managing such injuries.  If you are worried let me know.    Apart from strapping it, the toe should be kept elevated, and ice packs applied.  The healing process effectively starts the moment you injure it, and steadily improves over the next few weeks(!). By about 4 weeks the bulk of the pain is gone...in the meantime some painkillers and open shoes should  make life a little easier...Sadly you will now find out exactly how often one  knocks one's little toes throughout the day!  It is very rare for these fractures not to heal (if that is what you have), but it can happen...I would suggest DaveT is rather unfortunate in this regard.  \"Buddy strapping\" should prevent a little toe fracture  healing in an angulated fashion, non union is extremely rare.\n\n",

The knee is stable, it does not \"go out\" and I can twist and turn, and bend it with no problem.  There really has not been much if any swelling.  The bruising is gone now and all I have now is the pain.  It could be that I bruised the bone and it is just taking a long time to heal.  I hope I don't have a fracture or did some ligament damage.

    "content": "Hello! I am a 28  year old female with some questions for my doctor.  I have just moved, and am going to him for the second time.  I'm a little unsure of him. My history: I pulled muscles in my lower back about 6 months ago while lifting my 10 month old.  It only took about a week to completely heal.  When we made a cross country drive 4 months after, I started having ALOT of back pain.  I dealt with it, but the pain became so bad I had to see a doc.  He told me I had 3 pinched nerves, and spasms in my lower back on the right side.  He gave me some at home stretching/conditioning exercises, told me to get good insoles, and sent me on my way.  Since then, the pain hasn't gone away.  Some days are better than others.  I have been under ALOT of stress lately.  I have been feeling a little depressed.  The pain has gotten ALOT worse with this stress also (new job/BIG pressure).  My pain is mostly lower back/with tingling all up the left side of my back.  Tingling from my left shoulder to mid back, where my pinched nerve is. I made an appt with him, and started to go through my medical history.  I did a little research on line, and was wondering if I should bring all this to his attention.  On top of the above mentioned pain, I have been extremely fatigued.  I sleep approx. 6 hours during the night.  It takes all my energy to get out of bed and get myself and two children ready and out the door.  I fight looking at the bed, in fear that I will fall back asleep.  I am exhaused when I get to work, and my back pain flares!  I have a very hard time concentrating.  I forget what I'm doing about 25% of the time.  I lose concentration halfway through a conversation, like my mind shuts down (which isn't good when you're in sales!)  I sit about 50% of the day, stand the rest. I have previously been diagnosed with Psoriasis, Raynoynds (sp?) syndrome, meniere's disease (which I personally think was misdiagnosed), and vertigo.  The vertigo is under control (disappeared when I became pregnant in 2001).  My inner ear still aches from time to time.  My legs have stared to ache, along with my upper arms.  I have had a mild headached for 4 days now (taking Aleve).  I have also been getting painfully bloated stomachaches for the last 4 years.  I have ignored it, and just thought gas.  This happens about 3 times a week.  My husband saw a commercial about IBS medication, and said I should get checked for it....he said my symptoms are very similar. I know I should bring all this up to my doctor.  My question is:  what should be his next step?  Rheumatologist? Chiropractor? Physical Therapy? Psychologist? What could be going on with me? Do you think this is all stress realted? Thank you so much for you time.  I appreciate you reading this and taking the time to reply.  My appointment is this coming Tues, and would like to go to my doc somewhat knowledgeable about what to expect next!\n\n",

    "content": "Wow, your back problems sound so similar to mine. I'm not a doctor, so take what I say as a fellow suffer and nothing more.   It sounds like you have soft tissue damage, so going to a chiropracter may actually make the problem worse. What you want to demand is a CT scan of your back. This will identify any bulging disc that are pinching the nerve, or bone growths that are pushing on them, etc. I, personally, find it unlikely you have three pinched nerves, but it's not impossible.  If you do indeed have pinched nerves, these can be fixed with surgery. (I  think it's like 80% success rate with herniated discs)  That's the good news.  I've found Ortho Surgeons a mucn friendlier breed than Neurosurgeons. (They seem to have spent so much time learning what they do with such amazing ability that they didn't have time to realize they're dealing with a feeling (often scared) person.   A great help for the backpain (so you can sit in chairs and do things that help you) is an electric blanket. Of course, you probably can't bring of one of those into work, so I'd suggest a heating pad. It won't mean you aren't in pain, but it keeps it minimal for *me* until I finish doing what I want to do.   As far as the headaches, its probably very very understandable stress headaches. I've found sinus headache medication works miracles in getting rid of them, but again, just my experience.  I offer you heaps of sympathy. I have massive back woes but don't have any children and so can only imagine the nightmare of pain and suffering your life has become in trying to keep up.  And if you aren't comfortable with your new doctor, find another. Sometimes doctors-patients just don't work well together, finding a second one is often a good idea. Things will work better for *you*.  Hope some of this helped!  -Shady.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Ouchie,  Having psoriasis is associated with the presence of arthritis in lots of patiens and this might present as back pain or arthritis of the fingers of the hands as well.  Does the alleve that you take for your headaches make your back pain better? Have you tried any thing else for the back pain? A heating pad is a good idea, you might want to try it.  See your doctor on tuesday and then he will decide whether it is necessary to have a ct scan of your back or not because if you do not have any signs of herniated discs clinically then the ct scan will be unrevealing. You can raise your concerns during that appointment and ask him if he could refer you to an orthopedic surgeon if whatever treatment he offers you does not improve your condition within a certain period of time.  Most of the back pain that people experience is most probably due to unhealthy sitting habits (especially if you are using a computer in your job as this will put more stress on your neck vertebrae) and may be bad mattresses. So always try to sit straight and try to get enough sleep because to some people 6 hours of sleep are not enough.  Once more, thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

It is an intolerance to gluten and is not caused by stress or tenseness - it is an autoimmune disease that is treatable. It has many symptoms and can be hard to pin point, but there are blood tests available. I would encourage you to get these if you have low back pain, tiredness, and stomach troubles. Celiac will cause muscle aches, nutritional deficiencies constipation, big D and stomach pain.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,        Ever since I started to play soccer in high school, I have been able to snap my ankles any time I want to by just moving my foot up and down. This has never been a real problem up until about two years ago. Pretty much every morning that I wake up, my right ankle, not so much my left but it hurts some too, is very painful for about 30 minutes or if I can get it to pop a certain way. This pain has progressively gotten worse, and has been hurting non-stop for about 3 days now, and I can hardly walk on it. I've seen a chiropractor about it about 3 years ago, but his treatment did nothing. Any ideas what's causing this and what I should do? Do I need to go get it x-rayed and looked at? Any ways to have temporary relief from this, especially for playing sports (or if i need to quit playng sports I can)?  Thanks, Kickehy\n\n",

There is no obvious swelling or discoloration.  I tried putting heat on it, but when I took it off, it felt worse.  Could this be related to slamming on the brakes so hard?

    "title": "Scaphoid Fracture in Youth",
    "content": "My 15 yr old son was injured in a quadding accident last week.  He says he felt and \"heard\" a snap.  He has no side-to-side rotation of his wrist and has been in such extreme pain that he has passed out 3 times in the shower.  Initial diagnosis on Saturday by the emergeny physician was \"a bad sprain\".  My son has had multiple sports injuries, including fractures and sprains and tried to tell the doctor \"I felt it break.  I know its broken.\"  The doctor said nothing showed on the x-rays.  My son was in so much pain that I took him back yesterday.  He saw a different ER doc who did some simple \"try to do this, try to do that, does this hurt? does that hurt?\"  Then the doctor said that it appeared to be a \"Scaphoid Fracture\" but he would do some new x-rays with different views from the last time.  Sure enough, the bone is broken right across about mid-line.  My son was put into a thumb spica cast to his elbow.  The ER doc gave us this list of possible outcomes, none of which sounded so great.  What I don't understand is that there is not a great chance of this type of injury healing without surgical intervention.  Also, what I have been able to learn about it is that there should not be so much pain as my son is experiencing.  He is a very active athlete (hence all the injuries) and he has broken this wrist three other times so is quite concerned that if things are not done properly that he will not be able to have full use.  So, my questions: 1.  Is an orthoepoedic consult recommended? 2.  Is surgery advisable sooner rather than as a \"last ditch attempt\". 3.  Does severe pain indicate other trauma (to ligaments, muscle, etc.)?  Thank you.  B.\n\n",

That much pain should have been addressed more aggressively in my opinion.    But, as you, I'm a parent and I only want the absolute best for my children.  I do hope that a consultation was received eventually and everything was done to make sure that your son recovered as much movement and as little pain as possible.\n\n",

The results said there was a spur there. I went to my PCP who said there's nothing they do about that. It's a little unsightly, but that would be okay.  The problem is that whenever I write  I have to stop and shake out my hand ( I also have Carpal Tunnel) and the spur makes it impossible for me to long control how the letters come out, resulting in class notes taken in school that are illegible. Mostly I use the computer at work, but there are some documents that are hand written there too, so it is bothersome.  Are joint spurs on hands ever removed?\n\n",

    "title": "Elbow troubles.",
    "content": "Hi, I am a 48 year old male. I am dealing with a number of orthopedic problems but one has become an overwhelming concern.  I had a multiple fracture of my left elbow at the age of 7. The joint was rebuilt from the remains of the growth plates. It was a good job by the doctor considering what he had to work with. The joint never again had more than half of the normal range of motion.  The wrist was only able to rotate about 40 degrees. The ulna cap was removed in 1996 to relieve pain.  I have been on Celebrex for years and I have been using Ultram daily for the last couple years. However the pain has been intense and getting worse over the last year.  My family doctor tried steroids but they  made me too jittery, they did cut the pain and swelling. I saw a notable orthopedic here in Pittsburgh and his first reaction to my X-rays  was disbelief. He could not believe my elbow was that bad. He noted to me that arthritis that bad is not usually seen in someone my age. He stated that the best alternative for me would be Joint replacement but that it was unethical to do at my age.  I understand his points, yet I still have my problem. He did give me a shot of cortisone but it only made it worse. As a funny aside the Doctor had his PA give me the shot with a resident watching. As the fluid went into the joint my arm muscles started to spasm.  I thought the resident was going to freak. His eyes got real big.  My job entails me having to be exposed to great temperature and moisture changes ( I have to examine the fresh produce in the coolers) about 20 times each morning then I have to type my report into a database. Even the typing is getting to be painful.  Upon rising in the morning I feel great. It only takes about an hour though until my arm starts to ache. I carry my arm in my coat pocket as it acts like a sling and that helps a little. The pain is mostly in the muscles around the joint and inside the joint.  So what do I do now? I feel like my family doc is unsure about what to do and the impression I got from the Ortho was to call him when I get older.  I am worried about muscular damage because the arm responds with swelling every time I exercise.  What should I do next?\n\n",

    "content": "For several years now, (which seemed to be more present after the birth of my 2nd and 3rd child), I have had hip pain that has gradually gotten worse.  It feels as though my hip joints are out of whack.  I can move in a particular motion to lead up what feels like the ball and joint is going back into place.  This is present in both hips.  X-rays didn't show anything which led them to want to do a MRI, but I never made the appt.  I also feel like the Siatic nerve is pinched, which causes even more pain in my leg.  The people that I speak with seem to know nothing.  Can anyone give me some type of clue into what MIGHT be the problem.  Thanks!!\n\n",

I'm worried that i'm way to short for my age and I was also told that when I was young, I was breast-fed for about 3 months after I was born. Is there a correlation with the fact that I was under-fed with breast milk and the height of my parents? Is there any chance that I will grow bigger? If so, what kind of diet would you recommend and execise?   Thanks in advance.\n\n",

    "content": "When i was born I was very sick and was thought to have had lactose intolerance so I was n't fed properly as a baby. My sister is 5'9 my brother is 6'3 and my dad is 6'1.  I'm 5'7 and have only grown 2 inches the past year and I just turned 17.  I'm starting to get nervous that this will be my height for the rest of my life. I take a vitamins everyday and eat well, live healthily but never seem to grow.  I'm 5'7 and only 110 lb's and im 17.  I don't know if the fact i wasn't fed properly as a baby has anything to do with it or if i have hormonal imbalances but I want to fix the problem before it's too late.  I have a feeling that I'm either an incredibly late bloomer because I have't really put on muscle and I'm incredibly scrawny or I've already gone though the majority of my growing and I'm stuck being 5'7 and scrawny for the rest of my life.  Is being a 5'10 so much to ask?! I really want to grow but I don't know what to do, any help would be appreciated.\n\n",

He then suggested for ultrasonic massage and advised wearing soft padded footwear. This was some two years back. My weight is around 70 Kgs.   I took the treatment for a month and my pain subsided.   I have also started wearing soft padded footwear.   Now, the pain has restarted. It pains while walking/standing for a long time i.e. only when pressure is applied on the heels. At other times, it gives a burning/tinging sensation. Pressing heels also causes a lot of pain.   There is no swelling or discoloration of heels. Outwardly, heels appear perfectly normal.  Kindly advise what is the cause and what treatment should I take.\n\n",

    "title": "Pediatric knee problem",
    "content": "My daughter who is now 9 years old has been able to \"pop\" the bone in her shin where it attaches to the knee in and out at will since she was 3 years old.  Our family doctor insisted that the knee didn't require any intervention.  He said that children often have \"soft\" bones and ligament connections don't always tighten until they are much older.  As the ability to do this knee thing didn't seem to be causing her pain, he insisted we leave it alone and evaluate it later if it began to bother her.  Granted, it didn't seem to bother her so we did leave it alone, but I've insisted that she quit popping it in and out just for the fun of it.  Now, she seems to be having lots of problems with her knee.  She complains of pain in it constantly - sometimes worse than others.  When she is on it for a prolonged period, she actually retains quite a bit of fluid on it.  And now I notice that occassionally the knee just seems to give out on her making her fall.  I've taken her back to the family doctor for the problem, but he says that it is Austen-Schlatters (sp?) and there really isn't anything to do but exercise it regularly and take motrin for the pain.  That just doesn't seem right.  She is quite active already and given being on it for a long period makes it retain fluid and really hurt, I just don't think this is the best advice.  I am afraid that we've waited too long to treat this correctly.  I am afraid to take her to a regular orthopedic doctor, but can't get an appointment with a pediatric orthopedic doctor for many months.  Any suggestions what this might be?  And should I give in a take her to a regular orthopedic doctor instead of waiting for the pediatric ortho at Children's Hospital?  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear JustDionne,  Osgood-Schlatter disease occurs in children and adolescent athletes where repetitive extension of the knee causes inflammation and injury of the tibial tubercle (of the bone itself).  The tibial tubercle is the protuberant knob on the front of the tibia, a couple of inches below the knee, where the patellar tendon attaches. This pain is typically worse when extending the leg. The tibial tubercle is painful and tender to touch and over time begins to protrude more because the chronic inflammation stimulates the bone to grow.  This is a self-limited condition that usually resolves as the bone stops growing with the end of adolescence (at about age 17 years in males and age 15 years in females). Treatment includes PRICE therapy, which stands for:  PROTECT the knee from further trauma which can be done with knee padding.  REST the knee.  ICE the knee. Use an icebag placed on the knee 2-3 times a day for 20-30 minutes each time.  COMPRESS the knee with a knee brace or wrap.  ELEVATE the knee.  Over-the-counter pain control medications such as naproxen (Aleve or Naprosyn) and ibuprofen (Advil or Motrin) also play a role in treatment.  In severe cases, splinting the knee for a few weeks may help reduce the pain and halt the inflammation cycle.  My advice is: give the PRICE therapy together with medication one week, and if no improvemnt, go see an orthopedic doctor, as this usually points to some other underlying condition.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for your reply.  I have already had the MRI and it shows nothing. I was wondering about Dupuytrens because am developing 2 lumps on my foot. I think. It feels like I'm walking on marbles. However I can't see these lumps or feel the foot lumps with my fingers.  I am thinking the doctors might be cautious about diagnosing Duypuytrens because the lump is so soft. Unless of course the lumps from Dupuytrens would have shown up on the MRI. This is a very large lump about 1\" long 1/2\" wide and about 1/4\" high taking up most of my palm. All cysts and ligament problems have been ruled out.\n\n",

I  don't remember exactly how it happened, no popping noise, nothing, just woke up the next morning and my knee was swollen as hell, hot, and aching me to move around.  On some anti-inflammatories,  Got it drained a little 4 days ago, just mainly blood came out, not much either, could of been a better draining job, no fractures on the X-RAY,  orthopedic said it could be a tear of some sort, My insurance hasnt okayed an MRI yet,.  Also,  I can move around \"okay\" , as in I can walk around, not doing back-flips or anything, just hurts when walking around over periods of time. No problem flexing it, difficulty doing leg curls,  or even getting that mobility.  Feel like I wanta get it drained again.  I have no patience for this crap. The swelling is pretty bad right on the knee-cap, and on the outside of the knee, and on the top of the knee, not much on the inside of the knee  Could it be a tear, bursitis, staph?  These are the things I hear around the gym.  Wat are these things,  symptoms, whats the deal?  Its been a week now,\n\n",

When you begin exercising again try doing a couple of your different ones at a time over a couple days before adding additional ones. If the pain exhibits itself after new exercices are added it would be easier to determine which ones to maybe avoid. This way you will know if the pain is related to overextending or something else.

    "content": "i am in softball, and every time i throw the ball, it hurts my arm really bad. the pain lasts no more than a few minutes, and only hurts when i throw overhand. i am a catcher so that is alot of throwing for me. it does not hurt at my shoulder or elbow, but right below my deltoid muscle in the center of my arm. i have been told from a college baseball player (also catcher) that it would have nothing to do with playing softball, and that maybe it happened some other way. i don't know why it hurts or whether i need a doctor or not, but my coach has been benching me to help heal it and told me to got to an orthopedic, just incase it is serious. do i need to do this? does anybody have any suggestions as to what this might be? (a suggestion has come up about tendonitis?)\n\n",

Gout is a form of rheumatic disease (one of the most painful) and it results from the formation of crystals of uric acid in connective tissue , joint space between 2 bones etc. Although drinking to much alcohol is a contributing factor, family history, being overweight, eating foods rich in purines, etc., are also contributing factors.

    "content": "Hi,   I'm not sure if I am posting this in the correct section or not, I was lookng for a neurologist section but couldn't find one. Anyway,  I have mild spastic Cererbral Palsy and use crutches to move around. Due to my CP my balance isn't too great and I am not able to move my right foot that well on my own.  Around 6 months ago I began to notice that my ankles were stiffer then usual and so I went to my family doctor and he said that I was beginning to get \"frozen ankles\" and my right foot is inverted some and getting worse. Recently I noticed my muscles getting really tight and uncomfortable. When I first seen a podiatrist he reccomended doing surgery to have the tendons released again.( I had this done already once when I was 3.) I was researching online and I read that having the surgery makes the muscles weaker and I was just wondering if I have it a second time would my ankles be too weak to support me?  Also Would anyone be able to give me more information on what the surgery involves and if there are any other options out there? I did recently get AFO's but  I don't see how they help stretch the muscles they seem to just hold my foot in the proper position. Thanks for the information in advance I appreciate it. Holly\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Hollyberry19, The Achilles tendon is the largest/strongest tendon in the body and seems to cause significant problems in people suffering from Cerebral Palsy. Conservative treatment measures are stretching and casting but this offers limited success. To my knowledge surgical interventions involve essentially dividing the tendon, making incisions (cuts) in such a fashion that permits lengthening of the tendon.Tthe tendon is  then sutured into place, and a walking cast is placed for approximately 6 weeks, usually followed by physical therapy. As for muscle weakness involving the extended use of braces etc. this is found to be more common when surgical intervention is used to release spastic muscles verses tendons. Prior to any type of  surgical procedure, make sure you discuss the procedure, what to expect after a procedure, and expected outcomes with your physician so that you are well informed prior to an intervention.  I hope this information is somewhat useful.  Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "title": "loss of hand strength",
    "content": "Serveral months ago I noticed a marked loss of hand strength. It is not severe such that I cannot use my hands in ordinary ways. However there is a general decline in strength that iis perturbing. For example: I used to be able to open and close very tightly a soda bottle. However, even though I can still open and close it, I cannot close it tightly. And when I try to open/close it, it is mildly painful. In fact most tasks that require mild hand exertion, which before were unnoticible to me, are now noticibly painful. I find that I now avoid exerting my hand muscles quite often.   I think the onset might be related to a two week period of excessive moving work which I had engaged in but I am not sure--it seems I started noticing the problem towards the end of that period. I have also noticed that little dings like hitting my elbow against the wall, stubbing my toe, scraping my knuckles againt something, etc. is much more painful then it used to be. I'm not sure if this increased sensitivity to pain is related to the hand weakness.   I'm wondering what the cause of this might be and whether there is a remedy. I'm only thirty years old and am a do-it-yourselfer. The loss of hand strength has been quite upsetting. Yet, I'm concerned about being able to convince a doctor about it since I'm a petite female and since the loss is not severe. Is there a way a doctor can confirm such a thing  without  having a measure of my strength prior to this happening?  Thank you, Mila\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Chondrodermatitis nodularis chronica helices is also known as Winkler\u2019s disease.  This is a small, painful, scaly, nodular lesion on the helix (upper, outer cartilage rim) of the ear, colored skin color, grayish, or translucent; multiple lesions may occur along the rim of the ear. It can be caused from sleeping on one side, more common on the right side, can be surgically removed but may return. Very painful for your cousin to deal with, relief may be found with lidocaine ointment until it can be seen by a Physician. I can't find any information on a pillow made especially for this condition.\n\n",

    "title": "Pinched Nerve, or Something Worse?",
    "content": "I'll just give you my rundown of symptoms, please tell me what you think may be going on here (note: I am already in contact with my doctor, just waiting for him to open the office in 1/2-hour and call me back):   1. Been having upper back soreness lately (I KNOW this is from bad posture at my desk at work).  2. Last week, I had a sensation of \"an explosion of tingliness\" in the back of my head, it radiated down my arms and then my fingers felt tingly. Went away in just seconds.  3. Friday I woke up with a sore right shoulder muscle, but nothing to stop me from going about my normal daily activities.  4. Saturday I woke up with that same shoulder pain so BAD that it was debilitating. I called my MD, who gave me a muscle relaxer and an anti-inflammatory (we both figured it was another pinched nerve, as I had one about a year ago in the same spot). The meds didn't seem to do anything, not even make me tired, and the pain was UNBEARABLE, so I called him again, and he prescribed Vicodin. I took two of those, and went to bed a few hours later.  5. Easter Sunday - I wake up with still a little bit of soreness in the shoulder, but like Friday, nothing so bad as to stop me from normal activities. The vicodin was like my Easter miracle. I take one anti-inflammatory pill, as prescribed, NO vicodin, and NO muscle relaxer, and go to visit my parents for Easter.  6. Easter, while at my parents house, I get the sensation of \"an explosion of tingliness\" in my head again. This time, it doesn't radiate down my arms, but instead I get all clammy and almost pass out.  7. I also notice on easter sunday that the right side of my face is ever-so-slightly swollen.   So, I have stopped all meds and put another call into my doctor's office. I suspect that he will want to see me today, but does anyone know in the meantime what might be going on here. Just a pinched nerve? Reaction to the meds? Something worse?   Thanks in advance.  MACtools_2\n\n",

    "title": "Cervical spine compression",
    "content": "Hello,  If you have a Cervical spine compression you will probably be referred to a Neurologist by your Physician. A Neurologist is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treatment of nervous system disorders, including diseases of the brain, spinal cord, nerves and muscles that are shorting out because of nerve problems. The nervous system basically consists of the brain and its components, spinal cord, all nerves coming off the spinal cord and all nerves coming off of those nerves. The explanation of Neurological is real long, it is anything to do with the nervous system, the disorders of and functions of.   The Cervical spine is the vertebrae that make up your neck. Cervical spinal compression happens when something causes a narrowing of the canal or tube where the spinal cord runs through it. This can be caused by (to name a few) trauma, posture, or disease. This narrowing starts to irritate and squeeze the spinal cord and slows the flow of cerebrospinal fluid down that goes around the cord which adds to the irritation. All of this starts a variety of symptoms like tingling, numbness, weakness, severe pain, paralysis, and can eventually cause injury to the spinal cord, cervical discs and bones.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Joanna,  Unusual to damage a calf muscle with a twisting mechanism, but the tender muscle on the backside of the calf, in the middle of your lower leg would be your gastrocnemius.  Apart from local tenderness, going on tip toes causes the pain to worsen.  Pain settles down eventually,  with ice, elevation and gentle exercises.    Sometimes people sustaining an injury to the gastrocnemius describe a sensation that someone hit then from behind.   A similar sensation can be associated with an Achilles tendon injury, and this would need susrgery.  Ankles can be sprained after a twisting injury, and this can affect the collateral ligaments on either side of the ankle or (more commonly) the anterior talofibular ligament, slightly in front and to the outer side of the ankle. Treatment is again is as you have doing, with rest, ice, elevation, compression, then gentle exercise.   This would not cause a pain in the calf.  However if the pain in the calf developed after a days from the injury, then the possibility of a Deep Vein Thrombosis needs to be excluded.  More common in females, in smokers and those on the oral contraceptive  pill, this is potentially serious compliavtion of lower limb injuries.  DVTs are assocaites with hardness, swelling and redness of the calf.  Moving the foot upwards may make the pain worse, but sometimes the problem is difficult to disctinguish from the less serious, but painful gastrocnemius injury.  If there is any doubt, I would consult a doc...distasteful creatures though we are   Saif\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, my first time posting here.  Here are my symptoms, I'm hoping i'll give you a clue:  -  Aching in my upper arms, bicep region - seems to come more from the bone than anywhere else and center close to my elbow. -  It's happening to both arms to the same degree. -  Achiness radiates up to my shoulder and down to my hands  ok now for the weird part.  There is no achiness if I have been doing no activity.  However I have started some jiu jitsu (wrestling) and it hurst significantly after this.  It does not hurt during the activity, only after.  I have pinpointed exactly what makes my arms hurt.  If I get in the position to do a push up (can be on my knees with hands on the floor) and push my hands into the ground while either pushing laterally out to the side or in towards the floor directly under me, my arms instantly start to ache, and hurt significantly more after i stop than when i'm actually doing the motion.  After about an hour of no activity, the pain subsides and does not return till I put this certain kind of pressure on my arms.  So, are the ligaments in my elbow having  trouble withstanding the pressure?  The pain only comes when I'm torqing on my arms sideways.  I can do all the pushups and \"straight\" exercies i want.  It only seems to come when my elbow is stressed laterally.  What in the world is this?\n\n",

    "title": "Knee Dislocation and Blood Work Questions",
    "content": "Ok here it goes, I'm 18 years old and in the last 3 months I've dislocated my knee twice. Most recent occurence was on July 4. My doctor told me to see an Orthopedic Surgean which I wlll be doing but not until the end of this month because he is all booked up. He said that if this happens a 3rd time I could be in very serious trouble and run the risk of completely distroying my knee. The first time this happened I was sitting in a chair with my right leg tucked under me and when I stood up I pushed down on my leg near my knee socket and pop right there in the chair my knee pop out of the joint. It was not my knee-cap it was my actual knee. Luckily I had to just straighten out my knee and it popped right back in. On July 4 however it did not simply pop in place and after 2 minutes of extreme pain I finally managed to get it back in place. My knee is swelling worse every day and since my job requires me to stand on my feet for 6 hours at a time I'm sure its not going to get any better. I've been wrapping it up in the morning with an ace bandage and icing it at night and elevating it. Since I cant get to the doctor until late this month what can I do to help the pain? Why would with minimum pressure it just pop out like this? Could it be because of the complication when i was born with mild cerebral palsy? My second question is when i went to this doctor to get advice on what to do about my knee the one who told me to see an orthopedic surgean told me that my blood pressure was very high. I know the top number was 144 and the nurses were almost in a panic because my pulse was racing too. They took it a total of 8 times during the visit and it never went down only up. He diagnosed me with Hypertension and said that it could be just from my knee. I've never had high blood pressure in my entire life and this has really got me worried. I asked him also about my low body weight. Since my freshman year in high school I've been 5'8 and maxed out at 137lbs and now I'm graduated  still 5'8 but only 111lbs. I eat more than I used to and feel in great physical shape but it worried my doctor a lot and now he has ordered some blood work to be done. The tests are called CHEM 14, CBC, T4 FREE, ESR, and TSH. What do these stand for?  So to sum it all up my knee is swollen and I'm in almost constant pain. I cant gain weight no matter what I do and my blood pressure is now through the roof. Please help in any way you can thanks.  Abel\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Ken,  Flat feet (pes planus in doctors gobbledee Greek), is often associated with pains on the dorsum (top) of the foot.  This is said to be due to the fact that an arch to the foot is said to act like a spring and absorb some of the shocks of walking.  With falttened feet this shock is transmitted more to the joints between the tarsal bones, and the tarsometametatarsal joints.  This leads to arthritis here, and pain associated with this.  The holes in the bones probably represent degenerate subchondral cysts associated with this arthritis. Untreated this may progress to the extent that your feet migrates outwards, so that more and more pressure goes on the instep, with a callosity affecting the underside of the instep over time.  Treatment is with medial arch supports...uncomfortable to begin but useful if you persist with them in the first instance.  Gel ones are nice, custom ones are often better.  If very advanced the choice is between accommodative shoes or surgery...which has variable success rate.  regards  Saif  saif\n\n",

Injection with streoids can improve symptoms for a lot of people. Once you know which ones give the best response, and if you really want to try surgical solutions one can try to do a local fusion arthroplasty.

Part of the reason is the doctor suggested we put him on a low or no fat diet so the gallbladder wont have to push the bile out.  This seems to be working.

    "content": "I have been looking on various ask a doctor sites about knee pain I am struck by how many women my age are asking these questions and it seems that the subtle details of the pain either point toward real injury or just need for better excersize choice.  I haven't seen a description quite like mine so here it goes.  This pain came on slowly at first and is primarily related to using stairs.  I have also noticed over the last few months that my knees crackle when I descend stairs.  Anyways there is no swelling - but I tried anti-inflammatories for a couple weeks just in case it was a tendon out of sorts.  I tried using an ace wrap - that didn't help.  I spent one weekend off of it and used nothing but the elevators at workfor a week - that didn't help.  I tried hamstring exercises - they didn't help.  When I do use stairs ( 2 kids no choice) several times in an hour when I have my knee just slightly bent - I have found if you touch my knew cap on the right sideit  is extremely tender and rates a 20 on the 1-10 scale for pain.  But otherwise under normal walking to touch my knee causes no pain.  I know I've ignored going to the doctor - but until recently I thought it would just go away.  Now I am getting ready to go skiing for 3 days and I am battling the fear of not doing anything with finding out I have to cancel the trip.\n\n",

Some infection of the hand and forearm will cause this gland to become enlarged.  Lymph nodes can be enlarged for a variety of reasons, and many of them quite harmless, but it is worth checking it out with your doc, to find out whether there is something you should worry about or not.  Lipomas and neuromas and other-omas can also produce similar lumps.  Pulsatile lumps are usually vascular.  Sebaceous cysts are usually adherent to skin but not underlying tissue.  There are many to choose from, but as i say, get it checked out with your doc  Saif\n\n",

Some of the abnormalities that may be identified on a bone scan are fractures, bone infections, degenerative bone diseases, bone tumors, tumors that have spread from other parts of the body to the bone (metastatic disease) etc. A \"pop\" such as a fracture would be evident on this particular scan. Probably the reason for a repeat study in six months is to verify the cause. In my opinion, 6 months is not an unusual range, and I would consider it necessary. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Nikky, You never did mention if you are having any symptoms or not now. I did some research on this and this is what I found:  HLA B27 is an inherited gene marker associated with a number of related rheumatic diseases. They share in common, features such as spinal and peripheral arthritis, skin and GI disorders, anterior chamber eye disease, and psoriasis like skin lesions. This gene is found with highest prevalence in patients with ankylosing spondylosis (>90%), reactive arthritis (80%), and patients with the combination of peripheral arthritis and either psoriasis or inflammatory bowel disease (50%). Statistics are, however, sometimes misleading. Although it is true that patients with classic disease will show the presence of the HLA B27 gene between 50 and 90+% of the time, if you randomly take 100 persons with the gene marker, you may find evidence of disease in only 25% of the study group. This suggests that most patients with the gene never develop any clinical rheumatic symptoms of t (Answer provided by the late Dr. Raymond Federman, aka Dr. Bones, who passed away on September 2, 2003. The care of his patients even in retirement was always his joy.)  Here is another one Using the new genetic testing methods, not all HLA-B27 genes are associated with an increased risk of developing ankylosing spondylitis (for example, HLA-B*2706 has not been shown to have an association). It is important to note that this test does not predict the development of autoimmune disease, and should not be used for this purpose.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Quince,  Certainly joint pains can be caused by excessive loaded activity, but I wouldn't ragrd picking up you 3 and 5 year old on odd occassions too much.  I would suggest that if the problem affects multiple joints, and is associated with swelling in these joints, there might be an inflammatory component to your predicament. This is then more a problem of your body reacting against your joints, rather than due to wear and tear, or mechanical stress.  Your doctor, may be able to advise better than I, but other symptoms may include redness and warmth in your joints with the swelling, lumps around your joints that do not subside competely when the swelling goes down, feeling unwell, having good weeks and bad weeks, morning stiffness, dry eyes, etc.  Regards  Saif\n\n",

    "content": "My 13 year old son has been practicing with his baseball team and throwing an awful lot. We noticed that after practice a couple of days ago that his right elbow was swollen and he was unable to fully extend his arm. There is no pain and he has full range of motion with the exception of not being able to extend the arm straight out. We have iced the elbow, given him motrin for the inflamation and the swelling has subsided; however, he is still unable to fully extend the arm.  Is this a case of over working the elbow or something more serious? It does not appear to be an issue with the bursa because it does not appear to be your typical \"Popeye\" swelling.  Thanks for your assistance.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Sportsdad,  Sorry to here about your son...baseball has a lot to answer for; cricket on the other hand is a REAL sport  .  In cricket, bowlers have to keep the elbow straight you see.  This sounds like a repeated stess injury.  Bursitis typically starts on the tip of the elbow, doesnot involve mechanical structures directly, is more related to leaning on the elbows rather than sporting activities, and the \"popeye arm\" your describe are related to secondary inflammation, usually in adults, occassionally related to gout.  The injury that your son sustained may be more related to the common flexor origin (at a guess...).  This is the part ofthe inner side the elbow, where the bulk of the muscles that flex your wrist insert.  Try flexing your wrist, and feel on the inner side of the elbow...if the swelling your son has corresponds to the location of the bulge that appears on your elbow when you flex your wrist, then this is undoubtedly the case.  The treatment you have started is absolutely right, and you may a forearm support for future along with some reduction in the amount of throwing he does for some time.  That doesn't however explain why he is not able to fully extend his elbow.  This perhaps may related to some bicipital tendinitis.  The biceps tendon attached to the forearm in front of the elbow and is the cord like structure directly infront of your elbow.  If this is the area of tenderness or swelling, this may be the cause and may acccount for the limitation in extension.  Other non-specific problems can cause similar symptoms...for most scenarios the treament you have insituted would work very well.  Delay in resturn of full extension can be caused by swelling itself, if it is the joint, by local fibrosis, or rarely by myositis ossificans.  This last is a rare condition, and I wouldn't worry about this right now...suffice it to say that the treatment for this is said to be \"masterly neglect\"...i.e. the less you do to treat it, the better it gets.  Cheers  Saif\n\n",

    "content": "Hi jay,  As always, it is difficult to comment without having you in front of me, but I will try to help.    The fall that you describe could have injured your ankle; you don't specify if you saw a doctor, or had any treatment.  This can lead to post traumatic arthritis, and while this can be evaluated and partly relieved by arthroscopic management, it is unlikely that this procedure will reverse  any damage that has already occured.  This arthritis is a progressive irreversible damage to your joint.  Physio can help, as can arthroscopic surgery and debridement.  If this fails paliative measures include local injections of steroids.  Other treatments include the use of rocker bottomed boots, and if all these fail more radical surgery like arthoplasty or even fusion can be considered as a last resort.  These surgical procedures can have significant complications.  Another problem that can happen  is an injury to your subtalar joint. The injury mechanism that you describe is a way that the os calcis (your heel bone) can be fractured.  This can lead to pain coming from the subtalar joint...a joint below the true ankle joint, that would not be addressed during an arthroscopy.  Problems here are again difficult to treat, and typically give pain more when walking on uneven ground.   You orthopedic surgeon would be best able to identify which is the best joint to address, and I am sure the relevent investigations will indicate the best mode of treatment.    If on the other hand there is no degenerative arthritis, and there is no reasonable explanation for the pain (as your note seems also to suggest), it is possible that you may have something like Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy (RSD, also called  algodystrophy, or complex regional pain syndrome).  This is extremely difficult to treat, and sometimes a pain specialist can help.    Yet another problem that can also be a source of pain is the tarsal tunnel syndrome, and i won't go through a convoluted description of this...a better resource is found at http://www.podiatrychannel.com/tarsaltunnelsyndrome/  The superficial peroneal nerve can be bruised or damaged during arthroscopic surgery, its anatomy is variable, so not always possible to avoid, and it is possible this is the cause of your numbness in your foot...for a detailed study of the various paths see http://www.med.ub.es/~aprats/sae/EJA/EJA_V7_S1_03.pdf.  The upshot of this is that while the nerve is infrequently injured using the normal portals, it can be damaged if it takes an unusual path.  If it hasn't recovered by now, it is probably unlikely to.  hope this helps  Regards  Saif[/url]\n\n",

This site was enlightening http://www.physsportsmed.com/issues/2000/08_00/news.htm, as was this article from \"quackwatch.com\" http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRel ... prolo.html.  Both these are quite old (4 years), so unless new evidence has demonstrated efficacy, I would consider this treatment dubious. There are plenty of sites promoting this suggesting that it is pretty good, most of these are sites that offer this kind of treatment.  Logic would suggest that if your do have a complete tear of the suprspinatus tendon, then injection of sugar will not help.  Steroid injections can sometimes alleviate some symptoms.  If it is a partial tear, injection of sclerosants may help in theory, but there is also probably the risk of converting a partial tear to a complete tear (in deed this is what we warn all our patients before injecting steroids).  I would suggest seeking a second opinion...but as I say, I have no experience of this therapeutic option.  Regards  Saif\n\n",

You description of the pain is a bit confusing for my brain...as I am myself rather aged you see.  you say \"going laterally\"...does this mean on the lateral (outer) side of the feet, or starting on the inner side and heading laterally across your metatarsals?  Most commonly patients present with pain at the balls of the feet when walking as if walking on marbles, there may be thickened skin here, and treatment is initially the use of insoles that raise the transverse arch and abstaining from high heeled shoes for a while.  More drastic treatments exist of course.  A different problem, Morton's metaratarsalgia, is pain actually cause by a pseudo neuroma in between usually the 3rd and 4rth Metatarsals, but occassionally the 2nd and 3rd.  Typically patients say that the feet feel better when walking barefoot than with closed in shoes.  This too can be helped by the insoles I described.  There is no substitue for a doctor examining you and reaching the appropriate diagnosis but i hope this helps  Saif\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there Ms Cobra,  Lots of posibilities from you description, I guess...and if it is swollen after ten days and you still have pain, it certainly is wrth getting further attention to it.  If you can weight bear and lift your leg straight up in the airwhile lying flat, it is unlikely to be serious.  You say you can't straighten it...sometimes fluid in the knee joint can cause this.  It can also be caused by a damaged menscus, although unlikely with your description of the mechanism. A locked knee is one that is stuck at around 20 degrees or so and you can not extend it any further...loose bodies within your knee or a torn meniscus can cause this...as i say unlikely in your case. You say the swelling is on the inside of the knee...does this mean the inner side (on the side nearest the other side), or within the knee the knee joint itself? A sprined medial collateral can cause pain on the inner side of the knee, but again is unlikely with a direct impact injury to the knee.  Most common problem that people get after landing directly on the knee cap, is bruising to the undersurface of the patella.  This causes pain, particularly when going up and downstairs, getting up out of a chair, or kneeling.  It seems not so painful walking, in this situation and patients often walk stiff legged.  Ice packs and gentle quads strengthening exercise help.    As I say if it is not getting better after 10 days, then i would recommend a consultation with your doc would be appropriate.  Regards  Saif\n\n",

I get alot of pain in my hips, lower back, and legs....Is this normal.  I recently had surgery on one of my tendons, due to a snappy PSOAS tendon, and it doesnt seem to have taken the pain away, just would like to know if the pain is ever going to go away, because i am 21 years old and its very hard to cope with all the pain killers i am taking.  Also alot of people had told me that it might be difficult for me to hold a child for 9 months, and it also would be hard to give birth.. I will greatly appreciate a reply from someone who knows about this kind of stuff\n\n",

    "content": "If I understand you correctly what you are describing is called \"snapping hip syndrome\". The internal snapping hip is most commonly associated with an audible and painful displacement of the iliopsoas tendon over bony pelvic or femoral prominences.  Surgical treatment consists of lengthening the iliopsoas tendon.  The pain associated with the disorder is generally believed to be due to the sharp movement of the iliopsoas tendon over the pelvic pectineal eminence, femoral head, or lesser trochanter. Usually two weeks after surgery 14 days after surgery full weightbearing and physical therapy is initiated. Therapy includes stretching of the iliopsoas tendon (hip extension) and progressive, concentric resistive exercises of all the muscles around the hip. Aquatic therapy can also be used. Anti-inflammatory medication is used to help reduce the inflammation and subsequent pain. There are some studies out to show that botox injections into the muscles surrounding the area have helped to alleviate the pain when no other interventions have been effective. Chronic pain in certainly both physically and mentally debilitating and that is why there is now a specialty for doctors to go into that is called \"Chronic Pain Management\"  Seeing a doctor who specializes in pain management might be of benefit also.  I suggest you discuss these  possibilities with your physician and that you ask for a referral to a Chronic Pain Management physician. Best regards, Carolyn\n\n",

Suddenly my ankle started hurting without trauma and has deteriorated over the last months. I also have slight swelling at the side of my ankle.

I am now advised to rest till the acute irritation from physiotherapy passes, but then I'll just be back to where I started, won't I?  Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Flower,  I am sorry to hear about your problems with your ankle.  I see that you have already had an ankle ligament repair in the past.  The swelling on the side of the ankle occurs after strains and sprains of the lateral colateral and the anterior talo-fibular ligament, and as someone suffering from chronic instability you are I guess vulneranble to these.  Three components of any joint determine stability, the bony architecture, the ligaments between the bones, and the muscles that cross the joint.   Instabilty can be due to deficiencies in one or more of these.  In fact is is possible to compensate for the deficiency in one, by augmenting the contribution from another component.  For example, if your ligaments are inherently weak, in theory, by improving muscle power, one can improve the stability of the joint.  Bony deficiencies can be only treated with surgery Acute ligament deficiencies (e.g. due to recent injury) have some limited capacity for healing, but require rest and stabilisation for this.  Longstanding ligament deficiency, or that due generalised joint hypermobility will not respond to this.  Rest and stabilisation however weaken the muscles. Muscle contribution to stability is improved by exercise, but may (possibly) compromise the healing of some of the structures.  Here is the dilemma...do we rest and splint the joint to allow the tissues to heal, but risk the muscles going weak, or do we exercise the muscles to improve their contribution to stability...but risk losing the potential stability gains from the healing of the damaged ligaments.  I would suggest that in the acute phase...shortly after the injury and while the ankle is still sore, we rest and splint the joint (e.g. wear boots, ice, elevate, and avoid high impact activity etc)...this should be limited to say a maximum of 6 weeks.  Then we start building up muscle power, again avoiding high impact activities, and avoiding stretching exercises.  Why avoiding stretching exercises?  Because stiffness is, in your situation, better than instability.   We can focus on range of motion once everything is settled.  Flower, there is no simple solution, I am afraid, and I would suggest tailoring your therapy to your response. I hope this helps,  and hope you have a good Xmas and new year.  yours sincerely  Saif\n\n",

    "content": "Dear saif,  thank you for your quick and extensive response. Unfortunately I don't have an acute sprain at the moment I could allow to heal, because problems have been going on for almost half a year (with severe pain for 3 months now - since I first started physiotherapy, but continuing even after I stopped). I am taking high doses of ibuprofen daily as reccomended by my doctor, but they don't help much. So he decided to splint the leg for now almost 3 weeks already. The first week I was non-weighbearing and therefore not in pain, but now that I put weight on the foot again the pain returned immediately. The swelling was also gone during the time of complete immobilization, but has returned as well to its previous extent. I actually really hope there is a different cause of the pain than just the instability, because I don't know how I will cope: Splinting helps a bit, but only for the time it's on (at night I cannot sleep, as I have no support on the ankle and am in a lot of pain), and building up muscle strength get me in excruciating pain (and through the splinting I lose a bit of the strenght I have every day...).   Thank you so much for you information, it has helpedd me to see into my situation a bit more.  Yours sincerely, flower  P.S. My ligament repair was on the other ankle, which has been fine ever since...\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Bleu,  Will try to help, if I can, it is difficult without having you in front of me.  I would like to focus on three possibilities...but we need to be clear whether this is a global shortening of the limb, and apparent shortening of the limb or a shortening due to a focal pathology.  Global shortening are usually due to something that affects the leg development as a child, often due to a vascular problems.  Similar problems (vascular malformations such as AV fistulas can make a limb abnormally bigger than the other).  Other causes are polio etc. Vascular problems are associated with nephrotic syndrome, but global shortening is not common, in my experience.  Apparent shortening is due to the tilting of your pelvis, perhaps due to a spinal problem.  The tilted pelvis makes one leg appear longer than the other when standing, but when sitting, with the pelvis level and the legs in the same position, the legs look the same length.  This is possible in patients with renal pathology, and perhaps patients who have high dose steroids on multiple occassions in the past.  The scoliosis (curvature of the spine)  may also explain why you sit on a tilt.  Another possibility, and the most common is a focal apthology in the hip.  This can be due to Avascular Necrosis (AVN) of the Femoral Head.  This would give you stiffness and pain in you hip, pain being in the groin, occassionally referred to your knee.  This reduces the length of your leg, (further exaggerated if you have a fixed adduction deformity i.e. if you cannot move your leg outwards).  If you have a fixed flexion deformity associated wih this you may also find that you are having to adopt a tilt to sit properly...  Bleu, these are a ew things to consider...if you have any more questions please do not hesitate to ask...but in the mean time have a merry Xmas, and a happy new year  Saif\n\n",

    "content": "I have 2 questions.  I am an avid computer user, and I cannot seem to get my doctor or anyone else to address this issue.  They tell me the reason I have the pain I have is bad posture, but nothing more do they say.  Anyway, for 5-6 years, I have been disabled, and becaus of this, I spend a lot of my time on the computer, only recently did I realize I have a bad habit of leaning to the left (slouching to the left in my chair, a recliner chair, not an office chair) and due to this, I have a rib on the left side that either is pinching a nerve somewhere, or rubbing against another rib. All I know is, when I lay flat on my back, you can see the height difference if you were to look at my ribcage at eye level, my left side is higher at the bottom of my ribcage.  My question is, what can I do to fix this, and what habits should I change, it hurts a lot when I sit in the chair, is there a certain position I should sit in to counter this, or should I avoid using the computer so much, (that would be hard for me) or can I change something like maybe get a laptop and lay and use it, or should I lean to the right, or get an office chair and sit up straight. Also are there a brace, or braces, to help this, and what would you suggest to east the pain and discomfort.  My second question is that can something like this cause a pinced nerve, and if so, can that result in tingling and numbness (problems) in the same side's arm and shoulder?  Thanks for any response.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Rizanno,  It may be difficult for a doctor to address the issue of you computer avidity .  It is true that slouching in front of a computer aint good for your back.  There is two comments I would make in the light of your story...(you don't say how you have been \"disabled for the last 5-6years\", it may be relevant but lets ignore that for now). There are stools designed to improve posture when you sit in front of the computer, and a recliner may not be the best piece of furniture, but it may be the most comfortable with your disability.  Comment 1) Tilting to one side, and the appearance on one side of the chest being hiher than the other, may suggest a scoliosis...a curvature of the spine.  treatment is the treament of the cause for scolisis...if it is longstanding then it becomes tricky to treat...if it is progressive at your age, then this needs investigation and treatment.  Comment 2) While nerves can be pinched by the ribs the intercostal nerves only supply a thin strip of skin allong your chest wall  not down your arm.  This would imply a problem elsewhere, perhaps in your neck (although rarely a cervical rib...an extra rib  can cause trapping of nerves in your arm)   Hope this helps...  Saif\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Kady,  I guess you could have achilles tendinitis.  The tendon itself becomes tender in this situation and \"taking off\" becomes uncomfortable.   Another possibilty is paratendinitis which is an inflammation of the lining of the tendon.  If the tendon looks swollen and the normal  concavity on either side looks as if it is no longer concave then paratndinitis is more likely.  Tis latter condition is associated with other system inflammatory pathologies, like Rheumatoid Arthritis,  I ahve not heard of it being associated with inflammatory bowel pathology which you seem to have...but i guess that is possible.  Assuming that it is tendinitis rather than paratendinitis, then the cause is said to be mechanical.  The solution is usually interferential treatment such as warm packs, and conversely ice packs and rest.  Anti inflammtories help.  Another thing worth trying is shock absorbent heel cushions that you can get in sports shops.  These reduce the shock of the impact of walking and help to some extent.  Unusually, it is also a condition that seems to be relieved by having a slightly higher heel in the shoe.  Paratendinitis is less common and again can respond to the above treatments...however this is perhaps better addressed in conjunction with the underlying systemic process (if there is one)  Hope this helps  Saif\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Chelle,  Poor Brian...sounds like he does need help (if not being hog tied and dragged to the doctor!) . Falling down a 6-foot hole can give you a lot of potential causes of the pains you describe in your husband. So first we need to be certain that we are looking at the right area of the problem.  Can you describe any bruising? Does it hurt anywhere to press? Is the knee, hip or ankle tender or swollen? Does movement of these joints cause pain? If the answer to all of these is no, then perhaps a prolapsed disc is the problem...as always it is difficult to diagnose with the limited examination that can be done over the internet icon_sad.gif  A \"disc\" is like a bag of jelly that sits between the bones of your spine (the vertebrae). The vertebrae form a channel (called the spinal canal) for the spinal cord and nerves that take signals between your brain and the rest of your body. A prolapsed disc is when the bag of jelly bursts or bulges and presses on the nerves or the cord in the canal. This affects the function of the nerve, so 1) there may be pain in the area where the nerve takes pain signals from (not in the back, but somewhere say in the leg) 2) there may be numbness in parts where the nerve supplies touch sensation to. There may be pins and needles in this area 3) there may be weakness in the muscle groups supplied by the nerve  If the weakness involves the sphincter muscles then there may be difficulty in passing or controling urination, or feeling when urine is apssed. This is an emergency and should be dealt with IMMEDIATELY. If the weekness leads to a foot drop, again this is another criteria for early treatment.  Associated back pain may exist, however, there does not need to be any back pain, although the problem is indeed in the back.  Hope this helps, 'Chelle and hope your hubby gets better, and an Orthopaedic Surgeon is the kind of doctor you (rather your hog-tied husband) needs...

    "content": "Dear Rhoda,  Along with a number of conditions yes, damaged discs can cause numbness in the feet.  More likely if the numbness is spreading from the feet up, then the causes are more likely to be some peripherial neuropathy, including conditions like diabetes.  Numbness caused by discs, or more often in your age group, spinal stenosis secondary to degenerative disease of the spine, can happen, though.  Symptoms include burning pain, aggravated by exercise, helped by leaning forward, weakness in the lower legs. Treatment is dependant on the severity of the disease, but most often it is conservative (i.e. non-operative, with physio etc.)  But I would strongly suggest that other causes of neuropathy are eliminated before committing to this diagnosis.  Regards  Saif\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there Dsssatcom,  Seems like you have a couple of \"problems\".  You say you have had debridement of the elbow.  Why diod you need it Was this in relation to arthritis of the elbow, or a wound?  Which bit of the elbow was involved?     1) Cubital Tunnel Syndrome produces ulnar nerve compression or irritation leading to the numbness in the little finger, and it is said, half your ring finger (there may be some variation), pins and needles in this area, weakness in some of the small muscles of the hand and on occassion, when severe, \"clawing\" of the hand.  The nerve is trapped as it travels around the elbow on its way to the hand...it is the \"funny bone\" nerve.   There are two components to the problem...one is the caused by the nerve being irritated (the pins and needles and pain), and the other caused by actual nerve loss of function (weakness and numbness).  Incidentally, ulnar nerve symptoms can be caused by cubital syndrome, or direct injury to the nerve.  Symptoms may also arise from problems in the neck or in the wrist.  Cubital tunnel syndrome can be treated surgically, but other measures exist.  Night splints that extend the elbow can help reduce symptoms.  Occassionally a local steroid injection may help.  If there is confirmed cubital tunnel syndrome, then the only reason for not doing something is when the conduction study suggests the nerve damage is so extensive that recovery is unlikely.  After a surgical decompression, the irritation symptoms should recover.  The function recovers to a variable extent and sometimes incompletely depending on the amount of damage that has occured already.   If the recovery is incomplete, there is no guarantee that you will get back full recovery, the nerve regeneration rate is said to be one mm a day, so may take months before you notice benefit.  2) The cartilage tear in the wrist I presume refers to the \"triangular fibro-cartlilage\" (TFC), in the wrist joint.  This a small bit of tissue that lies in the wrist joint only the \"pinky\" side of your wrist.  In most people the tears do not cause any symptoms.  In those that do, the symptoms are usually of twinges of pain on certain specific maneouvres, clicking and rarely locking.  The tear does not heal usually, but usually becomes smaller and less problematic, but modern surgical techniques exist to help those in whom it causes sustained problems.  This is usually in the form a arthroscopic debridement (\"key hole surgery\") of  the wrist.  I hope this helps.  It is difficult to be specific without having you in front of me, please let me know if you need any more questions answered   Regards  Saif\n\n",

    "title": "Deformed chest and problems breathing...",
    "content": "Hello,  I am 16, and a male. and have a few questions about chest deformities.  The left side of my chest is smaller than my right side and is an enclave, while the right side is more rounded. I looked up all I could find about this and all I came across was marfan symptom or excavatum. I don't think it is excavatum because it isn't an indention in the mid-section near the sternum, but is lower on the left rather than in the middle. It might be marfan? I have a few symptoms of marfan such as: large stretch marks on the lower back and upper bottom, I'm 5'9\" and only 120 pounds, respiratory problems, long slender toes and fingers, and a narrow mouth. My two concerns are that I have trouble breathing (it seems real tight on the left side when I breathe where the ribs are flatter and a little enclaved) and it is a little bit embarrasing... Do you have any ideas of what this could be or what I could do about it? I don't have medical insurance (neither do my parents), and was also wondering if there was some kinds of cheap alternatives to surgery. Maybe exercises or chest brace?  I really appreciate your help! I couldn't find another site that was free! (:\n\n",

    "content": "Hi David,  I have to confess I have very little experience with chest wall  problems which are normall dealt with Paediatric Surgeons in the UK.  However I will try to help.  It does sound though that you have significant problems and it is certainly very important that you consult with a specialist, as the respiratory performance is compromised in your case.     You are right of course that Marfan's is associated with chest wall abnormalities, along with a host of other problems, some of which you mention.  It is genetic, and you do not mention if any of your relatives have these features and have been diagnosed with Marfan's...although spontaneous cases (without a family history) do occur.  Both Pectus excavatum (depression in the chest wall) and pectus carinatum, (pointy out chest wall) can occur. It is difficult for me diagnose this in you on-line.  The one feature that sticks out in your description is the fact that the chest wall problem is assymetrical (one side affected, the other side not).  Two things come to mind (barring the causes due to surgery or trauma) from my medical school days.  Most common cause of chest wall assymetry is scoliosis (curvature of the spine), and then there is the rarer Poland syndrome when the muscles and the skeleton on one side do not develop properly.  Several other conditions exist in between...not least of which is idiopathic.  David, I firmly believe that you should be seeking at least a consultation with a Surgeon to advise your further, as your breathing is affected...the treatment unfortunately is surgical, and there is, as far as I know no conservative solution.  I have for your information, included a few references from the web, that may be of interest to you, and apologise for my lack of expertise in this field  regards  saif   http://www.hmc.psu.edu/childrens/health ... stwall.htm  http://www.pectusdeformity.com/  http://www.emedicine.com/plastic/topic458.htm\n\n",

Well I stayed in it for about a month, but eventually had to drop out because I could no longer walk due to immobilizing shin splints. The splints started slowly getting worse day by day but I just figured I was weak so I stuck through it until they got so bad I couldn't walk. Anyways, after that experience, I can walk again don't worry, for some reason anytime I run for more than like 30 seconds I start getting shin splints and if I go for much longer they just keep getting worse until I stop running. After these \"continuing\" splints started, I first figured I'd wait and see if they healed by themselves, but it is 9 months later and they aren't getting any better. I was wondering if anyone knew how to fix this issue. Thanks for any help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Shin splints is the name given to pain at the front of the lower leg. The most common cause is inflammation of the periostium of the tibia (sheath surrounding the bone). The injury is an overuse injury and can be caused by running on hard surfaces, running on tip toes and sports where a lot of jumping is involved. If you over pronate then you are also more susceptible to this injury.   In its earliest stages, because it is an overuse injury, rest is mandatory. Applying ice may help if it is very painful. An anti-inflammatory medication may also be required.  In your case since it has been going on for some time I would advise:   Wearing shock absorbing insoles in shoes.  Maintaining fitness with other non weight bearing exercises.  Applying heat and use a heat retainer after the initial acute stage, particularly before training.  If the symptoms should continue still, then you should see a sports injury specialist who as you may need a brief rehabilitation program. He can also help analyse running style for over pronation.   Best regards,\n\n",

You really have to have a good pair ofrunning shoes  Also, before doing a sport or any activity that involves the legs, try to stretch your tibialis anterior muscles, the muscles attached to your shin by pulling down your foot as if making a tip-toe.  Hold the stretch for at least 30 seconds until you feel some \"stretch\" on the front side of your leg.  Repeat that several times.  Then stretch your calf muscles.  After a sprint or any running activity, apply ice directly on the painful site for 10 minutes.  Do this with and wothout pain.      Ciao!\n\n",

    "content": "Lets say a patient comes in claiming he injured his shoulder, maybe even thinks he dislocated it. What is proper procedure for Dr to do? Does he leave and tells nurse to administer medication, or does he examine the injured area by placing his hands on it, or does he just walk away and allows meds to be administered? What would a normal Dr do? When my baby had an injured arm, the Pedi placed his hands on baby and examined him. Don't you think this was what he was supposed to do? How come the same was not done to my husband? The Dr just walked away, nurse came in and administered med, causing husband to throw up. After 6 hours, Dr came back said to husband nothing wrong....go home. What's wrong with this picture? We are talking the infamous UTMB here, located in Galveston.

The Dr or assistant never once looked at my husbands shoulder, never touched it, etc. After husband woke up they claim xray showed that the shoulder went back in place alone. Today is now Tuesday. Husband has swelling on both hands, and ankles. Is in alot of pain on the shoulder he injured, he says it feels like it is still out of place even though he has had it in a sling since Sunday when he left the ER. What can be going wrong? I was there, they never once looked at his shoulder or put thier hands on it to see if it was out of place. Are they negligent? Please email me asap. mhomrighaus@houston.rr.com Husband went to the famous UTMB hospitol.\n\n",

    "content": "Ok, so I was at a party and happened to be in a fight. Yes, I'am not one who gets in fights but for some reason it happened. I was talking to a friend and a kid from my right back side punched me in the side of the throat. I think it might have been an uppercut becuase it also grazed my jaw bone. Anyways that is the injury. I have soreness in the right side of my neck and jaw, I noticed 3 red dots in the center of my neck and I' am not sure what those are from. They are very small and placed in a v kind of, but are spaced apart about a half a centimeter. Anyways I see no external bruising, but I assume there is brusing because it is sore.   My concern is not my neck bones or jaw ect.. My concern is internal bleeding. I have worked myself up over this I'am sure but for some reason I needed to look up symptoms of internal bleeding and I saw the red dots (well this was under a subcategory of brusing, may be it was just a sign of a small bruise) Anyways, my question is, could a punch to the neck cause internal bleeding? If so how could I tell without seeing a doctor (which I most likely will be). Would I be cold? This happened Tuesday night at around 12 a.m. If it were a very small cut would I notice anything? Any information or ideas would help thanks.\n\n",

Costochondritis [the inflammation of the joints between the ribs and the breast bone] is what comes to my mind, but I could be wrong. If that is the case, analgesics should help. Reduced stomach ulcer disease is noted during pregnancy due to reduced acid secretion by stomach. If there is relief for your pain with antacids, it is a pointer to stomach acidity/ulcers.  Hope this helps.  Warm regards,  -Bill\n\n",

    "title": "Serious Recurrent Pain in Left Shoulder/Arm",
    "content": "Almost a year ago I started work as a waitress... working 12 hour shifts.  I was using muscles I hadn't preiously used that often and would be sore at the end of the day.  I worked there to 'help out' for about a month.  Afterwards, I started getting very bad pain in my left shoulder.  Sometimes it even radiates down my arm.  When I asked my doctor she said it was a pulled muscle and could take up to a year to heal.  Well, it's been a year and I still get the pain... worse now than when it started.  Sometimes it is really excruciating in the mornings probably because of the way I had slept, but it also hurts pretty badly even if i am sitting at my desk at work for awhile.  Could it still be a pulled muscle and taking it's time healing??  Or could this be a pinched nerve?  I was lifting heavy (30 to 40 pounds) at my waitressing job.  Please help.  My arm and shoulder hurts so bad sometimes I want to cry.\n\n",

I haven't been able to sleep for 3 days because I can not find a comfortable position. Iam scared that it could be the hepitis C although I have never had any problems with this before. I have no energy and feel tired all the time\n\n",
