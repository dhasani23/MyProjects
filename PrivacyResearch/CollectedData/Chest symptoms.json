    "content": "Hello Hardrockalex,  You are correct that Augmentin treats a number of respiratory bacteria (most, actually).  Having been on Augmentin, it is quite unlikely that your symptoms are from a bacterial infection like bronchitis or tracheitis.  I suspect your symptoms are from a viral infection.  There are countless viruses that can affect the upper airways (the trachea, bronchials, etc.)  Some of these viruses (such as parainfluenza, metapneumovirus, bocavirus, influenza, RSV, etc.) can cause prolonged cough, some upwards of 4-8 weeks.  Antibiotics are ineffective against these infections.  The only thing that will help is time.  If you are slowly but steadily getting a little better then you probably need to give it more time.  If you start getting worse I would recommend you see your doctor again since viral infections do increase the chance of a subsequent bacterial infection (especially once you are done with the Augmentin).  Best wishes.  Hopefully your cough will subside soon.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Vanishing lung",
    "content": "Hi, \"Vanishing lung syndrome\" is an uncommon disorder, characterized by very large bullae [air-filled, thin-walled (<1mm) spaces in the lung, resulting from progressive destruction of alveolar tissue].  The bulla often occupies more than a third of a lung. Most cases occur in young men who smoke cigarettes. Bullous disease affects the upper lobes predominantly and as they enlarge, they compress the adjacent lung centrally. They can predispose to formation of a pneumothorax.  Because of their large size, coupled with the compressed lung results in the radiological appearance of \"vanishing lung\". Paraseptal emphysema and subpleural bullae are seen in virtually all the patients. Most also have separate centrilobular emphysema affecting the involved lung and the opposite uninvolved lung as well.  There have been reports of vanishing lungs in cannabis smokers. It has been reported in younger cannabis smokers who have seldom, if ever, smoked normal cigarettes. It is more likely in heavier cannabis smokers. How exactly cannabis smoking leads to vanishing lung is not clear. It might not be so much to do with the content of the drug as with the way it is smoked. Individuals who smoke drugs tend to take much deeper breaths and hold it in for longer periods than one would with common tobacco smoking. This condition has also been reported in heroin smokers.  One acute complication that may occur in individuals with this condition is a pneumothorax. This can cause pleuritic type of pain. This must be excluded in your case. Therefore you must consult your doctor with this in view. Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I have been experiencing sternum pain for the past 2 years.  Every time I forcefully sneeze, cough, or move certain ways I feel intense pain in the middle sternum.  My doctor dismissed my symptoms to over exercising after my EKG came back normal.  I have been dealing with this ever since, but then I started to experience a new symptom, an occasional 'cracking' sound (similar to knuckles popping) when the pain happens.        I went back to my primary doctor and he pushed around on my stomach and near my rib cage (that was a little sore), sent me off to have a chest X-Ray and concluded I 'might' have a hiatal hernia.  He referred me to a general surgeon and off I go in a couple of weeks.         My questions are, does anyone think I should see a specialist before a surgeon?  Could this be something other then a hernia, if it is a hernia, is it necessary to repair and what are the risks if it is not repaired?  AND.. What in the world could the 'cracking' noise that happens occasionally with the pain?       I have been reading that hernias are common and generally not that problem-matic, so I'm confused why my doctor would refer me to a surgeon with so little pretesting of his own.        I'm a 30 year old female, 5 foot 2 inches and 153 pounds.  No allergies, past surgeries, or illnesses, non smoker/drinker.  I have been diagnosed with IBS and GERD, and have occasional asthma. ....Any thoughts are appreciated! Thank you!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Sternum pain/cracking, possible hiatal hernia",
    "content": "Hi, There are 12 pairs of ribs. Costal cartilages of ribs 1-7 connect to the sternum; costal cartilages of ribs 8-10 connect to the costal cartilage of rib 7; costal cartilages of ribs 11 & 12 do not articulate anteriorly (\"floating ribs\").  Sternocostal joints involving ribs 2-7 contain thin joint capsules and therefore are synovial joints.Costovertebral joints are also of the synovial type.  Cracking or popping sounds originating in certain joints is a well known but not well understood phenomenon (deliberate knuckle-cracking, for instance). Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain this phenomenon and the most plausible seems to be the the \"cavitation\" hypothesis, which proposes that cavities of partial vacuum form momentarily in the synovial fluid of synovial joints and then rapidly collapse, producing a sharp sound.  \"Vacuum phenomenon\" seen sometimes in radiology of the spine is also attributed to formation of gases in degenerating discs.  The cracking sounds that you are experiencing, may be related to joint cracking, possibly originating from one of the synovial joints of the thorax.It may not be directly related to a hiatus hernia(even if present). Good luck!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Electric-like pinch in my lower left ribs",
    "content": "Hi, By your description, you have almost excluded the \"typical\" pain of pleural origin.Chest pain of cardiac origin needs to be entertained even in young individuals. I will confine myself to discussing in brief a couple of relatively uncommon, and often overlooked causes of chest pain.  Thoracic spine is relatively stable and well protected from trauma due to several anatomical reasons.  While a majority of individuals with back pain have abnormalities confirmed by MRI, studies on healthy young adults have shown that as many as 30% of individuals without pain also have abnormalities that can be seen on an MRI scan. (Magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine in people without back pain. N Engl J Med 331:69-73, 1994.)  \u201cThoracic discogenic pain syndrome\u201d: in this condition, lateral protrusion of a disc (nucleus pulposus) causes it to exert pressure on a segmental spinal nerve, causing pain.This may affect single or multiple discs.There is another emerging, as yet not fully understood entity called as  \u201cchemical radiculitis\u201d. It is postulated by some that a disc rupture causes the extruded nucleus pulposus to release certain chemical mediators that spread out and cause irritation of the neighboring nerve roots without actually causing physical pressure on the nerve.  Thoracic discogenic pain, although not common, has been seen to occur in young atheletes (especially those involved in sports that involve sudden, repititive bending and twisting of the spine).  The mechanism of injury can be of two types. - acute direct or indirect trauma, or - repeated minor trauma (overuse injury).  The pain is often radicular in type, radiating along the distribution of the spinal nerve in question.It may be accompanied by motor or autonomic dysfunction in the area of distribution of the involved segmental nerve.   Studies have shown that people who smoke are at greater risk for developing degenerative disc disease, as are people who work in certain occupations. Moreover, a familial tendency may be seen in some individuals.  Diabetic peripheral neuropathy usually is of the \"distal\" type, causing symptoms in the extremities. But, less commonly, it can involve the thoracic region (diabetic proximal neuropathy). When it involves the thoracic segmental spinal nerves, it can cause radicular pain in the distribution of the thoracic spinal nerves. I hope this information is of help. Good luck!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: former cocaine use and potential heart damage",
    "content": "Hi, With the lifetime use of cocaine rising, adverse reactions to cocaine use have resulted in a situation wherein it has become necessary to consider cocaine related complications in the differential diagnosis of various disorders, particularly ischemic events in young adults.  The cardiovascular complications include, - angina pectoris, - acute myocardial infarction, - arrhythmias, - accelerated atherosclerosis, and - cardiomyopathy.  Cigarette smoking causes vasoconstriction of the coronary arteries through an -adrenergic mechanism similar to that of cocaine. Several recent studies have shown that the deleterious effects of cocaine on myocardial oxygen supply and demand are exacerbated substantially by concomitant cigarette smoking. This combination markedly increases the myocardial oxygen demands, while simultaneously decreasing the diameter of diseased segments of the coronary arteries.This predisposes to myocardial ischemia.  A recent survey has suggested that 9 million people in the United States abuse  ethanol and cocaine simultaneously. Among those with a history of co-abuse of multiple substances who present at the emergency departments, the co-abuse of cocaine and ethanol is the most common. It is perhaps the second most common combination in patients who die of substance abuse, accounting for more than 1000 deaths per year(The most frequent multiple-drug deaths involve various combinations of opiates/opioids, cocaine, and alcohol). The co-abuse of cocaine and ethanol appears to be associated with higher rates of disability and death than either agent alone. Persons who co-abuse cocaine and ethanol produce cocaethylene, a metabolite synthesized by hepatic-transesterification. Similar to cocaine, it blocks the reuptake of dopamine at the synaptic cleft, thereby possibly potentiating the systemic toxic effects of cocaine. At autopsies, cocaethylene is often detected in persons who died of cocaine and ethanol toxicity.  During a myocardial infarction,some of the myocardium gets infarcted and that damage is permanent.The other complications such as cardiomyopathy may recover to an unpredictable extent following complete abstinence from the abused substance.

    "title": "Re: chest pain after electric shock",
    "content": "Hi, The passage of current through the body and its effects depend on a number of variables. The amount of current: The minimum current humans can feel is considered to be about 1 milliampere (mA).Currents from 1-5 mA, give rise to 'shocks'. Sustained Curerents of 30-200 mA can result in death.  Current density: current per unit area is known as current density. Small currents passing through a large surface area of the body may not be felt, but the same current passing through a finger or a toe(smaller cross-sectional area=greater current density), causes greater heating and may result in burns.  Frequency of the current: domestic mains supply is generally 50-60 Hz. Alternating current (AC) of this frequency is particularly dangerous for the heart. Even cardiac standstill may occur. Resistance: wet skin is much less resistant to current than dry skin. Duration of the current: longer the duration, mor is the damage caused.  There are broadly 2 types of electric shock. - the more common \"macroshocks\"- wherein the current reaches the heart after passing through the body and - \"microshocks\"- wherein the current directly reaches the heart from the source(ex; via transvenous pacing wires), without having to pass through the resistance of the tissues. In these instances, even very minute amounts of current can cause ventricular fibrillation. Macroshocks are more commonly seen in the domestic and work environments.  The injuries caused by electric current may be of two types. - due to the current actually coursing through the body, or - \"arc\" burns or flash burns (akin to lightning) affecting the surface of the body(internal injuries may also occur depending on the severity of the arcing).  The effects on the heart range form sudden cardiac death to involvement of the conducting tissues of the heart which may present even years following the episode.  Luckily, you seem to have come out of it with only moderate damage but, it is better to consult your doctor and have yourself assessed(including an EKG). Also, it is important to have your tetanus immune status reviewed and updated. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi  I have been experiencing at least once a week this dull pain around and mostly at the center of the chest since about 6 - 8 months. Since I am otherwise healthy, with no reported illnesses (as every year I go for physical check / blood tests - results being NORMAL all through since last 10 years).   When it began I also experienced fast heart beats during nights sometimes (and only during nights when I woke up in between the sleep - which has been my habit for 20 years). Besides that this pain. The pain is dull, can last for time windows of 30 mins (which has been common) and during that windows I would experience this dull pain that last 2 seconds to 10 seconds at max. Few times I observed this pain on the back, exactly opposite of the center of the chest. It is just a pointed area. There is no pain observed any where else. When I raise my hands I feel relief during that time. I observed that I am getting this pain 1 day after I do Yoga exercises. When I stopped doing exercises for a week or two to observer results, I am greatly normal. I stopped exercises to contact doctor.  I contacted a doctor with my family history (father - heart attack at 67, died of hammarrage at 86, mother died of severe stomach pain in 3 days at 82, brother - heart attack at 66 - doing good now at 73; for a family of 10 brothers and sisters that we are, no other incidences) and above symptoms reports, doctor ran EKG, plain stress test and considered the pain might be due to muscle inflammation. Doctor gave Meloxicam 7.5mg - 1 tab/day - for 15 days. I started my exercises and I got the pain, when doctor increased the dose to 2tab/day - I continued for 15 days, without exercise. When I resumed exercise, I get the pain. I stopped exercises, stopped medicine - as I read that this medication has side effect on GI track and also for the reason the pain is certainly bearable, though causing my concern when I experience the same.  I strated taking anti-inflmmatory food like garlic, ginger, turmeric, almonds, peanuts, spinach, carrot etc, making each of my food in take (breakfast, lunch, dinner) on an average anti-inflammatory. After 1 month of this food, no exercise, I did only couple of exercises - trikona asanas - bending the torso over waist on left and right for 2 days. I experience pain again, but like always 12 - 16 hours after the exercise. I realize that sleeping on my left side causes the pain, not on right side. This pain now longer for window of 1 hour (only when I am awake) comes and goes for 1 -2 mins. When turned on left, it will start _ when it starts -after 10mins, then last for 1 hour at lengths of 1-2 mins of pain.  While I can bear the pain, go with anti-inflammatory food, I am concerned if something else is going in my body around chest (I am convinced this is not cardiac) / lungs. Is it common for the inflammatory pains to reveals 8 - 16 hours after the exercise?   Regards\n\n",

You say that you are practicing certain yoga exercises.Ideally, these have to be performed under supervision of experts(at least initially). Not all yogic exercises are suitable for everyone. If a particular \"asana\"(posture) is found to be unsuitable for a given individual, alternative postures may be considered to achieve the desired benefits.There are 'asanas' suitable for various age groups.  Your pain has quite a few features of a \"radicular\" pain- a radiculopathy (nerve compression) originating from the thoracic spine.Muscular pain presenting so intermittently and for such short durations is rather unusual.  You should ideally consult an orthopedic surgeon and get assessed.You may also discuss with your yoga instructor to discuss your symptoms and if need be switch over to an alternative 'asana'.

Are you suggesting additional cardiac tests? I am not clear.  Yoga: I took yoga lessons under Guru in 1994 and have been practicing the asanas since then without any problem.   I am intrigued by this pain patten. It always lags the exercise by 8 - 16 hours (approximately). Is this common for inflammatory or cardiac situations? While waiting for your guidance, I would still consider your recommendation and so would consult my physican for a follow up visit.  Regards\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, You are right in saying that a cardiac cause has been excluded. I mentioned it as a routine, as an important information to be useful to the other readers of the forum.  In my practice, I have come across occasionally, even yoga teachers with similar or related complaints(may well be exceptions). You must be aware that even the most well trained athletes at times succumb to sprains, strains or other injuries, even  during routine practice sessions.  Your symptom may well be a due to myalgia or a muscle inflammation. i was only suggesting some of the differential diagnoses for your complaint without actually examining you!  Hope you will get well soon. Good luck!\n\n",

    "title": "Post Chronic Bronchitis- Health not Returning",
    "content": ".  Recently I visited an immediate care facility due to heavy wheezing and 15% lung capacity due to severe bronchitis symptoms.  Upon testing my lung strength, I blew a 300 on the testing device.  I was given 2 albuterol updrafts, and this increased my testing amount to 750, and was prescribed a Z-Pack (Azithromycin 250mg), and a Symbicort inhaler to use 2 puffs a day, twice a daily.     It has been 1 week since I have finished my Z-Pack, and I am still having problems.  Any work that elevates my heart rate, or sends me into colder areas, are causing me to cough heavily and make my lungs feel like they still have 10-15% amount of mucus or other fluids in them.     Please, any information or ideas would be helpful.  I have no health insurance so it is difficult for me to constantly see a doctor.  My only other attempts to alleviate this have been steam baths and a cold air humidifier in my room.  Thank you.\n\n",

    "title": "Left Side Chest Pain that radiates",
    "content": "Hello all.  I am a 21 year old white  male, about 5'10 and 225lbs (used to be 260!). For the past three months or so, I have had chest pains on the left side of the chest, mainly above the nipple but sometimes i have discomfort all around it. On some occasions the pain travels to my shoulder and down the left arm, to the point where I get pains in my left hand. Also, the pain is sometimes present in my back, around the left shoulder and below near the blade. A few times the pain spreads to the right side of my chest. It doesn't feel like indigestion, and I don't have any problems with exotic foods. Sometimes it hurts to breathe, other times I feel like i am wheezing (I have asthma), with other times  it is hard to get up in the morning due to the pain.   I have been to the doctor two times so far for this. The first time he sent me to get a CATscan (or CTscan, i forget the right term for it) which came up negative for anything but harmless bone tumors (osteocondroma) that have calcified near my joints, which the doctor said was the result of them just being there as I grew up. He then told me that it was chest wall syndrome, most likely a result of inflammation in the chest wall that takes a while to go away (though I don't remember injuring my chest, perhaps stretching wrong?). He also said that this was not heart related. I am going to see him again as the pain continues, but after another bad habit of looking up symptons online, I figured I would try this forum out as well.   I have mildly high blood pressure, which seems to be a reoccuring theme on both sides of the family, and for which I take metoprolol, which has helped keep it down to normal levels.. Also, I have Asthma, but have not had a serious attack for many years now, and I do not take any medication for it. Finally, I have migraines for which I take either Naproxen or 800mg Ibuprofen (high doses for those really powerful ones, I try not to take these unless it is like last resort.) As a college student, I am constantly facing stress and I could probably work on stress management, but anxiety is something that I find myself dealing with more often than not, which can make the pain even worst.   Thank you for your time.\n\n",

A person your age isn't old enough to have coronary disease yet; it takes many many years for the plaque to build up enough to block arteries.  It does sound like \"chest wall syndrome\", it is very common and does take a while to heal.  Your ibuprofen is the best thing you can take.  If it hurts with taking a deep breath, it definitely isn't your heart.  Do you also have neck pain?  Neck pain can cause pain in the arm(s) as well, the nerves for the upper body originate in the neck.  This would also be relieved by ibuprofen.  You do sound like you have a stressful life at this point, with anxiety, and you are exactly right, it does tend to make the symptoms worse.  Perhaps you can talk to your doctor about something to help you with that.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Ilovepatients,  Just got back from my doctor's appointment. He has acknowledged the pain increase and says this is most likely due to physical exertion, as the inflammation takes a long time to go away.. He has not given me an ECG, but to cover all options and to \"calm me down\", he has requested that I have a stress test done. My blood pressure is lower than it was (a few points under the \"high\" classification) and I lost another 3 pounds. I told him that in my line of work (haha) I can't help but be stressed, which is why he decided upon having me get a stress test done, just to be sure. He told me to stop taking Ibuprofen for the time being and started me up on \"Lidoderm\", Lidocaine patches that, according to my resources, is used for musle related pains. I've had the patch on for about three hours already but I haven't really noticed any difference. Of course, it could take longer. This pain is almost ignorable if I really get myself involved in something, but it is there to greet me when I am done with whatever task I was doing. I have also noticed that the number of bowel movements that I have per day has increased to about 3-5 times instead of 1-2.  Again, the doctor says that this is most likely stress related, that I am working myself up to it, resulting in the extra bloated feeling that, when combined with chest inflammation, makes me worry even more.  So, given the latest symptoms, it seems to be down to four things: Chest inflammation (doc bets on this), Heart related issues (doc seriously doubts it), a severe case of acid reflux (no nausea or heartburn sensation, belching, etc, so my doc doubts this as well)), and stress (doc says this is probably making the chest inflammation worst). I have been doing a lot of exercise (cycling is my favorite at the moment) but I have been wary of even doing such things with my chest feeling the way it is.   I am not sure if my family qualifies for true \"heart disease\" other than high blood pressure. My grandfather died of lung cancer due to smoking and working in a place with carciogenic materials. My grandmother had minor strokes, but they were not \"heart related\" and her death was not heart related (kidney failure, if I remember). On my mother's side, however, they seem to be qualified for heart disease. My grandfather had a heart attack, but he was a hardcore smoker and drinker. He beat lung cancer and recovered, however, only to die of a blockage that, from what I gathered, ruptured and his lungs filled up with blood. My grandmother also died of a heart attack; she was only like 53, but she was a compulsive gambler that resulted in diehard smoking and stress. My dad has no heart related diseases. However, he had contrated some sort of virus about 8 years ago that enlarged his heart, and almost put him on the heart transplant list. He takes like 20 pills a day. My mom has high blood pressure as well, and Crohn's disease, but the latter is not heart related. However, it could be related to acid reflux disease from what I hear, which is also another possible cause of my pain (though not yet proven, as I don't have \"heartburn\" or diarrhea. However, the doctor said that the pain could be a form of heartburn as well.  I must say that my personal investigation of my symptoms has not left me feeling any better (I can't help doing research, what I am going  to college for as a historian and a teacher haha). Currently the pain is as previously described, with a fatigued feeling in my left shoulder and arm. Hopefully the stress test will put my fears at ease, but with the multitude of pages that is my family medical history, I cannot help but wonder, you know?  Thank you for taking your time to read this. Your words, along with the doc's words, help calm me down a lot (though I am still stressed!). Thanks!\n\n",

It used to cool down when I went to bed and rested, but now it takes longer before it cools off. Doctors have been or (refuse to) give me a reason for it.    I put an ice pack on it to cool it off which works nominally.  What could be causing it?  and what can I do about it.  (I KNOW I HAVE LIVED OVER THE NORMAL LIFE SPAN AND CAN TAKE IT IF ITS NOTHING THAT CAN BE CURED)....  One of my graanddaughters gets married in September and I want to last long enough to make her wedding...(grin). Have great genes and expected to live to 100 but smoking (seems as if everyone in my generation comes down with COPD) had its way.   So, what can I do about the warm left side.  I may have aggravated something, as some doctors advised me to use my left arm and doing that may have been the cause.     I feel for all the young people on this FORUM that are having serious problems and I hope them all the best of luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Czar1206 I am 27 year engineer working in south korea, After reading your article I found myself to be categorized with the same symptoms. In fact I am facing the pain since eight months now. I had anxiety attack almost an year ago and after getting the treatment I tried to change my life style to adjust with stress. I have muscular physique and I am a freak for gym. It\u2019s been around 5 years to me since I am doing regular exercise however this pain has destroyed my schedule and I have been irregular since eight months. I had been to many medical care centers. A famous heart specialist who did ECG, treadmill test and blood test and concluded that the pain isn\u2019t due to heart disease. However I am not relieved. The pain is constant in my left hand and the heart area. I feel the heart muscles are being pulled. Also it radiates on the upper left side of the back. I also notice my left hand being colder than my right hand at times. After being assured by the doctor, I thought the pain was because of my too much of exercise or some wrong exercise that I did or due to work stress that is troubling me a lot. I find myself stressed due to workload most of the time. About three or four months ago I was too scared due to pain and was constantly thinking about it and slept in the same emotional condition in the late night. I felt as if I had an heart attack in the sleep and when it stopped I woke up after five to ten minutes due to hesitation. I am still not sure if it was a night mare or a serious attack. I ran to the hospital the next morning and the same kind of tests were done including the ecg and blood test which came out to be normal. The doctor then suggested me to see a psychologist and told me that this all because of your too much of thinking about it. My life style is hectic and more over I watch movies, news etc. up to late night as late as 12 to 1 am. Almost every night (except few). I am a Muslim by religion and hence have a habit of fasting for complete month of Ramadan. I did the same for the month of September. Luckily in Ramadan my daily schedule gets revised and I sleep early in night around 9 pm and get up early morning. That completes an 8 hour sleep. And more over there is regular praying etc. that keeps the stress out. Further during the fasting month I rarely do exercise. I found that when I followed this habit the pain slowly disappeared to nil. That really made me relieved. However after Ramadan I had again started my regular late night lifestyle and the situation came back again. I am now seriously thinking the reason for such pains is stress and sleeping late night make it worse. I feel if one sleeps early and gets up early those results in a perfect metabolism and health.  For your information I also take whey protein powder for exercise and muscle gain. I am an emotional person and think s a lot about my health which sometimes makes the situation worse. I think the solution to your and my problem is as follows. a.\tSleep early and get up early (eight hours at least) b.\tAcquire a life style which will make you feel stress free and try to help others or get involved in religious activities that will bring peace of mind. c.\tIf you do exercise check out each of your exercises if you do them correct. Especially the bench press machine (not the free rod and plates but the machine). Sometimes the machine is not correctly set or spacing of your left hand is lesser than your right hand (I have noticed this fault in our gym). Also use safe loads in gym. I wish you and me find the easy solution to our problems Insha\u2019Allah.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Everyone,       I am 27 male and I am glade I have come across this post. As I was reading through these post each one has the same symptoms that I am having. Recently my wife and I went to the movies to watch the new Iron Man 2 movie and I began to have similar things happen to me. When the movie started I felt a little dizzy, then about 20 min. later my left arm and chest started radiating heat, felt like it was getting hotter and hotter. Then my left hand felt cooler than my right hand. It also felt like I was having muscle cramps/twitches in my chest and my left shoulder, and the back of my arm. At the same time my heart felt like it was going to pound out of my chest, but I think that was A little panic setting in because I seriously thought I was having a heart attack or a stroke. We left about 1/4ths through the movie and went to the ER. The Doctor did an EKG, Blood Test, Urinary Test, and a Chest X-Ray. They said everything was clear nothing showed up. I told them I was trying to cut out sodas and drinking more water. The Doc Assistant said there was no real reason that the soda would cause this. They asked if I was stressed about anything and I told them If I was I don't know about it. He said it could be stress and that caffeine may have had an effect but more than likely it didn't. After Visiting the ER I went to my Family Doc. and he looked at my medical record from the ER visit and he said everything checked out good and asked me the same question, \"Are you stressed about anything?\" The only thing I was stressed about at this point is trying to figure out whats going on, because this just recently started about a month ago. He recommended me trying a 2 Week Event Monitor that way when/if I had these symptoms again I can record whatever is going on. I am still waiting to hear back from him about any of the result and I also had a Echo-cardiogram (not sure if that is the right name for it, it's where they did a sonar of my heart) done too. Still waiting for the results from that. My Doc. didn't seemed to concerned about this situation. Praying about this and keeping in mind that the Doc didn't seemed to worried about it has helped me not think about what is going on, but it still comes and goes. I like to think it's just heart burn or maybe a pinched nerve causing the random radiating sensation, muscles twitching, and pains. The only thing I haven't seen any say that I have experienced while having this is sometimes the left side of my head feels that hair raising feeling like I just got goose bumps. I try to watch what I eat and Do when these random attacks happen that way I can try to pinpoint anything that could be triggering but so far nothing. Maybe one of you have heard or figured something out. I am also drinking 100% juice drinks and water and every once in a while I'll have a soft drink.\n\n",

    "content": "I find it relieving to see that I am not alone... I am a 21 year old male. I have been having Chest  pains since late April 2010. My signs and symptoms are similar to what I have heard. It is the worst in the mornings when my muscles are the tightest. Initially, when I experienced these symptoms, I felt it on my left side of the chest close to the sternum, but it later migrated to the right upper side of the chest, near the sternum and has been there ever since. The pain surfaces when I retract my shoulder blades and stand/sit up straight. If i take a deep breath in that position, the pain intensifies. The pain radiated to my mid-back a few times which really made it difficult to breath even in a relaxed posture. Although I have a history of untreated back pain, the pain is moderate and is mainly lower back pain. I find that my upper back pain correlates with stress.           However, I do not find the chest pain correlating with stress, but I will pay more attention to that. I do not believe it is caused by any heart diseases since I am a health and workout freak. My EKG turned out great. I still need my blood work done, but I am expecting that I am also fine in that area. I meet the RDA values in the fruit pyramid. Though on average my salt intake is 500-1000 mg over, I believe I sweat everything out due to the intense exercise I put myself through, or used to put myself through... I have listened to medical doctors to stop exercising for the time being. I am thinking the pain originating from my muscularskeletal system. I know the X-ray did not pick up anything. Though I would like another opinion of those slides. I am hoping to get a MRI and CAT scan done soon.            Though I am tempted to workout, I do not... and it is killing me. My family doctor suggested me to see a rheumatologist. I hope that she will help me fix this problem. It is inhibiting my performance at work and school. It is only a matter of time before I lose my mental and emotional stability to withstand this lifestyle change. I do not want to give up, but reading these forums is not giving me much hope. Especially, the idea of these symptoms lingering for several years. I am prepared to exercise through this pain even though that is not the smartest idea... Nevertheless, I am trying to remain strong to fight this, but it difficult when doctors do not know the cause of these symptoms and their treatments yield little positive results.         One doctor, assured me that my pain was caused by my long term untreated back pain and the multiple knots in my entire back. It did seem like a logical diagnosis and she recommended me to see a chiropractor to relax my muscles and realign me. However, I am wary of her diagnosis though it may be on the right track. Her thought process may have been biased since I later found out that she, herself was a Chiropractor assigned in the ER. Her diagnosis would be accurate for my friend who has constant back pain with occasional intervals of chest pain occurring a few times a week. However, symptomatically, my case is nearly the opposite. I have moderate back pain with constant chest pain causing occasional mid-back pain. If my Rheumatologist is not successful in her treatment, then I will consider seeing a Chiropractor. Although, the idea of seeing a chiropractor is turning me away since the general thought accompanies the idea that \"once you see a chiropractor, you will always see a chiropractor\", I will do what it takes to get rid of this pain.            I also have a habit of researching my symptoms, I ran across costalchrondritis, which is an inflammation of the rib cartilages. However, I have every symptom except a major one which is tenderness with touch.            I have taken muscle relaxers with ibuprofen which has made the pain better, but it is still present. I ice it after any type of activity that I think might have put stress on that area. I also try to stretch 2x/day usually in the morning and before bedtime. Though my pains have gradually improved after its initial onset, It seems like my symptoms are not going to dissipate any more than it already has. If anyone discovers how to get rid themselves of this pain, please take the time to  email me at artngo@gmail.com.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello CSD83  Your incidence at the Iron Man 2 in theatre reminded me of my personal incidence. You may be wondering what could go wrong you felt you were almost a heart attack, when doctors team said every test result is normal. You may need to consider your emotional setting. Narrating my incident is not to belittle your experience or psychology, but just a perspect what our psychology can do what we assume phisiology should the source for. I almost thought I woule be mad man in next moment, and continued a period of  2 -4 years of life suffering from that one-minute incident.  Symptoms different, in 2000 ( I was having some anxiety certainly about my job performance and what-if I lose job, then family scenarios - to briefly summarize my anxiety), I woke in my bed one night, my wife was sleeping soundly by my side. Thoughts were running through my mind, and suddenly I got a thought I may lose my mind and would become mad. (I have had a 3o min episode of past in 1999 - when I stressed out on bench waiting for job assignment - when I felt like I would be mad in next few minutes. I declared that to my wife and kids, went to bed and woke next day normally. But apparently this incident seeded in my brain). This time night, I got this thought again came over me rapidly that 'in next moment, I switch..switch..', body became hot, I could not rest. I felt like waking up my wife, my neighbour about my becoming mad. Part of my mind knows, it is psychological, but I could not control. That psychological attach lasted for 3 - 4 years, to regain my past mental balance. All through those years, I would have spells of times, when I would hallucinating my lonliness, going to be mad next minutes, body becomes warm / worry!! It will be unbelievable until one experiences. Regaining normalcy, I stamped that out of many human emotions, I have the emotion - FEAR is very dominant in me that caused me such mental trauma. There is no physical evidence to my worry, but all psychological.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 24 year old male, in decent shape, but I've been having strange chest pains for the past month or so.  It occurs on both sides of the chest, though more often on the left, and is sometimes accompanied by some pain/burning in my arms and legs, especially the left arm.  It doesn't seem to get any worse while I exercise, although I have noticed that after I stop exercising, it takes my heart rate a while to return to normal (it can still be around 100 bpm an hour or 2 later, and takes about 4 hours to return to the normal 60 or so bpm), and the chest and arm pain is usually worse during this recovery period.  I've had several EKGs and chest x-rays, and a few blood tests, and they all came back normal.  The chest and left arm pain make me worried about a heart problem, but since I feel fine when I'm working out and my heart is pounding, my doctor thinks this is unlikely.  He gave me celebrex a couple weeks ago, and the chest pain seems to be slightly better during the day, but it still comes up now and again randomly, and whenever I stop exercising (which, by the way, is usually in the evening).\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I am a 22 year old college student. Towards the begging on April, I went out for a jog, and began to have heart attack symptoms shortly after the run. I felt burning in the left side of my chest that would not go away for about ten minutes. I checked my pulse, which was just over 100 shortly after the run. I checked again before going to sleep that night and it was 79. For the next week or so, I began to have chest pains (these were not burning, but were more of an intense ache) and also pain in my arms. The pains would range anywhere from the left side of my chest, to the middle, the the right. Most often they would be on the left side and I would get pain under my left arm pit. I have also had pain in the forearms, at the elbow joints, and throbbing or numbness in the hands. After about a week of this, I laid down to go to sleep one night and had chest pains and shooting pains in my left arm. I had a trip to the ER, where I had an EKG and a chest X-ray done. Both came back normal. I saw my PCP and had blood analysis and a UA done. Again, the data came back fine. After having the pains several more times, I have seen my PCP, a DO, and a chiropractor. The DO thought I may have a spinal disc issue, but the Chiropractor subsequently ruled that out. The Chiropractor found that my spine was slightly out of alignment, and a few ribs were slightly rotated, but nothing serious. I saw a cardiologist last Friday who does not think I have either heart disease or arrythmia, but is going to give me a stress test EKG for the piece of mind. Since these symptoms began, I have been ill many times, my eyesight seems to have gotten worse, I have constant dark circles under my eyes, and I have lost between 5 and 10 pounds. My heart rate and blood pressure have been checked numerous times and both are fine. I am 6 foot, 150 pounds, I do not smoke, and I do not have diabetes. I have no blood related heart disease in my family that I am aware of. I apologize for the long post, but if anyone has any ideas I would appreciate it.\n\n",

    "content": "My wife has been having the exact same problem.  She's 23, healthy, non smoker, no asthma or history of any chest/lung problems.  She's had chest pain (occational pressure too) in her chest that increases in severity when she breathes.  This pain seems to come and go for no identifiable reason and has no regularity to it. It can last 30mins to several hours.  It's been bad enough to wake her from a dead sleep.  It seems to get worse when she lays down compared to sitting, however standing/moving around doesn't diminish or decrease the pain.  The pain has radiated down her arm and caused her hand and arm to go numb at times.  She's also been very tender under one arm although not on a constant basis.  More than anything though is the chest pain.  It's been increasing in frequency the last several weeks and now for the last week or so she's described the pain as a dull constant ache in her chest that flares up to the intense chest pain.  We're both concerned but no one can tell us what's wrong.  We're desperate for clues or suggestions.\n\n",

    "content": "So here is an update on my situation, since non of the docs have commented yet. I had the stress test EKG, and although my armpits throbbed while running, I did not have any of the chest pains for the 15 minutes I was on the treadmill. The cardiologist said that my heart was fine, and that everything looked normal. The only slightly abnormal thing was that even though I cooled down for 10 minutes after the exercise, my heart rate never dropped down to its resting rate before the exercise. The doctor told me it was fatigue from lack of exercise and can be remedied by conditioning. Most of my stress and all of my panic has left me since the middle of June due to the news about my heart and finishing school for the summer, however I have since had occasional bouts of depression. Currently I am having less arm and chest pain. However, I still get the chest pain while running or after exercise. It seems to be more related to breathing now. It goes away with rest. It feels like a squeezing pain in my chest most of the time just below and left of my left nipple. Other symptoms I am having are persistent dark circles under the eyes, decreased sex drive, and moderate to severe insomnia. I am eating fairly well and drinking at the most 4 beers in a week. The last time I saw my doctor about a month ago, he thought my issue was panic attacks, which I am not having. My best guess for the rest of you with similar symptoms based on what I have read is something known as Cadidiasis, which is an internal fungal problem based on sugar and yeast intake. I am going to try dieting accordingly to see if it helps. I would still greatly appreciate one of the doctors commenting on this thread.\n\n",

    "content": "Okay so another update I guess. I had an episode about 5 days ago that probably a panic attack, or a panic attack plus something else. Since then I have been actively pursuing some psychological healing and it seems to alleviate some of my symptoms. However, I still seem to get some of the symptoms. Sometimes they are fairly random, with the sensations in my arms or chest of pain or a feeling of impeded circulation. I noticed after sitting for 3 hours at a time yesterday, that I get tingling in my feet and they fall asleep, even though I think that is fairly normal. I still get chest pain upon light to heavy exercise, not sure if its just subconscious anxiety or what, although it doesn't really worry me as much anymore. I decided to go for a run today, in which I pretty much went for a really hard run for about 20 minutes. about 2 or 3 minutes after I was done my heart rate was at 150. In another 10 minutes it was 120. 10 minutes later it was 98. Its been in total about 30 or 40 minutes since I got back now and my heart remains at about 98. Is this fairly normal? Again, I have the pains while I run, they go away as I cool down. I don't really think I'm gonna test my heart anymore medically, because I had 3 EKGs, including a stress test EKG (even though I had none of the pain during it), and a chest x-ray, all of which were normal. Is it just likely 100% in my head, or just a pinched nerve, or maybe something to do with my lungs? Any thoughts?\n\n",

I am having real problems just walking around town getting chest pains and shortness of breathe, although not always very bad. I also get many symptoms when I eat.

Is there something definitive I can do? Should I beg for a holter monitor?

    "content": "Hello again,  I'm kinda having a tough summer as far as health is concerned. Its kinda funny how much you take something for granted like your health until it goes downhill. Anyway, here is where I'm at now, in case anyone reads this. I notice that my heart seems to beat hard if I do something like get up and move around, or if I laugh hard (glad I still can!), or do stuff like throw frisbees or eat. Not necessarily fast, just hard. I had my mother feel my chest tonight, and even though she thinks I have a psychological problem mostly, she admitted that my heart seemed to beat quite hard. I seem to get overexerted with very little exercise at this point. If I go for a brisk walk up the hill I do pretty well, but more strenuous stuff really takes it out of me. Again here is a recap:  Since the start of the year I have had an ekg, a physical exam by an internalist, blood work, urinary analysis, and a stress test ekg by a cardiologist. I had no symptoms during stress test that I usually get now. All of these tests were normal.  The last time I talked to a doctor, he said it was all in my head. I'm going to be seeing a psychologist next week. I still feel there is a problem with either my circulatory system, or something neurological. Anybody agree?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there,  I have been diagnosed as hyperthyroid, with costochondritis, hiatal hernia, carpal tunnel, and fibromyalgia.  It seems to me that this is all too pat.  Doctors keep adding a name to pain they can't seem to figure out.    They've given me Robaxacet, ranitidine, nexium to no effect.  They seem to think that I have GERD but I never have heartburn.  Robaxacet just made my stomach hurt and made me dizzy but did nothing for the pain.  As did nexium.  They say I have fibromyalgia but my muscles don't hurt.  I have a stabbing pain under both ribs, the classic costo pain on my sternum, all I have to do is shift in my chair and all the ribs joints crack with a sound like tearing beef jerky.  The pain radiates, stabbing like an ice pick into my back, and I have great difficulty breathing deeply, especially breathing at night or at rest.  I'm constantly tired and weak.  The pain in the morning is so terrible sometimes I think I'll pass out.  My coughing is also very very bad in the AM.  A hot shower will usually bring the pain to manageable levels for a short time.  I also have constant sinus infections with post nasal drip that antibiotics never seem to clear up.  Lately I've been getting bladder infections and lower abdominal pain that literally feels like my bladder is going to pop out the bottom of me.  The only thing that has ever helped (and it helped 100%) is prednisone.  Which they seem reluctant to try again.  I've had a chest xray, mammogram (I have fibrocystic breats that making reading it difficult), and blood tests.  I have been begging for a CT scan for over 2 years since this all started with a very sore throat that felt like I had a sea urchin deep in the base of my throat.    My throat has now been swollen concurrently for 2 weeks, and I can almost feel the esophageal walls clicking and closing together.  I feel like I'm trying to breathe under water, coughing up more mucous than ever before, which has no real taste but a sticky texture and there's a tearing feeling in my throat and I can sometimes taste a coppery taste like blood, which is different from the salty mucous I get in my throat from post nasal drip.  I stuck a toothbrush back there and came out with a small clot of blood.  My voice is getting hoarser.  Another issue is my circulation.  I have none.  Unless it's above 25 degrees celcius, I'm freezing and my hands turn a mottled purple color, and I sometimes get pins and needles in arms and legs when at rest.  Please help me.  I can't take this anymore.  It hurts too much.  I'm terrified I really have lung cancer or leukemia, and that I keep getting brushed off.\n\n",

    "content": "I forgot to mention - I am B12 deficient, and last blood tests seemed to confirm that whatever was causing the hyperthyroidism seems to be going away.  I've never taken any meds for it.  Just herbal teas since the meds they tried to give me made my blood vessels in my head swell and the only thing that helped was ice.  The meds began with the letter T....tapocet?  Something like that?  Also, I am a smoker, half pack a day.  The recent swelling and wheezing and pain has finally convinced me to quit and I am on day 2.  Also, my nose is stuffy but there is nothing in it.  It's like its all collecting in my sinuses and causing pain there also.  It's been there so long I barely notice the pressure and pain, I've gotten used to it but it hurts.  It's the swelling in my throat, breathing problems and mucous thats really worrying me at this point.  Also, my skin is dry and parchment-like.  I bruise very easily and very big, completely out of proportion to the injury.  My nails are weak, my hair is dry.  And I've been getting worse and worse headaches, with vomiting in the morning (definitely not pregnant - I'm menstruating) and my bowels are usually a mess and have been for the last two years.  Chronic diarrheia. (sic)  I've also had breast pain and discharge, a clear fluid.\n\n",

    "title": "Chest Discomfort and Difficulty in breathing",
    "content": "Hi, I am 31 years old male. From last couple of years I am facing this problem. It first started in August 2003. I was sleeping and suddenly I felt that I am out of breath and not getting enough air in my lungs.  I got panicked and woke up. But that feeling was there for 10-15 minutes, after which I started feeling ok and slept again. I went to ER and they took chest x-ray and did the blood work, which was normal. They suggested acute bronchitis and gave me albutrol inhaler. And told me to use the same when I have similar attack. Same week I met my doctor and he told me that this might be because of seasonal allergy and gave me allegra and antibiotics, I didn't have the problem for next six month and during this time I was taking Allegra or Claritin continuously. After six months or so again, I had the similar attack early in the morning, with chest tightness and breathing difficulty. Again I visited same doctor and he performed EKG, Blood Test, which was normal. He suggested me to increase allegra doses to 2 tabs per day. After three four months again I had the similar attack and this attack lasted few day with chest tightness and excessive difficulty in breathing, this time my doctor again took the EKG, which was normal and gave me a dry powder inhaler and suggested me to meet a pulmonary specialist. My Pulm. Specialist sent me for a Methocoline Challenge Test, and it was normal. Then he sent me for PFT, which was normal. Then he sent me for full PFT, CT Scan, Stress Cardiolite test. All these test were normal and he told me that my lungs are absolutely normal and I do not have Asthma or any obtrusive disease. Now from last five months I have this upper chest tightness and difficulty in breathing, quite consistently. Sometime I feel mild pain in the center of my chest. I used to get acidity quite frequently from last two three years, and I used to take zantac when needed. Also on my doctor (Primary Physician) suggestion, I started taking Zantac twice a day, and I am not sure if it is helping me. Also I would like to mention that I feel better while/after exercising and do not have any particular problem while exercising. I was a active smoker for around 12 years with 1/2 pack a day and from last few months I am trying to quit and cut the habit to max three or four cigarettes a week. Please suggest me, what should I do, I am very worried and don't know where to go for help. What kind of specialist I should go to. I have all these thoughts always in my mind that I have got some bad desease. I am thinking of changing my Doctor to an Internal medicine doctor.\n\n",

    "content": "With all pulmonary and cardiac conditions ruled out, it sounds like a classic panic attack.  They tend to occur for no reason, just out of the blue, and they are also fairly common.    I know you do not want to hear this, but it happens to so many people, it feels like you are going to die, and they tend to make general anxiety worse, which brings them on more frequently.  Talk to your doctor about something to relieve them, and if what he gives you first is ineffective, try seeing a psychiatrist, they are MDs who specialize in diseases and disorders.  Remember it is not your fault, you didn't do anything for these to occur, they are physical in nature, just affecting the chemicals in the brain, that's all.  I hope this helps and you feel much better soon.    Sincerely,  Shannon\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for the quick reply. Although it is helpful to know that this is nothing serious and may be related with a panic attack, I am really feeling frustated.  The thing which I am most worried about in last two years is that these symptoms are incrasing, first I got this attack for few miniutes and now after two years these symptoms are persistent and I can feel something in my chest continuously. I tried doing some breathing exercising like try to hold my breath as long as possible, and this helps. But I noticed that if I take fast deep breaths in and out then these symptoms increases, could they be related with the inflamation of Bronchii?  If this may be the case, then couldn't this be identified in the tests, which  I have gone through? Can you suggest some breathing exercises? which can help me to reduce the chest tightness?  Thanks for the reply. Regards\n\n",

    "content": "Ajo, the nature of panic disorder is you feel like you can't breathe and end up hyperventilating.  It is not an inflammation or problem of anything in the lungs.  Regular, daily excercise, even for just 15-20 minutes can work wonders.  It naturally reduces stress along with being better for the body.  It probably won't take all your symptoms away, if your symptoms persist, talk to your doctor about adding something to the excercise to help.\n\n",

Have your doctor perform or issue a Barium swallow, a CT scan or even an ultrasound.  This one is hard to find and even diagnose.  Because of how your tests all came back normal yet you can't breath as you once were able to and it is intermittent i would really have your doctor check to see if you have this.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "title": "Sharp pain while breathing",
    "content": "I am a 35yo male. I am currently serving in the U.S Marine Corps and have been in good health until the last couple months. I am a smoker of 8 years, smoking approx 10-15 cigarettes per day. I am a non-drinker.  In late November I started to get a pain in the right side of my chest just below my rib cage. The pain would be constant but get more severe at the top and bottom of each breath. On a scale of 1-10 the pain being a constant 6-7 with an 8 or 9 at the top of each breath. I was short of breath and could only sleep on one side of my body. I could not lay on my stomach or back because doing so was so painful. Any attempt to try to take a full breath the pain would literally stop me from completing the breath and I would feel a sharp pain.   I ended up going to the Emergency room after trying to \"Stick it out\" for 4 days. The physicians assistant on duty had an EKG ran on me that turned out normal and also had a chest x-ray done that he said was normal. I was then told I was probably \"Backed up\" and was given a Fleet enema and told to take some metamucil(sp) or some form of laxative.  The pain continued and after a week moved to my lower right back. Sharp pains while breathing and shortness of breath continued. After a week or so this pain went away. In mid December the pain came back only this time in the same spot under my lower rib cage on the LEFT side. The symptoms were the same with sharp pains at the top and bottom of each breath. I Went to the hospital and once again an EKG was performed that was normal. I was given an x-ray that was normal and I was released with some 800mg motrin. The pain stayed constant for about 4 days and i developed a slight temperature of 102.7 that went away within a day. The pain moved to my lower back near my left kidney and produced the same type of pain. I also had pain that would radiate over my left shoulder. I continued to work doing my military duties as best i could and would get winded waling 50 yards and the pain was so severe especially in the colder weather that I would have to stop half way to may vehicle to catch my breath and deal with the pain. Once I would get home i would have to sit right away and try to relax myself. It was then that a spontaneous cough occured and i put my hand over my mouth to cover it. When i removed my hand i noticed a clear mucus with a dark clot of blood with fresh looking blood in my hand. I hadn't had a problem with coughing other than an occaisonal cough here and there.   I went back to the Emergency room and the physician on duty did the EKG, Lung X-ray, urine and blood samples were taken. I was then sent out to the local hospital in Japan for a CT scan to check for a pulmonary embolism which I have a family history of having from my older brother to my aunts and uncles. The CT scan was performed and was negative for a Pulmonary embolism. The Japanese doctor said I had Pleurisy and prescribed some form of antibiotic and motrin for the pain.  I was happy that someone had finally determined what I was suffering from and I had the medication to finally beat this. I took the anti-biotics ( I am still trying to find out the name of the medication since it was written in japanese) 3 times per day and the pain persisted. After a couple weeks the pain got less and less. Just as I thought I was nearing the end of this I started developing a pain back again on the right side of my chest just below the lower rib cage. Exactly as it was before. I went to the emergency room when the pain got so severe that when I would breathe i would get a sharp pain and a convulsive type reaction that would stop me from finishing a breath. This time the pain being a 10 (on a scale of 1-10). I felt a cold sweat and nausea during this episode. It took me about an hour to get my clothes on to go the doctor because it seemed no matter how i moved or breathed the pain would get worse. I went back to the emergency room, had yet another EKG performed that took 3 tries because i couldn't lay on my back without the sharp pains with every breath that would throw off the sensors. I felt less pain sitting and hunched over than standing up straight or laying on my back. The EKG was normal, Urine test was normal, and Blood test showed normal except an elevated white cell count that the doctor said the type of white cells that were elevated meant a bacterial infection. His diagnosis was i was still suffering from the Pleurisy and prescribed PIROXICAM (20MG) that i take once a day. Shortly after leaving the ER the pain moved to my lower right back near where my right kidney would be located. Right now I have that pain that comes at the top of each breath. I can not yawn or anything bacause the pain is so intense.  This pain will sometimes stop me from finishing a sentance (basically stopping me from finishing a breath).  I also have a pain that radiates over my right shoulder near my neck.  Please if anyone can help me. I have been suffering through this for over a month.  I just had my yearly physical and my PPD test was negative. I have no swelling of my legs. I am not coughing up as much blood as before but the mucus that i do cough up is kind of a really light pinkish color.  I am sorry if I didn't include anything or if i failed to explain anything. I hope you can give me some guidance. Thank you in advance.\n\n",

I was told I was just having a panic attack.  It started out really small but at least I could take a full breath. That was yesterday. Today the 4th I can no longer complete a breath and everytime I try to lay down and sleep the slightest movement courses pain through my body. I can burt, breath, cough or anything without it hurting. I have not had the pain move like you have described but it is unbelievable. I myself have a clean medical record. I don't smoke I don't drink or do drugs. I have never had any sicknesses or anything like that other then the comin cold and I have never been on any meds except Penicilin once for an ear infection that lasted 2 days. That and I have never busted anything either.  I don't know.. I just wont it to go away I see you said you have had it for a month I have had it for 2 days now. I feel better hunched over in a chair then I do lying down. It almost feels like it is not a problem with my lungs but maybe around it. I don't know I am no doctor. I am going to check at my hopsital here today in BC Canada and see what they say.. if I get any different answers I will definitly tell you about it,  oh god not I see that you last posted a year ago.. if you figured this out please tell me..\n\n",

    "content": "Wow, some other people with the same thing I have. I am a 38 yr old female from canada. I am living and working in sweden. I have had this sharp terrible pain when breathing deeply in for the last three weeks. When I first got it I thought I was having a heartattack as it woke me from my sleep. The pain was on my left side and it travelled down my left arm and up into my shoulder, neck and face. I went to emergency where they gave me blood thinners and pain medication and kept me overnight at hopsital. They gave me an ECG and a lung xray and CT scan which were all normal. After two nights I was released after they insisted it was a problem in my back! I of course left there simply not buying it.  I have shortness of breath and can't get a full breath in or even out. I shake involuntarily (convulse) if I attempt to breath all the way in. Hunching over helps for me also. Laying down or standing especially for too long is agonizing. I haven't had a cold or anything other than a small cough about a month ago.  Over the past three weeks I have spent three separate occasions overnight in hospital. I have seen 8 different doctors. They have tested my heart and lungs, CT scans for possible bloodclots in the lung, they have said that it could be broken ribs or a pulled nerve in my back, but weren't 100% of that either since my pain seems to be coming from  my lung. The pain has been also through to my back and has slightly moved down toward my kidneys. I have unfortunately been at the mercy of the hospital here in sweden because I do not have a regular family doctor. My left arm had been slightly purple (off and on over the past few weeks) which they have told me is from lack of oxygen. The doctors found a slight infection in my bloodwork and I had a slight temperature while in hospital. They ruled out any kidney problem because my bloodwork showed that was normal.  I have been seen by a neurologist also who thought perhaps this was spinal meningitis, and also wanted to check me for an aneurism or stroke. One doctor even made the pathetic comment that this could all be in my head. It comforts me to see that there are others here with the same pain as me. This is not in our heads. I can validate that!  I am now spitting up blood which frightens me. I have lost confidence in the hospital here and have been desperately searching for a north american doctor that may now be practicing in sweden. I am considering going to canada to get help but I work here and am also afraid to fly with this. During one of my visits to the hospital I was given an anti-inflammatory injection, but the nurse who gave me this hit a nerve causing paralisis in my right leg for about 5 hours. I have yet to return to the hospital since this, even after spitting up blood due to the lack of care performed there.  I have contacted my family doctor in canada by phone. She said that it sounds like pleuracy. She told me that an antibiotic could be prescribed... BUT swedish doctors do not give antibiotics if you can believe it, telling me that no antibiotic could be given for this anyhow. They have yet to even mention pleuracy to me here, even though I have mentioned it to them. They said they would have seen it in the lung scan, however my doctor in canada said that this isn't always the case. The doctors here have me on tons of pain medication which doesn't even help. In the hospital morphine barely took the edge of the pain I am experiencing. I hope someone can help me, I am so exhausted with this. I have averaged 3 hours sleep nightly since this began.  I noticed the first thread posted here was from a year ago (I too thought it was from this year). I warmly welcome any replies, private messages or help with this. Perhaps the person who posted the first thread will write back and let us know how long it lasted for him and what it was (if he ever did find out himself). I truly sympathize with anyone having this type of pain and especially not knowing what it is.\n\n",

    "content": "I think I may have something similar, but I have not gone to see any doctors yet. I have the pain on and off now for 4 years! Sometimes it is better, sometimes it is worse and constant. Although i don't have blood coming from any mucous, i do sometimes get blood in my mouth which is from my gums, esp in the morning. But I havent had this for a while. But still the pain mostly under my ribcage on my left side. I cannot sleep on that side as it hurts more if i put pressure there.  What are your exact symptoms Public ip? Does it hurt more on the left or right?  C\n\n",

The best thing is to send sputum culture and sensitivity.  They grow the bug and find out which antibiotics works.  They can also do a test for fungal infection.  If those labs come normal, i'll get neurology referal.  It seems nerve involvement.  The question is any recent chemical exposure?  Recent travel?  Is your current job exposed you to any hazardous enviormental  before all this started?  You need to discuss it with your doctor with those other possibilites?  Are you the only one with this symptoms?  Co-workers?\n\n",

Then I find myself also short of breath.  Certain positions make the pain increase even more.  I had this once, six months ago and thought that I might have to call the squad.  The pain was seriously affecting my breathing.  I took a tylenol 3, advil and after 3-4 hours the pain was decreasing.  The same kind of episode happened again last week. Then today I woke up with the same thing, so I'm online trying to figure it out.  The above comments sound so similar to my pain. I have no coughing or blood.\n\n",

About 4 weeks ago, I suddenly had severe pain when breathing - couldn't fully breathe in without terrible pain.  It hurt above my brest (left side) and in back, in the same place). Walked the floor for couple of hours - didn't know whether to go to E.R. (didn't).  Took everything for gas that I could - no help.  It subsided somewhat and I went to bed - but that hurt, too.  It went on for a few days, less severely, then ended.  Then I reached for something in my car about 10 days ago and it started all over again.  Went to Dr. next day - had chest x-ray, EKG, he told me they were normal.  Told me to take Advil.  After several days, it got better.  NOW:  have found a lump on my back, left side - same area where it hurt in back.  No injury - no warning, just a lump.  Any ideas??  Are these related?  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "I am new here but I was searching things up on a condition that I have had now for over 15 months.  I couldn't help but notice how simular a post was here made last year by a man in the Marines and seen a Japanese dr.  I want to say Sir what you described is a conditon that is not that widely known and always misdiagnosed.  It's called Costochondritis.  It is inflammation of the rib cage and upper breast bone.  It's very painful and can sometimes be more painful taking deep breaths.  This is normally diagnosed when all other tests like xray, Ekg and Ct scan come out Normal to rule out other more serious problems.  I do not know if you still have this condition, and I pray not as it's been lingering with me for what seems like forever.  It's very painful and hard to get rid of.  I suggest any of you here with these symptoms tell your dr about costochondritis <sp?  and have them check that out.  I used to think I was having a heart attack or I thought I had bruised ribs.  Well at least that is what it sometimes feels like.  It is inflammation of the rib cage and upper breast bone.  See an Ortho dr or a Rhuemotologist. God Bless, Karen Av For more info on this u may email me at angelvoices98@yahoo.com\n\n",

Five nights ago, I had just exercised, and I flopped down on the couch panting hard... and I got a painful stitch under my right breast. I've had stitches before, but this was a really bad one! Lying down was painful, and I preferred to slouch forward. I did eventually get to sleep, but when I woke up the next morning, the stitch was still there!  That day was AGONY!! I was snotty with my colleagues, I couldn't get comfortable, and I couldn't breathe properly!!! Since then, the pain sometimes abates during the day and I can't pin down any movement I do that triggers it again, but EVERY NIGHT I have woken up with INCREDIBLE PAIN!!! I can't breathe, can't lie down. I have been up again since 4AM now.... had a hot bath because that helped last night... made another hot water bottle. I AM GOING NUTS BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF SLEEP!! It hurts to laugh.. at any time of day.  The pain is still located in my right side. It feels like my lung. Then I have been getting shooting pains down the middle of my back, and twinges in my right collar bone. Now I really can't lie down..on any side!  I have been looking up.. as you all have.. what the hell could be wrong with me. I am currently living in England, and have heard horror stories about waiting lists forpathology tests and x-rays. Will try and get in to see the doc tomorrow. I was kind of relieved to see this, because, for the past 2 hours I've been thinking 'lung cancer'.  WHAT THE HELL IS THIS!! Everyone who has written in is from such a different part of the world it is just not feasible that it's envoronment related. There MUST be an explanation. I'm sick of not being able to breathe!!  Going to try the muscle relaxant thing tomorrow too.. someone wrote in to say it worked.\n\n",

I've been having this though for the last 2 days (5/6 times a day) so I went to the GP and he said that they were just muscle spasms that 'were'nt serious', and 'normal'. He said that they happen when you are 'stressed' or maybe depressed. I don't think this can be true because I am not stressed or depressed. He wasn't able to suggest any way of relieving the pain and said just put up with it until it goes away.  Is there a way of reducing the pain or ending the muscle spasms once they've started?

I have'nt said anything to any one because ive only had it a few times and it goes away after about an hour. If i get it any more frequently i will probably go see my doctor but im afraid it might turn out to be something serious.does any one know what this is?Also it looks like people here have two diffrent problems, half the people posted are maily haveing back and sholder pains and the overs are having pains in lungs(or around)) when breathing. Could these be two sperate problems or are they both conected?\n\n",

It's always been in the same place (on the left side of my chest over my heart) and it'll prevent me from breathing in as deep as I normally would. It lasts anywhere from 3 minutes to a half an hour, and it's spontaneous. I may have had 20 to 30 episodes in my lifetime. It's not as severe as coughing up any blood, or it moving around my body, but, I am worried that that might happen to me also. I have not yet seen a doctor about it. I'm sorry to see that so many people have this condition, at the same time, It's comforting to know that I'm not the only one. I encourage people that are reading these stories and have the same problem to post your story also. It might make doctors take this more seriously.\n\n",

    "content": "Ever since I can remember sometimes when I breath I will get a sharp, stabbing pain right in the middle of my chest.  Most of the time it's in my chest; sometimes I get it under my right rib cage and just now 5 minutes before I wrote this I had it on the left side under my rib cage and now my left shoulder is hurting along with my leg down in my calf muscle.  The pain lasted for about 6 breaths.  Well I could inhale a little each time, but I had to exhale quickly because of the pain.  I was sitting on the couch watching a movie with my family and all of a sudden it hit me.  I had to try to breath and sit up at the same time and just wait till it was over.  It finally ended and I feel okay except for my arm and leg feeling a little different than normal.  I have had a cold for the past week and I do cough sometimes.  For the past 4 months; I have felt nauseas off and on throughout the day.  I had my tubes tied jan. of 2004 and I've taken 5 pregnancy tests, the doc even did a blood test just to make sure.  Along with this; I've had bad headaches, a pain in the left side of my neck that sometimes feels like a burning pain and pain in my left ear off and on.  I have palpitations which I've had for as long as I can remember.  I used to just have them about once or twice a month and now they are once or twice every few days.  I can't do much because my muscles start hurting pretty bad.  Right now it's hurting just to sit here and type this message.  I've have more symptoms I've tried to write them down as I get them because I started to notice they keep coming back more frequent than they used to.  If anyone has any idea where I should go from here; please let me know.  I've been to my doctor but she said I was bipolar and that's all she's focused on.  During the time I went to her with my depression, my life was going downhill.  Now my life is way better and I know I'm not bipolar because I took myself off the medication and I'm mentally happy.  Thank you in advance to anyone who takes the time to try and help me.\n\n",

I had urines, bloods, ecg's etc and nothing showed up until I had an Xray.  This showed a slightly fuzzy area at the bottom of my right lung ( where most of the pain is )..  So I am now on a high dose of Augmentin 625mg to kill whatever is in there and extra strength Paracetamol/aspirin to aid me with the pain.  Its now 5 days later and the pain is much less severe but seems to react to cold.  My chest is now loose and rattly and im hopeful that it may have just be an infection.  Now my Xray didnt show anything conclusive but the Doc said he thought I might have a severe infection and prescribed me the above tablets.   Maybe you guys have infections that didnt show on Xrays?  Hell I didnt even have a cough either.!  will post again in 7 days trime to update you on how I am once the full course on antibiotics have been taken and I have another Xray.  Good Luck.!

Distinct, severe pain started under right breast/rib area from within, feels like a peg going straight thru to my back, which is extremely aggravated with cough/deep inhale, when it feels like \"IT\" is going to explode. From that a different type of pain radiates, as if I could actually feel my whole lung upon inhale. Sometimes it also is aggravated in certain positions. Blood, EKG, Xrays=NEG. Cat Scan does show Emphysema, possible Plurisy, but Doc dissagrees. Finished Antibiotics. Pain Meds. just about took the edge off. Was advised to see Nurologist and have MRI. To date, pain is less, but still there. Any input is greatly appreciated! Thank's! From One Hurting Puppy!\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 42 year mother of two and have been living with sharp pain in my chest since my early 20's.  I have had some tests done but nothing truly extensive.  I have had that magnetic imaging done.  The best description / diagnosis which seems to fit and work for me is something hardly anyone has heard of - and yet is a satisfactory answer for me: slipped rib.  Go online and look it up.  Chances are something like this could suffice for many of these readers - not all however.  When I was told this - it was like a cloud lifted.  We all think the worst, but as my doctor said, if I have been living with this for so long, if it was terminal I would not be alive.  I still feel pain - but understanding slipped rib and how you move can greatly reduce it's affects.  It also can curve around into your back.  I used to put my arm up when I commuted and after I was given this diagnosis, I stopped putting my arm up on the door rest and that has been a major factor in the reduction of the pain.  I still get it every day, but just gentely pressing on the pain site for a minute or two seems to help.  How you sleep is also key.  I started putting a pillow between my knees and oddly enough this seems to have helped too.  I hope this is helpful for some of you.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm only 15 years old. I'm starting to get worried here... Once in a while I used to get sharp pains in my right lung.. then it would switch to my left lung, where it consisted the most. They used to be sharp pains, then the next year they were bad where I couldn't take a full breath. Back around nine months ago, I have a SEVERE one, where I couldn't breathe for a full minute. I thought I was having an asthma attack. It's been several years and still getting these, and they occurred more. Now, all of a sudden ever since a few months ago, they have stopped. My mother always tells me that I overreact about it, and the doctor said I was fine. These sharp pains should NOT be, in my opinion.   Well, lately I have been getting the urge to take deep breaths, like one every couple of minutes. I'm excessively tired, and I do not know if that has to do with anything... because I have tried to get so much extra sleep, and STILL getting these. It's also winter... So I am worried if I have caught something. I do not smoke or do drugs or anything. I have smoked once, which was last week. That was my only time.. And I've been researching, and I've read these replies, and I'm VERY VERY VERY worried. I have a fear of gravity, also. As in, I'm scared the floors will cave in, or I'll have internal combustion because of it. Now. This fear comes at random times. (It's the weirdest phobia. I know.) And I have stress constantly from school and my family always arguing. I'm sleep deprived, too. My immune system is weak, which is obvious because I get sick so frequently.   Could my breathing just be a part of some psychological disorder? Or some infection such as Pneumonia? Or a formation of asthma starting?   I just turned 15.  I'm pretty young to have such worries, but no matter how many times the doctors and my mom have told me, \"YOU'RE FINE\". Obviously, I feel I am not.  Please, if ANYONE could help me or lend me further knowledge.  Soon. I would love to hear some.\n\n",

Today the pain was constant with certain times when it was worse.  I do not smoke and have a clean medical history.  Can anyone tell me what this could be?  Or what I could do to help this horrible pain?\n\n",

    "content": "Hey guys, a very similar thing happens to me. Hopefully this will help you out because it works for me.  Sometimes I get sharp pains when I breathe and I have to take shallow breathes (I don't cough up blood, that sounds totally different and more severe?). I do two things that usually work and the pain hasn't lasted past step two for me, so it might help you out.  1) I walk around with my arms extended above me and I wiggle my body from side to side. When I first started experiencing these pains I figured I had some sort of air bubble trapped inside my lungs and I was trying to get it out (that's obviously impossible, but this is what I believed when I was younger). This works most of the time.  2) If the above doesn't work I strike the area that hurts really hard. I literally hit my chest where the pain feels that it's emanating from and that fixes it. Sometimes it feels like maybe my ribs move when I do this? I'm not sure, it seems like they reposition themselves? Anyway, I usually smack my chest a few times and presto! It's gone. Obviously, I don't try to hurt myself but I strike myself just hard enough that I sound like a drum.  Hopefully this helps guys, don't go hurting yourself if it doesn't work out when you strike your chest. We might be experiencing different things. I haven't ever \"drummed\" my chest more than 3 or 4 times.  Anyway good luck because I know how painful this can be.\n\n",

My pain began a couple of days ago, I woke up with a sharp pain in my left side, just under my breast that wraps around to my back. It came on with a slight cough (minimal light brown phlegm). Since the cough has subsided. I thought I had slept funny as I am breastfeeding while laying down. I tried to stretch out my side, but couldn't find an area that releaved the pain. It has since begun to affect my left shoulder and occationally my neck. I feel the pain consistently when I breath in. It becomes increasingly painful when I am laying down breathing or not, almost spasm like in my chest/side. Tonight is the first time that I haven't been able to find a position that didn't hurt. I am taking ibuprofen to see if that will relieve the pain, being that it feels muscle related. I have had my husband massage the area, but it appears to be only give me temporary relief. If anyone could reccomend something I would greatly appreciate it. I'm already not sleeping enough with the new baby and this is not helping.\n\n",

    "content": "@NoOneSpecial: I had my gallbladder removed in 2002. The pain from a gallbladder attack never extended up to my shoulder and was never on my left side or the center of my chest. It felt like severe food poisoning cramps - it did not cause any difficulty breathing.   This is completely different. So far as I know, I have not been exposed to strange chemicals. Just hit me today. The breathing-slowly-through-my-fist seems to help. Otherwise, I am a experiencing stabbing pains underneath my right ribs, and if I stand or walk much, that pain starts stabbing just at the end of my right clavicle as well. Occasionally it hurts in the center of my chest too. Mostly, it just hurts to breathe deeply.   The last time I had similar symptoms, I thought it was a kidney infection; UTI tests all came back normal, though, and doctor thought it was more likely musculoskeletal in nature.   One thought I had - my mother recently experienced similar symptoms, and thought she was having gallbladder attacks. It turned out that she'd recently gone off her proton pump inhibitor, and that was what was causing it - when she went back on, the pain went away! She has a hiatus hernia, and it was related to that. I'm wondering if any of you have been tested for one?\n\n",

    "content": "How interesting! I have been battling this since I was a young boy (now 44 years old). When I was 11 years old, I had a brain scan (post sleep deprevaion), xrays and full exam. Their conclusion.. My chest cavity was expanding. Of course this was not the case.   Here's what I know: In my case, I have nearly outgrown it but had a fairly severe instance of it this morning. It is often brought on by stress or a period following stress or physical activity. I have a breathing routine during these episodes where I stand or lay and breath as slowly as I posibly can. I don't mean relaxed breathing, I mean REALLY SLOW, a rate you can not possible maintain for long but can live with for 30-45 seconds. It relieves the pain nearly 50% of the time.   In EXTREME cases where I have the pain at the top and bottom without enough room to get enough air, I have taken a VERY FAST and deep breath. It hurts, it's horrible, it feels like I ripped out a rib but it instantly stops the pain. You may even feel a pop associated as you break through the restricted limits of your breathing.   While I am sympathetic to all of you experiencing the same situation, it's nice to know I'm not alone. I genuinely thought I was some sort of weirdo.  I wish you well - Dave\n\n",

    "content": "I am having similar issues as everyone in this post. I have found no answer after visiting the doctor, however; I recommend everyone get a chest x-ray first to distinguish whether or not it's Pneumonia. I had this a couple months ago, and the pain I have now feels the exact same... Sharp pain when inhaling or exhaling, shortness of breath due to lack of deep breaths. If it's pneumonia, the x-ray will show it. Pneumonia typically will have other symptoms such as fever and cough or sinus related problems as well though. chances are if you're fine in that area, it's not pneumonia.  I had pneumonia on my right side, and my left side is what currently hurts. Right under my rib cage almost it feels like a bubble is going to pop when i take a deep enough breath. X-rays were clean, doctor just gave me some advil with codine in it, which doesn't help a whole lot in the long run, but does allow me to breath a little more deeply before I get the really sharp pain. When i do take a deep breath, the \"bubble\" area feels like it twitches or shudders a little bit, and I can't finish exhaling because it practically knocks the wind out of me with pain. I have noticed the pain seems to get worse when i get nervous.   My first advice is not to freak out because it only decreases the air-intake you're already having trouble getting. I would then get an x-ray and take some form of pain medicine.  My pain has been constant for over 24 hours now.  Strangely enough, it gets much more painful at night but not because i'm sleeping or doing anything differently than during the day.   It hurts to move, breathe, burp, yawn, cough. Pretty much can't do anything but focus on controlling my breaths. I really hope this goes away, as it seems no one knows what it is or what to do about it. The only thing the doctor suggested was that it could be an irritated nerve.   Another tip, I've been reading around, and it seems some people get this chest pain figure out it's caused by eating Gluten. This particular disease is called Celiac, and can cause different kinds of sickness from eating gluten foods.  I'll post back in a few days if I learn more or if the pain stops. This is very seriously painful, and i have not done anything stressful for the past few weeks besides listen to BPs oil mess.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: How much advil for costochondritis?",
    "content": "Hi,  Certainly, NSAIDs(including ibuprofen) are used in the management of costochondritis, as an element of sterile inflammation is involved in its pathogenesis.  Recommended dosage schedules for the oral formulation are as follows. The maximum amount of ibuprofen for adults is 800 milligrams per dose or 3200 mg per day (4 maximum doses). For mild to moderate pain: Adults and teenagers\u2014400 milligrams (mg) every four to six hours, as needed. For arthritic conditions (osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis): Adults and teenagers\u20141200 milligrams (mg) up to 3200 mg per day divided into three or four equal doses.  As to how long to continue taking it, my answer would be \"as long as it is absolutely necessary, as determined by the treating clinician\". Prolonged therapy may be necessary in case of certain arthritic conditions. This should be done only under medical supervision.  The other option available are the gel formulations of certain NSAIDs for topical application. Generally, topically applied gels containing NSAIDs do not appear to cause systemic (mainly gastrointestinal) side effects commonly seen with oral NSAIDs. They provide good levels of pain relief comparable to that of orally administered NSAIDs. Some studies indicate that they produce lower plasma levels compared to the oral route but, achieve higher concentrations in the underlying muscles and in the synovial fluid.  In the acute phase of rheumatological conditions, at least twice a day application is generally recommended for periods ranging from 7-10 days.Thereafter, it may be titrated according to the response.  In your case, as you have costochondritis and as the costal cartilages being quite superficial structures, topical gels may be a better option. Whichever formulation is used, the dosage should be titrated with the response.  Best wishes!\n\n",

(except for having my tonsils removed when I was 11Yrs old) I sometimes get the feeling that I can't catch my breath and have to yawn or stretch  to get a deep, filling breath. Sometimes yawning works and I feel like my lungs open up and i can breathe for a while and sometimes this does not work. I also get palpitations that seem to be getting worse lately. My other symptoms are Headaches, Earaches, Sneezing, Occasional cough(can't get the mucus to come up),  Post Nasal Drip and recentley I've been getting dizzy when I lie down. I used to be on allergy medication but switched doctors and haven't had it in quite a while. When I was on the medication it seemed to take care of the Post Nasal drip and the sneezing and stuff.  What I am concerned about is the Palpitaions and the fact that I can't catch my breath. Can these be connected to the allergy symptoms? Somebody suggested Anxiety, but I don't really feel anxious. Both my mother and my brother have Heart abnormalaties(A floppy something or other and a leaky something or other) and they also had Sinus polyps. My sister and my dad have Heart Murmurs. I also had a CBC done recently and it showed increased neutrophils and decreased Lymphocytes but my basophils and eosinophils are normal. Can this be connected? I also had a chest x-ray which I never heard about so I guess it was normal.  Are the Palpitations and Difficulty breathing anything I should be worried about? Any help is much appreciated.

    "content": "Hi AngelTurtle - I'm going to answer your post in somewhat reverse order, going toward the end and  working backward. The  reason is that much of what you have described could be classic anxiety, and you  don't feel you are anxious. This is the biggest single problem with resolving anxiety-mediated problems: the symptoms often precede the actual anxiety, especially in  people with what I strongly suspect is a family history of mitral valve prolapse (MVP), also known as \"floppy mitral leaflet syndrome\", \"click murmer syndrome\" and a number of other odd terms. The abnormality, which is almost always benign in itself,  often runs in families, and also has a peculiar tendency to be linked with anxiety. The symptoms (palpitations, apparent shortness of breath with good exercise tolerance, sometimes left-sided chest pains that are sharp or stabbing, and an increased awareness of one's heart and breathing) often precede the anxiety (which is caused by them) and so anxiety is often denied by the patient, even  though the clinical picture is classic, as it is in your own description.  There is probably also a chronic sinus problem, or perhaps allergic rhinitis, which is clearly severe enough to potentially cause some inner ear pressure problems including vertigo (dizzy when you lie down). Vertigo due to inner ear problems has been associated with anxiety and panic attacks as well, so you've got a lot of possible triggers for anxiety that  would not be evident to you, even though you are the one feeling the symptoms. (The sighing, yawning and preceived inability to draw a full, satisfying deep breath is also classic and often leads to accidental overbreathing - hyperventilation).   First of all, please do not feel you're being blown off as an anxious patient; anxiety can be a terrible and disabling problem, even though it is not a physical disease. The  symptoms lead to more self-monitoring, which leads to more concern (and anxiety) and thus to more symptoms. It starts to feel as though the situation is spiraling out of control and no one is taking you seriously. Well I am taking this seriously, because the  sum of these things can make your life miserable.   It would be helpful to get the physical things under control (perhaps  an antihistimine to manage  the PND and maybe meclazine for times when you feel dizzy).   Palpitations are extremely common in the normal, healthy population, even though they feel very disturbing. They are rarely of any consequence in an otherwise healthy person.    Awareness of one's own breathing creates a cycle that can lead to panic attacks and chronic anxiety which simply feels  likei its physical symptoms, which is  why a majority of people with this problem deny they are anxious: they feel real symptoms and assume that is where they should be looking.   Ruling out anything serious is a helpful starting point, treating symptoms  of chronic physical issues (like allergies or sinusitis) and possibly a trial of an anti-anxiety medication if correcting the physical symptoms, may get everything back in order. (The palpitations  are  rarely treated unless they are very persistent).   I hope this helps and please do stay in  touch.\n\n",

    "content": "For Dr. Stress:  Ideally you'd be able to visit a doctor, have a solid differential diagnosis, call it anxiety and be directed to someone practicing cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which is a self-limited, interactive form of behavior modification that helps the patient to recognize the onset of symptoms and derail them til finally they no longer \"work\", so give up and go away. Sometimes, too, if the symptoms are fairly disruptive, as they seem to be for you (and they so often are), a temporary anti-anxiety medication may be prescribed to help lift the burden of dealing with the somatic symptoms til CBT has been completed. In rare cases, longer term medical management is required, but most often the therapy is a huge help. If you're unable to get this help where you are, this may then become a do-it-yourself project, which seems unfair, but is becoming more and more common in certain areas where healthcare provision is dictated by unresponsive systems. If that's the case there, by all means continue to seek medical help, don't let up on it, but also undertake the DIY approach and begin to look at meditation, relaxation techniques, distraction, etc. Sometimes these can have remarkable effects, sometimes not, but they are worth a try. There are some books out there, too, which are helpful in learning these techniques.It's difficult to get started because the anxious patient is already distracted by his symptoms. Realizing this can actually be a good starting point sometimes , though.  I wish I could give you some magic formula for taking the upper hand of this, but first you do need an unequivocal medical rule out of any physical causes. Once that's done it's partly your job to badger the providers for the right referrals. Other than that, one sometimes has to learn to be still by finding one's own center.

    "content": "Hello,  I am a cadet in an ROTC Program at college and am used to physical strain and shortness of breath during runs/physical training.  But recently, I have been struggling to catch a full breath of air at night when I am trying to get to sleep.  It is bad--I usually end up having to go outside to just sit and hope for the best.  This problem is disrupting my life at school and it messing up my study opportunities.    What could be causing this?  I have a history of childhood asthma (diagnosed at age 3)  but am now 18 and in control of my asthma symptoms to the point where I do not need any medications.  I do not have a cold/influenza/pneomonia/etc.    I am worried that this might start happening during the day and actually start to mess up my social life.  Please help...\n\n",

    "content": "Hello.  I feel the exact same way. I'm 18 years old and I get these episodes where my chest feels some pressure particularly on the left side. I sometimes would even feel that I'm not hungry and skip breakfast or just eat a little bit of it. The shortness of breath has been going on for 2-3 months. However, I started getting some shakiness in my legs not too long ago and hasn't shown up sense. I feel irritable and miserable because I don't know what's wrong with me. I called 911 one day because I was so scared. The paramedics checked my oxygen level and said it was normal. They also checked my blood pressure which was also normal. They said I had an anxiety attack but I thought anxiety attacks was something more serious like passing out or something to that effect. My mom and many others believe it is anxiety but I don't see what I'm so anxious about. I feel as if it's something else and I'm just a sitting duck doing nothing. It gets worse when I'm getting ready to go to bed and woke me up several times last night. I could also hear a lot of gurgling noises in my stomach for some reason. I also feel dizzy when I'm lying down sometimes. Thank you for your time.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Constant Cough Since Africa",
    "content": "Hi, It is rather difficult to attribute a cause for your cough of just over a week's duration without actually examining you and without knowing other details pertaining to your travel.  Therefore, i will confine myself to a general discussion on travel and disease.  According to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (USA), emerging infectious diseases are commonly classified as: - diseases that have newly appeared in a population(\"Emerging diseases\") and, - diseases that have existed in the past, but are rapidly increasing in incidence or geographic range (\"Re-emerging diseases\").  Global Travel is associated with an increased risk of health problems.Obviously, certain diseases are more prevalent in certain geographic locations.One other aspect that is being studied is the relevance of the Length of travel(duration of travel to a particular country or region).   Length of travel appears to be associated with health risks. - long-term travelers (trip duration >6 months) and short-term travelers (trip duration <1 month).   Studies indicate that areas of concern for long-term travelers were vector and food-borne diseases, contact-transmitted diseases, and psychological problems.For short term travelers, acute infections were found to be more common(ex; influenza,dengue fever, acute diarrhea, rickettsiosis, sexually transmitted infections), animal bites, and insect bites.  While concluding, let me mention a few of the potential respiratory system related risks that are prevalent in some parts of some of the countries you had traveled to.  South africa: Like in many other countries,the environmental impacts of the mining industry have been affecting to some areas of the Witwatersrand, the country's most densely populated region. Mining-related environmental hazards are a concern.The dust from mine dumps can contribute to respiratory diseases, such as silicosis.Cleaning up and safety procedures have been implemented by the government.  Egypt: in some of the central parts of the Nile Delta, many people are occupied in the cultivation of the plant, flax and the production of flax fibres(used to produce linen). Dust which emanates in high concentrations during the processing, is known to cause Byssinosis, a respiratory ailment in people who are exposed for prolonged periods.Workers in the cotton industry are also exposed to the risk of Byssinosis.  Influenza risk is common to many countries including the ones you had traveled to.  So, it is quite obvious that there can be no simple answer to your query. It probably depends on the length of your stay in a given country, the places you visited, and the type of activity you were involved in (outdoors, indoor,urban or rural etc). Hope your cough has improved by now. Hope it was just an attack of 'flu'. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, It appears that you have almost fully recovered from costochondritis exept for some tightness in your chest.The management of costochondritis usually consists of rest, local heat (hot packs) and NSAIDs.  Generally, topically applied gels containing NSAIDs do not appear to cause systemic (mainly gastrointestinal) side effects commonly seen with oral NSAIDs. They provide good levels of pain relief comparable to that of orally administered NSAIDs. Some studies indicate that they produce lower plasma levels compared to the oral route but, achieve higher concentrations in the underlying muscles and in the synovial fluid.  In the acute phase of rheumatological conditions, at least twice a day application is generally recommended for periods ranging from 7-10 days.Thereafter, it may be titrated according to the response.  There are no fixed guidelines/protocols for discontinuing topical NSAID gel application. One of the ways could be (rather than to apply it whenever needed), to apply once a day for few days and then on alternate days for a few more days and then stop.One other way could be to apply daily, but to progressively decrease the amount applied. your best bet would be to discontinue under guidance from your doctor. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Clear Sticky Right Lung Congestion - NO COUGH",
    "content": "For over three months I have had a problem with my upper right lung and right side of throat. I have no cough, no desire to cough, but have the feeling of some phlegm i need to hack up.  The feeling is constant through out the day - though it get worse in the evening, around 5/6 pm and then wanes until it comes back at around 10/11 pm. When i clear my throat to bring it up it is only a minimal amount and is mostly clear, frothy, and sticky, but on occasion it is off white. About every 4 or 5 days I experience a bought where it is really hard to bring up and when i do it is tan or off white colored and sometimes with brown specks.        The condition is eased by taking Mucinex, which helps my ability to easily bring up the phlegm - however it never really clears completely. If i don't take Mucinex I find that i feel greater pressure on my right lung where the phlegm is coming from. In addition to the congestion and phlegm my right side of my throat constantly feels like something is in it - although the feeling has greatly been reduced since taking Mucinex - but i no matter how much i hack and hack the left side of my throat becomes irritated and sore and the right side just feels like i need to clear my throat.        A history of the onset of this problem: In January 2009 I had what i believed to be a cold. I awoke one morning with a sore right throat, right nasal congestion and body aches. I rested and in a couple of days I was felling better, though i still had a stuffy nose. A friend came over to my house and we (stupdily) smoked some marijuana mixed with hallucinagenic mushrooms. Subsequent to smoking It had been over a month that i had smoked marijuana. The next night after the mushrrom/weed inhalation i got a really bad cough and congestion where i lost my voice and had a sore throat for about a week. My cough and congestion was so bad that when i would cough it up i could feel it comming from an area of my right lung that i had never felt congestion come from. Durring this period of laryngitis i had the constant feeling of something stuck in my right side of my throat - i assumed it it was phlegm or post nasal drip  but it was really irritating and i constaly would try to clear my throat to clear it. i also had pressure on my right lung where i could feel the phlegm \"settling\"    I finally went to the Dr. after about three weeks of suffering. I was told i had Walking Pnuemonia  and was given Eurythromicin  and told that It was unlikey i had a fungal infection from the mushrooms as i did not have AIDS. After completing the anitbiotics my symptoms still remained. I began to notice that i had an eye infection  developing also and returned to the doctor who gave me eye drops for my eyes and told to wait for my body to heal since I had probably irritated my lungs and airways with all the coughing and hacking. A month and a half after the anitbiotcs i still had the feeling of pressure on my chest and congestion which was really hard to expel. Durring this time i had no body aches, no head aches but still had nasal congestion in my right nose and what and earache in my right ear. i went back to the doctor who gave me a Zpac and an abutoral inhaler and said that it should clear it up and to wait a couple of weeks after i finished to see results.      I started taking mucinex and immediately the pressure on my chest was relieved and i was able to clear my throat of something. i also expereinced a couple of throat clearings where thick green  and yellow \"ball\" like phlegm was expelled and releived the feeling of having something stuck in my throat - though i still felt it was swollen  and still had chest congestion.    Fast forward to today - I still have chest the sticky, clear, frothy, phlegm congesting in my right lung. My right nostril is no longer stuffy and i don't have an ear ache any more. I stil have problems with my right eye. Mucinex  helps to keep the congestion from making my right side of my chest feel pressure but without it i still get the feeling of fullness. My right side of my throat  still feels \"swollen\" and lately i have been feeling a dull pain on my right side of my chest where i feel the congestion originating.   What is wrong with me?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  While it's impossible to diagnose at a distance, and so we cannot tell you with any certainty what \"is wrong\" with you, we can certainly follow your detailed history and story and come up with a pretty good guess.   FIrst, you have had symptoms of a deep sinus infection. These can contribute to your main complaint in two ways: one, by simple post-nasal drainage, which can deposit infectioius mucus in your airway and bronchial tree; two, by this same mechanism allowing spread of the same bacteria to those areas where it can sometimes take on a second life. Either way it will cause the exudate and phlegm symptoms you describe. The fact that the phlegm is sometimes off-color or flecked with brown most likely means it contains some blood, and this is most likely carried down from the sinus infection which will  often cause some erosion of tiny capilaries up in there. Further, these deep sinus infections are often difficult to kill with regular antibiotics because they are located relatively far from local blood supply , so not much of the medication finds its way to the location.  There is also the remote possibility this is, in fact, a fungal infection, although whether or not it was caused by the mushroom smoke is both moot and fairly unlikely. It just doesn't matter. The problem needs to be treated. Part of the solution is Mucinex (or generic guaifenesin), as well as a more potent antibiotic and albuterol inhaler. First, however, infection of the pharynx and/or bronchi. The treatment would likely be the same anyway, but it's important to know what is being treated. Hopefully the symptomatic treatment now underway will manage this pretty well, but since it's been so persistent it does require further study and probably a potent broad-spectrum antibiotic.   Hope this helps. Good luck to you.\n\n",

Below is exactly what was on my first examination report.  FINDINGS: PA AND lateral views of the chest demonstrate adequate inspiratory volumes bilaterally. There is a 4.5mm oval density of the right lung base seen on the frontal view. There is a similar oval density seen overlying the cardiac apex on the lateral view. This likely represents a corresponding finding. The finding is more dense than that of the adjacent ribs abd likely represents calcified granuloma. Other etioloies are not completely excluded and there are no prior studies for comparison. No other potential areas of focal infiltrate, consolodation, or masses are appreciated. There are no pleural effusions or pneumonthoraces. The cardiac silhouette is of normal size, shape, and position. The bony thorax demonstrates no significant abnormalities.  IMPRESSION: There is a 4.5mm facal density of the anterior aspect of the right lung base which likely represents a calcified granuloma, however, there are no prior studies for comparison\n\n",

    "title": "Re: calcified granuloma",
    "content": "Hello -  Calcified granulomas are rarely a problem. They are almost always benign, since malignant lesions grow and don't have time to become calcified. Rather,  these  granulomas are scars that have healed or gone dormant  for so long that calcium deposits have formed on them. They are rarely removed or treated at all. Some of the more common causes are tuberculosis, coccidiomycosis (common to parts of California) and fungal infections such as histoplasmosis (most common in the Ohio Valley in the U.S.).   It's always a good idea to follow up with your doctor when a finding like this turns up, but it's almost always a benign finding, so no huge cause for concern.  I hope this is helpful. Please follow up here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello there,  I am a healthy 26-year old female. Ever since I was about 11 or so, I have experienced random, sharp chest pains that seem to come from the left side of my chest -- I'd describe them as underneath my left breast. They are stabbing pains that get worse every time I breathe in. These pains can last anywhere from a few seconds to up to about a minute, and they seem to occur randomly -- when I'm sitting down, laying down, vigorously exercising, etc. There doesn't seem to really be a rhyme or a reason to them. Normally, the deeper I breathe in, the worse they get. Sometimes I'll get three in a day, sometimes I'll go for months without experiencing the pains. The first experience was the worst and lasted for about 10 minutes -- none have been nearly as bad since that one. At first I would just try to breathe shallowly until they passed -- the pains are enough where they stop me in my tracks and I'll just focus on breathing. When I was about 17, I experienced what I'd call \"a bad one\" in the middle of mini-golfing and I happened to sneeze. Breathing in deeply in order to sneeze caused what I'd describe as a 'tearing' sensation in the same spot as the pain, but the pain ceased immediately. Ever since then, I try to force myself to sneeze when I get these pains if they last for more than a few seconds. There's always that tearing sensation and then the pain immediately stops.  I've asked my general practitioner about these pains and she could find no cause for them -- my heart and lung functions seem very normal. I've tried to research these sorts of pains on my own and I always come up with a variety of possible diagnoses. Any ideas? Need any more information? Thanks very much!\n\n",

The difference is the first problem, musculosketal, responds well to over the counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatory meds such as ibuprofin and naproxyn, but the other two things are a little more complex. The \"tearing\" sensation and subsequent relief of symptoms strongly suggests either an adhesion (tissue of the pleura, the protective lining of the lung, sticking to the chest wall because of some random inflammation in the past) or possible even (and much less likely) spontaneous pneumothorax, in which little bullae, bubble-like things on the lung, burst. This often is accompanied by the same symptoms you've been having but also often some shortness of breath. I'd lean more toward an adhesion or just plain chronic anatomic anomaly where something literally gets \"stuck\" and then is released by some strong inner pressure as from a sneeze.  None of these possible problems is serious, but you may want to talk to an internist about it and see if it could be resolved without too much fuss or if it's fine just to put up with it. If it's an anatomic anomaly you may well have to put up with it, and you've done a good job of that so far. If it's an adhesion there are ways of dealing with those, and the pneumothorax problem is pretty unlikely. There is also the possibility of chronic costochondritis, and this would respond to the OTC pain meds, so that may be worth a trial. It's pretty near impossible to diagnose most problems at a distance, some moreso than others, but I hope I've at least been able to give you some helpful suggestions as to why this might be happening. Clearly after all this time it's not a serious problem, the only issue is just how aggravating it is for you.   Hope this is helpful. Good luck to you and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

You describe a tearing sensation once you sneeze and I get a \"Bubble-that-finally-Bursts\" sensation which could be much the same.  I don't sneeze, I just force myself to take a deeper breath which causes the \"bubble to pop\" and I gain instant relief.  I am curious if you have any history of asthma, allergies, or being high strung.  That is what I thought might be causing the symptoms.\n\n",

    "content": "I have experienced the same symptoms as you, starting when I was 12 years old.  I went through a battery of tests(holter monitor, stress test, EKG, etc.), only to discover that I have a heart murmur which could not possibly be the cause of such pains.  I am presently 31 years old and still experience the random tearing pains.  They have increased in length and intensity as the years have gone by but I am unable presently to go through the tests again, as it took my mother almost 10 years to pay those bills off and I currently am uninsured.  I agree that forcing to take a sharp breath deeply in usually, but not always, relieves the discomfort.  A few years ago I was referred to a cardiologist by my general doctor due to my unusually slow weak heartbeat.  I, again, didn't follow through due to financial reasons.  I truly want to feel better and wish to no longer experience this malady.  I am hoping that I am able to get checked out and receive treatment if needed as soon as fiscally possible.  I used to suffer asthma-from early childhood up to about 2 years ago-then it mysteriously went away.  I also have vaso-vagal response attacks where I faint and breathing and heartbeat stop for a period, along with bladder/other release.  I have suffered 3 different attacks-the first on when I was 12, right before these chest pains began. The other two in my early 20's.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, The symptoms such as the ones you are describing are non-specific and can be due to a number of conditions, some of which are - anxiety/stress, - cardiac (angina, myocardial infarction), - endocrine disorders( ex; hyperthyroidism), - drug induced,etc.  Before jumping to any conclusions, the first question one should try to answer is, \"is this related to bronchial asthma or or its treatment?\"  Your symptoms can very well be explained by adverse effects that may occur during regular usage of salbutamol. Salbutamol may cause the following less serious side effects.. - tremors,  - Nervousness, - dryness of mouth/throat - throat irritation, - dizziness, - cough,   - headache, - insomnia, or  - nausea. More serious side effects such as  - chest pain & - irregularities of cardiac rhythm also occasionally occur.   As you have indicated that you are using salbutamol inhaler only on a  prn(as needed) basis,it can be safely ruled out as the cause.  So, i feel that you should consult your doctor and have the cardiac causes excluded as a priority. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: left shoulder pain with pain under sternum",
    "content": "HI,  The pains that you are describing can be attributed to a number of conditions such as - Gastro-esophageal reflux - angina pectoris - myocardial infarction - musculo-skeletal pain etc.  Of late, Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is being increasingly being reported in young individuals.  AMI has a low incidence in young adults. The percentage of patients under 40 years of age is 2- 8 % of all AMI cases  and it rises to 10% for people under 46.   It is unclear if AMI in young adults may be considered as an early expression of coronary artery disease (CAD) or an entirely autonomous disease.Possible gene polymorphisms are being investigated.  AMI in young adults is typical as regards risk factors, clinical, angiographic and prognostic characteristics. The risk factor pattern appears to be different from that in older people. The most common factor is cigarette smoking , followed by family history for CAD. An association between AMI in young adults and cocaine abuse has been noted. Cocaine, by its harmful effects on myocardial oxygen demand, myocardial perfusion, and its direct myocardial toxicity may precipitate an AMI.  AMI in young women has been noted to be associated with  oral contraceptive use.  Keeping these facts in mind, it will be safer for young persons with retro-sternal pain to report to their doctors promptly to exclude an AMI (although it is relatively infrequent). Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Im not sure if I posted this in the right spot or not but I'm hoping it's relitively in the right place. In late January I fell while at a figure skating competition and since then I have had a sharp pain in my right rib cage area, in the back, not quite near the bottom of my ribcage. It feels like it is more of my lung than my ribs, as the pain is fairly deep in. It only hurts when I breathe in heavier than normal, and feels like something is trying to push out of my ribcage. I stopped my skating practices and approached my doctor about it. He sent me for Xrays on both my spine and my chest, claiming that I could have a dislodged vertebrae. Both Xrays came back normal with the exception of a 2 degree spinal curve to the right. My dr gave me an immediate diagnosis of scoliosis, and said that the pain was caused by that and that there was nothing he could do except give me pain meds. I don't know what the medication was as I stopped taking it, but it made my pain no better and I returned to him. He refferred me to a physiotherapist for work on my spine. The physiotherapist claimed that the pain I was experiencing was from a dilocated rib, which I thought made sense as another girl I skate with fell and dislocated one and was in similar pain as well. However, he said that it had been out of place for quite a while as it was quite stuck and was nestled up to another rib (on top of it) really tightly and it was not a recent injury. After two appointments he was able to get the rib back in and said that I should feel better in a few days, however the girl I skate with said her's hurt for a month.  It has now been over three months since that appointment and my breathing has not improved at all. My dr is bound and determined it is my scoliosis (which is located at the top of my spinal cord), when I have told him that I have had scoliosis all of my life (undiagnosed until the Xrays), and that the pain was much lower than where my scoliosis is located, as well as it feels as though it is IN my ribcage, not on my ribcage or that my actual ribcage is causing it.  I was just wondering what this seems like to you? We were learning about the respiratory system in biology today and I approached my teacher about it and she advised that I get to a doctor quickly. However, my doctor is on vacation for another five weeks and I live quite far from another Dr so I thought I would give this a shot first. I am willing to drive to the Dr, but I'd rather have a sense of what is wrong first.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello all and thanks in advance for your opinions.  I have gone to the Doctor for this three times, have gotten chest x-rays, have taken many different tests, have multiple more appointments to look into this, and am just a little frustrated with the situation.  I have faith in my Dr., but I just want to get through thisand any suggestions or points I can bring up with my doctor would be greatly appreciated.  I have had a weird cough for about 2 months now, more of a dry hack, a single cough, caused by a constant tickle in the back of my throat.  I do ahve a bit of a tight throat (not neccessarily sore, just feels tight) and an occasionally difficulty in swallowing (difficulty, not pain).  it seems to be especially tight right behind my larynx, but can be felt down my neck.  The tightness might come from two months of coughing, or it could be a sympton of the larger problem, I am not sure as I do nto remember if the tightness came with cough or 2 months of coughing caused the tight throat.  Glands seem normal.  No history of any gland problems, no asthma, no breathing problems other then a small hay fever problem.  Feel fine other then the awkward tight throat and the constant cough that gets in the way of all physical activity (and life in general).  It does not happen more often at any particular part of the day.  Have had chest x-rays, post nasal drip medication, blood work, and am going for EKG testing to rule out a breathing problem that would cause the cough that would cause the tight throat, but I really feel that it is in my neck/throat area.  I screamed a lot during the red sox world series win/ beat myself up with a lot of late nights around that time, and the cough started shortly afterwards.  Another item that I completely forgot about until reminded by a friend, I was grabbed pretty hard by the neck about 8 months ago during in a hockey game - it caused no injury at the time and I did not have to go to the dr, but it was a hard enough blow that my friend remembered it.  Could this manifest itself as a problem 8 months later after a lot of screaming?  Thanks for you time...\n\n",

I saw a doctor for this and was given an EKG as well as an X-Ray of my lungs, the doctor said that both looked perfectly normal. I used to smoke infrequently for a year or so (maybe 4 cigarettes a week) but have since quit.

    "content": "I know this is an old post, but wow! It surely describes my symptoms over the past several months. I have benign chest wall pain for years, and have had stress chests, EKGs, echocardiogram, troponin tests and the such that have all turned out fine. Other a than a one week episode of frequent supraventricular tachycardia in 2007 (treated with total effectiveness with metroprolol succinate), I have never had cardiac issues other than some occasional daily premature atrial contractions & a few premature ventricular contractions. I do have elevated LDL lipid profile, so take 5 mg  Crestor for that after having a bad muscle reaction to Simvastatin at 40mg several years back. Last year, I had occasions of terrible shooting pain from under my left arm, my left side, and down my left tricep whenever I would reach or extend my left arm in certain ways (such as reaching behind to back seat in the car). The back MRI showed some lower level disk deterioration in parts of my cervical and lumbar areas, most noticeably c5-c8 areas. The recent EMG test wasn't highly conclusive, other than noting some c8 radiculopathy (left distal region and tricep weakened). I will be having a cervical epidural sometime in next month. I work at a computer everyday, and I am sure this makes it worse. I get a lot of tension/sinus headaches and pressure on many days along with the back/chest discomfort.   I started getting some heartburn/GERD symptomsd over the past several months as well, so my neurologist suspects it may overlap with the cervical symptoms (put me on some protonix about 2 weeks ago).  My current symptoms are just like thos in this original post, and have been for many months. Totally atypical for cardiac, although scary sometimes. The protonix sems to help with the indigestion/heartburn, although I still get daily burning & pinchy sensations in my esophagus/pharynx and even neck/mouth/nose areas! Hard to describe. Mostly right side, but not always. Quite irritated- maybe esophagitis? Then at the same time, my back is always tight and sore. All of these symptoms are worse when sitting for an extended period, versus when I am standing and active. Sometimes my upper chest muscles hurt if I run really hard in colder weather, but usually exercise makes everything feel better. Standing is definately better than sitting. The whole back/chest/sinus/headache and maybe even upper abdominal regions always feel connected in some way when I have such pains. Kind of weird- probably mostly muscle and neural,with some gastric and even sinus connection (I get lots of post nasal drip and wear a mouthsplint at night to help with snoring/possible apnea symptoms).   One final thought on all this- I had a numb/tingly and whitish looking tongue for many months about 1/2 year ago. The dentists did not think thrush/candida- rather they thought it was the Pro Health toothpaste. I switched toothpaste and things got better with the tongue but then all these esophagus/throat area things began. Is gthere any chance I may have really had a candida yeat infection on the tongue that somehow infected the esophagus area, causing esophagitis? It sounds rare since I am healthy with no known cancer, HIV, or immune disorders. Nonetheless...    Thanks! I would love to know how things with the original poster have worked out.\n\n",

    "title": "heaviness,pressure and burning sensations in lungs",
    "content": "Hello,  I am 28 yo male.Was a smoker for 10 years,I've stopped smoking 2 years ago with a relapse of one month this summer.I sometimes smoke 2-3 cigarettes in rare special occasions.During the 2004 I was diagnosed an Anxiety Disorder with Depression after experiencing strong emotional trauma while sailing on merchant ships.I have undergone a therapy and learned to live with symptoms and things were looking fine until this summer when I was exposed to a great amount of emotional stress again.At the end of September I've started to experience pain in the left side of the chest around heart. I went to my local doctor who prescribed me drugs for elevated blood pressure.After one week there was no change and symptoms worsened,pain started to radiate on left arm and neck who became stiffed and I even had one panic attack.I went to hospital did EKG and heart ultrasound and everything was fine no visible problems or deformations.I went back to my doctor and she told me its probably neurosis caused by high amount stress so I've stopped to worry so much.2 weeks ago I've smoked 3 cigarettes and few drinks and the next day I've started to feel strong pressure in my lungs after which came a burning sensation.My lungs felt kind of heavy and I've started to cough out white mucus,first I've thought it could be some kind of allergy but usually  never have allergy symptoms during this time of year.And I've started to feel some pain under my left shoulder blade went to my doctor again and she directed me to a pulmonologist  where I did chest X-Ray and spirometry.Both turned out fine and there were no visible problems on my lungs.Doctor gave me some antibiotics i was drinking for 5 days (today is my last day) but I don't see some major change in my state.The sensations of burning lungs,throat and pressure happen every few days for now but most of the time I have sensation of heaviness in the lungs accompanied with coughing out white mucus and dull pain around shoulder blades.Cough is more intense in the morning and after meals.I have also noticed I swallow a great amount of air while I eat and that is causing me to burp a lot after meals.I work as system and network administrator and I sit on a chair more then 12 hours a day.When I come home I again sit in front of a computer and work for many hours.Can you tell me what my lung problem might be,could it be all anxiety and stress related? Thank you for your time and patience.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  While generally what you describe does sound  very much like a classic somatic conversion syndrome due to anxiety and stress, the one thing that doesn't fit well with this is the productive cough, which could be, at least in part, a bizarre coincidence (these happen all the time, which is why sometiems an actual problem is missed due to the classic anxiety syndrome). It sounds as though you may have either asthma or bronchitis. The latter seems most likely because of the burning sensation you describe. You could even have a deep sinus infection which is draining into your chest postnasally during the night, which would explain the cough being worse in the morning.   I do think most of your symptoms  are classic for anxiety, and I hope you'll follow up with the appropriate professional for this, since it would seem you've had a traumatic experience in the past which set this off the first time. However, if you're still taking the antibiotic medicine, please finish it whole prescription, as you may have a respiratory infection (chest or sinus) in addition. If the productive cough continues, please let your doctor know, and follow up with  us here as well.  Best of luck to you. Please let us know how you are doing and if there is any additional information you feel might be helpful, please let us know.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello again,  Here is my situation report.After my antibiotic therapy I had no changes in my state.Cough still presisted sometimes with mucus sometimes without.I've as well started to see a therapyst due to my anxiety whic got worse due the physical symptomes I was experiencing.She put me on anti-depressant Seroxat(paroxetinum) and after one week of takeing I've developed a bad reaction to it (nausea,vomiting,restlessness and tiredness) and I've quited with pills after one week and I take now Helex(Alprazolamum 0,25) one or twice a day to help me relax and meet with my therapyst once a week.Symptoms still presisted and for a while I was thinking its was all \"in my head\" untill I've noticed a patern.Once after lunch I've laid down in my bed and an hour later experienced burning in my back like in lungs with pain and tightness,same happened after I went to a massage 1 hour after meal,and once when I was cleaning my yard and I was bending alot to pick up leaves from the ground 1 hour after meal as well.After I was done with work I've came back into the house and experienced same symptoms this with my throat feeling like it was on fire.I went to my primary care doctor again and she concluded I have GERD and prescribed me proton pump inhibitor Controloc(pantoprazolum 40mg).I am takeing it now for 5 days now.First week I am bound to take it two times a day once in the morning and once before I go to bed and after first week I am bound to take it once a day just before I go to bed.Therapy will last 3 weeks or more.I've started takeing small meals and not eating anything before I go to bed.I sleep with a pillow so my head is always elevated douring the night.I have noticed some little improvment I don't burb alot anymore and don't feel burning in my stomach like I've sometimes did but some other symptoms appeared.I have a mild throat inflamation that is lasting more then a week now and my doctor told me it could be easily GERD related as well as coughing after meals.Also I have sensations of lumps in my throat and esophagus like something is stuck there when I eperience those symptoms they tend to last whole day,other days they are slightly present or they are not.Throat inflamation is present all the time.I will undergo ear,throat and nose exam next week and my doctor sent me to check my thyroid hormones levels.Due to symptoms I am experiencing now is it possible my exophagus has been damaged due to GERD and if so how long is the healing perioid and when can expect some improvement?I did an alergy test as well that showed I am alergic to mold,dust,feathers,hair and plant fibers(corn,tobacco).Doctor prescribed me Telfast (fexofenadinum 180mg) to drink once a day if I feel it is necessary.I will keep you posted how things develop in next few weeks and I thank you for your time and understanding.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for this detailed followup. Everything, especially regarding the elaboration of the symptoms and how they are triggered, as well as the diagnosis of GERD and the treatment plan all make perfect sense. I think you may well have finally caught your suspect.  As for the injury to the esophagus and the healing time, it all depends upon the extent of irritation or even ulceration of the esophagus. The healing period can take from a few weeks to a few months, depending upon many factors, but you should at least note progressive improvement so long as you maintain the care plan, which is an excellent one and covers pretty much all the bases. Even when you feel significantly better you may require adherence to the same medications and other measures to prevent a return of the reflux. Right now it would seem you are doing everything right, and the healing appears to have begun, so you're on the right track.  I'll look forward to updates from you, especially when you've had the ENT workup. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello again,  I've had ear,nose throat exam and results were Diathesis Allergie,Rhinitis Allergie and was prescribed inhalatory therapy at spring time when I usualy have trouble with breathing and heavy cough.Doctor at clinic told me that throat inflamation could be easily connected to GERD but she found no evidence of throat damage or laryngitis.I went back to my primary care doctor where I have described her symptoms I am experiencing with my throat and tightness in the back.She told me that there is no need yet to see gastroenterologist and adviced me to take PPI she prescribed me before lunch instead and try to modify my lifestyle a bit more.It will take some more time to experiment in next to week to see if there is any kind of change.I've as well bought some remedies to enhance my home treatment.Those remedies include Aloe Vera juice i drink 15ml 20 min before a meal,a powder mixture containing minerals and elements who keep acid PH levels in order I drink one small glass of it after each meal and take a table spoon of honey.Symptomes I am experiencing vary from mild to moderate.One day I've had small portion of pasta and tomato souce,45 minutes later I've experienced sensations of tightness and pressure in the esophagus.I've ate one yogurt after that and felt some relif.The most common problem I have now is burning in my throat after I eat.Nearly every time I feel that symptom it lasts for an hour in its full intensity then it slowly subsides to a low level of intensity that lasts most of the day.Once I ate a small piece of a chease cake and experienced the burning aftewards so I have conculded that the quantity of food I am eating does not matter much.I wander if now I may be more sensitive on some kind of foods.My psychotherapist thinks GERD I am experiencing is closely connected to my anxiety and stress levels,and since the last 3 months of my life were dominated by those sensations I think that is a logical conclusion and I hope when my mental state improves so will my symptoms become less frequent and more easier to keep under control.I was presribed now mild antidepressant Luxeta 0,25mg (Sertralinum) to take once a day in the morning to help improve my state.(I've developed the bad reaction on the last one I was taking).Thats all for now,I will see how things develop in next few weeks and will keep you posted.Thank you for your time and patience.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello and thanks for the update. It does sound as though you've found the source of the problem. Just for the record, there are certain foods which will aggravate GERD more than others, tomato sauce being one (it has an effect similar to citrus fruits and juices) and also the cheesecake, which one wouldn't normally assume would do it, as well as whole milk (skim milk usually goes down just fine). As you've concluded, the symptoms are more affected by the type of food than the amount, although overeating will usually also trigger the effects, especially if one lies down shortly after a large meal.  Thanks again for the update and we'll look forward to more in the future. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Here is my newest update concering my state.The therapy of PPI prescribed by my primary care doctor had a minor effect so I have decided to see gastroenterologist who performed gastroscopy.There was no damage to the esophagus and stomach lining,and there was no presence of heliobacter pyroli.Doctor found some ulceration on duodenum whic he classified as dyspepsia.He discovered that my LES is weakened for some unknown reason and that is what is causing reflux.He presribed me PPI Controloc 20mg to take in the morning and Reglan(Metoclopramidum) 10mg to take before lunch and dinner for 2 months (one month has allready passed) and told me Reglan will help with strengthening my LES. I watch how and what I eat and there are no symptoms of pressure and burning sensations in my back and if they happen occasionally they last for 2 days.The only constant symptom I have for more then a month now is sore throat and it seems I just can't get rid of it yet.My psychotherapist belives I am experiencing Psychosomatic GERD due anxiety and emotinal stress I was undergoing for last 4 months and I experience some of it even now,whic would as well explain strong acid production in my stomach whic damaged my duodenum.I hope if I manage to get my stress and anxiety levels under control that full recovery is possible and it seems to me this will last few more months.To help me manage my anxiety levels psychotherapist presribed me 3 antidepressants so far to whom I have developed bad reaction.Mostly I feel nausea,restlessness and sleepiness.Last one prescribed is Cipralex (Escitalopramum) 5mgs a day and when I take it I feel tired and sleepy most of the day.To manage my stress levels I have created some excercise programs and increased the intake of a liquid.Thats it for now,I will keep you informed how things work out for me douring the next months.I thank you for your time and understanding and I wish you happy and sucessful new year.\n\n",

    "content": "I registered to let you know how this might help me with my situation. Your symptoms are extremely similar to mine (except the anxiety, fortunately). I also suffer from sinus infection and had a pneumonia in my teens that left some marks, specifically an allergic bronchitis. I've had those GERD symptoms for some time but never looked into them. But now, after getting \"the\" flu earlier this summer (H1N1, which I recovered from just fine), the cough and general stickiness have not gone away, even though I did recover fine from the flu, give the absence of all other symptoms after the normal duration of the virus attack.  Now, I'm starting to relate the GERD with my constant lung irritation for the past few weeks. On most meals (especially with white meat), I get stuck swallowing the food and I've been having \"liquid\" reflux on most mornings on my esophagus. My doctor has prescribed me with the normal antibiotic treatment for what she thought could be postnasal draining during the night. I finished the treatment with no improvements. After reading your process, I'm  starting to think my case could be a really close diagnostic to yours, so I'll bring these things to my doctor so it might help her treat this. :)  Again, thank you for taking the time to update your process, and I hope you're fully recovered from everything, and your anxiety and stress levels are back to normal.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there, I am 25 years old male and i find out that your symptoms are very similar to mine as well! I was a smoker for 10 years as well and I've stopped smoking 2 weeks ago.  I've had this problem for about almost 2 years already. Since i stopped smoking, i've had few cigarettes in few occasions(last of which was 2 days ago). First time i felt pain in the chest(right in the midle) was May, 2007 after having a cigarette and coffee back in my country. I felt shortage of breth for a minute and almost got a panick atack. Gave up smoking for the day and next morning felt a lot beter. Since that day i could feel cigarettes a lot more when i smoke, so i slowly lowered smoking hoping i will feel fine again at some point. Shortly after, i realized i have pain on left shoulder and upper back/neck which became stiffed and still are untill present day(you can also hear a crack when i move my left shoulder up and down). Few months ago I've started to experience pain in the left side of the chest around heart and right in the middle of the chest as well. I, as well stay for long periods of time behind the computer, so i was thinking this could be the reason(and the cold winters in Chicago too), but with pains in my chest comming and going I became very scared. I went to the doctor 3 days ago, and she told me my lungs sound good and i probably have shoulder problem(didn't give me x-ray). 2 days ago, i went out to a birthday party, had some cigarettes and some alcohol and yesterday i had the pains in the chest almost all day(comming and going). More often i feel short sharp short pains and sometimes it feels like a burning sensation or hartburn. Pain does not become worse with deep breaths. It is not triggered by pushing on areas of my chest. I have pressure in the throat and am coughing out white mucus for a long time but i don't actually have a cough(just feeling the need to take the mucus out)and last night i kind of think i had some problem swaloing my food.. What i notice is when i am physically active and don't think about it that much i feel better, especially after exercising. I ussualy don't have shortness of breath, but can feel/hear some wheezing right under my shoulders, when i do some streching - moving left and right with my hands behhind my head. I also had some panic attacks in the past and i do get very stressed lately having some financial problems as well as this too!  Please help!! :(\n\n",

    "content": "I'm 53, female, 160 lbs. (post-menopausal) Beginning of symptoms: Onset: 10/4 3:00 a.m. chest pain rated:6 or 7 with all over body malaise, upset stomach. Never had chest pains or twinges before that. At some point, just prior or just after (can't remember when) I took a fall downstairs.  Woke up again at 7:00 a.m. All symptoms gone except pain in left chest. Next day very, very tired. Stayed in bed all day. Next day slept till 11:00 a.m. Pain reduced to about 5. Next day and thereafter: Symptoms: chest pain on upper left chest. Feels like I was punched in the chest. Pain level at 3 next day and has gradually subsided (now 11/1) to .5 during the day and 2 in the morning. At first, couldn't sleep laying down. Now I can but it always hurts more laying down. Pain is dull, sometimes burning, ripping. I'm hoarse. I am tired. It always feels 'wrong', a few times a day the pain will come up to a 2 for 5-10 seconds. Stress exacerbates it.   Only since and because of the onset of these symptoms have I taken meds.  Have had: EKG, Blood tests, Stress Echo, CT Scan. All show nothing.  Any insights you may have or resources you could point me to would be extremely appreciated.   I DO NOT have: Difficulty swallowing, breathing, coughing or moving. Pain does not become worse with deep breaths. Pain is not triggered by pushing on areas of my chest. I do not have heartburn or notice any change in symptoms after a meal. I do not have gas, burping or abdominal discomfort or pain. I do not have heartburn, acid reflux or taste stomach fluid. I am not vomiting, not anorexic or jaundiced or anemic. I don't do drugs. I do not have a burning tongue, sore tongue, sore throat, red tongue. I do not have diarrhea, fever, unsteadiness, or general muscle pain. I do not have trouble swallowing. The pains are not sharp or shooting. Pains do not seem to be connected to heart rate.  I do not feel that 'something bad is going to happen' or that I'm going to die. I don't (and didn't) feel 'out of control, sweaty, clammy, panic. I don't have chills.   I didn't feel anxious before this happened. I don't think I have arthritis or any more joint pains than anyone else who is 53. I have not had any respiratory infections lately. I do not have high blood pressure, chills, night sweats.\n\n",

    "content": "11/09 Pain has now moved mostly to the center of my chest and has gotten worse at night. It is now a combination of pain (about 3) and a feeling like there is unusual activity in my heart rhythm. The burning is now primarily in the region of the ascending aorta. I am getting about 4 - 5 hours sleep now and getting extremely fatigued since this happens every night without fail and seems to be getting worse over the last week.  Although the pain is different (doesn't feel so unorganized) I am not able to lie down to rest during the day because every time I do the chest pain gets worse (from about .5-1 to 1-2). My family practitioner has me on a beta blocker and has increased the dose but it doesn't seem to give me any relief. I have been wondering if this is Prinzmetal's  or maybe PVC. I read that PVC's can be a complication of stress cardiomyography. What are your thoughts on what is happening? Should I see a cardiologist instead of my family practitioner?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Sheila -- I find this very troubling, even though the fairly thorough workup revealed nothing. This definitely does not sound like anxiety-related symptomology (although it could be inferred in many other cases); it does sound like something possibly heart-related, even though all those tests came up negative. You have several major risk factors for heart disease and even though you've had a fairly decent rule-out, I'd like to know what a followup EKG might look like even though you've had a very reasonable ruleout thus far. Women often have downright peculiar (by textbook standards) presentations of both ischemic heart disease and acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The latter can often resolve without damage showing on a resting 12-lead EKG, and your description of initial and subsequent symptoms just sounds way too much like the newly-classic female ACS to just assume it's not that. You may have dodged an initial bullet -- and I may be totally wrong about this -- but with your family history, being post-menopausal and having had such classic atypical symptoms, sometimes a woman requires a more aggressive workup to expose the disease that might well be obvious in a man. Why this is so is still being debated, but we know it can happen.   There are a few other potential problems this also could be, and those would include a pulmonary embolism (PE) and aortic aneurysm (the latter seeming less and less likely as the symptoms subside). I would want to have PE ruled out (the CT may have cleared up any question about an aneurysm) and coronary issues very thoroughly eliminated. There has to be an explanation for this event and your family history just screams for a second look at the heart. There is such a thing as microvascular disease in women also (not exclusively but overwhelmingly for sure) in which the smaller vessels are involved and it is often difficult to visualize damage or even frank ischemia. There is also the possibility of spasm of a coronary artery, which doesn't last more than 20 minutes initially, and usually resolves spontaneously without having caused any damage. It can be detected by EKG while it's happening, but rarely afterward.   This could well be something utterly unrelated to the heart, but something keeps gnawing at me, given the family history and your description of the symptoms. I'd want every possible, feasible test done to try and provoke the symptoms and located the problem. Also the potential for PE is still up in the air. Also, something of an afterthought, but hoarseness and \"ripping\" sensation associated with the pain could suggest, again, aortic aneurysm. A CT aimed directly at this (not certain where or how specific your CT was done) could help clarify.   Wish I could give you a better answer, but this is a really difficult one. Please follow up with us here as needed, and especially if anything new comes to light. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi again: Your subsequent posts showed up here after my initial response. At this point I do believe you should see a cardiologist because all the things you describe are at least consistent with potenial heart problems and especially with aortic dissection. An MRI (or CT, I personally favor MRI) of the ascending aorta and arch would likely disclose any funny business in that area, and this is important to rule out/in ASAP, so you can either leave the worry behind or get things repaired right away, depending on what shows up.   At this point (and the beta blocker was appropriate but isn't curative) it's important to know just what's happening. If heart and vascular problems can be ruled out that's great. If one or the other are ruled in, that's extremely important, and the sooner we know, the better. Cardiologist is the next logical step. Please don't hesitate and please follow up with us here as needed, and keep us updated also. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -- Somehow half the posts you put up on the same date showed up after I'd replied to the first two. In response to the rest, yes, Valium (and other similar benzodiazapine drugs) can often reduce the frequency of palpitations, since they are very often increased by anxiety and/or stress. So that's one thing that sometimes does help to partially relieve them.  As for the Prinzmetal's angina suspicion, I can see why, now that I know your episodes tend to occur regularly during the night. This is very common among those with Prinzmetal's. This can be tested for via chemical stimulation during angiography, so if it becomes more than just a suspicion this could be checked out that way. If you do have that problem it is often amenable to calcium channel blocker drugs.\n\n",

I've noticed that  pain on the left and right are relieved with Valium and/or aspirin and wondering if the hoarseness and left and right pain may have anything to do with vasospasms.

    "content": "Mr. Kenyon, Thank you so very much for your replies. I have read your replies to others and am so touched by your intelligent, well thought out and caring answers.   Once again, I am writing with an update on my condition. I had an event monitor but gave it up after ending up in the ER and told there was nothing wrong with my heart. But I did go to the hospital and retrieve the even monitor report myself along with a copy of the event monitor printout.   The interpretation says:   \"The patient is a 53-year-old female who underwent event monitoring for a history  of chest pain and palpitations\" [by the way, as I mentioned earlier - the 'history' started abruptly one day in October 2009].  \"A total of 9 events were recorded.  Each event was associated with sinus rhythm with occasional changes in QRS configuration consistent with an ectopic focus or wandering atrial pacemaker.  There was no evidence of ventricular dysrhythmias, artrial fibrillation, or atrial flutter. IMPRESSION: Nine events associated with normal sinus rhythm with occasional ectopic atrial focus\".  [end of report]  The QRST segments in some cases look like a kindergarten kid just scribbled all over the page.   Can you tell me anything about what this report suggests? I will of course follow up with a cardiologist but a different one than the one I once saw who told me that there was nothing wrong with my heart and that once I was assured the symptoms would go away....well, they haven't.  I know that atypical signs of impending heart attack are very often (80%) missed in women and I need to find a cardiologist that is going to take my symptoms seriously and don't feel that one did.   I am not one to quickly rush to the doctor. In fact, more the other way. At 53 I have only had 2 mammograms and 2 pap smears my whole life and I think 2 physicals. I know that is not recommended but I am only saying that to point out that if I didn't really believe something was really wrong I wouldn't be going to the doctor. My symptoms have changed since the day this started in October 2009 but my life is still upside down. I can't work a full day without getting hoarse, tired, chest pains and PVCs for two days afterward. I had a vibrant, full life before October. Something changed dramatically in one day. I am still taking Valium  but aspirin helps just as much with chest pains on the left and right but doesn't seem to affect the pain that is substernal. I have never taken Valium before and only had morphine once in the hospital. I am afraid of getting addicted to it if I can't get to the bottom of this.  Thankfully I am sleeping better, not being woken by pain in the early hours---maybe because of the Valium--since I started taking the Valium--but still wake up feeling like my chest is heavy sometimes. The substernal pressure which is better now is constant in varying degrees throughout the day, depending on the level of stress and also depending on the amount of activity/stimulation the day before.  I am constantly tired--that never changes.  I am off the beta blocker and the cardiologist took me off the Coreg. My BP is 147/81 and HR 85 around 2:00 p.m. Last night my HR was 58 with 3,5 and 7 PVCs in a row. Any other information, suggestions, etc. would be appreciated. Thank you.\n\n",

    "title": "Upper respiratory problems are they causing my torticollis ?",
    "content": "I have torticollis, supposedly idiopathic, I say supposedly because I feel that I cannot breathe properly and I know respiratory infections can cause torticollis. I recently bought a powerbreathe to help increase or open up my breathing and after a few times of using it a lump of puss came up into my mouth obviously dislodged from down in my airway somewhere. I spat the lump of puss out into my hand \u2013 it was about 5 to 7mm in diameter and smelt foul. It was white and soft, I squashed it between my fingers easily.   Is this puss ball a possible sign of upper respiratory infection? I used to smoke heavily some years back. Also I had a bad ear infection around the same time as my torticollis started, or just before, this ear infection could also be related to any respiratory problem and/or my torticollis as it never really went away even with antibiotics \u2013 I got used to have a dodgy ear and carried on with life. I\u2019ve had MRI\u2019s and x-rays on my neck and xrays on my lungs, all show up nothing at all. Although they would not have been looking for inner ear problems. I also went to see a lung specialist/breathing specialist who listened to my chest and made me breathe into a tube etc and he said I was fine even though I can feel that my breathing definitely isn\u2019t fine.   I don\u2019t breathe with my stomach it feels as though I breathe with my throat. I\u2019ve tried meditation and very light soft relaxed breathing which released my chest for an instant, this release in my upper chest hurt quite badly \u2013 a very sharp pain perhaps as the muscles released from spasm or released from being clogged up/being inactive for so long who knows.  What can I do about this? Is it possible that the MRI\u2019s and xrays missed am upper respiratory infection or inner ear infection??  Should I get a CT scan done? Any help or advice you can give me will be very gratefully received. Rgrds Robert.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Upper respiratory problems are they causing my torticollis ?",
    "content": "Hello -- While torticollis would not be directly contributory to any respiratory infection, it could have started at the time of the onset of the ear infection, which sometimes happens -- or it may be totally unrelated. The fact you had the ear infection suggests a deep sinus infection and that could account for the phlegm ball you brought up. So could a mild, encapsulated pneumonia. However, since you've had lung x-rays which would have disclosed any pneumonia I strongly suspect the phlegm was due to nocturnal postnasal sinus drainage. Since the phlegm ball was relatively firm it likely came from the bronchial tree, which is where this stuff often lodges after drifting down from the sinuses, especially in conditions of low humidity (very dry air, hot air heat, cold weather, etc.).   The torticollis could be indirectly related to a respiratory infection, especially one that involved the ear or ears, but it's now become chronic regardless of the precipitating factor, and needs to be treated on its own. If you still feel some respiratory discomfort despite a clean bill of health, you may want to try using a plain expectorant for a while, as well as taking warm, steaming showers and/or inhaling cool steam, as you still may have some residual crud in your bronchi, even though you're moving air out okay. A good expectorant is guaifenesin, which is sold under the brand name Mucinex. Even a breathiing treatment at your doctor's office could help clear out any residue from past postnasal drainage (PND).   Hope this helps. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi John, many thanks for your help its much appreciated. The expectorant sounds like a great idea and I will get onto it asap. I realise my breathing difficulty could be a result of some kind of brain malfunction which is what the neuros tell me causes my torticollis however since my (and most others) torticollis came on over a number of years it seems to me that my poor breathing could have lead to my torticollis excerbated by extreme stress and my ear infection amongst other things. If it took say 10 years of stress and poor breathing to get torticollis then it seems only reasonable that it will take just as long if not more to get rid of it with good breathing and no stress. If my body has learnt stress over long periods then it also seems reasonable that it could have turned off this section of my brain which they say causes torticollis through learned behaviour and trauma, the brain does after all learn from our behaviour and choices in life.  With this in mind I will endeavour to get my breathing as good and relaxed as possible and it can only help my condition improve over the coming years. I will get a good expectorant as directed to help get rid of any mucus which may be causing some of my breathing problems.  Thanks again and have a good Christmas! Rob\n\n",

You are essentially correct in your reasoning, although correcting learned faulty breathing (and other things,such as postural \"posing\",etc.) can sometimes be unlearned more quickly than it takes to learn it. However, you make a very, very good point about the neurological imprint process and this may well be of great value to other readers passing through here.

    "content": "Hi John, thanks for your support once again and yes I'll be sure to keep you and this post updated with any progress I may make. My breathing is getting slowly better through meditation and Chi Kung and I also use a powerbreathe to open up my chest and work my diagphram whilst lying on my back. I have deifnitely noticed a small release of tension in my abdomen and my breathing is definitely affacted for the better. No change to my neck but my sense of well being is a lot better than it was, this also down to taking panax ginseng in the past which worked well for me and has curbed my anxiety.  I'm looking into getting some other drugs for my torticollis but this time from a Psychiatrist rather than a neurologist. Its funny the levedopa I tried effects the D1 dopamine receptors and that help parkinsons and dystonia and is under neurology and the drug I want to try effects the D3,4 and 5 rceptors and comes under Psychiatry. Clearly there is a very fine line in spasmodic torticollis between being classed as slightly mad or having a movement disorder. Here's a link to some drug information for Torticollis: http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1152543-treatment  I've tried levedopa, benzodiazepines, clonozepam, baclofen, artane, botox for years and a few others but I have never tried or been offered some of the drugs in the above link mainly due to the fact that the antipsychotics can cause torticollis but they can also help it which must be hard for neurologists to prescribe as they are unsure of the reaction. Anyway I will be trying some of these soon hopefully with good results. If not my breathing will get me there eventually I'm sure, fingers crossed anyway, it certainly can't do any harm and will make me calmer.  All the best to you and have a good 2010  Kind regrads Rob\n\n",

The pain goes away, but I always feel a strange \"fullness\" sensation on the left side of my chest cavity compared to my right.  I have had a chest xray and a sputum test showing nothing.  My doctor thinks it is seasonal allergies but I think it is something more.   She also thinks it may be due to my mild pectus excavatum (indentation of chest physically disrupting my left lung, yet in that case, i would have suffered from this from a long time back!)  Please help!!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Chronic mucus production in left lung, dull back pain.",
    "content": "Hello -- While the negative findings of chest x-ray and sputum culture are indeed encouraging, it is odd, and while you've not had this previously despite mild pectus excavatum, we frequently hear, in many different types of situations, \"I didn't have this before.\" Sometimes things just eventually change. You also could well have developed some mild asthma which could be new and which might be worsened by even a mild Pec-Ex. An AsthmaCheck device, a cheap, simple gizmo most doctors have in supply in the office, could help determine if you have any obstruction to your breathing. If not you may well have some post-nasal drainage either due to allergy or sinus infection, which can often wind up in the bronchii and cause a productive cough. If this is the case the problem will need to be treated directly.   Other than the AsthmaCheck test, which simply involves blowing into the little platic device to move a pointer on a scale (hopefully to somewhere between 350 - 500) you may actually need the services of an ENT specialist.   Hope this is helpful. Good luck to you. Please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: chest pain and trouble breathing",
    "content": "Hello -  What you describe sounds very much like pleurisy or at least pleuritic-like pain. This can be due to something as simple as inflammation of the chest wall muscles or the pleura (the lining that separates the lungs from the chest wall). It can be excruciatingly painful and usually is aggravated by deep breathing, which leads to a sense of not being able to draw a full, satisfying breath. It can lead to anxiety and it also can, sometimes, be caused by the deep, sighing respirations of people who are already anxious.  Of course there could be some other, equally benign reason for the pain, but it would still be described as \"pleuritic\" because of the way it is related to breathing and the pain pathway sounds like that of pleurisy or muscle inflammation.  Often all that's needed is an over-the-counter anti-inflammatory pain medication like ibuprofin or naprosyn. You probably would do well to bring this to the attention of a doctor if it doesn't improve with self-treatment, but it is, in all likelihood, not serious.   Hopefully this is helpful to you. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

Then an hour later my chest got more tighter and started to hurt when i took deep breaths, hurt to swallow food or drink, tried laying down that made my chest pain worse. At one time the pain shot to my left arm for a second then went away. When i went to bed that night i had to lay and stay laying on my stomach to even be able to lay down. This morning woke up pain was gone. When i picked up my 5 month old baby the pain arose again starting off short breath and ended up being like it was before and now pain is in my throat chest is tight and between breast it is sore to touch. I do at times have panic attacks, but now like this i don't know if it could be to stress, which i havent felt or if it is serious enough i should physical go see a doctor. Your insight would be very helpful thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -- Laryngotracheobronchitis or adult croup is fairly rare, but it happens, and it can be pretty tenacious, although it usually runs its course in less than a week, at leas with treatment. You've been give the appropriate meds but still feel some chest tightness. You may only need an expectorant or a breathing treatment to help loosen thick exudate, but you really shouldn't be feeling much in the way of symptoms by now and it might be wise to contact your doctor and just let him know how things are progressing (or not). This syndrome is usually just a major annoyance, but it does have the potential for serious complications, so if you have any frank difficulty exchanging air or if you have difficulty swallowing you should get yourself in to see the doctor or to the ER. Otherwise, just let your doctor know at at 6 days you're still feeling some tightness.   Hope this helps. Good luck to you and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

The chest pain usually lasts just a few seconds, and repeats itself a few times over the course of a few minutes, and then goes away. The occurence of the chest pain is random, but almost always when I'm not active, such as doing school work or working on my computer, and does not leave me short of breath. I know I should go to the ER for this, but the last time I did for something serious, they took over an hour to get me in, and then I waited another hour for someone to see me (and this was on an off-night), to finally conclude with them believing there was nothing wrong at all (it later turned out to be a hemorrhoid that was coming open). Can anyone offer any advice as to what I should do?\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 24 year old female. I'm 5'9 and I currently weigh 265 pounds. Ive had weight problems most of my life, but I was not this overweight most of my life since I was very active from 5 years old to 19 years old, participating in sports most of my life. I was 215 pounds 2 years ago so I have let myself go and gained quite a bit. For the past month, I have started Weightwatchers and working out slowly to get back to how I used to be.  About a month ago, after I had woken up, I was laying in bed and out of nowhere from when I was leaning over the bed to grab something, I had strange chest pains. It occurred right in the center of my chest but very high up, on top of my breasts. It felt like something was really stretched so there was tightening and pressure in the center, I had my fist over it for 2 minutes while the pain occured and then it just went away. It felt sore for about 10 minutes but that had not happened for a while. A week later, the exact same thing occurred to me while I was driving for 2 minutes..I almost felt like I had to pull over but it went away. It had not happened to me again for a while. One day, when I went to the gym, I was stretching for warm ups, and I felt a little pain during one exertion and it was sore in the specific area on my left side right on top of my breast. I did not feel it again but since then, very randomly and for little periods of time, I would feel that specific spot on my left side on top of breast feel sore, or ache or even have a sharp pain for a minute. I ignored it because it did not feel serious since it was random and for little periods of time.  This past friday, while I was sleeping, I had the attack again come to me and it woke me up. It was in center of my chest and it felt like it lasted a little longer...about a few minutes and it stopped again. However, since that day, I have felt more pains all through out my chest. That specific spot on my left side as I mentioned above still occurred more frequently and it still does. Saturday night, I am embaressed to say this, but I had went out for Halloween and had way too much to drink. I was extremely car sick on the way home and wanted to puke a little bit to get the alcohol out. When I had gagged myself, I spit up blood but I didn't vomit. After that, I did not do anything. I did not want to irritate it or anything but seeing blood worried me alot. However, the pain started radiating through my right side, and after a few days it radiated through my back. Now there is pains all over my back...many times it feels like theres a sharp  poke in random areas on my back and it'll feel like that for an hour or more. It is very uncomfortable and scary. Only at night between 1-3 am I feel shallow breathing for 30 minutes or so. It might be because I am worried. I went to the doctor 2 days ago, and she said she did not think it was my heart and thought it was anxiety attacks but we decided it could not be that because I am not that type of person to have something like that. She then gave me Nexium ( strong acidic meds ) to take for few weeks and see if it helps with the pain since it may be Acid Reflux.  It helps a little but the pain is still there and it pokes me in such random spots that it is starting to drive me crazy.   I do not have insurance so we did not schedule for an X-Ray ( the doc said she'd do it if it made me feel better, not because she felt it was emergency) but I am in the middle of getting insurance from the state so it would take 2 weeks for me to finally get covered. I really wanted more doctor's opinions because I feel like something's wrong.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -- The initial presentation with sudden, sharp pains that were superficial and left you with soreness/tenderness in the area sound like they may be a totally different thing from what's been happening more recently (the Unfortunate Coincidence phenomenon). Those first episodes sound a lot like Tietz's syndrome, or costochondritis, an inflammation of the connetive tissue between the ribs where they connect to the sternum. This often can be aggravated by certain postures or positions, and the tenderness upon manual pressure strongly suggests this. It is usually a transient condition although it sometimes can be chronic. It responds to over-the-counter anti-inflammatories such as Aleve and Advil. The later pain, however, sounds more visceral, and could well be due to acid reflux or some other non heart-related issue. The trial of Nexium should help prove or disprove that idea in fairly short order. The fact you wound up vomiting some blood also could go along with reflux disease or even just plain gastritis (often the two are similar or may go hand-in-hand). There are other possibilities, but this seems like a reasonable approach your doctor is taking, given all you've described. Anxiety certainly could become a component as well, and always helps cloud the picture somewhat.   I'd definitely try consistent use of the Nexium for at least a month. If, of course, anything significantly different or worse shows up you should get yourself to an emergency facility right away, but I feel it's fairly safe betting on gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) possibly co-existing with Tietz's syndrome. Treating for GERD would make the most sense, especially if you find this causes an improvement in the symptoms.  Hope this is helpful to you. Please follow up with us here as needed, and update us as to how this all unfolds. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -- Your second post wasn't put up til after my response to the first one had posted, so I apologize for any seeming inconsistency. I'm glad to hear the pain is better, and with the additional information I still feel the first answer was probably the right one, but given your current weight this also could be an even more simple matter of excess fatty tissue in the abdomen having no place to go and so pressing against the diaphragm and phrenic nerve when you attempt to bend at the waist. First, obviously, don't do that if it hurts. Second, it may be useful to have an upper GI study done, as people with your degree of obesity are more prone to develop hiatal hernia, which also can produce these symptoms. While hiatal hernia is most often treated with the same meds as GERD (ie: Nexium) there are sometimes additional things that can be done to minimize the discomfort.   Hypothyroidism could certainly help explain the weight problem, and this needs to be explored further to determine if it is a factor. Meanwhile I'm glad the Nexium seems to have helped some, and this is strongly suggestive of either GERD, hiatal hernia or a combination of the two. This is hardly surprising given the weight you've put on. If thyroid is a factor, this should be encouraging, as proper treatment of that should help the weight loss program that is going to be necessary in any case.  Please keep in touch.\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for your responses...I was doing a lot of research this week because the pains came back. I haven't had attacks at all since Ive taken the pills but my chest has gotten a lot more sore and tender and I can't even lay down facing downwards or bend over deep because it feels like my chest wall is falling off. My upper back is starting to be sore and hurt as well...it gets to the point now where it hurts to turn as well sometimes. Ive been more tired as well and sleep seems to help along with a lot of water. I realized the diet green tea I was drinking had citric acid which could explain for the pain coming back, and the nexium does help...should I keep taking this for a longer periods of time because my doctor gave me two weeks worth? the only thing that has not gone away or help is the chest muscles and soreness...I work out with a trainer 2 times a week, and some exercises involving my chest wall, I can't do because it hurts...it feels like it's weak. What is that feeling where if im laying down face downwards, it feels like it falls off?? Also, the past two days, I have felt like a inflammation feeling on my back, like a burning/small vibration feeling going all around which makes it sore.    Also still no period as well...it's almost 2 months and a half now, and I'm not pregnant. My doctor didn't think I needed a thyroids test because I took one last winter since I noticed a lot of symptoms of thyroids occuring but there was no sign of thyroids in my blood tests.\n\n",

    "content": "You're very welcome. You definitely seem to have two different things going on at once. The GERD seems to have responded well to the Nexium, so it would be wise to continue that for a while, since there is often healing that needs to take place in the upper GI tract, and the medication will allow that.  The thoracic soreness is definitely musculoskeletal, probably inflammatory in nature, and may be widespread in the ribcage. Could also be due to thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS), which can be posturally caused or due to overweight, heavy lifting, any number of external things, and also can be congenital. It's not serious except for the discomfort and mild disability it can cause, and for this reason is also worth exploring.   Please keep us updated. Thyroid testing would seem to be indicated, especially with the missing period. Let us know how things unfold. Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 24 year old female, have always been very healthy. I am 29 weeks pregnant with my 2nd child.   A few weeks ago I was rushed into hospital with sever pains in chest and back and vomitting. after 4 hours it dissapeared and i was discharged with no idea what was happening. for the past few days I have not been sleeping very well, I have tingles all over my body though it seems very centred on my right arm and hand. I've had a lot of bad migraines and yesterday I had an extremelt bad nose bleed. everything seemed ok after that but I woke up in agony through night, It was so bad i was in tears. It felt at first like someone had been staming on my chest. My ribs where killing me. The pain started in the top of my back, mainly in the centre. Felt like someone had rammed a knife in and was constantly moving it around. I threw up 4 times and took me a few hours to loose the pain but it did not go completely. This is similar to what happened the first time when i was rushed to hospital. I've noticed that i have a bad loss of appitite also but i have put that down to the pregnancy.  I'm really worried about this. A friend suggested the first time that it may be something to do with acid but I have not suffered from any problems whatsoever with acid before and during my pregnancy.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -- This is a very strange presentation, but one thing that should be ruled out is pressure on the diaphragm and phrenic nerve (or one of the other major thoracic nerves) due to the pregnancy. This is one of the few things I can think of that might be causing this sort of combination of bizarre symptoms, and it's not unreasonable to assume, especially when lying down, this could be causing both the chest and back pain of the sort described, and even the vomiting. It may well not be the answer, but exploring this possibility will at least bring attention nearer the problem area, which is almost certainly somewhere in the same vicinity. This is the best I can come up with at this moment, and it's a reasonable guess.   Please stay in touch with us here and keep us updated as to what happens. Hopefully this can be resolved soon. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi I have been suffering from all sorts of chest pains for a long while now.  Something that seems to make my pains worst is alcohol is if I just have a beer or 2, the next day I nearly always get very back pains around top front of the left side of my chest around where my heat is. It almost feels like I get cramp in my heart and its very very painful to the extent that sometimes I think I could be having some sort of heart attack. The serious pain and cramp feeling will only last a few seconds but after that i'm left with a very dull pain and almost feels like it wants to cramp up again. I also get painful palpitations/heart beats that just last for a second.  My chest had never been right after a very bad chest infection.  I'm getting very concerned about this. I have been to the doctor many time and have had many ECGs and chest xrays but nothing ever shows up.  I'm currently getting physiotherapy in the hope that it might be Costochondritis but the physio can't really replicate the pain when pushing on certain areas i've tried lots of different anti-inflammatory drugs and they make no difference also i have had one electroacupuncture session and that didnt seem to help.  I'm really stuck with where to go and who to see as I feel I have tried everything.  Any help or pointers will be much appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  First,  if I were you I'd probably lay off the beers if they seem to aggravate the problem. While there's no clear reason why alcohol should cause heart pain, it does apparently play a role in your chest discomfort. I suspect, based on what you've described as well as the fact that heart disease has pretty much been ruled out, plus the fact that this has been going on for seven years without getting better or worse (heart disease would have gotten worse once it becomes unstable enough to cause chest pain at rest). and considering the fact that the severe pain only lasts a few seconds, that your problem is probably one of the upper GI tract. It sounds like it could be simple gas (beer contains a lot of bublles), or perhaps acid reflux, maybe causing what's called, oddly enough, cardiospasm, which is actually a very painful spasm of the esophagus (which is comprised of cardiac muscle). You might try an over-the-counter anti-GERD medication like Prilosec, or perhaps you could get your doctor to prescribe a more potent one for you. If you are going to continue to beer (no real problem there if it's just a couple now and then), perhaps you should try taking Prilosec a few hours before you drink or even after, but before the symptoms begin.   If your physiotherapist can't duplicate the pain via manual pressure, it probably isn't costochondritis, which almost always can be located manually. I think it is an internal, probably GI-related issue. Give this some thought and maybe try the Prilosec (or some similar product) and see what happens.   By all means follow up with us here, too, especially if you get no relief. Good luck to you.\n\n",

I'll try taking the tablets before a few drinks and see if that makes any difference.  The only thing that puzzles me is it all started when I have a extremely bad chest infection.  I would say the pain has very slowly got worst. I didn't used to get what I can only describe and muscle/cramps in my chest that feels like pain from my heart. This could be as you said a cardiospasm, I will try some strong tablets for acid reflux and see if that helps. Is it possible this could have all been caused by a chest infection>?

    "content": "Hello again -  You're very welcome. It seems unlikely this sort of problem would be related to a former chest infection (and I am assuming you mean a respiratory infection like bronchitis or pneumonia, correct?). The mechanism seems to follow the path of drink several beers, gas collects, gurgling takes place, then the pain follows. It actually can be quite painful. See if the tablets help and if so you probably have your answer. If not, I'd still be inclined to think the next stop should probably be a gastroenterologist, but probably your GP first.

This pain would occur on the left side of my chest, near the heart area. I like to sleep on my back and sometimes role to the side and feel the sudden sharp pain for a good 10 seconds. The ideas I have come up with at first was swimming competitively. But now I haven't swam in a while and 5 months later the pain is back.          I started drinking alcohol at parties when i graduated from high school and now that the cross-country season is over i started drinking again. And this is where the pain comes in.

    "content": "For abs012: This isn't a heart-related condition, and your notion of the location of the heart, like so many people's, is off a little (to the left). Your heart is in the center of your chest, beneath the breast bone. Heart pains are almost never sharp, stabbing or sticking in nature, and are never elicited by pressure or posture. This sounds very much like costchondritis, an inflammation of the cartilege between the ribs, and is quite benign but also often pretty uncomfortable. It responds well to over-the-counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (such as ibuprofin or naproxyn as Advil or Aleve respectively). This happens in both training athletes, athletes in lapsed training (that would be you) and just plain folks who maybe lifted something or moved the wrong way. It can also be caused virally, so it can happen to anyone. Alcohol's relationship, in any case, would be coincidental most likely. There's no logical reason for alcohol cosumption to cause any sort of pain (other than possible liver or stomach pain in somone with advanced alchol-related disease). This is chest-wall soreness you're describing.   I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -- What you describe sounds like very typical residual bronchial sputum (phlegm) of the sort left behind after an acute respiratory infection. You may well have had flu of one strain or another, and H1N1 does seem to affect people with a history of asthma more than others, but most flu strains do anyway. You seem to be recovering nicely. I'd suggest use of an expectorant like guaifenesin (brand name of a long-acting type is Mucinex). This will loosen the remaining sputum by liquifying it, making it easier to cough it up. From the sound of things this is probably all you need. The rattle is due to loosening bronchial secretions. Off-white is a desireable color for this stuff, by the way. Brownish, bright yellow or greenish would suggest an ongoing infection. It doesn't sound like pneumonia, either, which usually will produce some deep, low chest aching and additional fever.   Hope this helps. Good luck to you. Please follow up with us here as needed\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -- It seems most reasonable to suspect the left-sided chest pain is a lingering result of the fall from bed during the seizure. You may have cracked a rib or irritated some connective tissue between the ribs. If it's worse at night I am guessing this is mostly when you're lying down and trying to sleep, and lying position often will aggravate this problem. It usually responds very well to over-the-counter anti-inflammatory pain meds like ibuprofin (Advil) and naproxyn (Aleve). This might be worth a trial to see if it helps the problem. If not, you may need to have a physical exam which might include imaging (x-ray or CT scan) of the area to see if there's anything out of place.   Hope this is helpful. Good luck to you.

    "title": "Re: Female, 26, Sharp apin upon awakening",
    "content": "Hello -- This really sounds musculoskeletal in nature, perhaps some inflammation of the cartilege between the ribs or where they attach to the sternum. Quite often lying on them or just lying flat can cause the stiffness to manifest as pain on getting up from the lying position, especially if the inflammation is, as is most common, in the front. You of course could have something else going on, perhaps a nerve impingement, but it really sounds first and foremost like costochrondritis, that inflammation of the rib cartilege. This can be quite painful, especially on changing position, and then resolves after being upright a while. It can cause pain and restricted sensation on breathing, also.   The best solution to this will be to be examined by a medical doctor. Short of that all we can do is speculate, at a distance, based on the description you've supplied, and in that regard it very much sounds like what I've mentioned above. If this is the case it often responds very well to non-steroidal anti-inflammatories such as Advil or Aleve, and you might try this if you haven't already. Hopefully you will get insurance soon or find a medical practice that will work with you on price and payment (which is becoming more commonplace as more people find themselves without health insurance).

In other individuals, bradycardias may indicate some underlying abnormality.Symptomatic (Symptoms of bradycardia include fainting, dizziness, extreme tiredness, and shortness of breath) bradycardias should always be investigated.  In your case, as the symptoms came on during exertion,it is possible that at that point of time,you had developed a new dysrhythmia or prehaps your heart rate failed to increase proportionately.Are you an any medications(such as beta blockers?)  'Sick sinus syndrome' may need to be excluded.The other likely candidate is 'exercise- induced hyperkalemia',which can precipitate an acute change in cardiac rhythm.  You may not have experienced any problem during stress testing  because the level of stress might not have equalled the stress of running.I think you need to be tested further to exclude some underlying cause.

I am a non smoker but Over the last week I have been spitting up excessive and dark phlegm in the morning and thinking nothing of it. Two nights ago I was playing with my 6 year old and noticed a pain in my left arm/shoulder and thought nothing of it. I do not know if this is related but the other night I was coming out of a function at my sons school and all of the sudden i had sharp stabbing pains in the lower part of my chest. It did not feel like my heart and was on both sides down low like the bottom area of my rib cage. It was quite disabling and I had shortness of breath. It was difficult for me to walk to the car and my wife thought i was having a heart attack but I did not think it was my heart. After sitting in the car for a min it subsided. But once i got out of the car it started hurting again very very painfull stabbing pain. and it continued like that into today evertime i move it seems to spike, it wont be hurting than all of the sudden i get up or move and it hurts so bad . Its concentrated in one area now a small area on my right side like almost under my lung, and seems like its spreading into my upper chest area and I can feel this when I breath. It is very very painfull when it spikes, then it goes away. It is very strange and scary I have never experienced any thing like it. My wife wants me to go to the emergency room but I really hate to do that what with the swine flu thing going on I just want to leave the emergency room for a last resort. Any help or direction with this will be so much appreciated. I do have a doctors appointment for next friday, maybe you can help me sooner, I really do not want to die before thanksgiving. :)  Thank you so much.  T.R.V. Upstate NY\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -- What you describe (including the dark sputum) sounds like it could well be pleurisy due to a lower respiratory infection or perhaps chest wall muscle injury due to coughing. The two can be quite similar and in fact often overlap. You hopefully have had the congestion and phlegm production resolved by now, but if not you can relieve a lot of that distress by taking a very simple over the counter (OTC) medicine, gauifenesin (brand name: Mucinex, a long-acting form). This has virtually no adverse side effects, is a simple expectorant, and may help you clear the rest of the crud out of your chest with less effort. As for the pain, if it is chest wall muscular or pleuritic pain (and it does very much sound like one or both) this usually will respond to OTC non-steroidal anti-inflamatories (NSAIDs) such as Aleve or Advil (naproxyn and ibuprofin respectively). It definitely doesn't sound like a heart problem. The worst case scenario probably would be that this could be caused by a pulmonary embolism PE), which could account for the dark sputum -- but so could a sinus infection with night time drainage. It's a good time of year for this sort of thing (sinus infections) to start showing up and they often drain post-nasally into the bronchial tree during sleep, with coughing and phlegm primarily in the morning. Blood is often a component of this phlegm, so it can look quite dark and rusty or greenish or yellow. It's rarely white or clear. Frank blood would suggest something more serious like a PE, but this is pretty unlikely statistically.  I hope this is helpful and that you have an excellent Thanksgiving. Hopefully you'll be fine by then. Please follow up here as needed. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "This is a pretty obvious question probably and the answer is definatly \"well stop smoking\", but other than that I'm intrested in what might be going on.   I smoke about 5 cigarettes a day, and sometimes I get a sharp pain in the center of my chest after having a smoke that comes and goes for about 10min. I also had minor neck and upper back injury from a car accident 3 years ago and I was told by a chiropractor that I have a slight misalignment in my spine, and its possible since there are nerves involved that go to the chest that pain can be cause by a pinched nerve etc.  Any ideas?

    "title": "Re: 30yrs smoking chest pain",
    "content": "Hello -- While your advice to yourself is excellent (regarding smoking cessation) this particular problem doesn't sound as though it's directly related to the habit (although it could possibly be in some arcane way); rather it seems more likely your second guess, regarding a nerve issue due to the accident may be causing this. There are certainly cervical and thoracic nerve trunks that serve the front (anterior) part of the chest, and since you do have a history consistent with this possibility it seems more likely it has something to do with this problem. I'd see either an orthopedist or neurologist if possible, since this may be a sequal to the original injury. It may be something relatively trivial, but pain alone, if chronic or recurrent, can be quite a burden, so it may be worth a look to see if the traumatic misalignment has worsened.   I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you. Please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, \"Choking sensation\" in the throat is often caused by causes outside the throat. Two causes which need to be excluded are GERD (Gastro Esophageal Reflux Disease), and \"Panic attacks\".  GERD can present with a variety of symptoms of varying severity which affect one's lifestyle by varying degrees.\"Globus sensation' is a sensation described as a 'lump in the throat', which can also be felt as 'choking' in the throat.This sensation is occasionally associated with GERD.  \"Panic attacks\" are manifested by an acute anxiety coupled with intense physiological response.An affected person may feel close to death and extremely frightened.This may occur as an isolated occurrence or may be recurrent.Duration also varies.  Apart from these two conditions,one other condition which needs a mention is \"Sleep Apnea\",in which choking sensations may occur.You must consult your GP first for an initial evaluation. Good day!\n\n",

    "title": "Chest pain center of chest and below ribs. HELP!! any info.",
    "content": "Well here is my situation any help anyone can offer at this point would be soo appreciated as this is ruining my way of life and has so for a while now. Anyways heres my info: 30 year old male non smoker mild drinker father of 2 unemployed history of anxiety (at least thats what the doctors keep telling me) not very active anymore  Well about 2 months ago I was watching television and all of a sudden I had a sharp jolting pain in my upper left part of my chest. It felt like a pinch but only lasted 1 thrust then stopped.  I did not panic and thought little of it. Well a few days later again the pain happened again. This time it was followed by dizziness, sweating, nausea, hands tingling almost burning well...anxiety. So not having insurance and from my past experiences of running to the ER and being told its \"anxiety\" I let it go. Well a few days later at night things progressed a bit and I started hyper ventilating so I felt it was time to see my Doctor. I go to my doctor and he does the throat, eyes, blood pressure, you know the basics and looks at me and says I have 2 ribs out of place. So he minipulates me and says he has put them back in place.But he does not do any X-Rays???    Next day I feel much better HUGE DIFFERENCE this lasts about 7 days then one day I started sneezing and sure enough I had the tighteness in my chest and pain again? I returned to my doctor only he was not there and another doctor at his practice had to see me, he spends all of 10 minutes lokking at me and says I have a cold and he is gonna \"relieve some pressure on my ribs\" So he has me hold a pillow lay on my side then he crunches me in a way like he is trying to manipulate me also but I have never had it done this way.   Well heres where my new pain comes in since this I have been to my doctor 4 times in a month he just now did a EKG as I felt I had to be having a heart attack as this pain is persistant, it came back fine. He still has done NO X-Rays or blood work. He just manipulates me eack visit and it does relieve m pian for a few days but sure enough it comes right back!!! So heres the ppain I am having that is ruining my way of life seriously!   When standing there is very little if any pain at all   When sitting in a chair or in the car or such severe pain in the center of my chest along my sternum to the bottom of my rib cage    Pain feels like it is under my ribcage almost on my stomach are also   Pain is unbearable when laying on my back or sitting unless I lean forward???   I can see muscle contractions around my stomach I believe when the pain hits   Pain seems to occur when I breath completely out and at the second I am taking air back in ( reminds me of driving in a car and going over a hill and you \"loose\" your stomach? Only very painful like a cramp   Please if anyone has an idea please help as this is really causing me to go through a living nightmare I cant sit...I cant lay on my back only on my side (and it normally does not hurt when laying on my side at all)\n\n",

Have had ultrasound for liver gallbladder, blood work, check xray, abdominal to lower chest CT scan, and Colonoscopy. No for sure answers yet but ct scan shows hyperexpanded lungs......I do have some Chest pain but not like the constant dragging and annoying pain on lower right rip cage front to back area. Tried celebrex for anti inflamatory, Albuterol inhalers for Asthma......still have the right side pain. shouldn't be a stitch if constantly there right? what about Pleurisy? What about collapsed lower lung........or maybe the hyperexpanded lung is pushing on the lower abdominal wall and also putting pressure on liver. Now, I have my beer too, but I'm only 28.....don't drink hard alcohol. Cirrhosis out?, liver size came up normal on ct scan. I think its Pleurisy, but damn doctor just prescribed the inhaler again. I have been a smoker......and no haven't officially stopped so then the pain must be blamed on smoking right? other smokers don't have this pain......not at 28. I've stopped smoking before for 3 months.....pain still there but actually was lessened. eating food actually does make it better. Gastritis?(sp) I think expanded lung, causing Pleurisy......lupus? if I put pressure on the spots that hurt or sort of give myself a bear hug, the pain seems to go away abit mostly for lower right pain but no so much the chest pain. I'm so sick of it by now, over 2 years of feeling the pain, hasn't really gotten awhole lot worse and not better. Any thoughts by anyone? maybe it is musclosketal but for some reason I doubt it.\n\n",

Arthritis of the ribs.  I'm stretching for answers myself because I've had a similar pain for over 2 years started in lower right rib cage area and has progressed.  A hernia on me probably would have shown up on CT.  I too am starting to get fast paced breathing to where I feel I could start to pass out or like I'm panicking/anxious and my heart rate increases.  Then the doctors say I have anxiety......and ok I do, I don't take medicines for it but how could that explain right side pain and chest pain.  You don't smoke, I do.  but either person can develop pleurisy simply by infection.  I'm going for another regular chest xray in an hour to see more about the progressing chest pain and also see more about lower right rib cage.  Sometimes I feel there will never be a solution and every just thinks its in my head.\n\n",

I guess I'll go back to my first doctor on Monday who does have a chest xray machine in his office and that would be covered 100% by insurance.  He'll probably tell me the same thing though.  I just question how to test for possible pleurisy......googling says it can go away and come back and only really go away if underlying infection is treated or other cause for the pleurisy like growths and such.  In anycase if not treated then could cause permanent damage and pain.  Scary.  I already seem to have some pretty premanent pains in the right side to mid chest.  Must be inflamation.  So I'm supposed to assume no smoking will stop this, but you don't smoke you said.  Who knows, maybe we do have entirely different situations but sure do sound similar as do the others posted.  Best of luck to you aswell and let me know of any miracle fixes or causes you may find for yourself and possibly could help mine.\n\n",

He then also did the arms crossed with weight on my chest to pop something in that lower right area in back.  Seems somewhat relieved but not entirely.

    "content": "Hi there -- ILS will cause all the symptoms you mention, can be, on rare occasions, quite serious if untreated, and should be resoved by ligation of the aberrant feeding vessels (which have been identified) and subsequent removal of the blind lung body. This seems simple enough, and if it isn't done, even without immunity compromise, repeated pneumonias are to be expected. Why your doctor feels you should have the surgery only during a respiratory infection eludes me completely. The goal is to avoid hemmorhage (rare) and repeated pneumonias (common). Why wait til you're ill to do this? I have no idea. I would definitely get a second opinion on this. With lupus you're at increased risk of infections anyway, so removing this ILS, which is essentially good for nothing but to cause problems, should improve your overall health at any given time.   I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you. Please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

They state that there are a lot of risks with this surgery.  They will try to do the VATS but can't guarantee that they will be able to complete the surgery without a thoracotomy.  I guess I just need someone else to confirm that this surgery needs to be done.  The only other hospitals who have had any experience in this type of surgery, my insurance provider won't approve.  All the research I've done on this topic always states that surgery is the only option.  Have you had any experience in this procedure?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -- Since you've had PE for quite a while now, and since the breathing problem arose fairly recently, it would seem likely the problem is due to one of three likely causes, two of which you've already mentioned, anxiety and MVP (the latter usually being a secondary anxiety problem as well). The third possibility is mild astham, which could be due to airborne allergies or gastroesophageal reflux (GERD). The latter is a very common cause of more chronic asthmas which are not always obvious because they don't occur in typical \"attacks.\" All three (or two) should be considered and ruled out if the problem continues, as each is medically manageable and while you seem to be doing well right now, this problem may well be more pronounced in someone with PE.   I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck, and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

I had a pulmonary TB infection 19 years back as a teenager that I took the appropriate medicines ( cant remember the drug name ) but it was supposedly 3-4 months. I've never had any further problems or infections or concerns ever since I got better. Now I am 35. However my x-ray shows the scar. Does that mean I have \" LATENT TB\" or bacteria that is dormant and therefore I am more susceptible to getting active infection than a normal person since those bacteria could get  reactivated ? OR am I TB free or CURED now and my chances of getting the infection again are like any other normal person   2. Does the scar ever go away ? If not, what are the chances that every chest x-ray will show that for the rest of my life ?  thank you   --LP\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Course of action for X-ray Scar of Previous TB infection",
    "content": "Hi there -- In theory your TB infection remains latent and so there is a (very minimal) risk of recurrence. In practice it almost never happens, but there is a remote possibility of transmission, so it is regarded differently than in a patient with no history of TB at all. Having taken the medical \"cure\" makes you, for all practical purposes, \"cured.\" Then again, anyone can become infected or reinfected via exposure to active TB, so it's never totally out of the question. You're highly unlikely to ever have the problem again, but you should test positive every time (although even this isn't a 100% ironclad rule either).  As for the scar, most of them remain indefinitely, which is what defines scarring. However, and once again, this is not a sure thing, and it could at least become minimized and may eventually be difficult to detect. However, don't be surprised if it does show up on each X-ray, which means this is something that needs to be noted in your medical records so as to avoid raising a flap every time someone notes it.   I hope this answers your questions. Good luck to you. Please follow up here if you have any further concerns.\n\n",

    "title": "Pain in right back / right lung area...",
    "content": ".  I've had a pain in my right chest (actually, the pain in in my deep back area) since last April.    The pain original come and went for 1 month and now its really starting to bother me.   Viisted the doctors 1.5 weeks ago and X-Ray of single back and detailed right back / lung shot was clear.    Also took a throat swab (to check for infection) and still waiting for its results.      If wondering, I'm 42 year old male.   Last March/April, I started to get a pain in my lower right abdomen.  The pain got stronger every day until mid summer.   The pain felt like a hernia without the external lump.    Went to my GP (in mid summer) and she didn't know what it was,  refered me to a specialist.   I got an CT done and it was clear.   I still have slight pain in that area but it mostly comes and goes.   My GP doctor feels it might be a pulled inner muscle or a small rip in a liining.   But since its pain is slowly going down (6 of 7 days is now painless), this area should be painless in another 2 months.    I wanted to mention this abdoment pain in the lower right abdoment / stomach area because it might be related to my current upper right back / inner lung pain.  While doing blood tests to figure out my abodomen pain, my doctor discovered I have pre-Type 2 Diabetics.    My counts were 68 and 69 on 2 different tests.   She sent my wife & I on a 1 day diebetic course and I now eat better foods.   Foods customized for a Type 2 Diebetic person.    And, I also \"now\" walk 5 miles every day - to help burn the sugar out of my blood.     I wanted to mention this problem because it might be related to my current upper right back / inner lung pain.     Since last spring (just after my abodmen pain started happening), my upper right back / inner lung pain has been getting more and more painful every month.   During the last 3 months, my lower inner throat has been sore.   My right lympth node (under my right jaw bone) has gone hard 3 different times.    After a few days, my right lymph node go back to normal softness (and no pain).   But afterwards, I still have a sore lower inner throat and upper right back pain.        The pain level in my back (deep like a lung pain) doesn't dramatcially change if I bend over, bend side to side, pick things up or do deep breathing.   Its at a constant \"low level\" and sometimes, it will spike pain like a small area burn.  Certain non-specific posture sometimes makes the pain level change.    The pain spikes is like someone is rubbing sandpaper up my louter ung wall (if that makes any sense).      Over the next few days, I'm going to book another appointment with my GP doctor.   Need to tell her the pain is still there, it's still \"a pain\" and we need to seriously get it resolved.   Hopefully, she'll refer me to a specialist - who will do a throat scope or an MRI or other tests.      Any ideas on what this pain could be?    I'm sure it could be caused from many different things.   Including non-physical Anxiety / Stress.    Is there things I should tell my doctor or certain questions to ask her - to help disagnose the problem?   thanks.  .\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It is difficult to tell what could this be since your symptoms are very non specific and can be shared with different causes.  But, Recurrent Chest pain, lower abdominal pain, sore throat, and a lymph node that gets bigger and smaller all may point to some sort of infection probably viral.  You have mentioned that you have been diagnosed with Type 2 DM this would make you vulnerable or recurrent infection as you body immune system in weaker than others.  Viral infection and muscle pain can result from muscle spasm. Muscle spasm is a body reaction to injury in tissues Causes of muscle injury include: Viremia Metabolic abnormalities like low Magnesium level and Hypocalcemia The correct diagnosis is easier when other symptoms exist. The   Lower abdominal pain if associated with GI problems that came first are probably of  infectious (viral) origin. The other possibility is slow bowel movement in diabetic patients (even if DM is controlled)  that may reach up to constipation.   I would like to know about the results of your complete blood picture during these attacks and all other blood  tests done before.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for responding to my post.      The next time I'm at my doctors, I'm going to ask her for more details on my blood tests, blood (fasting and many other results) CT test (of my abdomen area) and my X-Ray test (of my chest).      Today, the pain in my lower throat and back pain isn't as bad.   Isn't as bad as it often is.   Hopefully, its on a \"down hill curve\" and over time, my pain in these areas go away.    I know, wishful thinking on my part.   Especially since my right back / inside chest cavity pain started last spring.    Being \"a guy\", I usually don't visit a doctor unless I'm in large amounts of pain.   I'm sure you have a few \"stubborn guys\" on your patient list as well.     I know, very dangerious attitude to have because just like a tooth that is deep pain, the damage is too \"locked in\" to eliminate.    If the problem was caught early, less agressive solution would have be required.     re:  Simple filling instead of a deep root canal.     I definately have to change my attitude when is comes to looking after my body and running to my doctors for help.       I do have some \"good news\" to share with you and others.   Since age 38, I've had high blood pressure.  My GP gave me \"the BP pill\" and many lectures.   Lectures to reduce my weight, to do more exercises and start taking better care of my body.    Being over weight (was 234 at 5' 10\") and on a high stress office job, the lack of proper body care is starting to catch up with me.     After being diagnosed with Pre-Type 2 Diebetis (in mud summer), I've been walking or peddle bike riding 5-10 miles a day.   Usually 5 miles at lunch time and 5 miles after dinner.   Since doing this for 5 consecutive months, my BP has dramatically dropped.   It's now 130/80 LA and 120/80 RA (or the other way around??).   Last week was my 3rd consecutive month \"within normal range\" BP tests.   If I keep exercising, dropping weight (already dropped to 221 lbs) and get 5 more consecutive tests in the normal range, my GP doctor plans to take me off the BP pill.    So in a way, being diagnosed with Pre-Type 2 Diebetis is a great thing.   Made me realize that I need to focus more on my body, eat a much better diet and listen to what doctors tell me.    Their education and experience really does work!!!!!    A lesson learned I wanted to share with others....   During my next doctor visit, I will ask her for results of my many previous tests.    I will try to obtain copies or write down the critical numbers.       thanks.  .\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Your complaint  is more likely to be due to pleurisy. Pleurisy is an inflammation of the pleura, which is a double-layered membrane covers the lungs separating it from the rib cage. Viral infections like flu, are the most common cause of Pleurisy.   The pain is felt as sharp pain which get worse by Coughing, sneezing, moving and deep breathing. Auscultation of the chest shows a characteristic sound known as pleural rub.  The condition gradually improves with rest, plenty of fluid. NSAID can help reduce the pain.  Other causes to be excluded (less likely) include:  - Muscle spasm alone can cause this pain which can be an unidentified cause but in many cases is the result of inappropriate posture for long time like traveling, driving and certain types of work.   - Sometimes Chest pain is not originating from the chest itself; instead it is due to problems in the digestive tract. These problems include IBS, Gastritis, gall bladder diseases and GER.   Cardiac causes, should be excluded in any case of Chest pain although it is likely to be in your case (young age, non  typical symptoms).   Direct clinical examination is essential. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 47 year old female, not pregnant, a smoker, non-drinker.  I work in a stand up job that does require lifting (appx. 30lbs)  but have not experienced any injury events.  Only one occassion of a  pulled muscle(s) - in my left shoulder/neck about two months ago.  One week ago I was symptom/pain free.  I had a rather violent sneeze which resulted in immediate pain in my right chest, under my breast in or under the chest wall.  This pain has not improved or worsened over the past week.  I have been able to lay in bed which is a fairly soft surface without pain.  Today I went to lay on the floor to do my weekly sit up routine and found that I was unable to lay on my back without intense pain in my right side, starting about mid-back, under the right shoulder blade and feels deep like it were also under or in the chest wall.    As I lay back slowly it feels as if the pressure of the floor meeting my back is causing something inside to radiate the pain. There are no visible lumps or bruising on my back.    While standing or sitting I do not feel the back pain (although the milder pain under my breast persists)  unless I take a deep breath.  While reclined or laying down I am unable to put full weight on that side or lift my right arm over my head without intensly sharp pain.  Breathing, even shallowly,  also becomes painfull while laying down.  I have no history of gastro/intesinal or heart related disorders.  I did have an inflammed sternum as a result of an impact injury about a year ago which healed up and left no noticable residual pain or difficulties..  I live ruraly near a small town and the doctors in my area  are not currently taking patients.  I've been off work for the holidays this past week which is when the pain started.  I'm due to go back on Tuesday and I guess I'd like to have some idea of what it might be  before I consider bothering the good folks at the emergency room.  Any insight would be appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "For about a year and a half I have been suffering slight discomfort under my lower rib on the left side of my chest, I keep worrying about what it is, it also constricts my breathing, although I am quite anxious and I tend to think about breathing to much, which I know in itself can help cause involunentry breathing problems, this really can't be discribed as a pain, its more of a discomfort, I have smoked for 3 years, and I am also very prone to chest infections, which yes, should mean  I should stop smoking but its hard!  Sometimes when I breathe also I would get slight pains in my chest and my upper back, and very rarely my lower.  I keep just putting this pain down to wind, because it feels like it is, but I want to stop worrying about whether or not its lung cancer, or any other serious illness, I am only 19 years of age, and I seriously doubt I would have lung cancer after smoking for only three years but I have a daughter and I want to know that I'am okay.  So any clearance on this matter would be extremely appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Normally the physiological act of respiration is unconscious(you seem to be well aware of it).Once one becomes conscious of it for any reason,it can be annoying.  Instead of worrying,you must consult your GP who,after examining you will be able to exclude certain diagnoses and refer you to the right person(if necessary).  At your age, one possibility is 'costo-chondritis' an iflammation of the costo-chondral junction of uncertain etiology (?viral).This usually passes off in course of time. Good luck!\n\n",

It has been constant for about a week now.

Anginal pains are very characteristic although there are some forms of atypical Chest pain of cardiac origin.   The fact that you have tenderness on the part where you feel the pain indicates a myoskeletal origin for this pain. Overexertion of the chest wall muscles or their inflammation as a part of viral infection like flu or cold results also in Chest pain, the pain is usually aggravated with certain moves and is usually associated with tenderness over the affected muscles. Pain due to rib or chest wall bone disease is also another cause of Chest pain. They are also tenderness over the affected areas. In all of these conditions the Chest pain is usually aggravated by taking deep breath and Cough. Costochondritis is a known cause of chest pain that is associated with tenderness near the sternum and is associated with painful breathing.  If the pain is persistent or increasing you have to be checked by your Doctor. Only by complete history, and physical examination the proper management can be done.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Teenage Male, side of sternum raised",
    "content": "Hello --  This sort of thing is seen fairly often, usually appearing in adolescence. Sometimes it's just plain normal, as none of us are truly symmetrical. If the raised portion if pronounced it could be a variation on one of the chest wall abnormalities like pectus excavatum, but it sounds as though it's pretty minor in terms of deviation from the other side. Pressing on it would likely produce pain -- if you press hard enough. There could be some cartilege problem there also, and it could involve inflammation. This can become painful and restrictive of movement sometimes, so it might be worth bringing to the attention of your doctor, at least so it's noted as part of a baseline physical. In general these things are, again, fairly common and rarely a source of problems, but just to make certain it isn't something that could be improved by simple medical treatment such as anti-inflammatories, you may want to bring it to your doctor's attention non-urgently.   Hope this is helpful. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Sirs,    I am a 39 yr. old woman. About two years ago I was playing on the floor w/kids & went to get up fast & twisted my back so badly it knocked me to the ground. I hurt my lower, right side of my ribs, and I still sometimes feel the pain. Since then I've been feeling a fluttering sensation in my chest, lower right side, when I take really deep breaths, or when lying down. I also started feeling an odd sensation between my lungs,when I lie in my back & take a deep breath, and first get up in morning & take my first deep breath. Then it seems to clear off for the day. I saw a Dr. a year ago, and about 9 months after feeling these things, none of it rang any bells to him, but we did a chest x-ray, and it was fine. He thought that the sensation between my lungs was acid reflux, but I have since seen a digestive disease Dr. and said he didn't think I had acid reflux. No testing was done. He also said he wasn't sure what the fluttering of the chest was, possibly I injured the lining of my ribs. We wasn't concerned with any of my symptoms, but they're still there, and it scares me not knowing what they could be. Not too sure what to do. I can't pin point whether the fluttering is in the lungs or ribs. I am a very anxious person, and can feel EVERYTHING in my body! Am I crazy? I appreciate your time and any suggestions you may have. I can't afford to run a thousand tests, but not sure where to start. I am very healthy otherwise, no conditions. Seldom drink, don't smoke, and I try to eat healthy foods! Thank you for your time!

    "content": "Hi ksbecker - Let's start in reverse order: based on what you've mentioned here there's no reason to think you're crazy. Maybe a little more tuned into your body than some people, and maybe a little anxious, but that's not really unusual and certainly not crazy.  As for the actual symptoms, the \"fluttering\" sensation sounds like muscle twitching that is commonly called fasiculations. Little areas of muscle just kind of twitch or flutter intermittently, just like one's eyelid can start fluttering for no apparent reason. The larger the muscle the more noticeable it is. It can come and go and usually means nothing. If it persists indefinitely you might bring it back to the doctor's attention.  About the odd sensation in your chest in the morning: I think you are feeling normal morning sensations caused by a whole lot of normal processes that take place during the night, and which might include some reflux (no testing was done, so it's not out ot the question) as well as some post-nasal drainage. The two can work together to create a small amount of drainage into the bronchial tree, which in turn can feel like tightness in the center of the chest when taking the first deep breaths of the morning. (One solution to this would be to not take the deep breaths).   One of the cardinal signs of anxiety (and depression, too) is that the patient takes occasioinal deep, sighing breaths. This is not actually all that normal, and usually reflects some disruption of the normal mood. Also, once one has become aware of one's breathing it becomes difficult to ignore (try not thinkinig about something and see what happens).  I suspect  that if you make a conscious effort not to take that first deep breath in the morning you may actually start to notice a difference in how you feel. If you are sighing a lot during the day (you likely wouldn't notice it, but others around you might) then you could be irritating the nerve involved in the area where the twitch in your chest is!   You sound perfectly sane and pretty healthy as well. Tuning out our bodies can be difficult, but it can be done. Trust me, when something is really wrong, it will let you know.   Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi John Kenyon,    this is really something, I just now found your response to my question because I was researching it again. I wanted to thank you so much for your response, even though it's a couple of years ago. I still have the same sensation, and I'm more stressed now than before, and also going through perimenopause on top of that. But I think you're right. The sensation comes and goes, but the more attention I pay to it the more I feel it. I have been told by many doctors that I'm too tuned into my body and am aware of everything that goes on, and to try to tune it out a bit. But it helps to hear it from another doctor.   I wanted to make sure to thank you ...even if it's a couple of years later!  Sincerely, Katherine Becker\n\n",

    "title": "Dull chest discomfort near left breast",
    "content": "I have a list of weird symptoms and I have no idea if they are related.  About a month ago I noticed that my neck was abnormally stiff and my lung capacity seemed reduced somewhat.  My neck seemed somewhat swollen mostly on the lower right side though the left side may have been a little swollen to.  I was having some mild pain behind my ears and in my jaw.  Oddly enough, though I don't think it was related, my left top eyelid was twitching uncontrollably for 2 weeks leading up to me going to the doctor.   However, I had no other symptoms like a sore throat or cough that would suggest a cold.  I went to the doctor and she gave me a zpak.  It didn't seem to help much while I was on it, but it does seem that now 2 weeks later the swelling in my neck seems to be gone though my neck is still kind of stiff, my eye isn't twitching and I only have occassional ear pain.  On a side note the ear pain is really weird cause I've had the exact pain before and for the last couple years, but its only when I drink alcohol.  However, I'm writing this post because I'm still having discomfort that won't go away in my left chest area.  Its really dull but pretty constant.  Its more discomfort than pain.  There's also discomfort on my back around the same place opposite the discomfort in my chest.  When I take a deep breath my lungs feel fine, but occassionally it does make the chest pain feel worse.  I am 30 and have a past history of smoking though not that recently.  I'm really concerned cause lung cancer has a symptom of dull achy pain in the chest and I don't really know what that means.  My pain is dull, but I don't know if that really matches what a doctor would consider dull.  All the symptoms I've explained seemed to start at the same time, so that's why I'm including everything.  If somebody could give me an idea of what's going on I'd appreciate it.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Kevin --  While you're right to take note of the mistake and hopefully not do this in the future, we all make mistakes like this from time to time, usually with no lasting effects, at least if we don't do it over and over again. Much of the  air we breathe is already full of noxious stuff, some of it totally natural (there are tree pollens I sometimes wonder about, they are so thick and plentiful, if they aren't as bad or worse than fiberglass particles). There is a remote possibility you could develop a mild pneumonitis later, but not a huge likelihood. If you do develop symptoms (productive cough, bloody sputum, etc.), you'll need to see a doctor, who may treat it with steroids and/or nebulizer treatments.   Hopefully this will just resolve over time. If not, by all means bring it to the attention of your doctor. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello again!  I'm sorry to hear you're still having symptoms and frankly they are somewhat odd considering the way this presumably started. What I'm thinking now, given the time that's passed, is you may have managed to trigger some sort of allergic/autoimmune response (which might not even be related to the original insult) because your upper airway seems to be involved most of all. This could mean a chronic irritation of a deep sinus (a place where material could lodge and have a very difficult time getting back out). First thing to do would be to try a few days' worth of guaifenesin (brand name Mucinex) to see if it helps loosen anything up. Failing at that, you may want to seek consult with an ENT doctor, who might decide you need additional consult with a pulmonolgist. My gut feeling, though, is this is coming from above, not below, your throat, quite possibly the sinuses, which is something often overlooked in exposures to this sort of noxious material. Since your chest x ray turned out negative you're probably clean and clear there, although a pulmonary function test (PFT -- even a very simple one with an Asthma Check device) could help determine if you've got any problems in the lower respiratory area. I am inclined to doubt it now, but it should be ruled out. An ENT consult is probably is your best next order of business. Most doctors have at least a drawer full of Asthma Check devices or a small PFT machine, so your vital capacity could be tested. Sometimes asthma is triggered by exposure to an irritant and is often not recognized for what it is because of lack of wheezing, but will cause coughing, throat clearing and chest discomfort which is muscular in nature. It also can be set off by sinus irritation, which I keep coming back to because it is such a great place for irritants to hide and cause trouble.  First, though, try (if you haven't already) a few days of Mucinex or its generic.  I hope this is helpful. Please do stay in touch and let us know how things go.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Abnormal Pulmonary function, EKG Pectus excavatum",
    "content": "Hello -  At baseline this set of complaints is far more common in tall, thin young adults, especially with pectus excavatum. What I'm wondering is if the rapid rate on standing is measured per standard TILTs, after one minute standing, or if it is seen immediately upon standing. There is a big difference between the two that's underappreciated.  There are any number of relatively benign possible causes for this presentation, from \"variant of normal\" to MVP syndrome to Marfan syndrome, with many in between. Again, much of this may be WNL for the patient given height/weight and PEx.   Resting rate and BP are absolutely normal, so orthostasis is the first and most likely culprit, but echocardiogram might be useful to rule out some  of the more bothersome possible disorders which could be suggested by the complaints.   While none of this would seem to require urgent evaluation, I would suggest at least a timely cardiological workup. PFTs are very good. It would be wise to rule out any structural heart abnormalities, if this has not already been done.   I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you both and please follow up here with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Good news about the scheduled echocardiogram. That's probably going to be the most telling thing that's been done so far. Don't be at all surprised if MVP shows up, as it is very common anyway, more common in females, and especially so in those who may have markers for Marfan syndrome. Your daughter has a few, by the way, but a doctor can actually measure the length of the arms and legs to see if they're disproportionately long, etc. There are a couple other genetically transmitted things like Marfan's which also can be checked for.   The fact that the heart rate accellerates a lot upon standing isn't necessarily a bad thing, and over time many people adapt to this. It often occurs among tall, thin adolescents, but it's also worth noting in the context of everything else. The toes turning blue is called acrocyanosis, and usually isn't meaningful.   Please don't feel you're overly concerned. This is your child we're talking about. This is important stuff. It will be good for both of you to know what is (or isn't ) going on. You're being a good, concerned parent.   Thanks for the follow up and we'll be looking forward to more when you learn it. Best of luck to you both.\n\n",

    "content": "I am 20 year old female. I had my gallbladder removed when I was around 13. My mom, aunt and grandmother all had theirs removed- my mom on the same day- we all had stones.  Over the past few years I have had gradually increasing abdominal pains. Over the past year - year and a half, the pains have gotten more severe. It seems that 8 out of 10 times I eat I have a bowel movement. Sometimes I don't even get to finish my meal before. I also have abdominal pains without eating and sometimes are relieved by a bowel movement. More often then not it is diahrea. I have been to the doctor and without any testing was told it was IBS. I took the medicine-dicycolime for a little while, did nothing.  That was almost a year ago. Since then I have been to the doctor for another reason... the chest pain.  About 8 weeks ago I was driving around town and had a sudden sharp pain on the center *left* side of my chest.  I went home and laid down for a little while and the pain went away. The next day I was driving home again from our stateline, about 45 minutes away. Still far out of reach of a hospital, the sharp chest pain came back again. This time it was a little more right in the center. This time it felt more severe. My fiance was driving and got us to the hospital as fast as he could. By that time it had calmed a bit and was starting to go away. So I decided to go see my parents. I told my mom what was going on and she thought it was just indigestion. I took some rolaids to see if it would help. To my knowledge, it didn't cause it slowly went away like it did the day before The pain lingered for quite sometime til eventually I bent over and all of a sudden could barely breathe. I was taking short puffs of breathe as we drove to the ER (which is a 15 min+ drive!!) We got there, by then I was crying almost hysterically. They signed me in... and of course 30+ minutes later I was called into the office so they could take my pulse and ask what was wrong... After that I continued to wait and wait and wait to go back... and then continue w/o any visit by the staff for hours. Finally when the doc came in to take a listen to my lungs, the pain was gone. I was fine. So they did a chest xray, gave me some lortab perscription, told me there was nothing wrong and that maybe my chest was inflammed.    The pain persisted for a few days, with shortness of breathe and right sided chest pain. Eventually my entire right side of the chest, not just the center was in pain. My right underarm to my chest and breast was throbbing with pain. It felt/looked like my underarm area and about an inch out toward my chest was swollen. My left underam had a swollen lymph node, which I had before 4 or so months ago. Two week sor so went by the pain went away, or was very minimal and was every other day or so with a few moderate pains. I wanted to see the doctor but was working out an insurance problem. During that time I started having severe right sided headaches as well. I had a lot of pressure behind the right eye, pain in the right temple, in the head above and behind the ear following down towards the right side of my neck/spine area.  My vision would go blurry in my right eye throught the headaches. One time my right upper eyelid swelled really bad and made my eye close half-way. That's when it really started to worry me. Additionally, I started to get a hard knot/lump on my left abdomen right below my breast that would throb with pain as it seemed for no apparent reason. Occasionally with a smaller lump on the left side.   Finally I got into the doctor about 3 weeks ago. He felt around my stomach and did not feel anything - the lumps and pain only appear occasionally so he felt nothing wrong.  He did an EKG and found nothing wrong with my heart either. He decided to put me on 600mg of ibuprofen 4 times a day - he thought I had costrochondits (inflammation of the cartlige between the lungs and ribs) and then if it persisted after 3 days to go to the cardiologist referal.  Then follow up with him in a week to go further with the headaches and stomach problems.   Well, it seemed that the ibrprofen had worked so no cardiologist.. I went back to the doctor a week later and said I hadn't had much pain. Maybe a dull ache here and there. So he decided to move on to my stomach against my request of going with my headaches - as I have been dealing with stomach problems for quite some time, I have learned to deal with it. He put me on levsin - only to take when needed and told me to continue with the ibuprofen for the chest only when needed instead of every 4 hours. To take away the pain from the headaches, he also game me a small dosed persciption of lortab....  He said he thought it was IBS too - even though I told him the last medicine I had (bentyl-dicycolmine) had not worked, and my pain didn't coincide with the reasons IBS has for acting up. He said it was strange that denser-fibrous foods made it act up worse so he wanted to send me to a GI doctor while taking the med - and then to follow up with him in two weeks.  In the mean time, I went to see an eye doctor. My mom is an optician and the doctor where she works checked out my eyes. She first did an eye exam and found that my right eye was barley .25 off. She said it was very minimal but would have me get glasses to wear when I am on the computer & studying to maybe ease any strain it is causing. She then dialated my eyes. She was worried that the pressure I was feeling may have been an early sign for glaucoma. She checked it and everything looked normal. But she noticed my extreme sensitivity to light. My left eye had a normal light sensitivity response to dialation, but my right eye was pretty sever. But it seems my eyes have been light sensitive for quite some time anyway, especially with my headaches.  She said if the pain persisted after two weeks with the glasses to see a neurologist - and also to ask my family doctor for a perscription of I...?? - something for migraines.  Now it has been a week and a half - not two weeks yet (when I follow up with the family doctor) and I had to make an emergency appointmen. My chest pains came back half a week ago while we were at the movies. It started with a gradually pain increasing headache, and then the chest pains started. We started heading home and turned back to go to the emergency room. The pain was sharp again, and all over the right side. Very sensitive to the touch. My breath was short and very painful. But by the time we got there the pain had almost gone away so I went back home. A few days went by and then again the pain came back severly. I dealt with it until the next day. I was in a lot of pain, even my mouth and back of throat was a little sore and sensitive when I inhaled, plus I  had a bad headache so I went and saw the doctor. By the time I got into see him the pain wasnt as severe, but it was still there. He said the pain in my mouth and the higher chest pain was acid reflux from the ibuprofen. I didnt agree with it, as the pain was the same feeling I felt lower in my right chest. Anyway, he decided to give me another cardiologist referal within 48 hours (I am still waiting on) for a stress test. He also told me to take one 81mg aspirin a day until I saw him again (after we got the results from the stress test). He also put me on perscription for Aciphex for acid refulx - he said it would take 3 days for it to work so to take maylox or mylanta in the mean time. Funny though, because he said the refulx was from ibuporfen and to stop taking it. Why would I need a two month perscription for an acid refulx disease medication? I got the perscription anyway, and started taking it today. I think we are going in the wrong direction... Anyway, aside from that I told him I was really worried about my headaches. He said he would deal with that later, cause he wants to put me on a migraine medication, but if something is wrong with my heart, the medication could give me a heart attack... He said to continue taking lortab for the pain when needed and dismissed it.   I am in a bit of pain right now. A couple hours ago I had a terrible pain at the base of my skull-where it meets my neck. It was tender to the touch and very painful. The pain even stemmed moderatly down my spine. I put a cold rag on it and took a lortab. Now, two hours later, the pain has moved more from there to my right temple. It isnt as strong, but theres also a lot pressure.   I don't know what is wrong with me. I don't think my doctor is going in the right direction. I can't help but think there might be a coralation between the chest pain and the headaches... As they are both on the same started, and started about the same time. Some of the things I've looked up online have scared me to where I am afraid to look anything else up... Things from the coxsackie virus - which causes meningits as well as plyueridia, etc., to lupus, brain tumors, and more... Lupus seems like a good posibilty but the doctor doesnt think the pains are related. Coxsackie virus fits good as well. Before this all started I had constant canker sores for a few weeks... and during I had one as well... which is the start of it.... anyway. I know you can fit a lot of symptoms to a lot of diseases so I probably shouldnt try.. I am just scared and worried. When I was having gallblader pains it took them almost two years to find out that it was my gallblader that was causing it... with multiple sonograms and all..and people checking for stones in it... I don't want this to be the same situation. It is straining my daily life. I don't feel like doing much anymore and havent gone to school since this started. I am also worried that there might be something severely wrong that needs immediate attention, and by the time I get it it might be too late...  Any help is welcome. Thanks, Renee  PS the lingering chest pain is kind of heavy and burning feeling. I make a little bit of a wheezing/whistling sound out of my mouth when I breathe.. Very faint, ususally only hear it when I am laying down to sleep. I thought maybe something was wrong with my lungs, but the doc said he does not hear anything so dismissed it.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  This is a remarkably common problem especially in adolescence, and yours sounds to be a unilateral, small lump. These will sometimes emit some liquid if squeezed (probably better to not do that) and most often they resolve in a few years on their own, unless obesity is a related issue. It sounds like that's not the problem here, so while it's probably really annoying and you're probably more aware of it than anyone else, it sounds like a relatively small puffiness compared to some.   Again, most instances of this resolve on their own in late adolescence, early adulthood, so you're probably close to having it disappear. Hope this helps. Good luck to you and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 38 year-old male, smoker. Three weeks ago I woke feeling short of breath, as if I couldn't get a deep, full breath down my throat - no choking or gasping, congestion, mucus, etc., just this feeling of  breathlessness. Since then this symptom has been with me 24/7 and is usually worse when I lie down to sleep (I will jerk awake feeling breathless). A chest CT scan and x-ray showed no pulmonary abnormalities and the PFT values were normal. Pulse oxygen rate was 97%.  I also have reflux that lately seems in sync with the shortness of breath, i.e., feeling like a pressure and acidity at the pit of my esophagus and between shoulder blades when I breathe deeply through the mouth. A cardiac work-up last year was negative for cardiac issues.  My question - is there a chance this could be an allergy, sleep apnea, or GERD-related? If it's an allergy, is there a good OTC that could help with breathing? Doctor prescribed Claritin  and Prilosec which haven't worked.  Thanks for any guidance.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Shortness of breath - negative CT and normal PFT values",
    "content": "Hello --  There are several fairly benign possible causes of this, and sleep apnea is one possibility, but since you don't mention obesity and this is of fairly recent onset, I'm more inclined to suspect GERD-related nocturnal asthma, or possibly even an anxiety problem. If it is allergy related or asthma secondary to GERD, the most effective antihistimine is often Singulair, a unique medication that has a good record in managing allergic and other forms of asthma.   I'd mentioned anxiety as well, and you could be having nocturnal anxiety attacks or even sleep paralysis, a very strange anxiety and stress-related phenomenon that often causes the sufferer to wake suddenly gasping for breath only to stabilize in a few minutes and go back to sleep. It is a poorly understood mechanism but is benign, although it can be pretty disruptive of sleep.   I think I'd try and eliminate the GERD/asthma possibilities first, and SIngulair might well be a good thing to combine with Prilosec therapy. After that consider sleep apnea, especially if you're overweight, and anxiety/sleep paralysis variant beyond that.   Hope this is helpful. Good luck to you and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

Every once in a while I will notice a dull pain in my upper chest and it occurs on both sides.  As long as I am taking shallow breaths I can barley notice it.  If I try to take a deep breath the pain becomes more intense and sharp.  Sometimes it makes it impossible to take a full breath.  When I was younger I remember the pain being more severe but it would never last for more than 30 minutes.  Today I have has this pain for more than six hours but no doubt it will be gone in the morning.  I have never considered the pain severe enough to warrant a doctors vist and it doesn't occur that often, maybe once a month.  What could this be?\n\n",

Pleurisy which is an inflammation of the tissue lining the chest wall and lungs is the classic cause of this. Pericarditis can also cause chest pain on inspiration. The most common cause however, would be related to the chest wall muscles and tissues. In those cases pulling on the tissue triggers the pain sensation.  The only way to know for sure what this is and if it's serious or not would be to get it examined by a doctor.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "I experience a sharp pain about 2 inches under my right nipple when I exercise on my bike and start breathing heavily. The pain is very quick. It almost feels like something is pulling apart, similar to a stretched rubber band breaking and then it is over. It lasts less than a second. I have no tenderness or any other pain or symptoms. It only happens when I really push myself and start breathing heavily. It seems to happen less and less as I ride each day but it still happens with some regularity when I push myself hard. It sometimes will happen more than once on a ride but usually it happens once and is over. I may be subconsciously restricting my efforts afraid that I will experience again. It is not particulary painful but it is a sharp enough pain that it is causing me some concern and apprehension.  About 8 or 10 years ago I had a bad fall while snowboarding and cracked some ribs and the chiroprator that xrayed me said that I had also \"sprung\" some ribs. It seemed to take a long time (3-4 months) for this injury to heal and the pain to go away. I have not done any cardio exercise since then that really made me breathe heavily until I started taking up bicycling in the last 8 months. I have always done alot of walking but nothing that got my heart rate and respiration elevated.  Could this just be old scar tissue that is breaking loose as I expand my lung capacity or is there some organ in that area that is giving me problems. I really have been blessed to have no health problems, but this occasional sharp pain is causing me some concern.\n\n",

It is not painful, but most noticable when I am recumbent or when I arch my back.  It does not seem \"moveable\".  Although I've been through tens of archives, I get more confused over time.  I cannot discern difference between the symptoms of Barrett's, GERD, or hiatal hernia (or something more ominous).    I do find that I feel a bit of \"fullness\" in that general vicinity, but am not sure how much of that is \"contrived\" and how much is real.    Current meds are few, and include Zocor (20mg/day), Prilosec, a baby aspirin, multi-vitamin, and extra vitamin E & C.    I drink less than one glass of wine per day (sometimes a beer), 2-3 cups of coffee/day, occasional decaf wine w/honey & apple cider vinegar, and my 15# weight loss has occurred over eight weeks or so.   Thoughts/suggestions?  Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "It's possible that you may be feeling a hernia.  There may be a weak spot in the abdominal muscles that is allowing the intestines to slip through.  Usually, though, these are not totally hard (although they can be).  It would not be a hiatal hernia.  This hernia is when the intestines slip through the diaphragm into the chest.  Similarly, GERD or Barrett's should not cause this.  Another possibility, given the location, is that your xiphoid process is more prominent than typical.  The xiphoid process is the small bone at the bottom of the breast bone.  In some people it can be pointed somewhat outward rather than straight down.  Given your weight loss it may be more prominent now.    If you were not trying to loose the weight I would recommend that you see your doctor.  That is fairly significant weight loss.  If you were trying to loose weight it is a lot less concerning.  It is probably a good idea for you to have a general check up sometime in the near future to have all these things evaluated just to be safe.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I appreciate the input.  I went to the doctor (general MD) who stated he thought I might have a ventral hernia which was explained as a weak point in the upper abdominal wall muscle where a small fatty deposit from around the internal organs(the lump is not hard nor painful to pressure) has essentially oozed (my words) through the muscle.  Regardless, I have a CAT scan (barium intake prior to test) scheduled which hopefully will further define the problem.  Part of my weight loss involved increased \"crunches\" repetitions, which likely further tightened the lower abdominal muscles and perhaps exerts more pressure on the internal organs (and the fat surrounding them?)  (That is my totally amatuer thought process...not the physician's).  Input welcome...  bh\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there --  Your symptom doesn't sound heart related at all, and here's why: heart pains are almost never sharp or stabbing, rarely brief or fleeting, and very rarely in the area of the left breast. Also, since deep breathing aggravates this, it sounds very much like one of several other much more innocent problems. Yes, it could be a gas bubble, or it also could be mild pleurisy (inflammation of the lining around the lung) which can cause this sort of pain, sometimes more severe and shooting up to the shoulder on the affected side. It also could be due to costochondritis, inflammation of the cartilege between the ribs near the breastbone. Sometimes the muscles of the chest wall can become similarly inflamed with the same result. Most of these (other than the possible gas bubble) can usually be treated effectively with over-the-counter anti-inflammatories like ibuprofin (Advil) or naproxyn (Aleve). There's very little chance of this being heart related, and the heart is actually located more toward the center of the chest, mostly beneath the breastbone, but since we tend to believe it's over on the left (and is often felt beating there) we assume left-sided chest pain is heart-related. Deep breathing and/or upper body movement that aggravates this sort of pain is one more way of ruling out heart involvement.   I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck with this, and you might even try to avoid taking deep breaths for a while, as this can actually cause chest wall spasms that feel like what you describe.\n\n",

    "title": "Esophagus Spasms",
    "content": "Hi, I went to emergency yesterday as it was the second time in 3 days I had severe chest pain.  It felt like a sharp rock was in the center of my upper chest and then like more and more sharp rocks up to my neck.  Both incidences lasted about 15-20 minutes and have left me scared to death to have another.  There was severe pain, I was vomiting and dizzy/faint and sweating profusely.  I had not eaten anything in approximately 16 hours previous to both episodes and both times was washing my hair.  I was told that I probably had esophagus spasms as my chest x-ray, EKG and bloodwork were all fine.  I was born with restricted movement in my joints and intermittent severe pain in knees all my life, purple and white legs and feet and pins and needles from my toes to my hips lasting for 2-3 days at a time with no diagnosis.  Since January 2007 I have been having recurring right side facial symptoms, eyelid drooping, tightness by nose and tongue pulls to right, drooling, affecting speech and seem fuzzy and unable to think clearly or find the correct words.  Last week I had a new symptom with the right half of my mouth where it feels frozen like when a dentist gives you a needle which has not gone away.  Since January 2007 I have repeatedly asked doctors if this could be a problem in my neck as I have severe pain in my neck, restricted movement is more severe in neck area but have been told it is all in my head.  I do however have an appointment next July to see a movement specialist to be checked for dystonia.  I really think something is getting pinched or perhaps circulation cut off due to my strange sleeping positions and think that because it is difficult for me to reach over my head that this esophagus problem could be caused by something in my neck also. I frequently wake up feeling disoriented and with one pupil larger than the other which then progresses to the facial spasms which last for days.  My life is over as I know it, I have alot of pain in neck, back of head and left leg almost constantly.  A neurologist said my problems could be genetic, molecular or TIA's but told me he did not know.  He did an EMG on my right leg, normal.  I later had an EMG on my face, normal.  I have never had any doctor check my circulation.  Are you aware of anything that could be causing all these strange symptoms especially this excruciating new chest pain?  I would appreciate any help, thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  My first thought, and this still stands, is that the chest pains you describe, especially with the corrolary symptoms, should make it a priority that any cardiac problem be ruled out first. While I clean EKG is a good thing, it's not usually a good final indice for this sort of thing. And while you do seem to have some severe central nervous issue going on, this doesn't mean you cannot also have some other issue as well. Too frequently the squeaky wheel gets all the attention, which is unfortunate. But assuming this is just one more part of the varied spectrum of neurological symptoms (and it certainly could be) then it's a puzzle to me why no concrete diagnosis, or even a solid guess, has been made. The EMGs would be only a part of a comprehensive neuro workup. Nerve conduction studies, ENG, brain MRI, etc., should all be done also. Further, this neurological problem could be secondary to a congenital vascular issue, and that needs to be considered also in the differential diagnosis. Not nearly enough has been done to narrow down the field of possibilities. Your suspicion of a cervical problem seems not unreasonable, with the exception of things affecting your eyes and face. The unequal pupils suggest something pressing on the brain, which of course needs far closer attention. The drooping and other facial paralysis suggests a brain lesion or pressure also.   The dystonia consult may well help you get pointed in the right direction. I certainly hope so. There are so many potential problems that could be causing this, and that may help by working backward from one of the symptoms to the central cause, and it is definitely a central nervous issue, with the possible exception of the chest pains,  which fit classic cardiac presentation and this should be followed up first and foremost.   I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck and please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

This really makes no sense, to admit to you there's  something not right, then dismiss the whole thing. I guess given the system you have to deal with the only constructive suggestion  I can make is that you take a very aggressive, even militant approach to having this be followed appropriately, show up at the ED occasionally if symptoms remotely warrant it, and generally make yourself unavoidable so that eventually someone will have to take a further look. It's not the best way but it may well be the only way.  I'm so sorry this is working out this way for you. Please stay in touch and keep us updated. And do not allow them to ignore you.

    "content": "Hello --  Thank you for your comprehensive report. This is helpful.   Going from  last to first on your list, the answer to (D) would be that it could be any of the possible conditions  you mention,  but since it seems inactive or very slow growing now (depending on what it actually is), the CT-guided biopsy would be ideal. Depending on where you are, there are some very skilled and anatomy-wise doctors who can do this without contrast if necessary, although there are also some alternatives, which have been offered you. It should be biopsied sooner than later, on the off chance it is malignant, since it would seem to be timed very well to be manageable  if it  is. Of course it could be any of the other things listed too, and statistically the odds of it being one ove the others means very little as far as predictions. Otherwise you wouldn't need a biopsy done. Basically TB and sarcoid are less likely but entirely possible. Infection and malignancy are about equally likely ahead of those other two. Calcification is also a possibility.

    "content": "Hello --  First, no, I have no knowlege of anything known as \"Type A\" cystic fibrosis and am unable to find any reference in the literature or on line. This may be a reference to some subset not normally used, as there are some oddball types of CF that aren't really like the classic form, but again, never heard of anything called \"Type A.\"   Second, most CF patients are identified in infancy, and \"possible\" CF is a very wild throw of the dart, since there are definite diagnostic criteria for this disease. It's not hard to diagnose and again, is usually picked up early in life, sometimes even in utero. I'm having a hard time imagining this as any sort of classic CF.   Since this has me completely stumped what I will do is refer this post to the pulmonary team here at The Doctor's Lounge and will also provide a link to the website for the CF Foundation, which you may find helpful since you can use the information there to compare with what you're currently seeing in your boyfriend. Here it is: http://www.cff.org/  Please check back here in a day or two and see if anyone has advanced any additional insights or ideas about this odd finding and obscure \"type.\" Good luck to you both.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Marfan Syndrome breathing problem",
    "content": "Hi there --  This is an odd observation by your doctor and I would think he'd have been more specific as to his meaning and the possible cause. I can make a couple guesses, however you really need to follow up with him and request a more thorough explanation.   One reason this may be happening is that many people with Marfan's simply have, due to structural abnormalities, less vital capacity (lung filling capacity) than others. However, if this were the case you should have noticed some compromise, so that doesn't seem to be the likely answer. Another possibility would be a pneumothorax (collapsed lung), which would of course yield this finding, but would likely also be accompanied by some discomfort or pain, shortness of breath, exercsise intolerance, etc. I can't imagine this not being explored and explained. I have to assume your doctor gave you some sort of pulmonary function test, and if so perhaps you know the numerical results? Also you could get your hands on an Asthma Check device, a cheap little plastic airflow device that pretty accurately show what your lung capacity is (you should be able to blow at least a 350 on one of these, which would be an adequate two-lung-power reading). Perhaps your doctor would be willing to give you one of these,  since he seems to think you're running at 1/2 capacity but has no interest in taking any action or explaining such a weird finding. If not they can be purchased in some drugstores and on line for less than $20.00.   I hope this is helpful to you. Please follow up with us here as needed. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: I am having right sided chest pain, on Chantix",
    "content": "Hi there --  While your chest pain, as described, does not sound at all cardiac-related (even for an otherwise healthy young woman, which is where so much of the confusion occurs due to atypical presentation), it's still not right, and may well be something else worthy of attention. While it could be related to smoking cessation (this is sometimes reported) and is almost certainly not due to Chantix, which can have some  unwanted side effects, but this is not one of them. Most likely this is chest wall spasm, but it is worthy of evaluation, and one reason is the remote possibility of pulmonary embolism (PE) which can often occur without any remarkable warning symptoms (although there's usually significant warning) and almost always has other symptoms accompany it. I'd just prefer to be safe than sorry, and really doubt there's anything seriously wrong, but always will opt to err on the side of caution. Almost certain this is not heart-related nor Chantix-related, and probably muscular, but again, would prefer to err on the  patient's behalf than to simply blow it off.  One thing you could do to rule out any of the above would be to do some manual pressing on the affected area, as well as some upper body twisting maneuvers and see if this aggravates the pains. If so, it's definitely musculoskeletal and over-the-counter pain meds should subdue it.  I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you. Please follow up here as needed.\n\n",

I have started to get a very loud whistling and gurgling noise from my chest I have had this for about 3 months now, and I can get it without notice one second I breath normaly then the next breath is makeing a noise sometimes this can last for a few minutes but never more than 5 really, it tends to be more frequant when im laying down or at night when im going to bed, I have noticed my usual smokers cough has become deeper and a lot more raspy I also get a huge amount of mucus which i have had for years and am constantly coughing and clearing my throat when i do this it feels like a lump actually moves from the chest but sometimes I don't get any mucus to spit out it's almost like im just clearing a blockage, my lungs burn occasionaly and I also but not frequantly get a cough where it feels like im going to be sick but actually end up with a mouthfull of clear liquid that feels like it's come from my chest rather than my belly, the strange thing is I haven't felt anymore out of breath than usual I own a transport company so I am used to physical work even though at the moment I have kidney stones a chronic back and groin pain and haven't worked for a month I don't really get short of breath apart from when i have a ciggaret occasionaly, also may be unrelated but my ears have started to ring a lot and again without warning it just comes on sometimes in one ear or both i put this down to titnus but maybe related i don't know. Any infomation you may have would be much appreciated as im not one for visiting the DOC Many thanks for your time. OH PS i am trying to give up\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  Even though you are a marginal smoker this is not helping the situation and could well be the cause. It's difficult to know. At any rate, you have something going on in there that should not be happening, and it could be chronic bronchitis or it could be a pneumonia (this does not necessarily make you feel profoundly sick, at least for a while). Although you're not one to go to the doc I would strongly suggest you make an exception, have a thorough exam including chest x-ray, and have this diagnosed and treated, because it will either become chronic bronchitis or pneumonia or, perhaps worst chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). You may have asthma, as well, and not realize it. It's pretty amazing how we adapt to slow, progressive compromise of body systems until something starts to really get severe. Since you're not having symptoms so far, you  may well be able to dodge a bullet if you get yourself in to the doc ASAP and have this thing diagnosed and treated.  Hope this helps. Good luck to you.

The aching is usually in the lower side around my armpit area on the side of my breast and up and around in a circle way (half moon kinda of) to the top of my chest on my sternum, where I sometimes get sharp pains (I think that part could be my muscles as that usually happens when I am stretching my arms out then relax them). I just finished my period. its not a sharp stabing pain in my breast, just an ache.  I'm not really in money and can't afford to go to the doctor right now to figure it out as i have to pay each time so figure I would try this.

    "content": "Hi Danielle -  I'm afraid the  problem is sufficiently vague as to be very difficult to narrow down beyond possible muscular stress due to some possible slight postural misalignment which, combined with the amount of breast tissue carried, could be causing some strain on the muscles and rib cartilage in the affected area.  I'm not satisfied with this answer, however, mainly because of your family history, so I would strongly advise you have this examined and possibly have a mamogram done as well. I understand money is a problem right now, but this has to be weighed against your overall health and safety. Hopefully you can connect with a doctor who is sympathetic to the fact that many people don't have the usual means to pay, and will perhaps work with you on a sliding scale or discounted rate for a one-time exam (assuming nothing significant shows up). I do suspect this is orthopedic in nature,  but again,  due to family history, I would be  remiss to simply send you off with that as my final answer. I really think you should get this checked. There's no way this can be diagnosed adequately on line, and self-diagnosis isn't a great idea anyway.   I hope this is helpful to you. Best of luck and please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  It's entirely possible the mold could be causing your symptoms, as mold from other sources (household, structural) often causes very similar complaints. If you can get your doctor to agree to order a pathology test of a mold sample you may just have your answer. At the very least try using something else to drink from. Nalgene has, in the past year or so, been taken off shelves and out of production because of other health issues related to the type of plastic used in their construction, and since their earliest products included petri dishes and other lab equipment it even makes more sense not only that the mold might form, but that this may be yet another problem associated with the brand. I'd stop using the current one and find another brand or type of water bottle.   Given the persistent and recurrent nature of your symptoms despite all the logical medical therapies, your mold problem is a likely cause. Given the already known health problems associated with  Nalgene I'd be willing to bet this is the source of your problems. Please let your doctor know about this, as the treatment may change given the likely source of the problem.   I hope this is helpful to you. Please stay in touch and keep us updated.\n\n",

Some of the possible causes of this  sort of discomfort are: gastric esophageal reflux disease (GERD), Barrett's espophagus, Meckel's diverticulum (one or more little pouches in the wall of the esophagus), esophageal spasm or stricture, etc. Most of these are fairly easy to manage, but some of them can eventually cause more serious problems,  and even if that doesn't happen, this can't be much fun. A good internist or, preferably, a gastroenterologist, can find out what's going on and how best to manage it so you don't have to put up with these symptoms or any future complications from whatever is causing them.  Best of luck to you. Stay in touch.\n\n",

    "content": "I just arrived in Thailand on May 2(in Bangkok).  After about 12 hours after my arrival I started having this weird sensation in my nose, throat, and tongue.  It sorta felt like when you cough or laugh when you're trying to swallow liquid and you get some in your nose, that wierd annoying feeling in the back of your mouth.  Also felt mild numbing in the my tongue, and a bit of a sore throat, but I've never really had a sore throat like this before.  And it was on the right side of my mouth only.  A day later I flew to Chang Rai, a considerable distance from Bangkok.  I had a bit of relief but mostly it has been constant now.  And it seems to be all over now, not just the right side.  My throat sometimes feels weird like I have mucus in it but theres nothing to cough up.  And it constantly feels like there something hindering my nasal breathing from the back of my throat.  It is very weird and hard to explain because I have never had something like this before.  Basically the whole thing makes me feel like my breathing is actually being hindered and sometimes it feels like my throat is swollen and that I am having trouble swallowing.  I've tried Halls Lozenges but it virtually does nothing.  I was living in Victoria, Canada before I left.  I don't smoke.  Is it something in the air?  Allergies?  It's weird, because I feel stuffy but its almost like theres nothing actually clogging me up.  Is it the elevation?(Chang Rai, I believe to be quite a bit higher than Victoria)  To be honest, it does concern me because I feel like at anytime it could get worse and I could start having serious breathing troubles.  I wont be back into Canada until June 27.  I have also been experiencing some mild chest pains on the left side.  Short duration, only a few episodes, but one time it was quite painful.  Thanks for your thoughts.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear turtlesti,  This might be related to a sinus infection or to a bad case of tonsillitis. Another cause might be acid reflux even though the odds are low. Allergies are also a very good possibility.  i am not aware whether or not some of the Thai food is served raw or semi-raw and whether or not you are eating the thai food. Food might contain some gerns and if not well cooked, the person who eats the food might run the risk of catching certain germs.  i strongly recommend that you see a doctor over there.  If the sore throat does not improve after 3-4 weeks, i recommend that you get a complete blood count to make sure that your white cell count is not low.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and I hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "I visited the doctor on Monday.  His Thai was hard to understand but he mentioned something about \"Early something rather\" as his diagnosis.  He gave me some general antibiotics and some yellow soft-looking-tylenol-looking pills for fever, but I didn't have a fever, I am to take 3 each a day together with meals.  I say \"general antibioics\" because the doctor gave the same tablets to my friend who lost her voice.  Not sure what they are, red and yellow, I Googled that description and Amoxil came up, they basically look like that but with no markings.  As I said, on Friday I started having a mild sore throat, which was new.  Saturday, my sore throat still mild but my breathing felt better.  Although I did have a short episode where it felt like my throat was swelling up again.  Sunday was ok, sore throat seemed a little worse and my breathing actually seemed better.  That night my throat got really sore and throughout my sleep I was awoken with a really bad sore throat, I don't remember the last time I had a sore throat like that.  So I went to the doc.  The pills seemed to work, all around, although my throat still felt a little sore in the mornings this week.  For some reason my breathing did improve last weekend to a good level that I was pleased with, I am stating this because I found my \"progress\" to be rather odd.    Today however I have not been feeling well.  Last night after dinner my (im going to guess tracea) tracea felt a little scratchy like it was starting to close up, kind of like an alergic reaction feel.  This breathing problem is different from the others I have been experiencing lately but I'm assuming they are connected. It sortof went away before bed.  Today I awoke feeling alright but that mild sensation quickly returned and sorta came and went in 3 parts today.  A few hours ago it seemed to get really bad.  I wasn't weezing yet but I could tell that's where it was going.  I almost decided to call it and head to the hospital but I decided to lie down on my stomach.  Odly enough I was feeling better quite quickly.  This doesn't make sense to me.  What could be causing these troubles of mine that if I were to lie down on my stomach it would help and no longer feel like its getting worse and worse.  I am so confused and frustrated.  I should add that the past couple of days I have been experienceing some other symptoms.  Frequent urination, a bit of memory problems, (like 2nd guessing myself and trying to remember if I'd done something or not).  I should mention that I do have a nervous system disorder... unknown, I've made other posts about it.  For a while now its been fairly quiet and constant so I am not terribly quick to point the finger at it.  Although frequent urination and memory troubles did bother me at one time.  But it could very well just be a cycle, I usually have a few bad days where some of my symtoms return.  But the breathing doesn't fit.  One other thing i'd like to add is: I've been noticing some abnormal eye stuff.  Like it feels sometimes like I can feel my own eye.  Usually one eye at a time.  And it feels like something is in my eye, like some cloudy liquid.  It's there but not sortof feel.  Very weird.  But never any pain.  I am going to head to see a doctor tomorrow and maybe an eye doctor as well, I was just hoping to get your opinion on all of this stuff.  Thanks for the read, You have no idea how much I appreciate your time.  We all do.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm 39 years old, male, and for past 3 years been having chest pain, the cause of which goes undiagnosed. I'm 5'10\", 187 lbs., active and otherwise healthy. Have been following SouthBeach diet for 3 months and have lost approx. 20 pounds. Strenuous manual labor for 25 years (forestry, landscaping). have used chewing tobacco for 20 years. Occasional drinker (beer).  Symptoms:  Pain & severe stinging left ribs, tightness in left chest area. Feels like it \"pulls down\" heavily while tightening. Sometimes accompanied by sweats/hot flash. Feels like a \"shock.\" Other times, stinging or \"inflamed\" sensation on left breast (under skin). Yet other times, it feels like the muscle squeezes, feels like heart. The whole muscle clamps up/moves (wave-like contraction) and it simply feels \"weird.\" Heartbeat seems to stay regular before, during, after these episodes. Breathing is not painful or problematic. Other times, general pressure all over left side, may come and go for seconds at a time for hours, and some days nothing happens. Under left armpit, muscle tightens with \"rolling\" sensation - radiating right across chest then down around breast area. Sometimes initial pain begins in back and radiates around to front of chest. Usually sleep on left side; sometimes rib area feels \"swollen.\" No significant sleep problems. I cannot determine pattern to when or why pain starts. Can be any time of day, active or inactive, seemingly not related to food. Is becoming extremely disruptive as I am often uncomfortable and worried about it.  Medical investigation to date: After consulting with GP was referred to Cardiologist; had 2 stress tests, echocardiogram, CT-angiogram, full cardio workup. He found nothing to be concerned with (passed stress test with flying colors). Referred to Gastroenterologist; he did EGD and other (?). Again, nothing unusual showed, except: mild GERD, and small hiatal hernia. Prescribed Nexium, which I take about 1x/day. Referred to Neurosurgeon; had full work up and he found nothing to explain symptoms.  Currently trying physical therapy: stretching, exercise, but have not been able to recreate pain/spasm while with therapist. Am awaiting an appt. with Rheumatologist in the next month.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  Having had all the really serious problems ruled out is helpful. Now, however, you still have the odd symptoms and it will become more of a challenge to diagnose them. I'm thinking you may be having an atypical presentation of some sort of viral inflammation similar to shingles, but without the skin eruption. Since neurology found nothing, I'm surprised there wasn't at least a trial of pain blocking medication (which is also usually effective against seizures, and this could be Jacksonion seizure of rare type as well, based on your description). Medications such as gabapentin or pregabalin may just help control the pain and spasms. It would be worth a trial, even if there's no concrete diagnosis as yet.  I hope this is helfpul to you. Good luck, and please  follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Chest Niggling Pains & Bad headaches after Exercise",
    "content": "Hello --  The chest pains you describe do not sound like they are  cardiac in nature (not even the atypical type that actually are typical for women). However, something is causing them, and while it could be simply that you've been away from the gym for a while, it also could be GI related, since a lot of different GI problems can cause chest discomfort during exercise.  It can be due to gastroesophageal reflux causing exercise-induced astham, it can be IBS with pressure up against the diaphragm causing referred pains in random areas of the chest, etc. These are not serious, but it all needs to be sorted out in order for you to feel okay about your exercise program and being healthy.   Headaches are so common and sometimes so very difficult to pin down, that your best bet may be to play detective with that and keep a journal of what you eat and do before, during and after exercise and look for patterns that correlate with the headaches.  Other than that I would simply wait for the results of the bloodwork and use that as a taking-off point.  Please do follow up with  us, especially once you've gotten the lab results. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  The good news is that you seem to have had any possible cardiac problem ruled out. The serious stuff out of the way, the challenge now is to find the cause of the pain  and correct it so you don't have to be uncomfortable. There are a number of possible orthopedic causes of this sort of thing, and one that may be uncovered by physical therapy (PT) if it is present, is a condition called thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS). This is a somewhat controversial condition and not every doctor has accepted it as legitimate, but I'm quite convinced, based on discussions with neurosurgeons, that it's not only real, but that it can cause some pretty disturbing symptoms and can be  difficult  to discover.  PT therapists are often the link in the chain where it's actually uncovered, and sometimes it will respond to PT, if, in fact, it is the problem.  This is my best guess given the little I know -- which is mostly what it is not. Hopefully PT will yield not only some relief, but some diagnostic clues as well. You might want to mention TOS to the physical therapist if it isn't brought up first.   Please let us know things go. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi. I am a 30 year old previous smoker. The last year I have stopped but with a few reoccurrences. Firstly about a year a go I started coughing up brown gunge after a bad chest infection, which I hope is all the tar from smoking, that prompted me to stop smoking. Then more recently, over the past couple of months, there has been blood in there as well. Not much to start with, just streaks, but then last week it seemed to be slightly more and almost in little wet lumps about 2mm across. I have had a chest Xray a year a go which was clear and have had a camera down my nose to check my larynx which again was clear. I have also been to the doctors a few times over the last 3 months worried as its not going away but my doctor doesn't seem as alarmed as I am as I'm not the right age to realistically have cancer.  I am currently half way through a course of Amoxycillin to clear up potential infection. Thing is, I cant workout whether its from my chest or sinuses, as its mainly in the morning (occaisionally I have had blood in the afternoon). When I blow my nose there is no blood but I think this morning when I cleared the back of my nose and spat it out there was blood. Can I request the doc to give me a CT scan or is it on their judgement?  Any advice would be greatly appreciated. A concerned and very confused Mr.Jak\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Bloody sputum, maily in the morning",
    "content": "Hi Mr. Jak -  Well no one is happy to see blood in the sputum, and it does warrant some concern, especially in a former smoker, but while age isn't a really good measure of the likelihood of cancer, if there's no marked family history of it, this is more likely due to a chronic sinus infection,  as you've guessed. Often blood and mucus can be aspirated from the sinuses down into the lungs during sleep. Coughing up whatever is down there will bring the  blood-streaked mucus as well. This  does not guarantee there is nothing serious going on, but cancer is less likely, and the fact that you were able to bring up bloody sputum from the back of your throat makes it seem more likely you have a chronic sinus infection that's producing the questionable sputum.   This should be evaluated by your doctor, as a matter of course, and you may need to be placed on an antibiotic if there is an infection. Whether or not your doctor feels a CT of the lungs is appropriate is entirely the doctor's call, although you certainly are free to make the suggestion and voice your concerns and how this might help ease your mind. It  certainly would do no harm, but because it may be quite clear upon  examination and listening to your lungs that you have no real issue down in there,  the doctor could decline to order the CT.   Former smokers frequently are more prone to this sort of problem because cigarette smoke (and heated air) drawn into the lungs damages the cilia (the little, hair-like \"helpers\" in the bronchii that help move phlegm up and out),  resulting in more aspirated drainage just sitting around, mostly in the bronchial tree, til it becomes thick enough to provoke a cough. Then it is thicker and if there is blood in the sinuses (which often happens), it shows up in the  older, often colorful mucus.   I hope this eases your mind some, and that you'll  at least bring up the CT idea to your doctor if he doesn't bring it up first. It can't hurt,  although it may well not be necessary.  In the meantime, an over-the-counter expectorant  (guaifenesen, brand-name Mucinex) can help loosen the stuff in  your chest and make it easier to cough up, which may actually resolve the problem.    Best of luck to you and please keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "I had a very bad cold and horrible cough about 5 weeks ago which took me to the ER and after several blood tests and chest xray I was sent home to simply rest and recover.  I continued to cough (productive) and finally stopped about 2 weeks later.  I then started having pressure pain in my sinus above my eyes and on my cheekbones.  I took extra vitamin C and used my neti pot to rinse the sinuses with warm saline water.  I started being awaked at night by a terrible taste in my mouth and spitting out first tan colored sputum and then slighly bloody.  This has continued so I went to my doctor who had labs done and everything was normal, chest xray was normal, so she is treating me for allerigies and post nasal drip.  I have a humidafier in my bedroom at night, drink lots of water to thin the mucus and during the daytime I feel good.  But at night the same thing is occuring and I am scared.  The doctor wanted me to take predisone for a week to reduce inflammation, but I would not take it as I read several articles that were negative so I want my doctor to swab my throat and see what the cutural will show and then take ciproflaxin as it is the only antibotic that does not give me severe side affects.  She offered to do a MRI of my chest to make me feel more calm about this, but is that appropriate, or should it be a MRI of the sinus cavaties.  How can you tell where this bloody sputum is coming from, chest or sinus?  Your input will be sincerely appreciated.  I need to stop obsessing over this as my husband has just started dialysis and that is enough of a problem for me emotionally without adding in any more.   Thank you very much.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there, I'm a medical student, and currently confused on one of my companion's question: why pleural effusion usually occurs on the right side of the lung? In bilateral pleural effusion, it's mostly the right side that has a larger amount of fluid.  Well, I then tried to google some answers, but found a bit, to nothing, of information. In one site, it says that in CHF patients, pleural effusion tends to occur on the right side because of patient's habit to lie down on his/her right side to find some comfort. Well, that makes sense. But..... why in most cases of pleural effusion, it always occur first in the right side? For example, in Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever, the pleural effusion occurs around 85% in the right side (according to one site I found). If it occurs bilaterally, the amount of fluid is usually greater than the left side.  What's the possible cause of this phenomenon? Is it the anatomy? Vascular aspect? I hope I can find some answers here. Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  Excellent question! In my experience this has been answered most often (and I've asked it more than a few times) that it's largely an anatomical phenomenon. Look at the way the right pleural cavity is occupied vs. the left and you can see it's a natural reservoir of first choice based on gravity and resistance. That's my best answer and I feel it is at least a valid one, if perhaps not the only explanation. I think it's the most logical one, and the majority of doctors (including some thoracic surgeons) have answered this way -- or simply denied the phenomenon even exists. I've seen it enough times to believe it's not  only true but that the vast majority who blame this on anatomy are correct.  I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you so much for answering, I've thought that it might be caused by anatomical structure, but couldn't explain it. Your answer seems so logical by now. Aside from posting in this forum, I've come across to some answer from other doctors that I asked from. The most interesting one is: because left lung consists of 2 lobes, and the right one is 3, then it's most likely that pleural effusion will have a tendency to occur on the right side. Why? At least, in Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever, one of the systemic failure is plasma leakage. The right lobe of the lung provides more mass of organ than the left side, thus the amount of blood vessels are greater on the right side than the left side. So, pleural effusion tend to occur first, or more, on the right side. But still, that answer is quite similar to the one you posted, and valid. Thank you so much.  PS: any other opinions?\n\n",

    "content": "For the last week I've been \"gasping\" for air. It's like I forget to breath..The first couple days was just few times throughout the day. Now it's like every few minutes, several times an hour. I'll either take a real deep breath or a big loug gasp. Everyone has been looking at me and asking me what is going on with me. My family is all noticing. I've also been having the muscles in my chest feel really sore, I'm pretty sure its from doing all of these deep breaths in. I also when I cough will get dizzy and have had increased heart palpatations. I had pleurisy about a month or so ago. Could this be due to this? I also am going to be having testing for autonomic neuropathy due to some other problems I've had. So, not sure if this could be the cause. This is not a diagnosis as of yet, however one tests has shown peripheral neuropathy. My main question is should I be concerned about the breathing issues? They just seem to be getting worse not better. I did hook myself up to my sons pulse ox last night and the respiratory rate kept alarming, however my O2 stayed within 95-96 range. But, today is was 97-98, which I know is normal. Could I simply just be \"forgetting\" to breath? Thanks for any help!!!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: \"gasping\" for air",
    "content": "Hi there --  What you're experiencing is fairly common, but people are often loathe to discuss it. Once one is made aware of one's own breathing, either due to physical problems or emotional/anxiety ones, it is very difficult to stop monitoring one's breathing, and this leads to some very conscious and so very faulty patterns which can lead to increased anxiety,gasping, hyperventilation syndrome (lightheadedness, dizziness, tingling and numbness in the fingers and in the lips and  around the mouth, even sometimes in the anterior chest) and leads to more of the same.  This kind of situation can also lead to very sore chest wall muscles, especially upon deep breathing, as well as tightness of those muscles (tetany due to hyperventilation). Worse yet, the unwitting hyperventilation causes the victim to throw off more carbon dioxide, the very thing that causes the brain to send the diaphragm and lungs the message to breathe in! When too much CO2 is  thrown off this way, the signal to breathe is lost temporarily (even though ultimately breathing is voluntary it is mainly habitual) so, in a sense, yes, you can (or your brain can) \"forget\" to breathe. Of course, once the CO2 balance is restored the signal comes back quickly, and since by then the brain actually needs some O2, the next breath is gasping in  nature,  since it feels as though one has somehow \"forgotten\" to breathe. It is a vicious cycle that can be dificult  to break, but it can be broken.  Complicating this is the fact that you may have some peripheral neuropathy causing dysautonomia, so that the \"Breathe\" signal is more easily lost from  moment to moment.This is not dangerous but can be terribly distressing. The results are pretty much identical to those of anxiety-based hyperventilation. It's incredibly annoying. As you've noticed by checking, your room air O2 saturation remains normal (95-100 is perfectly normal and when very relaxed or during hyperventilation the sats can actually drop lower. When this happens during relaxation or sleep, in the absence of anxiety, there are generally no symptoms at all except yawning, which is the normal response).   You're not literally forgetting to breathe, but are throwing off the CO2 balance, which, as I explained earlier, feels as though one is forgetting. It's  actually just a confusion of the brain itself,  caused by a too-acute awareness of breathing, unless it is caused by dysutonomia secondary to peripheral neuropathy. Generally the result is the same, and sometimes anti-anxiety medication or cognitive behavioral therapy will help \"cure\" the problem.   I hope this is helpful to you. Do your best to relax, look into formal programs for dealing wtih this very common problem, and please follow up with  us here as needed. Good luck to you!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi. I'm an 18 year old high school student. About a week ago, I started experiencing discomfort in my right chest area. I can only describe it as a sort of pressure that comes and goes. I'm experiencing it right now.   The pressure isn't painful or anything- only uncomfortable, and for the first few days, I absentmindedly just rubbed the area with my hand. The pressure would stop temporarily, but restart later. I don't experience anything outside of the chest area. It would rarely occur during the mornings, but I would experience the discomfort again in late afternoon and in the evening. I have no trouble sleeping- the pressure seems to stop late at night.  I'm sedentary- I don't play sports, nor do I get any form of regular exercise after my gym class physical education requirements for high school were fulfilled. I'm 5'11'' and I weigh 160 lbs. The nurse told me that my blood pressure was 120/80 It seems that I spend most of my time at school and doing homework/ extracurricular activities in clubs.  I went to see my doctor, and he seemed a bit puzzled. He gave me an EKG, and it turned out normal. He gave me heartburn medication (prilosec OTC) sample packets to try at home and to report back to him. My parents have advised me not to take them, fearing that it may not be heartburn, and that adjustments in my diet would suffice. I'm inclined to take the medicine, but I'm not too sure.  What should I do?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Chest Pressure in right breast area",
    "content": "Hi there --  Well. Pressure in the right chest is rather atypical of cardiac problems, although it can occur there, and that way. However, being very atypical and coming away with a normal 12-lead EKG, the likelihood of it being heart related becomes very small, especially at your age. It could very well be gastric reflux (GERD), and it doesn't seem to be aggravated by exertion (although you apparently don't exert a lot; you might try hustling up a flight of stairs to see if that aggravates the symptom -- and if it doesn't then it's almost certainly non-cardiac, though if it does it proves very little). As for your parents advising you to not take the Prilosec, I'm perplexed by their reasoning. If it's not heartburn (GERD) then it will do nothing. It certainly won't mask heart symptoms. It's not heart medicine. On the other hand, if the sensation is due to GERD, it should help. In any case it won't hurt anything and you should try it on the off chance the doctor is right. Give it at least a week to work, too, as that doesn't always yield immediate relief.  Other things it may be are: interior chest all irritation; right-sided pnuemonia (although I'd guess your doctor listened to your chest and maybe even did an x-ray); Teitz' syndrome, which is an inflammation of cartilege between the ribs near the breastbone. This responds to over-the-counter anti-inflamatories like Advil and Aleve, but don't try those til after you've started the Prilosec, because if you DO have GERD, those can make it worse.   For the record, acute cardiac chest pain in men almost always IS described as pressure and deep burning pain, beneath the center of the breastbone, often radiating to the shoulders, arms, back and/or jaw. Nothing like what you're describing.   If your problem doesn't go away on its own and/or with Prilosec use, then by all means take it back to the doctor, but with an eye toward figuring out what is causing it, which is nto likely heart-related.   Hope this is helpful. Please follow up with us as needed. Godo luck to you.\n\n",

However, it won't be  absorbed or dissolve, and it can migrate, although if  left in muscle or fatty tissue many times it will stay put. However, if it's causing discomfort, it  needs to be located and removed. This really shouldn't be that difficult. Apparently this isn't the first time your doctor has had this experience, but if you're having any symptoms which may be related to the remainder of the catheter, you deserved to have the problem corrected.

    "content": "Hi there -  Sarcoidosis can involve the eyes and one type of involvement can cause swelling of the optic nerve with increased intracranial pressure (ICP) so yes, this could be related to sarcoidosis and should be checked ASAP. If it is due to sarcoidosis the outcome, with prompt and correct treatment, is usually pretty good, so the prognois should be promising. However, there is always the Awful Coincidence Phenomenon to consider, wherein more than one thing is going on at the same time -- and there's no rule against having more than one problem at once.   If sarcoidosis is ruled out I hope your doctor will aggressively pursue the cause of the swelling,  as there are a number of serious problems that can also cause this,  and while  they are generally manageable, it only works if the cause can be discovered.   I hope this is helpful. Please follow up with  us as needed and also keep us updated as to anything new. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  This sounds like what you suspect, probably a chest wall irritation due to muscle strain due to tensing in the cold, or possibly even pleuritic pain (similar) due to the cold, dry air being inhaled. While generally not at all serious, it can be somewhat debilitating, especially if the pain on taking a breath is severe. Normally this type of problem will respond well to over-the-counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatory pain meds such as ibuprofin or naproxyn. If one  of these is not effective then  you'll need to be seen by a doctor. Usually, though, these types of medications will resolve the pain and allow the affected muscles or chest wall lining to heal.   Hope this helps. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Am 28 years and I don\u2019t drink and smoke. In later 2001 I had cold and flu with catarrh and coughing. After taking some cough mixture I will be relief. But in 2004 I had cold and flu again which result to a very severe coughing and catarrh. The sputum is white with no chest pain. I used cough mixture but it won\u2019t go so I went to see a doctor and he gave me one antibody drugs but I did not remember the name again. The drug work perfectly and I was relief for years  In late 2007, I started feeling some irritation and itching in my ear and throat which may last for about 10mins but when is severe it will last for 15 to 20 minutes and also extend to the middle of my chest. This occurs mostly in the night but I will be relief after taking water or menthol sweet. These continue until early 2008 and it stops and result to very deep coughing and catarrh which produce white sputum but no chest pain. I took cough mixture and antibody drugs but I was not relief. Later l started feeling some kind of sputum clogged in my throat and each time I tried to cough this out it wont come out this will result to move violent coughing . One afternoon, the cough became severe with little chest pain and light headache due to the violent of the coughing that I became weak but thank God my sister was around and I ask her to get my a milk to get some energy. Thank God it work gain some energy, I went to see my aunty (nurse) she gave a drug Zanit (antibiotics) and I took it for five days. I was greatly relief but the sputum clogged still in my throat but the coughing was reducing. So the following Monday I went to see a doctor told him everything and the drugs am using currently. He no gave some drugs cough mixtures but he did give any antibody since I was already using one but he said I should go for X-ray and tuberculosis which came out clear. After weeks I was relief totally. After some months I will feel the irritation and the itching in my ear and throat but under 5mins it will relief me   6 weeks ago came to London and about 3 weeks ago I had cold and flu which result to cough and catarrh and I started taking cough mixture. A week later, the coughing subsides a little bit. One morning, I woke up to clear my nose then I notice dark blood stain in the mucus or sputum, immediately I clear my throat and also the blood stain was there. I called my Mom (nurse) and told her she just told me is winter cold that it will go and that I should just keep warm. Though I was afraid but she said it will go. After about 3 days, the sputum was clear no blood stain again. Though I still cough with no catarrh.  About 5 days ago I went out in very cold weather when I got home felt some pains in my joints and bone generally but after keeping warm I was relief again. This morning, when I woke up I notice a bit tired and when I clear my throat without coughing this morning I saw a dark blood in the sputum it was more that the previous one I was alarmed again. When I told me mom again she said is cold that it will go. And she said just take hot liquid. Since then up to the time of writing this post, I can still see the dark blood in the sputum when I spit out the sputum even without coughing.  An feeling better from the cough and I don\u2019t have catarrh  but my fear is why is dark blood mixed with my sputum and this give a lot fear, like is lung cancer, Tb, infection or just cold as my mom told me.  Please help because am now in fear and anxiety as am writing this post And thank you in advance for replying my post\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  It sounds as though you are prone to respiratory infections, both chest and sinus. The blood you describe seems to be coming from your sinuses and this is, in fact, very common, especially during winter, with cold, dry air and dry air from the heat indoors. The combination dries the mucus membranes in the nose and sinuses and causes small capilaries to break. The blood pools in the sinuses and elsewhere, and, since it is dark, this means it has probably been sitting there for a while. If you were to cough up bright red blood from your chest, this is a very different thing and not like what you've described.   Along with treating the symptoms of your colds and bronchitis (which is what this sounds like), you might try purchasing a humidifier for the room where you sleep, which may help keep the air from drying the mucus membranes and reduce the amount of blood you see. The blood in  mucus is very common with winter colds.   I hope this is helpful to you. Please keep us updated. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "You're very welcome. I'm happy to know the problem seems to be resolving. Hopefully this will mark a turnaround for you.   Some of the factors in chronic respiratory infections are not totally controllable and some of us seem more prone to them than others, but one of the main things we can do is try to keep the lower respiratory tract as clear as possible early on when a productive cough appears, using an expectorant such as guaifenasin. Also, try to avoid crowded situations as much as possible, especially during the winter months, as much is practical, since this is where many infections are transmitted by droplet. Also, maintain good nutrition so as to keep the immune system at its strongest, get adequate rest and sleep, and just as important, remain physically active as much as possible. See a doctor at the first signs of a new infection so as to minimize it early on.   Best of luck to you. Stay well.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Pain when taking a deep breath",
    "content": "Hi there -  What  you're describing is not heart related, but sounds exactly like pleurisy, which of course (I even hate to say this) is probably being worsened by the increase in smoking and may actually be due to smoking. No lecture, you know what you need to do with that.  Pleurisy or pleuritic pain, is due to irritation or inflammation of the pleura, the membrane lining the space between the lungs and the chest wall. Sometimes it also involves the chest wall itself. It can be caused by a mild viral infection, lung irritation, or due to random irritating causes. The pain can be felt in the side from the bottom  of the ribs upward on inspiration and often will shoot up into the shoulder or the area of the collar bone. It can be excruciating and inhibit normal breathing, which over time can lead to pneumonia, just FYI. Usually this doesn't happen, and sometimes pleurisy actually is the main symptom of a mild pneumonia.   Pleuritic pain usually responds well to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory  (NSAID) pain meds like ibuprofin (as Advil) or naproxyn  (as Aleve). If this doesn't resolve the problem  or if it recurs,  you should have this checked by a doctor to make sure there's no underlying lung problem. Usually it will resolve on its own, more quickly with NSAID therapy.  I hope this helps. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi again -  Thanks for the reply and update. To answer your followup question, most pleuritic pain is referred upward, so often the origin is lower in the chest wall area, but is felt very distinctly in the locale you describe. This is especially common with pain in the thorax, where a lot of the nerves wander around in peculiar patterns. It probably is localized, but probably not where it is felt, although of course that's possible too. Usually the actual site of irritation is lower down. It can be anywhere along the trunk of the nerve and will usually always be felt mainly up high as you describe.   Hope this helps.\n\n",

As to what they may be caused by, there are several possibilities: sharp pains that are provoked by deep breaths are ofthen due to pleurisy (an irritation of the chest wall lining). They also can be caused by chronic or intermittent irritation of the cartilage between the ribs. Both things respond well to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory meds such as Advil (ibuprofin) or Aleve (naproxyn), available over the counter.   I hope this is helpful to you.

    "content": "Hi, I am 38 years old, S/P delivery of healthy 6 month old twin girls. Twice in the last month I have had a stabbing-like, sharp pain in the same area just below my right breast. It seemed to worsen when I breathed in and upon touching, I could have sworn I felt a little bubble that slightly moved. Though, I am prone to anxiety  and fear the idea of a Heart Attack. Strangely enough, the pain has subsided within 20 -40 minutes after taking Tylenol (not an NSAID). It happened in the same area each time and is a localized pain. I do recall having pain in the upper right rib when I was pregnant but it was constant and not a stabbing, shooting pain as this is. Note: My left arm also hurts often on and off, but It is a gnawing pain that radiates from my wrist to generally around my elbow area to the inner arm 1 /12 inches above the elbow where I tend to hold my 12 lb babies so I think it could be related to stress of the bearing weight and cocking my wrist to hold the bottle???\n\n",

    "title": "Re: sharp stabing chest pains",
    "content": "For laurenspeak:  Hello -  The left-sided pain you describe is almost certainly not heart related, even as aytpical pain goes. It is retrograde (runs backward from an extremity to your chest) and your description strongly suggests you may have developed a neuromuscular or orthopedic/neurological injury due to the unbalanced strain on your right side by holding baby. This could be as simple as simple strain or could be more complex, such as thoracic outlet syndrome (nothing life-threatening, but something which can cause this sort of symptomology and is many times due to postural change -- like holdng baby -- when it's not due to trauma). A neurologist would probably be your best bet as a specialty consult, as the pain sounds like it is distributed along a nerve pathway running from your right extremity back up to just about where the thoracic outlet is located. This makes sense and is often treatable by changes in postural habits, physical therapy and/or home exercises. Rarely, it is corrected by surgery. It's worth looking into.   Your right-sided pain also sounds unlike even atypical heart pain, but more like possible reciprocal (compensatory) pain possibly from the strain on the left side. You may have had some inflammation of the cartilage between your ribs on that side prior to this and it may have become irritated again.  I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck with this and follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "I have been a smoker for approximately 10 to 11 years and have recently quit with some relapses of a few here and there.  For about 3 weeks I have had pain on the left side towards the bottom of my rib cage underneath.  When taking a deep breath it almost feels as if there is something under the rib cage the size of a small fist.  Also, there is a tight feeling with death breaths.  I took some anti-inflammitories and this did not seem to work (Naproxen).  It is not constant and will sometimes go away after a couple of glasses of wine or a beer.  Any thought as to what this may be?  Thank you\n\n",

    "title": "Re: aching pain/tightness in lower to mid rib cage area",
    "content": "Hello -  This is interesting for several reasons. For one thing, it tends to go away with one or two alcoholic drinks, which would suggest relaxation is the cure, so tension may be the problem. This tension could well be taking place either in the abdominal muscles, but having that happen on one side this way would be odd. However, it also could be due to gas being trapped in the colon, at the splenic flexure (where the large intestine makes a sharp downward turn on the left side). This is a very common are for things to become trapped,  like gas,  fecal matter, etc. and can cause a sensation of a knot or bloating at that point, as well as discomfort/pain. Naproxyn would definitely not be the right choice if this is a GI problem. If it's muscular, but not tender to the touch (as in strained or inflamed muscles), then it also wouldn't be very helpful.   If this symptom continues over a long period of time (and it already has) then it's probably wise to have it evaluated by an MD, just to be certain there isn't some sort of physical issue there, such as a polyp or inflammation inside the colon.  I hope this is helpful to you. Please follow up with  us as needed. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you so much for you information.  I recently visited my regular doctor and he was unable to feel anything in the area, but to be safe ordered some chest x-rays due to my history of smoking.  He also ordered a blood test for thyroid etc.  Also said this could be possibly anxiety induced and instead of occational Xanax should think about Paxil or something.  The tightness and aching is still there and have had no change in bowel habits etc that I've noticed.  I have also been taking Protonix and Metaprolol for some time so I don't think its the medication.  Any more thoughts to what might be happening?  Thank you again for your time!\n\n",

There is a typical body habitus where a person is medium height to tall, thin, a little below normal weight and has low blood pressure.

This is often associated with various kind of chest pains and shortness of breath. This condition is absolutely benign and has no dire consequences whatsoever.  If you are not a hyposthenic or have an MVP, the stabbing pains you have may result from a muscle pull or from an inflamed pleura [membrane covering the lungs]. A visit to your doctor followed by any tests that she advises would be in order.   Apurva  Apurva\n\n",

    "title": "Dull Chest Pain on Right Side",
    "content": "Hi, I'm a 26 year old male and I have been experiencing dull pain on the right side of my chest. The pain generally lasts about 1 to 2 seconds and occurs anywhere from once every 20 minutes to 3 times a minute. This could happen for several days staight and then disappear for a month. The pain is dull but very localized, a few inches to the right of center and maybe a few inches deep. It almost feels as if it's in my right lung, but it doesn't seem to correspond with breathing or moving. I believe it's related to anxiety, but I'm unsure whether it's a cause, effect or both. However, it is definitely not psychosomatic. It's generally not very painful and mostly quite mild - but uncomfortable and worrisome nonetheless. I am 6'1\" and weigh 155 lbs. I'm not aware of any history of heart disease in my family (parents/grandparents). My diet is fairly healthy and I don't smoke. I'm not as active as I should be, but lately I've started walking about a mile a day. I do suffer from generalized and social anxiety, occasional mild depression and, more rarely, panic attacks. I take 40mg of generic Paxil a day. When my blood pressure is taken, the systolic (top number) is typically pre-hypertensive (120-139) and sometimes higher. Diastolic is almost always normal. My doctor suspects a bit of the white-coat hypertension effect due to my anxiety. I now home monitor my BP, and the systolic is usually between 120-130. Of course my worst fears always get the best of me. I instinctively think that it's either heart-related (clogged artery, inflamed heart, etc.) or lung cancer. If anything, these fears seem to make it worse (more frequent). Compounding my worries, I don't have health insurance. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, Mike\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Dull Chest Pain on Right Side",
    "content": "Hello -  First, let's eliminate your concerns about a heart problem. Now heart pain, contrary to popular belief, can be felt, sometimes, to the right of the sternum,  although it is unusual. However, heart pain is not intermittent, highly localized, nor fleeting. It's not heart pain you're feeling.   So what is it? Well, being an anxious person you do have some useful insight into the insidious ways anxiety can play tricks on us.  These types of chest pains, while  usually felt on the left side most often in anxious patients (no idea why this should be, but most often it is) are often caused by minor muscle spasms or irritation, and that, in turn, is quite often caused by faulty breathing practices, usually not  consciously performed, but more like nervous tics in response to the pervading, almost claustrophobic sensations anxiety can sometimes cause. Usually the result is irritation of one or more small groups of accessory muscles.   This  is the kind of thing that  begs the advice \"Try to ignore it.\" I realize that's like asking someone to not think about something: it rarely works. However,  knowing it's nothing serious sometimes allows the sufferer to let is slip out of the  sphere of awareness. As I'm sure you know, many anxious people are more tuned into their bodies and somatic sensations, so it's not as easy for everyone to \"lose\" track of a basically useless message from the body such as your pain. Still, this is, or should be, the goal for you. Know it's OK, it's nothing, and hopefully your attention will shift  to something else, preferably something more positive. It can be done, but it's not so much a conscious \"not thinking about it\" as it is thinking about other things more, so that this  issue is lost in the  shuffle. Trust me, if you ever have truly significant chest  pains you won't be able to ignore them or \"forget\" they're happening. It's a whole different animal.  I hope this is helpful to you. Please  follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "For D68Money -  If you were to go back and read your own post now, you might see that what you've described is a rather stressful, potentially anxiety-producing situation you're currently in the midst of. Then you close by saying you don't have anxiety (or depression). Anxiety is, by definition, an overwhelming feeling of dread, and if you (or perhaps your wife, since you have yourself classified as male) are having a baby soon, that alone is enough to produce enough anxiety for both of you. You're also moving shortly,  one of the more stressful events on the stress scale (and there is a very real stress scale that assigns a point value to various life events). You then ask if all this might not be causing you to worry that your symptoms might represent  something more serious, which is a working definition of anxiety. If you didn't have it to begin with, you are certainly anxious now. I hope you will go back and look at my response to the previous poster, since everything I said to her would apply to you as well, given that your symptoms are,  as you say, \"exactly the same.\"  I hope this is helpful. Please follow up with us as needed. Good luck to you.\n\n",

I feel like I ran a mile and cant catch my breath. I get out of breath just from talking. My chest will feel really tight, I get light headed and my left arm will feel sore then my hand tingles and I feel so tired. I cant get my cough out completely because I cant take a deep breath. It's hard to explain the cough. My collar bone area starts to hurt and my jaw line and neck.   I feel silly going back to urgent care for this because I have already been there twice. Do you know what this might be or why it wont go away and keeps getting worse. I havent been drinking as much coffee, I cut my smoking down to less then a half pack(i should quit completely).

You know that, so enough said, no sermons are forthcoming.  Second, please don't feel silly going back to the urent care facility, since you're sick! In fact, what I strongly suspect has happened, based on your very thorough description and history, is that while  you started out with a viral infection, you now have developed a bacterial superinfection. (This doesn't mean  some super bug has taken hold, but merely that a bacterial infection has superimposed itself on the weakend and irritated respiratory tract, while the virus has probably played itself out). This happens quite often, and while no antibiotic will kill off a viral infection, antibiotics are absolutely indicated for a bacterial infection. The change in color of your sputum makes it likely you now have a bacterial infection (that \"superinfection\" thing). I would go back to the urgent care clinic at once and have them do a sputum culture to see if you now need antibiotics. Nothing silly about that.   Best of luck to you. Please follow up with us and let us know how things turn out.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there,   I am a 22 year old female. Former smoker of 7 years. I also worked in the construction industry around alot of dust and insulation for 2 years, and since then have worked in warehouses. I do alot of physical work, and am fairly physically active (was more active up until the pain started).  About 7 months ago I started experiancing pain in the left side of my chest. At first I thought i was having a heart attack and immediantly went to the emergancy room. They have me an EKG and a chest x-ray and decided that it was all in my head.   Anyway, the pain continued and got worse as it did. .  Since then I have seen 3 different doctors. One of them sent me for an ultrasound of my breast, but the results came back negative. The other 2 sent me for MORE xrays of my chest (even though I had told them that I had xrays already) and said they looked fine and sent me home. One of them told me they would get a specialist to call me, which was 4 months ago and nothing has happened. Unfourtunatly I do not have a family doctor, as I move from city to city alot.  The best way I can describe the pain is a sharp stabbing pain in my lung. It moves around to the back, but mostly stays in the front under my breast. I get pains in my collar bone and down my arm. Recently it has been sending sharp pains down my side and into my leg as well. I get a shortness of breath at time (not all the time) and I get a bloated naceous feeling at the same time. The pain is pretty much constant. I might get lucky and go 1 day, or even half a day with no pain. There does not seem to be anything I do that makes it worse, or better. My boyfriend has also been telling me for the past 3 years that I hold my breath when I sleep, and sometimes quit breathing for a couple of seconds. (Which sounds to me like sleep apnia, which runs in my family) Could this have anything to do with the pain that I am experiancing?.  Also, are there any suggestions for finding a doctor who can help me with this? I am getting desperate. It is really holding me back from doing alot of things because I am scared. I have put on 10 pounds since this started because I can not do any cardio whatsoever, without feeling like I am going to pass out.  Also, I do have a history of colon cancer. My father was diagnosed in September and passed away at the beginning of December.  Thanks alot.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Sharp Chest Pain / Shortness of breath /Stomach Sickness",
    "content": "Hello -  First, my deepest sympathies on the recent loss of your father.   This pain should at least be looked into so that the most obvious and most serious potential problems can be ruled out. While it sounds atypical for cardiac pain, most women do present with atypical pain. The fact that you're young and otherwise healthy probably has led doctors to ignore this possibility, and while at your age it is less likely than post-menopause, it is possible and should always be ruled out first. There are also other,  non-coronary-related pains that can happen that aren't necessarily as serious but still deserve diagnosis and possible treatment. At the very least you should have been given an electrocardiogram (EKG) to rule out any gross abnormalities. You probably should  have an echocardiogram as well, since mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is very common in the general population and about twice as common among women as men. While MVP is almost always benign, it can cause some pretty scary symptoms such as left-sided chest pain, palpitations, occasional shortness of breath, etc. When MVP causes symptoms they can be treated with a simple medication and/or exercise and relaxation exercises.  There is also the possibility, further down the ladder of seriousness, that this could be a nerve-muscle-orthopedic problem caused by a strain or pull caused by the very physical sort of work you do. It could even be a very simple orthopedic problem known as costochrondritis, which is inflammation of the cartilage between the ribs.  The pain down your leg may or may not be related to the chest pains, since due to the nature of your work you're at greater risk of orthepedic and muscle injuries and could have more than one problem with your spine causing separate problems.  One way to help rule out cardiac involvement regarding the pain is to find out if it can be provoked or worsened by physical movement, twisting of the upper body, raising of the arms, or direct  pressure on the affected area. Can you tell me if this is true or not? Also, is it worsened by exercise? These are important things which would be very helpful in clarifying what's going on.  The observation of your boyfriend that you seem to pause or hold your breath when  you're breathing should probably be looked into as well, as you have a family history of sleep apnea. While it seems unlikely it is possible. It's hard to tell whether this would be related to the other symptoms or not,  but it would be worth learning if this is a real problem or not.  If you move too often to establish a primary care physician relationship then your best bet is probably to be seen at an acute care facility and use it as your temporary primary care source. You can be referred to local specialists this way, also. You should probably be seen by a cardiologist and maybe pulmonologist as well. There are a lot of possible causes of your symptoms and it's difficult to narrow them down at a distance this way. I hope this has been somewhat helpful.  Good luck to you and  please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  It sounds like the coughing wound up being worse than the orginal problem. I'm sorry to hear that,  and you will need to give the chest muscles and cartilage a break in order for that to heal, so wrestling with the animals probably is out for a week or so. Also, the animals may well wind up irritating the bronchii, since the infection will make you more sensitive in that area where you might not have been otherwise -- and exposure to animal dander and other by-products could have caused the infection  to start with.   Finish the Z-Pack, use the inhaler as instructed, and use over-the-counter non-steroidal-anti-inflammatory pain meds like Advil or Aleve to help with the chest pain. Also rest the chest! This is very imporatant, as is assessing the possibility that you cought something as a result of tending the animals, since there are a lot of possible exposures not only to irritants but to bacteria, in that job.  I hope this is helpful. Best of luck and please keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  Bronchitis, if acute, usually will resolve anywhere between a few days and a few weeks. However, it can become chronic, especially if secondary to a sinus infection or other underlying cause of infection or irritation. It can also turn into asthma in certain subjects (usually people who already have had some allergy problems).   If the infection seems to have resolved but the wheezing,  coughing and shortness of breath continues, you'll need to be re-evaluated with an eye toward possible asthma subsequent to bronchitis. The treatment is generally the same, but it may go on indefinitely if that's the  problem. In either case it can be intermittent and chronic or, if it's just relapsing bronchits, it may resolve given enough time. You may also need to have one or more breathing treatments (using a nebulizer) in the doctor's  office  to help loosen up the secretions.   I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you, and please follow up with us and let us know how you're doing.\n\n",

    "content": "You very likely have, then, exercise-induced asthma, possibly secondary to gastroesophageal reflux disease (the connection was only relatively recently made), as well as some allergies, and treating both will probably yield the best results.   Primatine Mist may work for you temporarily. It's just epinepherine and not as strong in effect as you'd get in an Albuterol inhaler, but it may make things tolerable for you in the interim. Since Primatine Mist is less predictable in effect than Albuterol you really need to be careful not to exceed the recommended doseage and to follow instructions for use closely -- just as with Albuterol. It's there, and in a pinch it works well for some people when they can't get their hands on the genuine article.  I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Jay -  I'm  not even going to ask how this happened, but I'm willing to bet it won't happen  again. At any rate, while this is  something you generally don't want in your lungs or airway, and technically it is toxic, the chances of you having any lasting problems from this mishap are fairly small. The main thing you'll need to look out for over the next few days is aching in the ribs, shortness of breath, or a progressive and productive cough; then you might  have developed aspiration pneumonia. Otherwise, this should resolve on its own without too much trouble. The headache is most likely related to some very powerful coughing, which is reasonable considering what happened. While the risk of complications is  small, you probably would be wise to have a healthcare professional listen to your lungs just to be certain there's nothing making noise in there. In all likelihood the substance never got that far. If your airway is clear and your throat's not sore and you can talk without excessive hoarseness then the phosphates (the offensive content of Cascade) aren't likely to have damaged anything further down.   I hope this answers your concerns, and please do follow up with us as needed, and update us, also, as to how you're feeling. And of course if anything weird or unpleasant should start up (again, very unlikely) go to an ER, don't bother to call the poison control center, as this would be a localized problem and not a systemic one.  Best of luck to you. I suspect there's no need to say \"be careful.\" I'm sure you will. :)\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I am suffering from anxiety and have a pressure on my chest in the middle where my ribcage joins together. I also have a burning/buzzing feeling on my left chest muscle.  Since I started having panic attacks 2 months ago I have been in the A&E three times thinking I'm having a heart attack and had my ECG checked everytime, nothing wrong with my heart.  I have also been to my doctors which have done bloodtest and urin and everything is fine. He prescribed me Citalopram to take but after 3 weeks the side effects was just too bad so had to stop.   After 3 weeks without Citalopram my body is getting back to normal accept from my stomach. I have a really sensitive stomach and that was one of the main reasons why I stopped with the anti depressants.   I had a really bad panic attack 3 weeks ago and it made my chest really sore on my left breast and I also had a stitch 3 cm below. Since then I have had this sore feeling in my left breast muscle and it feels like it's vibrating or buzzing. This feeling comes and goes but the last couple of days it's got worse again.   I am wondering if this burning/buzzing feeling in my chest is caused by acid reflux, inflammation in muscle or just nerves playing up? I am a bit scared that it could affect my heart in some way. I havent been diagnosed with acid reflux but the last couple of days I've had a really bad pressure where my ribs join on the chest and it feels like it's fizzy inside and my stomach is making a lot of noises. don't get proper heartburn but have a feeling of something in my throat and alot of flem. I also have an ulcer on the side of my tongue far back that has been there for about 2 weeks.  I would be very grateful for any help.  Many thanks\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Chest pain due to anxiety?",
    "content": "Hello -  Well you've started out well by addressing the panic disorder (PD) problem. It's too bad the medication wasn't well tolerated, but there are others you could (and probably should) try. Meanwhile,  we'll try to evaluated and explain the chest discomfort, etc.  People who have anxiety disorders also have, for any number of possible reasons, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), as well as other stress-related GI problems (IBS, gastritis, etc.), so this may be at least part of the problem causing the disturbing sensations in your chest. However, there is something else to consider with that, and that is that anxious people tend to breathe in faulty ways as well, which can often cause chest discomfort, because it not only strains the accessory muscles (those between the ribs and at the top of the ribcage, between the shoulders and the neck), but also can irritate the cartilage between the ribs. Either of these things (or both together) can cause localized chest pain and tenderness as well as \"stitches\", which are usually little painful muscle spasms in the chest wall.   The buzzing sensation is something often reported also by anxious people, and while I have never yet heard anyone advance a convincing theory as to why it happens, it is clear it's benign as well.   If you'd like to try and determine if you're having some anxiety-related GI problems you might attempt a trial of one of the over the counter medications for that purpose (such as Pepcid AC, or its generic equivalent, Prilosec OTC, etc.). If the stomach symptoms are reduced or go away, all to the good. If not, after a week or two, then you can safely discontinue the trial of whatever medication you decide on.   As for the chest discomfort, there are two things you can try yourself also. One is to take an over-the-counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatory such as Advil or Aleve, but bear in mind these can irritate the stomach, which  may work at cross-purposes to the other medication. Another thing, not involving medications, would be to try and take note of your breathing: whether you sigh a lot at rest, or if you feel you can't draw a full, satisfying breath. If so, you may be breathing in a faulty way, which is, again, very common in the setting of anxiety. If you find you may be doing this, try consciously breathing through your nose (or at least take note if you're sighing a lot -- you can't sigh very easily through the nose).   Most of all, though, I'd try and find another prescription medication  you can tolerate, to use to control the anxiety and panic disorder. There are any number of not only antidepressants, but also benzodiazepines such as Klonopin (generic: clonazepam).   I hope this is all helpful to you. Please follow up with us as needed. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Chest pain due to anxiety?",
    "content": "Thank you for taking your time to reply.  Since my posting I've been to see my doctor a couple of times. First visit I told him about my concern about acid reflux and I was prescribed som tablets to take for it. After 2 weeks of taking them I still had a bad chest discomfort. I went back to see my doctor again and he said it's all to do with the anxiety and that I should go councelling.  For weeks now I have been experiencing more or less a constant tingeling in my chest, mostly on the left side right on my breast. It feels worse if I touch and also radiates down my left arm. When the tingling is worse and I press my chest muscles it feels like they will cramp up underneath my chest. Sometimes I get a tingle inside my chest close to my lungs.I am really struggeling to understand that anxiety can cause these symptoms as it feels really awful.  Something that hit me was when you mentioned the breathing in your reply. Normally when breathing is mentioned in panic attacks/anxiety it is hyperventilation, I never thought I had that problem as I am not breathing fast. But thinking about I probably don't breath as I should. Alot of the time, probably more often than I am aware of I stop breathing as I am scared of the pain in my chest. So from now on I am going to practice more on my breathing and hopefully that will help me with my chest pain.  Another thing I wanted to mention is that this feeling of muscle cramps on my chest has more or less been with me since my panic attacks started. I used to go to the gym 2 times a week and often lift weights to to build up my chest and arms. Could this be something muscular or even a trapped nerve?  There is also a muscle in my neck on the right side that has been sore for 3-4 months that wont go away. But I do work in an office and sit in front of a computer all day so my neck doesn't get that much rest. I noticed a week ago that there must be  trapped nerve in my tailbone as when I pull to the right it hurts.  don't really know where to turn now as I have had 3 doctors telling me it is anxiety but to me it feels like as soon as I mention anxiety they settle with that explanation and don't want to do any further investigation.  I would be grateful for any help.  Vanilth\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Chest pain due to anxiety?",
    "content": "Hi Vanith -  I think you've pinned down the two possible causes of your chest discomfort in  this followup post. While it definitely can be caused by anxiety-related faulty breathing, what you describe also could be due to a secondary (or even unrelated) problem with a nerve being impinged upon (anxiety could have caused this through the mechanics of breathing or it's possible it could be a coincidental repetitive movement/postural injury, likely due to your work).   It is very true -- strangely so -- that anxious patients are often unable to recognize when they are breathing in a faulty manner,  which is why hyperventilation can sneak up on one so stealthily. Strange, but true. So it's good you're willing to look  at that  possibility.  If you can  elicit pain or tingling or other discomfort via manual pressure on your chest, then you have either a pinched nerve or inflammation in one or more of the costochondral spaces (between  the ribs,  where they connect to the sternum). While in no case is this related to the heart, it may well be an actual physical issue,  whether it is the result of faulty breathing, posture in front of the computer (a common cause) or just a random case of inflammation. It may well respond to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication  such as ibuprofin or naproxin, in which case you would  notice relief and your attention would then cease to be drawn to it. Even if this doesn't work (nerve impingement often doesn't), you can know it is something relatively simple and benign, even though it is odd and annoying.  It sounds as though you are on a good path toward improving this aspect of your anxiety. Best of luck to you  with that, thanks for the followup, and please do stay in touch.\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks again for following up on my problem.   I have tried to focus more on my breathing and it is making me much more calm.  I've had some really good days in the behinning of last week when I almost felt normal again but after 2 days back at work it got worse again.   I have now discovered a lump about 2-3cm in diameter in my lower back that hurts when I push on it and can be moved around. Only discovered it because I was in pain after sitting down and still am. The pain in my tailbone is still with me too. Not sure what is going on there but will see my doctor about it tonight.   I am trying to relax more now as I know I have been tensing all my chest for a long period. But everytime I relax my chest I get a really bad pressure especially in the solar plexus area. This is getting me down alot at the moment as I want to relax to get rid of all this. Is this to do with the muscles as I have been tense for so long?  I also get the feeling of something pushing on organs or tissue inside my chest. I guess this must be my mind tricking me or could this happen?  I went out with a friend over the weekend and we had a bottle of white wine to drink. Had a great night but feel rubbish after and its not a hangover. Since that night it feels like a more or less constant flutter in my throat when I breath. I have checked my pulse and it is normal 80. I also have a hard time eating and feel out of breath if I do eat something. I am scared I now have got irregular heart beat or something.  Thank you again for taking your time to explain and ease my mind.   Vanilth\n\n",

    "content": "Hey V,       I HAVE YOUR CURE MUST READ!!  I had a very similer problem.. im 24,  6'4  190      I am very athletic and in immaculate shape as told by doctors lol.. so I had this breathing problem and it started causeing these same EXACT chest pains you describe i went through all the ***** you did misdiagonisis ect... I mean 1 of the doctors took an x-ray of my chest and came back to me and told me i had pneomonia, which can easily be seen in an x-ray well the next time i had a panic attack was becaseu i thought i was dying from pneomonia lol so i rushed back to the ER they watned to x ray blah blah i told them check the old X-ray im not paying for ***** more.. This was a diffrent doctor and he looked at the old x-ray taken of me an told me my lungs looked beautiful ( Mind me i smoke Marijuana every day for about 4 years now) he said  there was no pneomonia so this really pissed me off becasue the other doctor blatently lied to me. don't TRUST Docs. except the one of this site he seems on point every time good job.    Ok so i have conquered my pains and breathing let me tell you as far as i know its ANXIETY 100% ok because after that 3nd visit when they finally diagnosed that it was Anxiety I have not had an attack since then maybe small eruptions but i come to terms with myself that its all in my head... it takes mental strengh, Im very strong mentally ok the reason I had my early relapses was becasue they had diagnosed me wrong and when your told you have pneomonia and you start reading about it and then Bernie Mack dies of pneomonia symptoms you start to get very scared an worried so I had my anxiety attack...  so I was able to understand that my conditions were caused by my erratic thoughts.. I bet you are a very very consi0ounce  thinker every little detail matters, as does every detail on your body and you begin to have fearful thoughts about all minor things like finding the small bump im sure its nothing but in your mind you might think tumor immediately and rampant thoughts of cancer death run through your mind these thoughts bring much fear and that's when you start feeling uncomfortable and the pain slowly creeps back and will intensify as long as you stay in that form of fear that something really bad is going on with your body, but if you can somehow releave yourself of the fear and be at peace with your diagnosis, that is the most important for anxiety you need to be in peace with that fact that you have anxiety and that all those odd pains are YES caused by (your mental state-thinking about bad things.. think happy think its nothing its only stress nothing is wrong with me i am strong my mental state may not be strong but that is the reason why my pains occur )..this is your cure when you have done this you will know that when you begin to feel some discomfort that it is simply all in your mind from maybe some form of stress if you can come to terms with yourself on this then your worrying an fear should go away and the result of that is no more attacks. Also its not only thoughts of cancer death blah blah  it can be thoughts of any high worrying occasions that cause stress like a deadline on a paper or worrying about your kids.. it can be as simple as did i lock the front door and you can become enthralled by many thoughts of what might happen if i didn't lock the door... well V, the names Dan......      good luck\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Vanith -  I don't know why I didn't get the notification of your follow up post,  but now that I have, I'm inclined to agree with bignasi13, at least about the likelihood that this is mostly anxiety-mediated. While the pain could still have been something minor but physical, what you've demonstrated in your most recent post is your being extremely tuned in to your body's behavior,which is classic for people with chronic anxiety. For instance, you felt that fluttering sensation in your throat (something that can happen sometimes, and can even be due to premature atrial heartbeats sometime, which, if it were that,  would still be inconsequential), but then you checked your pulse and it was 80 and regular, but you're still concerned about having an irregular heartbeat.   This is part of the price one pays for living with chronic anxiety, due to the fact that it is very difficult to be subjectively aware that's what's happening. It's very impressive that bignasi13 has been able to not only recognize but manage this on his own, but he also seems to possess a \"strong\" personality. It's really rather unusual for a person to be able to do what he's done. The support and  insights should be helpful to you (and are appreciated here),  but don't hold yourself to that standard, as you could try and have difficulty with it, and then blame yourself for being \"weak\",  and that is not the case. Most people  do have a great deal of difficulty in getting the upper hand of this without outside help. There is plenty to be had, too. Not only are there excellent medications if needed, but also cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and relaxation  techniques that can be learned, etc.   Hopefully this, along  with bignasi13's excellent advice and insights, will be of help to you. Just remember there are also dedicated resources.  Don't  hesitate to take advantage of them.    Best of luck to you, thanks for following up,  and my apologies for being so  long in getting back to you. I had no idea you'd posted again.\n\n",

The doctor said to have a scan to see if there was any damage as it was bruised and very sore to touch. There was no damage to the liver or i would of had to go to the hospital straight away. Anyway it went away for a while but 2 days ago it came back with revenge. The other thing i have been doing to make it sore is playing the wii that we got for Xmas, games like bowling, golf, archery i was just wondering if any of the game playing has done any damage to it and maybe bruised it even more. Should i stop for a while till it settles or what should i do.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  After  bruising (and maybe even cracking) a rib that way, the area, especially the cartilage between the ribs in that area is bound to be a little sensitive still, so playing with the Wii is one thing likely to aggravate what's probably costochondritis (an inflammation of that cartilage). This usually will respond to over-the-counter non-steroidal-anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofin (Advil) or Naproxyn (Aleve) if it bothers you enough. Of course the other possibility would be to let it rest, but if you can knock out the pain with one of the meds mentioned, it would be just as well to keep on playing with the Wii, as it's not only great fun but for some people it's actually a workout, which is a good thing.   If the pain doesn't respond  to rest or simple pain meds you might want to mention it to your doctor, but this really isn't unusual this soon after a rib injury such as you suffered.   Hope this helps. Good luck to you. Please follow up with  us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Alright, about a month (December 1st) I had a tooth swell up, so I made a dentist appointment and it turned out to be for Dec 10th. I didn't want to wait that long, so I went to a walk in clinic on December 8th and the Dr prescribed me Keflex 500mg twice a day. I took that until the 17th when I had a checkup appointment made with the dentist. At that time I told them I was having upset stomachs and slight stomach pain. They prescribed me Penicillin VK 500mg 4 times a day. On the 19th, I started to feel a little chest pressure. It wasn't accompanied with any pain, it just felt like someone was pressing down slightly. It occured on the center of my chest and then it moved over to my lower left breast. It would tingle a few times, but only for a few minutes and it rarely occured. My g/f had a real bad case of the flu a few days before xmas and it lasted until the weekend after. I started coughing real bad like her on Dec 26th. I went to another walk in clinic (I don't have a general doctor unfortunately) on December 29th and told them about the pressure and the coughing. They took my vitals and temperature and said they couldnt find anything abnormal, no swelling on my sides or anything of that nature and told me to just monitor it. After that I called the dentist that prescribed my the Penicillin and told them the same story. They called in a new prescription for Amoxicillin 500mg 4 times a day. A few hours after leaving the walk-in with my cough still bad I started to feel it was slightly difficult to breath in through my mouth. When I would cough to try and loosen up my chest it seemed as though it did nothing. It's basically come and gone for almost days now. I don't have any fevers, or trouble in my breathing rhythm, it just feels as if occasionally it requires a little more effort breathing in through my mouth. I'm not having any chest pain at all except for some soreness right below my chest occasionally when I cough.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  The pressure you describe doesn't sound cardiac in nature, but it does seem to follow your having taken certain antibiotics, so I'm wondering if it may be due to some mild asthma as part of an allergic reaction to one of the drugs you were prescribed, or if one or more of those have caused some GI distress that's being referred up into your left chest (many times bloating or pressure in the splenic flexure of the colon -- the corner it where it turns downward on your left side) can be referred up into your chest.  The cough also could be part of an  atypical asthma presentation or, if you've been exposed to influenza, you may have had a mild case of that (the antibiotics wouldn't have any effect on it) and have now wound up with a sequal of bronchitis.   I'd just have this sorted out with a visit to your regular doctor. Hope this helps. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "I\"m a 56 year old male in decent shape, maybe 10 pounds overweight.  I have had a very sharp pain on the right side of my chest that comes very quickly and leaves just as quickly.  It's about four inches below my nipple, and seems to be very close to the surface.  It's not below the ribs and seems to be between the ribs and the skin surface.  I've had it come and go several times over the past couple of years, usually months in between episodes.  Because it happens so seldom, I haven't been to my doctor.  But when it does happen it's very severe and sharp.  Had one today and it lasted for just a few seconds, but was very sharp, needle-like.  I also notice that there might be a little tenderness to the touch after an episode.  Any info or advice would be appreciated.  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  What you describe sounds very much  like costochondritis (Tietz's syndrome), an inflammation of the cartilege between the ribs, where they connect to the sternum. This can be a chronic, recurrent problem or due to a strain or physical trauma, or even due to a passing viral infection. In your case it sounds like a chronic, possibly anatomical anomaly. In any case it usually will respond well to over-the-counter anti-inflammatory drugs like  ibuprofin (Advil) or naprosyn (Aleve). It  is mainly an annoyance, although sometimes it can hamper upper body motion or even breathing due to the pain.   The OTC meds suggested are useful when the problem becomes contant for periods of time. Otherwise it is probably best left alone.   I hope this is helpful. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Pressure On Chest, slight tingling",
    "content": "Hi there -  This is a real problem, because anxiety could explain your new symptoms (they tend to change as soon as you think you've got it all figured out, which can be infuriating), and yet it's also true that anxious people get sick and have regular problems, just like everyone else, so it's tricky and one has to be careful to not blame everything on a known anxiety problem.  That being said, what you describe does sound like a classic, if \"new to you\" anxiety symptom. The sensation of slight (and poorly localized or else highly localized) chest discomfort, accompanied by a sense of the inability to draw a full,  satisfying breath, is commonly a sign of anxiety-related faulty breathing and/or breathing awareness, either of which can cause this  sensation. Stress, of course, not only exacerbates existing anxiety, but will help set off new symptoms.   This is not to say it's impossible you could have developed a breathing problem (such as asthma, most likely, although still unlikely). There are simple ways of telling: for instance, your doctor could test your ability to exhale (a simple pulomonary function test, PFT, using a simple  asthma guage into which you blow, moving the needle). If you have developed asthma, it should be managed with oral medication and an inhaler. If you don't have it then you'll have to come to terms with the probability that your anxiety is now affecting your awareness of your breathing, which can be very difficult to control, but can be done by the patient. Knowing is  the first step. If you don't have a pulmonary problem, then you'll have to learn to disregard the awareness of your breathing. Since most anxious people tend to be very somatically aware, it's hard, and just telling you to \"ignore\" it would be ridiculous, as trying to ignore something is almost impossible once you've taken it on as a task. Instead, what needs to be done is to find things to distract you from your body's behavior.  This is important,  because trust me, when it really wants your attention you won't be able to ignore it anyway. If you can be distracted from paying attention to your breathing that's a huge plus, but it usually requires some work on the part of the patient, in terms of talking to somone about the anxiety problem and,  eventually, other things. When one \"forgets\" one has a \"problem\" it mysteriously disappears.  A provocative test you can do for yourself would be to see how you tolerate exercise given this apparent difficulty breathing. If you tolerate exercise well, you almost certainly don't have a true respiratory problem. It most likely occurs only when you're sitting and thinking. If you are, instead, active and doing, you're likely to not notice anything wrong unless it is very concrete. Then you can  identify it more specifically and bring it to the attention of a healthcare provider.  I'd do both: rule out asthma, then see if you can find ways to move your attention from your body's behavior to more interesting and absorbing things.   I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you. Please keep us updated.\n\n",

I breath fine......except when I stop to think about it or just sit there. Once it is in my mind it \"mysteriously\" gets worse.  I just wasn't aware that anxiety could shift symptoms, as I still have nausea when I do get anxiety.  And you hit the nail on the head when you said it is hard to pinpoint where the pressure comes from...I can't.  It feels like it is sporadic, but not terribly bad if that makes sense.  Even typing here it is getting worse.  I have Klonopin and Promethazine...but my doc wanted to put me a an MAOI...I tried one before and the side effects are terrible.  Thank you again for your response.\n\n",

Suppressing it is the trick  now, since it is probably not a productive one (if it were, guaifenisen -- Mucinex -- might help).  There are a few over-the-counter cough remedies which contain a mild suppressant ( Dextromethorphan -- look for the \"DM\" suffix). Try one of these. It should resolve on its own or with this, and if it does, that's great. Also, take perhaps a couple Advil for the soreness from all the coughing. If the cough doesn't ease up and resolve in a day or two, see a physician, as it is possible to pick up fungal infections from hay, and this would  require prescription drugs to suppress the cough and to kill the infection as well. Hopefully the  irritants will  be moved out on their own in a day or two.  Please follow up with us as needed.)\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  It is probably not a reason for conern, but probably should be followed up on  a routine basis for a while to be certain it doesn't change. Most of these wind up being calcified old lesions from some lung damage due to infection or aspiration of something in the past. Sometimes they aren't even that, just some random  artifact.   It would be prudent of your doctor to repeat the chest x-ray at six months or a year, but if that shows no change then it can be safely disregarded.   Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "I have this some sort of pain on my right chest to the upper right of my nipple near my armpit but not on my armpit itself. It's around the area that forms an arch between the arm and the chest. I think its in the pectoral muscle area. This pain only occurs when my arm is stretched or when i press it firmly.  The pain also occurs when I rotate my arm and while I eat. The area above my right shoulder blade near my neck (near my back side) also has pain when i press on it firmly. It is not a severe kind of pain, but it feels weird and out of place. I've read a lot of articles and forums suggesting gallbladder disease, but this I am uncertain of. I am male, 19 years old, slightly overweight but nonetheless healthy. I don't smoke nor drink. I've been having this pain on and off for a while now. Please reply and help me out. I am a bit worried about this. Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  You can write off the gallbladder problem (at least as a cause of the pain you've written about here). This is too high up, and were it gallbladder-related, would not cause tenderness on pressure.   This sounds very much like a musculoskeletal problem. It could be an inflamed pectoral muscle, or possibly a tendon/ligament attached to the pec. The fact that pressure upon the muscle above your shoulder blade on the same side also suggests that either you are chronically doing something to irritate both areas (which do work in concert), or, as a remote possibility, this may  be caused by a condition known as thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS), although this would normally cause pain, tingling and even puffiness in the hand on that side. More likely it is a repetitive motion injury or infflammation due to an overuse or strain of the right shoulder girdle at some time in  the past.   This should respond to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, over-the-counter types, such as ibuprofin or naproxyn, taken according to directions on the package. If not, then you might need to see a doctor who can evaluate this for physical therapy or even possibly an intramuscular steroid injection to relieve the inflammation.  I hope this helps. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  Since you've had all the appropriate workups to rule out heart problems, and since this worsens when you lie down, I strongly suspect either gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or a hiatal hernia (they both have the same symptoms and respond to the same medications). Lying down will often aggravate either one. I am going to assume you tolerate exercise well, and that this doesn't aggravate the pain. (If I'm wrong, please let me know). This would just about nail down a diagnosis of esophageal problems, due either to GERD or hiatal hernia. These are usually easily treated with oral meds.  I hope this is helpful to you. Best of luck, and plase do follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Claire -  What you describe sounds most like a spasm or stricture of the esophagus. It could be something else, but since it is triggered by swallowing food it most sounds like an esophageal problem. Rarely, however, and especially in women, heart problems can present themselves in very atypical fashion, and while such a thing is extremely unlikely, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that this should re ruled out. It really seems most likely a spasm of the esophagus (a stricture shouln't show up so abruptly; spasm can start any time). Either esophageal problem could be treated with oral medication and possibly some dietary caution.   if it weren't for that \"band of pain.\" That's what makes me feel a heart problem, however unlikely, should be ruled out, and this should be easy to do. Then you might be prescribed something for what is very likely an esophageal problem.  I hope this is helpful to you. Please follow up here as necessary.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Tasting blood after strenuous exercise",
    "content": "Hello -  While the persistent soreness (may be lungs, may be chest wall irritation) is of some small concern, the taste of blood after having performed high intensity exercise is a complaint/report heard often. While it can be caused by any number of pathological problems (such as asthma, sinus problems, excessively dry air, etc.), it is most often caused by blood being forced through membraneous  tissue in  the lungs (the alveoli mainly) and even on up into the bronchial tree at times. This happens routinely when  pushing one's self to the threshold of an anaerobic state (past the point where the cardiopulmonary apparatus benefit). How quickly this can  happen depends upon the baseline fitness level and general health of the person in question, but it is a very common thing and one hears it every so often in cardiac rehab groups, from the overzealous recoverers. If there is no actual blood produced by coughing it can be considered normal and perhaps a signal from the body to push not quite so hard at the limits.  If the soreness persists into the next day, this is another matter,and ought to be looked into by a healthcare professional, to be certain there's no chronic problem (again, such as asthma), although when one has pushed one's self to the limit, the accessory muscles to start  to come into use (as in an asthma attack) and  this  can cause some lingering soreness and tenderness that can easily be mistaken for \"lung\" pain.   I hope this helps answer your concerns. Please follow up with us as necessary.\n\n",

    "title": "Does this sound like heartburn?",
    "content": "I am a 24 year old female, who is about 70 lbs overweight, but otherwise healthy.  For the past three days, I have been experiencing pain on my left side, right under my left breast. Here's how it started: I was lying in bed Tuesday morning, playing around on my laptop computer, lying on my left side. I felt the sharp stabbing pain down the left side of my sternum, so I rolled over to my back and attempted to stretch those muscles by rolling my shoulders back...that didn't help so I decided to get up and move around by taking a shower. The pain was pretty constant for about 10-15 minutes, and seemed to be getting worse everytime I bent over (this could have been my imagination since I get panicky when I have chest pains). I ended up having what I believe was a panic attack in the shower, but after I calmed down the pain went away.  So all day Tuesday and Wednesday, the sharp stabbing pains have been coming and going. Some times they are a little lower than my left breast, but they are all localized. When the pain isn't occurring, the area feels a little discomfort, almost like soreness. Yesterday morning, I also had some nausea let started when I woke up, and latest until about lunch time, along with the pain. Also had diarrhea the past three days...not bad, just everytime I have a bowel movement (1-2 times each day). So far this morning, I haven't had a problem.   I went to the doctor yesterday, and she feels my pain is from heartburn. I have never experienced any burning sensations, so I feel a little doubtful about this diagnosis. She also thinks I have asthma, and the heartburn is aggravating it. Again, I think this is wrong since I've never had trouble breathing, and asthma doesn't run in my family. She said it was either asthma or early stages of bronchitis. I was given an inhaler, allergy meds, antibiotic, and Prilosec OTC...I am finicky about taking meds, so I really don't want to take them if I have been misdiagnosed.  I kinda feel the pain is due to my inactivity, or because I slouch when I sit. The sharp pains are similar to those I feel after I've been sitting in front of the computer too long, since I do not sit up straight. Usually, once I stretch the muscles, the pain goes away. Stretching doesn't seem to be helping this pain though. I haven't lifted anything heavy recently, and it's not tender to touch the area where the pain is localized.  I am just looking for a second opinion here, as my insurance doesn't cover many local doctors so I can't really afford to go to another. Oh, and I do suffer from palpitations. I have had several tests run on my heart....2 EKG's, an echo cardiogram, 24-hour heart monitor, and a stress test (walking on a treadmill) all determine my heart is fine...All these tests were run at the end of 2007/beginning of 2008. The conclusion there was they occur with fatigue, because I feel them more when I am tired.\n\n",

I would definitely follow her orders and go back in a few weeks if it is not improving.   Sometimes diagnoses must be made by trial and error.  We make an educated guess based on labs, symptoms, and exam, then go ahead with a course of  treatment.  If we rule out one problem, we go on to another.  We're just not yet precise enough with non-invasive diagnostic procedures to always know exactly what is going on.  If the treatment helps, this confirms the diagnosis.  If not, we go back to the drawing board with more information now available.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  Pain that can be duplicated my motion is never heart-related, so you can relax a little about that. Also, most serious organic problems have been  ruled out. What's left as possiblities are things like chronic muscle spasm or possibly a nerve compression (perhaps somewhere along the lumbar spine) that's causing both local and referred muscular pain. While it's not urgent/life-threatening, it's obviously something you don't need to have going on, so once your insurance has fire up, I'd strongly recommend getting a referral to an orthopedist, who may be able to locate the problem and help you to manage it and maybe even come up with  a plan  to make it go away. This could range from physical therapy to pain meds to surgery, depending on the nature and location of the  problem,  but it very much sounds like  it is muscular, possibly resulting from an orthopedic problem you may have had for a long time. This sounds very fixable, assuming the focus is on the likely cause instead of organ systems.  I hope this is helpful to you. Best of luck to you, and please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  The fact that your chest pain can be reproduced by breathing and by lifting heavy objects, it is almost certainly musculoskeletal in origin. There are both muscles and membraneous lining inside the chest wall, and these can be irritated and/or strained by heavy lifting. There is also the possibility of inflamed cartilage between ribs causing this, but because it seems more visceral (as you said, \"inside\") it is probably pleuritic or chest wall pain. Have you tried anything such as ibuprofin to relieve this? If not, give that a try, as directed, for a few days, as this can sometimes resolve the inflammation. While it is almost certainly nothing serious, it is obviously bothersome, so if it continues beyond a few days on ibuprofin (Advil) or naproxyn (Aleve), arrange to see your doctor, as it may require something stronger to resolve the inflammation.  I hope this is helpful to you. Best of luck.\n\n",

If it doesn't improve in a day or two, or if it gets worse before then, by all means see a doctor urgently, explain what happened, and you'll probably be given medication to clear this up.

    "title": "Re: Blood in Phelgm",
    "content": "Hello -  First there was that prior infection, which you referred to as \"upper\" (and so I assume was in your nose and/or sinuses), and now what sounds very much like a chronic sinus infection. The blood in your sputum seems to be coming from post-nasal drip (PND) which occurs most often at night, while asleep, and carries with it any colorful mucus, blood, and of course, bacteria, down into the pharynx and even the bronchial tree. In the morning, especially, one can wind up coughing up some pretty colorful stuff, which seems to have \"grown\" in the throat of chest. Eventually it may sometimes take root there, too, but usually it is from one or more infected sinuses. The fact that you're able to bring up blood-tinged sputum by \"snorting\" strongly suggests this is what's happening. While one doesn't generally welcome the sight of blood anwhere outside the body, the sinuses are lined with a great many superficial capilaries, which will break when chronically irritated, infected, or even just subjected to dry air.   With or without a sinus infection,dry air can cause a sore throat, bloody mucus, and all the other things you've described. If you already have a history of a severe upper respiratory infection (as you do) then this is probably more of the same, or at least what led to it.   An over-the-counter medication, guaifenesin (marketed also in slow release form under the brand name Mucinex) can help with this, as can proper humidification of the room where you sleep. If things don't improve shortly you may have a new infection and so would need an antibiotic to get rid of it.   I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you. Please keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  The tenderness makes this sound like you may have an inflammation of the connective tissue between your ribs in the affected area. The \"itching\" sensation and  the cough are more difficult to pin down, and if they are  actually related to the sore spot, it's difficult to guess, at a distance, why that may be. The most likely thing seems to be inflamed cartilage between the ribs (a very common problem), although this rarely causes coughing, but that part may be sheer coincidence.  Best bet, if this causes you significant discomfort, is to make an appointment with your doctor, but I have a strong suspicion this is something that will resolve on its own, perhaps with the help of an over-the-counter anti-inflammatory pain medication like ibuprofin.  I hope this is helpful. Please follow up with  us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "3 mths after having my 3rd baby I noticed a dull pain on the lower part of my sternum I rubbed the area and realized their is a rock hard..sore.. non movable 2 in x 2 inch (approx) protruding lump on my lower sternum. This also causes light-moderate-bad pain and a tingling type (weird) sensation all the way thru to my back as if something is \"growing\" in there and pushing on other organs and my back. In the exact same spot where the lump is protruding on my front sternum (chest) my back in this area kills me. i have to try and use muscle cream to help tolerate it sometimes and if i carry my baby or bend over for a small period ect the pain in my back in that area gets worse. I showed my doc and she said she was concerned about this and sent me to the hospital for blood work and a CT Scan and then tells me they \"think\" my baby kicked a bone out of place and i may have to live with this the rest of my life. I have continue to struggle with this issue and pain and called the hospital today to see if someone else could re-read the CT Scan and i told them my doc had said it was a bone my baby had kicked out of place. They looked at my file and said...\"it was no where in the report that baby had kicked bone out of place\" and they said to go to my doc and request a copy of the report as i had been told wrong yet they are not allowed to tell me what the report actually \"does\" say. I need a Doc tp PLEASE answer this for me and let me know if I should be concerned about this issue and look for another doc/ 2nd opinion or should i just try and deal with the pain/uncomfortablness from it? I geuss i am getting even more concerned now cuz i am now (6mths after the CT Scan on chest) having severe frequent headaches and weird lumps now popping up on the back of my head. I am only 32 but my body is known for growing things and my doc just does not seem to be paying much attention to this. Several yrs back I had a exployitory surgery and beneign growth removed inside me (was back towards my back) and I also had 5 colon poyps removed when i was in my 20's and have had some other medical issues as well. I am stuck without insurance coverage right now and worry they just don't want to deal with me because of this.   I don't know what to do ...i just know i hurt, i'm uncomfortable...and i am sick of not being able to stand and hold my baby long without hurting even worse.Docs Please help~??~!!~\n\n",

Request the flims  of the CT scan to bring to the second doctor, also, so that they can be read in front of you and get this clarified. It's pretty unusual for a fetus to knock loose the xyphoid process (which is what you seem to be describing), although I suppose it (or something like it ) is possible during a pregnancy. There does seem to be something else going on, though, and of course, not having seen the films nor you in person, it is difficult to be certain what this may be.   Absolutely, a second opinion is in order, if that's what it takes to learn, if only to ease your mind,  just what's going on.   Good  luck to you with this. Please let us know how things go.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: can't fill my lungs",
    "content": "Hello -  This symptom is possibly due to asthma, but may also be caused by an unusual awareness of one's breathing due to anxiety. While asthma certainly should be ruled out, there is often noticeable tightness and sometimes soreness of the chest, as well as a clear-cut difficulty in expelling air more than inhaling.   Anxiety-related breathing awareness is often more subtle and more difficult to recognize. It often results in hyperventilation, and this  is triggered often by sighing while sitting still.  This upsets the CO2 content of the air in the lungs, making the brain  \"feel\" it doesn't need additional air, with the net result of a sensation that one can't draw a deep, satisfying breath. This can become a very uncomfortable cycle and can produce odd symptoms  such as dizziness, numbness around the mouth and in the hands, all of which produces more anxiety.  Asthma certainly is possible, but the more likely explanation is your acute awareness of your breathing. If there is any significant stress in your life or any anxiety (which may not have an obvious cause) this could also account for the  problem. If asthma is ruled out, the latter is most likely the  cause. Your doctor should be able to help with managing  either problem, but it needs to be clarified first as to which is causing the symptoms.  I hope this is helpful  to you. Good luck. Please stay in touch.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: chest/back pain with headache",
    "content": "Hello -  Based on your description of your pain and the fact that it is tender to the touch makes this seem most likely an inflammatory problem involving the connective tissue between your ribs. While unusual to occur fore and aft simultaneously, you do also have asthma, and so may have overused your accessory muscles (which are also located between your ribs as well as at the bast of your neck on either side) and this can, at times, cause a sense of pressure or tightness as well as the sort of pain and discomfort you describe. Were it not for the tenderness to touch I'd be  concerned that it might be instead an  inflammation of the pericardial sac in which the heart resides, or possibly pleurisy (and inflammation of the lining surrounding the lungs). While these are not usually very serious, they can also cause these sorts of symptoms, but not tenderness to touch from the  outside.  All three are treated the same way, as a rule, which is with non-steroidal anti-inflammatories such as ibuprofin or naproxyn (Advil or Aleve).   The migraine would seem to be unrelated and an unfortunate coincidence just adding to your current discomfort.  If the chest pain and tenderness doesn't respond to simple medication, you should then make an appointment with your doctor to see if something stronger is required.   I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: stiff back and chest every waking up morning",
    "content": "Hello -  \"Morning stiffness\" is usually a descriptor for one of the symptoms of arthritis. However, your pain sounds more like the result of simply sleeping in an awkward position. While there is little that can be done to prevent this, since we all move around a good deal while asleep, it could be something as simple as a too-pliant mattress. If your mattress is of good quality then you're probably sleeping in an odd position during the night and wake up with strains to your back muscles and the cartiiage between your left front ribs, which would suggest a twisting at the waist during the night. Sometimes this \"feels right\" to your body so it doesn't cause you to wake, but in the morning, after a period in the odd position,  everything is stretched and stiffened.   So long as the problem resolves early in the day, there's really not much that needs to be done. If it persists long enough to cause problems, you could try taking a couple ibuprofin either at bedtime or, probably better, first thing in the morning (after eating). It would work to take it at night (probably preventing the morning stiffness), but there is a potential for it to cause esophageal reflux or at least stomach upset when taken just before sleeping,  so the next best time would be first thing after eating in the morning.  I hope this is helpful to you. I imagine eventually this nocturnal twisting will stop, but for the time being taking something to eliminate the stiffness and soreness is probably the simplest solution.  Best of luck to you. Please follow up here as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: CHRONIC CHEST CONGESTION X 1.5 YEARS",
    "content": "Hi Cheryl -  Two things come to mind right away given your history and excellent description of the symptoms. First is the mold allergy, which often is a hidden problem. If you're highly allergic to certain molds and they happen to be hiding somewhere in your environment, you'll almost certainly have repeated respiratory infections. So that's one possibility -- one that could require a good deal of detective work to rule in or out.  The other thing that comes to mind is that I notice you carry a diagnosis of GERD. This, sometimes, can contribute to respiratory problems -- usually asthma, but sometimes chronic lower respiratory infections as well. This is because when horizontal (as when  asleep) GERD can result in stomach contents being aspirated.   Combine these two, which may be the case, and you'd have seeminly never-ending nasal and chest congestion, one feeding on the other.   One factor that  argues mold may be a factor is that you've been treated with some powerful antibiotics yet the problem seems to come right back. What I find just a little odd is the prescribing of steroids (not wrong in itself, but usually contraindicated when an infection is suspected). This is because steroids tend to reduce inflammation  and so mask infections, making them appear to be improved, when they're actually still there. In conjunction with or alternating with antibiotics can prove frustrating and sometimes will make things worse. If infection was ruled out, steroids then would be appropriate.   I really think the GERD and mold allergy aspects need further investigation. Since you've had sinus surgery that should have resolved any lingering problems with drainage -- although once in a great while the scarring the  results can actually cause the  problems to return, so a CT of the sinuses would also be in order, so as to not miss any possible cause. If they won't order a CT of the lungs maybe a CT of the sinuses would fly. There has to be a chain of evidence to  support a diagnosis and find the cause so this can be resolved.   Best of luck to you. Please stay in touch and follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Dirk,   While what you describe could have a physical cause (and that needs to be explored and ruled out), it certainly sounds an awful lot like hyperventilation syndrome, which usually occurs in conjunction with acute anxiety. It can also, however, be triggered by new onset asthma, since the constriction in the bronchi can cause the victim to overbreathe and wind up with the unexpected result of hyperventilation. The  latter can also sometimes trigger asthma or wheezing due to drying of the airway.   Although this is what springs to mind first, it is important to be certain all  physical causes have been ruled out (asthma included). About the only other potentially serious causes would probably be neurologic in nature. Following up your ER visit with a thorough workup by an internist would be a great first step. While I strongly suspect hyperventilation syndrome, there still could be an underlying cause, and since cardiac causes are now off the table, that makes the process of elimination a lot easier.   Please follow up with us here as needed. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  That bout of salmonella is paying off now, because it caused you to describe stomach acid very well. That,  combined with severe epigastric pain (the area just below your chest), and a few other things you mentioned, strongly suggests either gastritis or an actual gastric ulcer. This can be caused by simple  overproduction of stomach acid or it can be secondary to a bacterial infection. Being tested for h. pylori bacteria can help guide the treatment of the problem, since if  the bacteria is  present an antibiotic is needed as well as something to help inhibit the production of stomach acid. Meanwhile, avoid foods that obviously aggravate the problem, especially whole milk. While this latter may seem counterintuitive, whole milk stimulates production of stomach acid, so often makes the problem  worse. Skim  milk is fine, and may actually be helpful.  At any rate, you've gotten to the point where the symptoms are  pretty well intolerable,  so please see your doctor as soon as possible and maybe even get a referral to a gastroenterologist.   I hope this is helpful to you. Best of luck, and please follow up with us here.\n\n",

    "title": "Chest and back pain for 3 months",
    "content": "Hi, my name is Erick Im 19yrs old about three months ago I was driving home from the airport after picking up my grandmother when I suddenly felt a sharp pain in my middle upper back. I paid no attention to it until I got home, the pain ached both sides of my back and when I put my shoulders down It made itself present in my chest. The pain feels like my chest and back are ripping specially when Iput my shoulders down. I got very anxious when I started to think about the pain, the fallowing morning I woke up to palpitations and shortness of breath. I had no idea what it was so I didn't go to the doctor to get checked I just thought it would go away on its own. Even though the pain didn't get any worse I had other symptoms that were hunting me, head aches, aching eyes, weakness in my knees, anxiety and disassociation. After having the problem for two months I went to my doctor and the ER fearing that It was a heart attack. Both doctors gave me EKG's, X-rays, and blood work everything came out fine. The ER doctor prescribed naproxen 375mg which did nothing to ease my pain. I have no idea of what this pain could be or what's causing me to get all the other symptoms the only thing I can think of is stress I took care of my aunt for five years until she passed away from cancer, the entire process was very stressful since at the same time I had school and responsabilities of my own. Although I have experienced stress before, I never had these symptoms. Can stress cause all these problems? Its been three months now and im not any better, i don't get rest in my sleep and im always tired. Im hoping that its stress and not a major problem, should I worry about the pain?  Thank you,     Erick Ramirez\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Erick -  The pain does sound as though it's musculoskeletal in nature, and it's especially good to know any cardiac involvement has been ruled out. Because of your description of the character of the pain and how it shifts to the chest when you drop your shoulders, I suspect this  may be due to prolonged tension (perhaps related to maintaining certain faulty postures such as being bent at the waist with the upper body curved forward, as in leaning over a patient for long periods of time often can cause in healthcare workers and other caregivers).   Stress can also lead to physical tension and can cause these things to happen. The fact that you woke up with palpitations and a sense of shortness of breath suggests anxiety or stress as well.  The stress you experienced recently due to the illness and passing of your aunt  was both prolonged and possibly quite intense at times, and often the physical symptoms of stress don't manifest themselves until the pressure is off.   If naproxyn wasn't effective you might need to see an orthopedist, and you may wind up finding that muscle relaxants combined with naproxyn may be more helpful.  This could be a slow process of elimination and, as usual, I'm happy to know the more serious things have been ruled out. With that  done, you can relax some, and know that nothing life-threatening is going on, and work on finding the underlying cause of the pain so that can be resolved.   I hope this is helpful to you. Best  of luck, and please  follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Sporadic Chest pain at right side.",
    "content": "Hi Hari -  Given your description of the pain and how it is aggravated by deep breaths, it is likely to be pleurisy, an inflammation of the membrane that encompasses  the lungs. This can cause rather severe pain, especially with deep breaths, and the pain is usually felt on one side of the chest as you describe. It can happen due to respiratory infections or it can sometimes happen for no apparent reason. It usually responds very well to non-steroidal anti-inflammatories such as ibuprofin or naproxyn. If you try one of these and it successfully relieves the pain, you can assume this is what's going on, and the medication may actually help resolve the pain, although it is sometimes a chronic problem.   Good luck to you with this. Please let us know how things go.\n\n",

He called in a general surgeon who wasn't sure why this had happened. He did ask if I had emphysema and I do not, at least not that I know of. He pushed the lung back down so they could continue with the procedure. The next day my doctor did x-rays of my lungs and everything looked fine. My breathing is good. He did suggest however that I get this looked at as soon as I can. He told me to tell my doctor (primary) that my liver enzymes were a bit high also. I want to know if you have ever heard of this before and if I should be worried. I do have sleep apnea and am wondering if this might be the problem. Thanks for helping!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  While  I've never heard of this before and it's even hard to visualize in my mind, it's obviously possible, and probably has something to do with unequal pressures in the pleura. I would think it probably happened during the procedure, perhaps because of it, but I'd definitely have it looked into anyway. It seems everything is back where it ought to be, so that's good news.   Sleep apnea may well be at the bottom of this, since it can cause unequal pressures, unnatural pulling, etc., and that theory makes the most sense, given I have, again, never heard of this happening, at least without physical trauma as the cause.   Please stay in touch and update us if you learn anything new. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  Your concern is certainly not unreasonable, and by writing here you're taking a big step toward getting past the avoidance part which is so common (especially in the healthcare profession, oddly enough).  Your linking the pain with stress is telling, one way or another. Either the underlying physical cause is aggravated by stress or, given recent events in your life, it may be that you're experiencing somatic transference symptoms -- just as real, if not necessarily life-threatening, and often more diffcult to deal with.  While I would never jump to the latter (somatic transference) conclusion, it is something that should be considered as part of the differential diagnosis. It is extremely common.   For potential physical causes, very brief, left-sided chest pain, especially when sometimes followed by evidence of gas (eructation or bloating), is rarely cardiac-related, and this should be the first and simplest thing to rule out (via resting EKG at least). Other potential causes of this pain, given its fleeting nature, are (as already noted) gas, which even if its origin is the  splanchnic flexure of the colon, can be cause pain to be radiated to the left upper chest or even the shoulder or arm. (This is equally true of gas trapped in the hepatic flexure, but that happensless often). If there is any way to duplicate the pain by manual pressure/palpation, then you may well have some inflammation of the cartilege between the ribs on that side (Tietz's syndrome). This can be managed with OTC NSAIDs.   All of that is speculation, and a very basic physical should help determine the cause,  if there is a physical one.  If that turns out negative, which I suspect it will (and please do have one, because otherwise you'll carry the worry around with you indefinitely, and there's just no point in that), then somatic transference, related to the recent tragedy in your life, would be a major consideration.   In any event, there is the matter of the half-pack of cigarettes per day. That's all I'm going  to say about that. You know what you need to do where that's concerned, so I hope you'll  do it. I hope you'll also get yourself checked up, more for your own peace of mind than anything else, as what you describe honestly sounds most like stress-related somatic transference, but we don't go there first, but rule out physical causes first.   I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you. Please  follow up here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "I went to the ER a couple of weeks ago for heart palpitations.  My EKG showed PACs and the dr there said my lab work was fine.  I followed up w/my cardiologist and he said that my D-dimer was high, so he wanted to do an ultrasound to rule out a leg clot.   He has already done an echo of my heart and said it was ok, just very mild tricuspid regurgitation and mild left atrial enlargement, but nothing to worry about.  My question is that I was on my period when the blood was drawn, so could it be elevated from menstrual clots???  Also, if I had a clot in my leg or lung, would it cause left atrial enlargement or regurgitation?  I am going next week for the u/s.  Thanks!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: D-dimer and menstruation",
    "content": "Hello -  The theory you propose concerning elevated D-dimer during one's period is a controversial one at best. The official word on this (so far) is that since menstrual clots are extravascular, they wouldn't influence a D-dimer result. This is from Chan, Johnson, Panju and Bradley in the Journal of the American Journal of Hematology. While the theory makes sense on its face (and may actually be found, someday, to be correct), the belief now is that being on one's period won't affect a D-dimer test.   This leaves the question of what led the attending physician to include this test in your workup for palpitations (the result of PACs). It was an odd choice unless this was a very thorough and involved doctor who realized that on rare occasions pulmonary problems (such as a DVT gone to the lung) can cause atrial arrhythmias. Then again, with no other symptoms to suggest this (and the D-dimer is good for this because it can tell if there may have been a clot anywhere in the body over the previous week or two, not necessarily confined to the leg), it remains an unusual choice. It  also was elevated, which is odd as well.  A DVT would not cause left atrial enlargement, although a  long-indwelling DVT which had  moved to the lung might cause this as well  as tricuspid regurgitation, although, again, without any symptoms to suggest any of this, it is all very strange. Generally a DVT will cause typical leg symptoms, and even in cases where it does not, if it were to escape and lodge in a lung the chances of that going unnoticed are almost nil.   None of this precludes the possibility, but PACs and mild regurge of various heart valves are so common a finding, I'm just rather surprised that the ER doctor you saw may have discovered something important which apparently caused no other symptoms (at least none that you've mentioned).   If there were a DVT still present in your leg, on the other hand, it would not yet have gone to your lung, so would not be responsible for the PACs and tricuspid regurge anyway, even remotely.   Because of all this pondering I'm thinking your doppler exam  will come out negative, but either way I'll be very interested in the finding. It's possible, although unlikely, something potentially worrisome was accidentally found because of your ER visit.  If so, my congratulations to the doctor. Your cardiologist is absolutely correct to follow this up. I hope it all turns out to be a big nothing, but if there's something there, you certainly  would want to know. Then  the underlying cause could be discovered and medically managed.   Please do follow up with us on this. Again,  hopefully it is nothing.  Statistically it seems like a long shot. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

Now i am awaiting a chest xray which I havent got an appointment yet.

    "content": "Hi charlene -  Your symptoms could be caused by a lot of different things, and some of them are pretty benign,  while others could be more serious. What you really need right now is a good, comprehensive physical and to rule out a return of asthma (I see you note you had asthma 10 years ago), GERD (I also note you take medication for this) and especially heart problems. While  you did have an EKG and it was apparently normal, a resting EKG isn't always sufficient to disclose heart disease, and women tend to present with more atypical symptoms are are sometimes more difficult to diagnose, especially younger women (I don't know your age, but women of any age can have heart problems just as surely as men can, although they usually develop it after menopause, not always). The fact that you describe chest \"pressure\" instead of pain, the headaches, the nosebleed and the \"dead\" arm all argue for a more complete cardiological workup, even though there are plenty of other potential causes for all of this. We're best off ruling out the most serious things first, then working down toward the very innocent, annoying stuff.  Again,  you could be experiencing chest pressure or tightness due to asthma, the nosebleed and headaches could be related to each other but not the chest discomfort, and the arm sensation could be some third, unrelated issue. The only what to be certain is to see a thorough internist and have all this sorted out. I think it's definitely worth the trouble.   I hope this is helpful to you.

    "title": "Re: can't take full breaths",
    "content": "Hello -  While you have had a recent respiratory infection (bronchitis) and may even have asthma, it seems far more likely you are experiencing perceived, rather than  actual, shortness of breath. The reason I say this is that you tolerate exercise with no problem, but only seem to have a problem drawing a full, satisfying breath when you are at rest. If it were a pulmonary problem it would worsen at night (these problems almost always worsen when the patient is horizontal) and if it were anything else it would definitely worsen with exertion.  The second part of my thinking on this is that while you acknowlege having some problems with anxiety, you find this breathing problem happens when \"i'm home relaxing.\" Unfortunately, this is a very common (and extremely confusing) phenomenon in anxious people: they feel anxiety symptoms when they believe they are actually in their most relaxed state. What often happens is that anxious people sigh a lot, something of which they are utterly unaware. When one does this chronically (usually most often when \"relaxing\") it throws off excessive amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2). Since CO2 is the very thing that tells the brain it  should want more air (breathing is voluntary but the urge to breathe is not),  if it doesn't get enough of it (due to it being blown off due to sighing or other faulty breathing patterns) it doesn't \"think\" it needs for you to be breathing so much. The result is that you, being awake, know you should be breathing, but your brain doesn't think so, and the result is you feel as though you're not getting adequate air in, because your brain is actually resisting the reflex to breathe.  This feels wrong, so you try harder to breathe, believing you should be (and it's true, breathing really is important -- but when we become unwittingly aware of our breathing it throws the whole process into confusion).   This is a long way of saying your sense of shortness of breath is probably an illusion created by an anxious personality. Learning to be fully aware of this and trying to manage it consciously, sometimes can make things get back  to normal. When this happens, try breathing slowly, through your nose. Try to consciously resist the urge to sigh when you're physically at rest and relaxing. You may be surprised at how the feeling of oppressiveness disappears.  At  least that's the idea.   I hope this is helpful to you, and if not, please don't hesitate to follow up with us here. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Chest pain, left side.",
    "content": "Hi Allie -  While left-sided chest pain isn't usually cardiac-related, yours seems to be aggravated by exertion,  so we need to look further than usual. First, a good way to try and eliminate heart problems from the picture would be to ask if any movements of your upper body (while standing still) cause this pain to happen or to worsen (such as twisiting, reaching, raising your arms, etc.) and if there is a distinct focus to the pain, a place you can point to or cover with one hand. If so, does manual pressure on the area elicit any tenderness or soreness? Finally, does taking a deep  breath aggravate this pain? These things would almost definitely eliminate cardiac causes.   If the above questions don''t eliminate heart involvement, while it's still unlikely given your age, gender, etc., it still would need to be ruled out, probably via an EKG and maybe an echocardiogram. While you are awfully young to have any significant coronary artery disease, some young adults can have other, structural problems,some of them quite benign and others that require medical management.   Please let me know how you would answer the questions above, about being able  to provoke the pain by movement, breathing,etc. We can then go forward from there.   I look forward to hearing from  you.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 37yr old female. I have a burning pain between my shoulder blades that started after i stopped snorting oxycodone. I was snorting hundreds of pills a month  about 200 mill. aday of several differant kinds 10's 20's even 5 mill. oxycodone and oxycontins also taking methadone too. I did this for about 2yrs. i stopped in Dec.07 with the help of suboxone (i snorted that too) after coming off the suboxone i got shingles on my back, the pain was there about a month before the shingles. Ever sence then I wake up every morning feeling sick like the flu feeling it last about half hour, almost like withdrawls, i also have night sweats too. The Dr. says its post shingles pain, but what about the night sweats and sick feeling in the morning? Im afraid i damaged my lungs. I had a negative chest xray in Oct.07. All blood work is normal. This pain is very bad and its almost everyday. I did try Lyrica but it didnt help. Can this have caused lung damage? Im to embaressed to tell the Dr. about my past drug use to ask if it could be my lungs. I am a smoker also.\n\n",

    "content": "My fiance is 29 and healthy as a horse on most occasions has had some unusual pains. It started in the back, then sholders, then to his neck.  We thought it was pulled muscles from over doing it buidling our new house.  This has been going strong for 4 months.  It's as if he has a worm that goes from place to place in his body making him hurt in different places.  He went to the chiropractor once a week thinking this would solve his problems.  He then began noticing bruisng on his chest.  Not a typical bruise.  It went from the middle of his chest along to his side.  he then went to another doctor.  They gave him antiinflamatories and muscle relaxers.  After this did not help he went to another doctor where they did chest x-rays and gave him what I call a Z-pac.  The chest x-rays showed fluid around his left lung.  After the Z-pac did not help, he was sent to a specialist where they did a CT test.  Test came back with an unusual thymus.  The doctor said it was not normal and was very enlarged.  He is scheduled for a breathing treatment next week, a EKG and more blood work.  He returns to the doctor two weeks from now. The doctor stated he was going to get a second opinion on it too.  Which always scares me when a doctor needs a second opinion.  What causes an enlarged thymus?  What are the options?  Should I be worried?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Kimmerann, The thymus is one of the lymphatic organs in the body which is typically the largest from birth to approximately the age of two. At this point generally speaking it begins regressing in size. This structure is important in immunity and responsible for the T lymphocytes. If an enlarged thymus was noted on a CT scan, you were told correctly in this being an abnormal finding. One of the important findings would be exactly how large, taking into consideration his age etc. Some conditions that may cause enlargement (and I am certainly not implying that this is the cause in his case but used as examples) are thymic tumor, Myasthenia Gravis, and in some cases chest pain is caused when lymphoma involves the thymus gland. Do not jump to conclusions until you have a definitive diagnosis and I am glad to hear there are more diagnostic studies underway. Keep in mind that it's okay for one professional to seek the opinion of another to be certain of a diagnosis. If your time permits an update would be appreciated. Best wishes.

    "content": "Hi Kimmerann, An orange to softball size is rather large. Treatment, surgical or otherwise, will actually depend on the findings of the biopsy. If recommendation for removal of the thymus gland is suggested there are a couple of ways this can be accomplished. The least invasive one being an incision is made above the sternum or breastbone essentially at the base of the neck. The procedure may take approximately two to three hours to complete with an approximately two-twelve week recovery time depending on the procedure, complications, and general recovery. I hope this helps. Best wishes and please keep us posted. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "title": "Re: chest pains on right side",
    "content": "Hi there -  What you describe sounds very much like costochondritis or Tietz'  syndrome, which is an inflammation of the cartilage between the ribs and which connect them to the sternum (breastbone). A good way to tell if this is what's going on is to try twisting and bending your upper body or reaching up with your right  arm. If this aggravates the pain, or if you can elicit pain or tenderness by pressing on the spot then it is almost certainly Tietz', which is best treated witn non-steroidal analgesics like  Advil  (ibuprofin) or Aleve (naproxyn).   Sharp and highly localized pain, just FYI, is almost never heart-related. If you can  reproduce it by movement or pressure as described above, it is never heart-related.    It's still pain, though, so try the diagnostic method I suggested above, and if that confirms Tietz' syndrome then try one of the over-the-counter meds mentioned above, as directed on the label.  If that  doesn't help then  you'll need to see a doctor, who can prescribe something more effective.  I hope this is helpful. Please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

Last year I had an echo and ekg and everything came back fine. The chest pains im experiencing began on Saturday 2/9/2008. The weird sensation lasts all day I would say. I do smoke (did I quit tonight) so by the time night time rolls around if i put any pressure over the heart, there's pain.  I really don't want to go spending thousands at the ER in case this is a false alarm. I also should say I probably have an anxeity problem and my father just passed on on 1/31. I'm 29 years old 5'4 159 lbs male.   When I breathe in or out the pain isn't effected. When i press on the sternum there is a slight pain. When I am not pressing on anything rightnow there's no pain just discomfort. Collar bone area no pain. Below breast if i press there is pain.    I've experienced no weird sensations in my arm or anything and the only time there's shortness of breath is when I became extremely anxious which honestly I am not rightnow. I wish I cold be more detailed hmm..\n\n",

    "content": "I have been ignoring it for so long now,I don't think I can handle it any more. A while back around 15 or so (I'm 26 now) I had lots of problems physically. So my rents took me to the doctors. I went to 3 different hospitals and took countless test (very painful) and all of them would say something different. Finally a (can't spell) gasterologist said he wants to run more test but is pretty sure I have chroans disease and he see's detiriation in my hip bones. (like I said can't spell) Since then, every year it seems like I get worse. I crack and pop my bones all the time. I can't help it because it hurts if I don't. I can crack my back and neck every time. Every time I step my knees pop. If I look a certain way my neck pops and I get splitting head aches. My wrist, my inner thighs...pretty much I'm a walking rice crispy. Well, I have learned to deal with these pains over the years until now. In 2006 I started getting chest pains. Thinking it was just an injury I let it go. Now it's almost 2009 and my chest is worse. I can pop it too. When I pop my body it feels good, but when I pop my chest it is so painful. The pain comes and goes and is so uncomfortable, sometimes paralyzing. Today is probably the worst I have felt and I am actually thinking about going to the emergency room.    I am so scared to go to the doctors because being 15 and doing all those test somehow tramatized me and I never want to go through that again. I feel it is getting down to the point where I have no choice. I am in a lot of pain and I have to work tomorrow. (physical labor) I don't think I can do it. I woke up today and my upper left part of my back, and chest hurts so much. My neck is sore and I can barely move without shooting pain. My chest is (on a scale 1 to 10) a 10 for pain and it is putting a lot of strain on my heart and chest. I feel like I'm going to have a heart attack. So that is what is going on in a nut shell. I just wanted to get some advice before I do go to the doctors so I can know a little bit of what is going on. So I hope this is a common problem that can easily be fixed, but I fear for the worst. Please give me some feed back so I can be more knowledgable and not so scared.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello.  My name is Mai, and i am 15 years old. x  these past couple of days i have had a really, really tight chest, and have been stuggling to breath. I have had huge headaches, i mean really big ones, light sensative ones, and i cant swallow tablets. I have also been feeling really dizzy, tired and have had shortness of breath. I havent slept properly in ages either, i cant go to bed at say ten and will still be awake at 3.30am at the least.  I also sometimes feel sort of detached and really spaced out.   I posted a topic about it on another forum i use(its a rabbit forum), and i got this reply of a member.. Hi. I have panic attacks and also hyperventilation disorder (where you breathe either too quickly or too deeply - normally from your chest instead of your diaphragm (sp?) ) This can cause lots of side effects and definately stress can be a factor. it could be the case you are slowly hyperventilating due to stress and this could cause the tight chest. Taking really deep breaths can worsen the problem as its caused by taking in too much oxygen and not exhaling enough C02. The best way to test is to put your hand on your chest and the other one on your diaphragm and when you breathe the hand on your chest shouldnt really rise and your other hand on your tummy should. If your chest rises more than the tummy one then you arent breathing properly. To regulate your breathing you should count for 4 slowly on the inbreath and out for 5. It doesnt have to be exact for that but as long as the outbreath is for longer than the inbreath. Hope this helps and hope you are ok x  Common side effects are tiredness, dizzyness, shortness of breath and tightness in chest etc   I have all those symptoms that that member said. I am not breathing 'properly' either. Am i hyperventilating? things have been very stressful lately, as my mum is going through chemotherapy, could this have set it all of?  thank you for your time.   love mai xoxo\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Michelle,  Your symptoms are vague enough that they warrant a more in-depth workup, though not necessarily urgently. I suspect you are feeling these sensations because of a combination of benign physical problems and perhaps some chronic anxiety. The fact that you've been anxious and also sleep deprived could very well account for all of it, but since you describe chest tightness specifically, and also lightheadedness. it would probably be appropriate (and put your mind at ease) to have at least a resting 12-lead EKG and perhaps an exercise stress test as well. It sounds as though you are in generally healthy condition, but the frequent lightheadedness and other symptoms are difficult to quantify without first ruling out some structural heart disease first. That done, it should be a lot easier for you  to relax, since anything else would probably be very insignificant by comparison.   I don't really suspect you have heart disease, but a cardiological workup is a handy thing to have anyway, and the symptoms may warrant it. Your doctor could feel this is overdoing it, and if so, then trust your doctor. However, many would be willing to go this route just to be sure, and in the course of such a workup the actual culprit may show itself, which most likely would be either GERD, a hiatal hernia, or just plain anxiety (the most difficult of the three to treat, but at least a load off the mind).  Hope this finds you feeling better. Please do stay in touch.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  With the information about your husband the picture may have changed somewhat. Coughing up blood is never a good thing, and makes his problem more urgent. Aside from being a smoker (which could bear some relationship to his symptoms, it is hard to tell), you both seem to share some of the same symptoms, which could suggest a local environmental problem (mold? exposure to the same microorganism elsewhere?). At any rate, your husband does need to be seen urgently for evaluation of his symptoms, and perhaps the doctor he sees can find a link between the two of you and what's happening. Neither sounds much like heart problems,  but again, it is only a guess at a distance. There can be no question there is something going on, and in your husband's case it is either different or advanced beyond the point you're experiencing it. He should be seen by a doctor ASAP, and you should be with him and included in any discussion when this happens.  Please keep us advised of what you learn.\n\n",

    "content": "TWo days ago, I was playing with my 4 year old nephew, who is 38 lbs.  I sat on him, with my weight all on my hands, and said \"Why's this blanket so lumpy...\", and he laughed.  Then he decided to do it to me, only he jumped on me, by jumping in the air and landing on my chest with his bum.  It hurt emeidatly.  The pain is getting worse, and all I want to do is sleep.  As soon as I got home that night I went to sleep (at 6:00), and slept until 11:30 that morning, and then in the afternoon I had a 5 hour nap, and I've been sleeping like that ever since.  He jumped on my left side, just under neith my breast.  My mother says it's probably just a cracked rib, and Gramma and that and all they did for her at emergency was bind it up, and tell her to wait until it didn't hurt anymore.  Is there a use to going to the doctor?  Should I go, or will he just bind it up as my mother says.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  While your mother is probably correct -- usually even cracked ribs usually are wrapped or taped -- it would be wise,  with a continued complaint such as this, to at least have it examined and perhaps even x-rayed. While you'll probably wind up with a binding dressing at most, it can't hurt to know exactly what, if anything, is the extent of the injury. And if it is only bruising, binding might not even be the best thing for it.   I'm not sure why the drowsiness, but  you might mention that during your visit, should you decide to go.   Good luck to you. Stay in touch.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank You Dr. John Kenyon, CNA:  I did go to the doctor, and he coincendently said that he has 3 boys and on the weekend when he was playing with them, the same thing happened to him.  :) :0 strange.  He felt my ribs, and my stomach and said he thought my ribs were either bruised or cracked, my breathing seemed fine, and everything else seemed fine.  Since they don't do anything for cracked ribs anyway, he didn't think that x-rays were needed.  He did say something very helpful though - he said not to favour that side, and to resume regular activity.  When I did this at first, it hurt more, but then it got so much better instead of worse as it had stedily got before.  I'm not sure why, but I guess bending to one side, and always holding an arm infront the the injured area wasn't good for it and was actually harming it.  So I'm glad I went even for that.  Thanks again.  I'm sorry I took so long to get back to you.  I had to figure out in my own mind if the other symptoms that came on are due to that or something else: fever, feeling like my skin is burning, stiffness in joints.  Finally tonight I figured it out: 3 days ago I started a new drug (topomax) and these are side effects from that.  They should go away soon.  So now that I know it's not connected I know I can say thanks without asking more questions.  Thanks again.\n\n",

As a rule there is little or nothing to be done for bruised or cracked ribs, but he did give you excellent advice about favoring it, as you've now learned. Well worth sharing here.  Topamax certainly could explain the other symptoms. That makes perfect sense.   No problem with you taking your time writing back.

Anyways about 2 weeks after I started coughing and was starting to feel better my cough came back with a vengence! and I feel like everything is starting all over again. The cough, 2 days of sore throat, the headache's, eyes sensitive to lights and always watering, I even had a fever yesterday off and on. I also lost my voice for a while. My nose is so stuffy that I cant sleep well. Yesterday I started getting sharp pains in my upper chest strangely enough sometimes all the way into my breasts, my lungs kind of feel like they are being squeezed at times and the gurgling in my chest makes me cough alot. I had to sit all the way up last night in order to be able to breathe without coughing much and to unclog my nose. Also last night there were times I felt like I was breathing though a straw and I believe I was wheezing. I was thinking about going to see the doctor but I don't feel as bad as I did last night, I'm coughing and my chest is a little tight, the pain when breathing isnt so bad now. My husband is pushing me to see a doctor but Money is tight. What should I do?\n\n",

Some simple household remedies that might help you are salt water gargles 3-4 times a day and steam inhalation.  You can take some otc products like a bronchodilator cough syrup and some tylenol.  However I do think you need some antibiotics and may be for this you may need to consult at least a family physician-GP.   Apurva\n\n",

One thing that has changed for the worse is that I feel like my throat is swollen and the soreness has spreed to my lower gums.... so when I swallow I feel pain starting from my jaw then going  down my throat halfway. My gums are very painful to the touch especially where my wisdom teeth go in and out but I don't believe they are moving at the moment and even if they were they never cause this much gum pain in the whole lower jaw. I havent had a fever since last week. Is this something I can just wait out or do I NEED Antibiotics? and if so how do I convince the Doctors offices that I cant wait?\n\n",

My advice would have been yes, you did need to be seen at once. You first described a developing bacterial  bronchitis, but your follow up post suggested you may have had a very serious infection not only in your upper bronchial tree but also perhaps strep in your throat causing what is known as Vince's angina, which causes the nasopharynx and even the teeth and jaw to hurt as you described. And while Vince's angina has nothing to do with your heart, the sort of pain you describe (throat and jaw pain) can also, especially in women, be caused by heart problems as well, so you really did need to be seen right away.  I hope this finds you feeling much better now, since you seemed to be feeling pretty awful by the time of your second post and by the standard of your busy doctors' practices, you should have been a high priority at that point.   Again, I hope you are well. Please do follow up with us.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello - I am a 29 year old female, I smoke (< 10 a day), and have family history of heart issues (father mild heart attack - no damage - age 55).  I recently had what I can only describe as a panic attack at work.  I have a very stressful job and have had constant tightness in my chest, a rapid beating heart, and some shortness of breath.  My chest pain is a dull ache that radiates to my back, but is constantly there.  My hands get tingly when I sit at the computer (all day at work) too long.  When I fall asleep and am woken shortly after, i feel my feel beating very fast.  This occasionally happens upon waking as well.  I went to my GP this week to find out what was going on.  I have been seeing her for several years now, so she knows me pretty well.  We've had pretty regular check ups since I have hypothyroidsm that she monitors pretty closely.  She immediatlely diagnosed anxiety and prescribed me on Lexapro.  She did listen to my heart and lungs, said everything checked out OK and she didn't think there was a problem there.  My bp there was 150/90, which is not usual since I am anxious at the dr.  I admit that I have anxiety, but it is not somehting that I am unable to control on my own.  I am a little put off that she didn't look a little more into it with me.  I also explained to her that we would like to try to start a family soon and asked if the medicine would be safe.  She said to get off it when we did, but I am reading now that it is not an easy thing to do.    So, after my lenghly explaination (sorry), my main question is, do I go get a second opinion?  Can she know there is nothing else wrong by listening to my heart and lungs with a stethascope?  Thank you in advance for you time and attention.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: chest pain - diagnosed with anxiety -question",
    "content": "Hi there -  First, you do have two big risk factors for future heart disease, one of which is controllable: you have a family history because your father had a heart attack pretty early in life -- and the fact the there was no damage is great, but it doesn't eliminate the fact that it happened, and to a first-degree relative. There's nothing you can do about this, as we don't get to choose our relatives. But that second big risk factor is smoking. If you're wanting to start a family soon you are definitely going to have to give up this habit anyway, so you may as well start now. That's a fact which I won't soft-pedal. It's too big a deal to do that.   So you have some risk factors. That's good to know, so that you can do everything possible to control the ones you can control. You know what you have to do.  You acknowlege being an anxious person, and anxiety can cause all the symptoms you've mentioned, but your doctor has eliminated any reasonable doubt thus far, given your age and history. A stress test might not be a bad idea as well, because of your father's history, but your doctor can tell pretty much  all she needs to know, given your personal history and symptoms thus far, via listening and the EKG.   Where your doctor may have dropped the ball is in trying to treat an emotional and physiolgical problem, that being your anxiety. Antidrepressants like Lexipro are increasingly popular for the treatment of anxiety, and if you're finding that it works for you, that's great. If you become pregnant you certainly can stop the drug without any withdrawal syndrome, but you will likely have the anxiety symptoms return. This is a difficult problem, because during pregnancy there aren't too many drugs that can be given a simple green light. However, there sometimes are exceptions, and these are determined by weighing risk vs. benefit. I'm not sure what the risks to a fetus are with Lexipro, but it won't be hard to find out.   Oh, and the tingling you describe, while common in chronic and acute anxietey states, can also be caused by working at a computer or doing other repetiitive motion activities, especially if your posture sags or otherwise goes wrong progressively during the course of the workday, and since you are already anxious, feeling tingling that may be caused by this would only make you more aware of your body and cause more anxiety. Of course the tingling in the extremities can also be caused by hyperventilation, usually caused through deep sighing, sometihng one is more inclined to do if anxious and if sitting in a wrong position during long periods of time at work.   You are always entitled to a second opinion, and in this case I think it would be very wise. I'd also suggest you ask a  doctor to refer you to a psychotherapist who specializes in congitive therapy, since you may be able to reduce your anxiety levels through this method and manage without medication, which would be especially helpful during pregnancy.   By all means get a second opinion if you don't feel your current doctor has covered all the bases. Your history might warrant a stress test and you may as well know as much about your overall health as you can before you start a family. But regardless of all that, you need to stop smoking and you need to stop right away, not only for the sake of a possible baby, but also because of your family history of heart disease. It's one risk factor you have the power to remove.   I hope this finds you well and I hope everything works out well for you. Please do keep us updated here.\n\n",

I am a 42 year old mother of two and have been living with sharp chest pain for over 20 years.  We all go through the motions with our doctors - as we should - and suddenly find ourselves facing tests that were \"normal.\"  I was finally diagnosed with an unusal and little known phenomena:  slipped rib.  This diagnosis may be what many folks are experiencing.  Nothing replaces visiting your doctor and getting tests done as there are far more serious conditions which exist.  However, after doing some research many of you may find this diagnosis is something to consider.  I encourage people to do the research and get some peace of mind.    The pain will never go away, but understanding where it comes from can help you learn to live with it and to avoid body positioning that makes it worse.  Good luck!\n\n",

Typically this pain is felt more in the back near the spine since this is where the \"rib joint\" is that gets slightly dislocated.  There are actually some treatments for this to help improve or resolve the issue.  It is likely that you may need to see a DO or a sports medicine doctor trained in manipulation of the skeleton.  Basically the technique is similar to relocating a dislocated joint like the shoulder.  Occasionally this technique is not effective and the issue remains.  In that case, physical therapy to strengthen the muscles of the rib cage can help.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi David 1952 -  Well first of all, I am obligated to tell you that you need to stop smoking - now. Yes, I know, you're under a lot of stress and taking that away would be taking away one of your small comforts. However, it is one which will likely eventually kill you, and who needs that? OK, that sermon is over. You know what you need to do.   As for the chest pain, having been kept at the hospital for a few days and worked up thoroughly, I'd accept the finding that your heart is, for now at least, OK. I only say now because anyone can develop or even have occult heart disease, and since you're already a smoker you add a very potent risk factor to age and sex. But I said that sermon was over. Sorry.  You characterized, in the header of your post, that the chest pain was \"sharp.\" Sharp or stabbing chest pain is almost never heart-related. It can be, but it almost never is. This should help support the finding that your heart is fine.  You are under a great deal of stress, and this can cause a whole galaxy of symptoms, some physical, some psychosomatic. Especially in the case of a seriously ill loved one, this can be so. It has to be a tremendous burden to deal with your wife's very serious illness and the bills associated with it. I hope you are able to find ways to offset the load you're carrying presently, and that your wife's health improves greatly and soon. Hopefully you can find not only financial assistance but perhaps caregiving assistance as well. If you are serving as your wife's primary caregiver you are under quite remarkable stress and will need occasional breaks. There are systems in most jurisdictions to help with these sorts of situations. Finding them is usually the challenge.  I'm glad the hospital found your heart was fine. Try and run with that for now, and concentrate on taking care of yourself emotionally and physically. You won't be able to help your wife if you're not well yourself. It's a rough situation. I wish you both all the best.  Please do stay in touch with us here.\n\n",

    "content": "Over the past two weeks this pain becomes very intense and blood pressure rises. Ended up in the ER and was hospitalized for 3 days. After numerous testing( Ecco gram, stress test, blood test and EKG's and last a cardio cath the doctor said there was mild inferoacpical hypokinesis and mild focal hypokinesis. (What does that mean?) Then sent back to PCP who referred me to have a ultrasound of abdomen. This showed only that I have \"fatty liver\". This still does not explain the pain that comes on and is sever. What else could this be. I'm affraid still I'm having a heart attack. I have been put on lipitor, niacin, zanex, baby asprin, pain killers. What to do from here?  Please help....\n\n",

    "content": "Hello sunnyhawaii -   First of all, I hate to say this, but your doctor may as well have not told you anything at all rather than simply give you some extremely technical information that means virtually nothing but leaves you wondering and concerned. What the inferoapical hypokinesis means is that there is a slight sluggishness of the muscle lying at the base of one or both of the upper chambers of your heart, as well as some mild focal (localized) sluggishness somewhere, either in the same place or somewhere else, but it is non-specific and certainly wouldn't account for the pain you experience, nor is it, by itself and out of context, diagnostically important.  Fatty liver is a generally benign condition as well, and means that more than 10 per cent of your total liver weight is made up of fat. It may cause no problems whatsoever or, over time, it could cause inflammatory liver disease. It is something worth following during annual physicals and if there are any GI or other symptoms suggestive of a liver problem. So far you haven't reported anything like that here.  Which leaves the question of the pain you experience. You were undoubtedly referred for the abdominal ultrasound to rule out a possible abdominal aortic aneurism, which could have been responsible for the type of pain you describe (although that would usually sound more like an ascending or thoracic aneurism, which would have been discovered during your cardiac workups). All you came away with, thankfully, is a fatty liver. You did good.   So what about that pain? Right chest pain can actually invovle the sympathetic nervous system and could even be as remote as some sort of trauma or irritation of the C-8, T-2 section of the spine. There are nerves which serve the diaphragm as well, and these can be irritated by various anatomical or postural abnormalities and which can cause really severe and unsettling pain in the left or right chest, radiating up into the neck, throat, head, or armpit on the affected side. These are almost never associated with heart problems, although it is wise to rule that out, which you have now done.   Sometimes, if this is the problem (nerve irritation) the solution is as simple as taking up the practice of yoga, or as complex (if the discomfort warrants it) surgery to release the affected nerve or remove pressure.   The first line of therapy, however, is always pain medication. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents usually work well, but sometimes, if the problem originates in the GI tract and is due to pressure on the diaphragm from below, then this may actually aggravate the problem. Even that would be telling, however, so it is a good idea to try this approach first, even if it only serves to prove the problem is gastric rather than an irritated nerve.   The pain can be truly severe and sometimes momentarily disabling. It almost never is accompanied by any other symptom than elevated blood pressure (in some patients) due to the sympathetic response to pain. (High BP is often a confirming corollary of reported severe pain anywhere in the body, and makes serves to make the finding more convincing). Not everyone is \"wired\" to respond with elevated BP, but it is not unusual at all.   I hope all this helps to ease your mind some, since you've been through quite an ordeal of ruling out things. Please do keep in touch here.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I've posted here before. I'm a 28 year old female. I'm posting tonite because sometimes such as tonite,I get a tight feeling or feeling of pressure in my chest when walking and sometimes in my left shoulder and arm,too. I can get some tightness when sitting,too. I have wondered before if I had reflux,and I haven't been tested for it,but my doctor thought symptoms I had in the past sounded like gerd.  I wasn't eating mexican food and then have been able to this year. But sorry to say,I get gas sometimes after using the bathroom and what I describe as a 'yucky feeling'. Thankfully I didn't get much gas tonite. And I had mexican food for lunch today. I just naturally more than hope these feelings aren't heart related. When I got the tight or pressure type feeling in my chest tonite, all I did was walk from the store to the car. I wasn't feeling great in the car,either,and I had this feeling in my throat like I couldn't breathe well or something. I'm not overweight-I have some stomache fat I'd like to lose but I'm not overweight. I haven't weighed myself since September,and then I weighed 117.5 but I guess I gained some weight since then because some of my clothes fit tighter now. I don't exercise,though. Ever. And I work at home. I don't smoke,though,and my blood pressure has always been fine. I had a ekg last year and it was fine,but I know that doesn't always mean anything. Anyway, I just wanted to ask what it sounds like this could be? Thanks.   Michelle\n\n",

    "content": "Hi again -  Well I just completed a response to your previous post, but now, having read this one, I feel more likely you have a GI problem, and it may be anxiety related. The symptoms, again, are rather vague, but enough to cause you considerable concern. It is often the vague symptoms which cause the most concern, since they are difficult to hang on a specific condition or even organ system.   Since gas is sometimes an issue (and we all get it, don't feel funny about that), and usually does accompany the ingestion of Mexican (and other ethnic) food, that could certainly play a part in this, as could the unconscious swallowing of air, something which occurs more often in anxious people.   You do sound like a very healthy person, and now that the GI symptoms have come  to light as playing  more of a role (especially the chest discomfort when seated) I have to suspect simple gastric bloating and pressure on the diaphragm as a likely cause of the problem. Still, we do not know these things for certain, and certainly not at a distance, so I'd still recommend you bring these things to the attention of your doctor. A simple hands-on exam could well determine if this is the case.   Again, I hope this finds you well and again please do follow up with us.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello. I am a 24 year old male, 5\u20198 and 175 lbs, who has had asthma since the age of 10. The only medication I take is Albuterol. Recently, I have been having difficulty breathing at night or when I'm inactive during the day. During these episodes, my heart rate is in the mid 40's (normally in mid 50\u2019s when active). My peak flow meter shows that my lung capacity is normal, (actually the best its been in a few years). My blood pressure is usually a little under 120/80. Specifically, it feels like it is more difficult to breathe in and out tidal volume. Quiet breathing is less frequent and more labored. I feel like I'm suffocating sometimes. Again, this only happens when I am inactive, in bed or resting on the couch. I can do 30 minutes of cardio without pain and with the usual amount of fatigue.   I have had a period of 2 weeks in the past (November 2005) where I had these episodes nightly. When I went to the doctor, he told me that that it was psychological. The problem went away on its own. Now the problem has resurfaced. School is over and I am minimally stressed.  I went to a new doctor. This doctor was concerned enough about my low pulse to do an EKG and TSH test. Both were normal. She concluded that my heart rate was probably normal for me. She says that the shortness of breath might be due to inflamed muscles because of the intense cardio and weight lifting I have been doing for the past month. I have cut back on the intensity of my exercise and the episodes persist.   Is there a diagnosis that neither of these doctors have considered? Is there something that I should look out for or make my doctor more aware of?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: difficulty breathing when inactive",
    "content": "Hello knaik2 -  Since you tolerate vigorous exercise and the problem only presents itself while you are at rest, the strongest likelihood is that it is a symptom of chronic, generalized anxiety. Respiratory anxiety is not as common as that relating to the heart, but it is probably underreported. If you had any pulmonary dysfunction you would very likely find it worsened by intense (or even mild) exertion.  The one possible caveat to this, since you have a history of asthma, is that you could have post nasal drip and/or gastric reflux, both (either singly or in combination) account for a certain percentage of asthma cases. Sitting or lying can aggravate GI reflux, whether you feel it happening or not, and lying down (sleeping) can intensify both PND and GERD.   It's just a thought, but it's worth looking into. If this isn't the case then it is very likely attributable to anxiety as GAD often intensifies during inactivity.   I hope this is helpful. Please do follow up with us.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 21 year old male who has experienced shortness of breath and chest pain on an on and off basis for almost a year. Right now, I have been feeling short of breath on and off daily. When I turn my chest, it cracks like my knuckles would. It takes about 20 minutes or so to crack again, as a kunckle would. My shortness of breath limits my abilities to speak long sentences and sing. My chest hurts occasionally in the sternum area.  I have been to the ER about a dozen times and have received a full cardiac workup including a thallium stress test, echocardiogram, and numerous EKGs - all of which were normal. I have had 3 CT scans, and several chest X-rays - all normal. My lung function tests came back that I wasn't exhaling enough air, but after I quit smoking for 4 months, they came back that I was exhaling more than expected. However, each time I took the test.. I took it twice because the first times it would indicate a very poor performance on my lungs' part. the second times got the results i just previously stated.  What worries me greatly is that I have abused a lot of drugs in the past. Although I don't anymore... about the time this started I was then snorting painkillers quite frequently. This, in retrospect, sadly, worries me greatly as now I am aware of the risk of pulmonary granulomas and such from such mindless behavior. Although my numerous tests have been clear... i still am outrageously afraid at what I might have done and that I have some disease that has slipped under the diagnostic radar.  Help. Please.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Recurring shortness of breath, chest pain and cracking",
    "content": "Hi Ludwig357-  It sounds like there is definitely one benign problem going on with your chest wall, and the remote possibiity of an actual lung problem as well.   The chest discomfort, pain and cracking sounds very much like Tietz' syndrome, an often chronic inflammation of the cartilege in the intercostal spaces and where the ribs join the sternum. This can be quite painful at times, and does often feel like it needs to be \"cracked\" like knuckles. This condition usually responds well to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen.   The shortness of breath could be due to some inhibition due to the tightness and soreness of the connective tissue inflammation, or it may overlap with some lingering infiltrate material from the snorting of drugs not intended to be inhaled. I'm not certain, but would hazard a guess that this should correct itself over time, but if you haven't discussed this with any of the medical people you've been seen by, it might be a good idea, since I assume the pain medication was ground pills, which can contain talc or other inert material which can actually cause interstitial lung disease. It probably would not be severe in your case, but it's worth looking into.   In the meantime, I would try a course of NSAID therapy, prescribed by your doctor instead of over the counter, so it can be taken at effective dose levels and under direction. This may resolve the whole problem, but I would not, especially in your case, suggest self-medicating.  Hope this is helpful,  and do please keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  Shortness of breath has several causes for its occurence. First and foremost is low hemoglobin. One must pay attension to this first, if low and corrected the patient is saved from a lot of lengthy and expensive investigations.   Then there is the bronchial asthma and brinchitis. Asthma is usually with allergies and seasonal too. Patient  has choking sensation, wheeze, cough, expectoration and an air hunger.  Then there is the cardiac- heart-origin. Younger patients like you may have some valve disease or pericarditis. Relatively older population may have coronary blockages and have angina and dyspnea. Pateints witha a past 'attack' could have a low ejection fraction.   Restrictive lung disease is another possibility. Your pulmonary function test just could mean this. Restrictive lung will mostly show in Chest X ray and an HR CT of chest is indicated. One may need steroids for this diaease.   In my view, before attributing a symptom to anxiety a complete investigational work up is a must so that some important diagnosis is not missed.    Apurva\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I've been having chest symptoms since Nov last year.  At that time I went to the ER, got an x-ray, it came back negative and EKG with was normal.  The PA gave me Ibuprophen and I was released, she said I just needed some rest and that I was fine, but come back if the symptoms happen again.  This did not put my mind at ease; so I found a doctor and explained my symptoms, which are:  -constant and radiating, I'm always feeling the pain somewhere in my body; sometimes it's bareable and other times very debilitating.  Sometimes, I don't even know where the paid is coming from specifically -it hurts so much, and sometimes it feels like I'm having an out of body experience, for example, I'm at work typing, but it doesn't feel like I'm actually typing; but my work gets done the way it's supposed to. -chest tightening, sometimes it feels like I can't breathe or I have to remind myself to breathe; my breathing is very labored -sharp and sometimes dull pain that feels like it's directly behing my chest plate; or like a balloon is being blown inside my chest and blocking something, but  I can't tell what's being blocked. -back ribs hurt and are sometime tender to the touch -slight dry cough and runny/stuffy nose (this might be because I've been traveling for a few days now and the climate's been changing from rain to sun to rain to clouds.) -my whole body gets tense at times and I find it hard to relax, I don't even notice that I'm not relaxed until someone says to me relax or I move and realize that I was a little tense. -at separate times my left pectoral muscle feels tense, like I've been doing bench presses for days. -This tense feeling spreads to my left shoulder, neck and a little bit in my jaw area -muscle spasms in my left arm and sometimes a sharp pain in the wrist, forearm or shoulder area (but all three never hurt at the same time). -Dizzyness, light-headed -loss of appetite -insomnia -My vision is sometimes blurry  When these symptoms intensify, I freak-out and it feels like I'm dying...which makes me worry even more.  That's one of the main reasons I can't sleep and it's not like a I'm afraid to die...it's just very discomforting.  Okay, so here's a little medical background.  I've smoked for the past 7-8 years, about 1 pack a day.  I planned to quite, but ended-up taking a break for three months and started again one month ago.  I'm getting back on the horse, I've been cutting down (4 to 5 cigs a day) and then will quit in a few days.  I've had liposuction done to my chest, stomach and legs in Dec 2006.  I've done cocaine almost everyday for about one year and drank a lot of alcohol in that time.  Currently, I have't touch either substance in over two months. My sister had asthma and my mom battles high blood pressure. I'm lactose intolerant, but not allergic to any medication and a vegetarian.  I've been a vegetarian for a long time, then last year I started eating meat, but now, for about a month I'm back to being a vegetarian .  My doctor said there was something wrong with my digestive system and gave me Prilosec and Ibuprophen for the pain, but the Prilosec didn't really work.  She gave me a full blood test, which came back negative; except my white blood count was elevated as if fighting off an infection and my bad cholesterol was 1 point over the norm.  She said everything was okay and I should just stay away from acidic and fried foods.  Then she prescribed a muscle relaxer, I can't rememer the name, but it only made me sleep and I had to work; so I stopped taking it. She then prescribed Lorazepam to help with anxiety and it has been helping to keep me calm, but my worries and freaking out is still present, especially with these symptoms.  I'm seeing a new doctor, cause i'm in a different city.  He thinks it's a stomach/digestive problem and gave me omeprazole 20mg 1 per day and it has helped to ease my stomach, but I'm still getting chest, lung and muscle pains.  Does anyone know what I'm dealing with here or can make any suggestions on what to do to alleviate some pain.  The doctors said I should exercise, but I'm kinda afraid my heart with beat too fast, pop out of my chest  and/or rupture something.  Thanks in advance for any advice or suggestions.  Your opinion is great appreciated.  THANX!!!\n\n",

    "title": "Pain In Lower Left Chest, Approx 1 1/2\" Below Breast",
    "content": "Approx. two weeks ago while at work (and after doing nothing of particular difference, as I was standing still when this began) I began experiencing a dull pain in my lower left chest that gradually expanded around to a similar area on my back.  The pain gradually increased and soon it became painful to breathe.    Eventually I made it home from work and pain subsided the next day, but it was still there, though now localized to primarily the previously mentioned chest area.    Cut to now and the pain has been coming and going for the past two weeks.  Typically it will occur when I am lying down and attempet to make a full inhalation/exhalation.  The pain will come on not in a sharp way but strong enough to cause a good amount of discomfort and I will have to slowly inhale or exhale.  Also, a fluttering sensation of sorts or movement of some kind feels like it is accompanying the inhaltion and/or exhalation in the previously mentioned area.  Currently, sitting here typing, I feel absolutely no pain or irregularities of any kind which is really throwing me off on what exactly this is. Any help would be much appreciated.  Details that might be helpful about my life style include that since the start of the year I have been leading a much more active life style than the norm, jogging a mile about three or four days a week with light weight lifting.  Also my work load has been extreme, working 6 days a week for about a total of 65 hours each week.  I am a music venue/restaurant manager and administrator and my job requires no extreme or abnormal physical exertion.  I drink on average twice a week and was also a marijuana smoker for the past five years.  For the past 43 days, however, I have not smoked.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Jsg,  Here are some facts about a chest pain which might be useful to you:  Chest pain well localized is mostly non-cardiac. Chest pain inframammary area i.e. just below the breast is almost always non cardiac. Chest pain increasing on deep breathing is non cardiac, either musculo skeletal or pleural. Chest pain on coughing is non-cardiac.  So now you can see for yourself that your pain is either musculoskeletal that is coming from the rib cage or the muscles in between or it is pleural. Pleural pain consists of a pneumonia, TB, Pleural effusion. You mey need to consult your internist to get the relevant tests like basic blood work and a chest X Ray done.   Apurva\n\n",

However this new complaint of yours like aching all over and pain in chest could herald a fresh episode of a viral. I think you will benefit from some warm salt water gargles and some tylenol.  Suppose you do not improve with these in a couple of days' time I strongly suggest you consult your internist.  Best wishes,  Apurva\n\n",

However it is really very difficult to throw more light on this just from this information.   However since you say you have GERD, your symptom could be a manifestation of some acid reflux or gaseous distension of the intestine too.  I do advice you to see an internist about this to get a proper diagnosis and whatever treatment required.   Apurva\n\n",

The only other possibility that comes to mind for me is the potential for mold from the humidifier.  Make sure it is cleaned thoroughly, perhaps with a bleach solution, then dried well.    If you begin to have breathing difficulties, fever or a sense of impending doom, see your doctor.    Good luck.\n\n",

    "title": "Random tight and stabbing chest pains",
    "content": "Every now and again I will get a sharp pain in my chest, usually in the middle-left area of my chest. It will last at most 15/20 seconds, but usually it's just a few seconds, with one stabbing pain feeling occuring. When it happens it's usually me breathing in that brought on the pain. What I mean by this is that the pain will occur just as I'm taking a breath in, I don't think I've ever felt the pain on exhaling breath. The pain will also feel quite constricting and give quite a tight feeling round my chest. When the pain lasts for more than a few seconds, I get the same stabbing feeling usually each time i take a breath in, making breathing feel quite hard and discomforting. I should also note that during each subsequent breath, the pain will lessen slightly until it's gone.    I have been experiencing this pain on and off for about 13 years now, as I'm fairly sure it started when I was seven. The first time I had it was when it's ever been the most painful, as I remember having the pain constantly for atleast half an hour, with the same stabbing feeling in my chest whenever I inhaled, just alot more painful and with the inability to control the pain as much buy not breathing in as deep, i.e. the pain was constantly there, with breathing making it more excrutiating. One of the things I remember about this incident was me on the floor screaming in pain. It died down a bit after half an hour or so, but was still there so I was taken to hospital where they looked after me over night, but I'm fairly sure they didn't fully diagnose it. I think the best they could come up with was that it was a viral infection.    Since then I've had 'attacks' on average about once a month. There really doesn't seem to be anything that connects them, I'll just be going about my day doing whatever and suddenly I'll just get a pang in my chest, with it going away shortly after. Just as an example, the last time I had it was three days ago just after I woke up. I was just lying in my bed when it happened, but I've had it sitting down, standing, walking, running, it does just seem to be random and not brought on by anything.    I have spoken to a doctor about it before last year, as at the time I had been getting the pain about once or twice at most a day for just over a week and was slightly worried about it. As it seems to go away quite quickly it's never really worried me too much. The doctor couldn't really see what was causing it. I think she said that she'd heard of other cases like myself in young men, and it was a bit of a phenomenon in that the cause of the chest pain wasn't really known.   I don't have any family medical history of chest problems, and I've always been quite fit and healthly. My chest pains don't concern me too much, but I am quite interested to hopefully find out one day what is causing them, so any help you can give me with this matter would be greatly appreciated. Thanks very much.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello MarkWood87,  The symptoms you describe sound very much like something called \"precordial catch syndrome\".  This is a benign and fairly common complaint amongst children and teenagers and can persist into adulthood.  The cause is unknown, it might be related to a pinched or compressed nerve, but it does not seem to be cardiac in origin and is thought to be harmless.  Some people find that forcing oneself to take a very deep breath may alleviate the pain, though it may be painful to take that very deep breath.  Anxiety can also cause chest pain, as well as disorders of the respiratory and cardiac systems of course, but the symptoms you describe sound unlikely to be of a serious respiratory or cardiac nature.  I hope this is helpful to you.\n\n",

Now you wheeze when you exhale so possibly you might be heading towards chronic bronchitis. You need to stop right now, since once set in, chronic bronchitis has no remedy.   The chest pain you are having does not look like a heart pain but I strongly suggest you to get in touch with your physician and get whatever tests he suggests, like an X ray of the chest, an EKG etc.  Apurva\n\n",

    "content": "Hi I'm 27, male and a non smoker. I\u2019m pretty healthy, but in constant pain.  I have been suffering with this chest pain for 7 years now.  To cut a very long story short, basically I had a very bad chest infection about 7 years ago. This has left with chronic chest pain.  I used to smoke allot of cannabis at the time which I feel As has damaged my lungs/heart or something in my chest causing me to have  Daily chest pain. That infection has changed my life.  I have always got a very dull and very deep pain around the area of my heart, front and back.  The pain I get is very hard for me to describe, I get alot of different pains all over the left hand side of my chest and back and sometimes shooting pains down my left arm. I get a sharp stabbing pain deep in between somewhere near my 3rd rib up on the left, this pain I don't get too often but when I get it, its pretty unbearable and last for about 30 secs\u2026.I can\u2019t move or breathe.  The pain I\u2019m most worried about that has only started recently seems a  It\u2019s a very dull and very deep pain. I can't make this pain any worst or any better.  Its generated from around the heart area, front and back. but deep! so kind of  in between  my front and back ribs. It feels constantly like my heart is under some sort of pressure and there  is something around it crushing it making it hurt. I get allot of very painful cramps amount this area mailing near the front of my chest that really scares me. I also get some very large and painful heart beats...enough to make me jump out of My seat and scream in pain. Almost like a electric shock in the chest.  Exercise doesn\u2019t seem to make this any worst, but then i don't do too much Hard core exercise to notice, I do allot of walking though and that doesn't effect  it at all. I never seem to get out of breath and I do feel pretty fit.  One thing that does seem to make this worse for some reason is alcohol, if i have been  out for a drink,the next day i'm in so much pain.  I have been trying to at least find out what this is for years. It does seem to be getting slowly worst.  I have been to 3 chest specialists, I have had loads of x rays, tried every  Anti inflammatory and pain killer. I have had a few ECGs. Nothing seems to show up and nothing seems to help my pain.When a doctor listens to my chest it seems to sound ok. The only things i haven't had which i think might show something is a CT scan. on my lungs and heart...but not sure if something will show up?  This is really affecting my life and now and really need some help as i feel I have run out of options on things to try\u2026I get now where with my local doctor and I have to wait months to see a specialist...bit sick of going to hospital and  not finding out whats wrong.  I'm pretty sure this is not a anxiety or digestive problem.  Any help or advice would be most appreciated.  Sorry about the essay\u2026\n\n",

    "content": "Hi.  From the description of your pain it does not fit in to the typical cardiac pain neither it is characteristic of any lung disorder. Inspite of this it is advisable to get all possible tests to get to the root of the cause of the pain after seeing a specialist. If he agrees he may advise you a Stress Test, an Echocardiogram, Chest X ray, a CT scan of thorax etc.  However in my opinion your kind of pain, I have seen it to be caused by a condition called Cervical Spodylosis wherein the discs in one's cervical spine would be compressing the nerve roots and causing pain in arm, shoulder, back and upper front of chest.  I hope this is useful to you,   Apurva\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you very much for your help and opinion.  I have had a Echocardiogram about 6 months ago and everything showed up find, is it possible for an Echocardiogram to miss something that might be causing pain in the heart?  I think the only thing that might put mind at rest is having a CT scan, but i can't get my specailist to give me one.  Could my chest infection of caused Cervical Spodylosis in anyway?  One thing that does baffle me is..sometimes i get a really big heart beat, this is sometime extremely painfully, this gives me a bit of a shock and worries me. Is this possible this is something different and not anything to do with my pain?  Thanks very much for your help  \\A/\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I am a 20-year-old female who has experienced night sweats and extreme fatigue for over 1 year. I have hypothyroidism and am receiving treatment, my doctor adjusted the amount of my Levoxyl 2 months ago. I am also on Yaz.   I sleep a minimum of 12 hours a day and am still fatigued when I awake. I experience night sweats and have \"sweating spells\" throughout the day. I occasionally have trouble catching my breath, it seems like my heart is palpitating. My arms and hands tingle when this happens. My lymph nodes are swollen and sore. I have a constant headache in the back left side of my head.  I have odd bruising and burning in my veins, especially veins in my forearm and thigh. My veins protrude out and bruise after I feel the burning sensation. The doctor tested me for blood clots, as he said these bruises looked like \"strips of clots\" in my vein, but the test said my clotting factor is perfect. I have a family history of heart problems and cancer.  I am not sure where to turn now. I am tired of always being fatigued and sweating....I know this is not how my body should be. These are extreme changes from what I have been like. Please help!\n\n",

May be you could ask your doctor for a TSH test if he agrees and modify the dose accordingly.

Beacuse these are the organic causes of a numbness which is caused by dysfunction of the local nerve supply of the area.   On the other hand it may also have to do with the concerned nerve root getting compressed at the level of spinal cord.  I would like if you posted some more detail about the history and other features.  Apurva\n\n",

The area where the numbness is located it the same color as the rest of my chest.  It doesn't swell or stick out in any way.  The only way I can find it is when I scratch because as soon as I hit that area I feel nothing.    I don't know for sure how long it has been there.  I just noticed it one day when I was scratching my chest.  If it is spinal compression... is it/can it be serious?  I do have a checkup soon at my hospital so maybe I can bring it up.\n\n",

    "title": "Hard to Breathe, Shaking and Sick Feeling",
    "content": "Hey,       I am having a few problems which is worrying me every day. I'll start from the beginning which was almost a year ago when i started to feel like this. I was watching tv during the day having an energy drink,(red bull) when i fell asleep. I awoke a little later shaking like mad and feeling sick. I thought it was jsut the caffeine from the drink which woke me up like this. I jumped in a hot shower to calm me down, which helped then the shakes started to fade. A few months later i went out to dinner after work, just as i started to eat this feeling happened again. I thought i was going to faint and me stomach felt very heavy and i was trying to take long steady breathes as i thought i was going to have a panic attack. I ran to the bathroom but i was not sick, just this strange feeling. This then started to happen every couple of weeks as i started to eat. The thought of being diabetic struck my mind as i was drinking fizzy pop when this started to happen. So i stopped these drinks, and tried to eat a bit more healthy too. After this the feelings started to happen more often, but mostly as i was lying in bed at night about to go to sleep. Sometimes i would violently shake, i could not even type on my keyboard. The feeling of being sick, breathing fast and my heart racing would happen too. I thought it was something i am eating, so i have changed foods alot, changed the amount i eat, but nothing seems to change. I also started to go swimming and do more excercising just in case, but still no change. Now it is happening almost every day. The violent shaking only seems to happen once a week but the sick feeling in my stomach and my breathing keeps happening in the mornings, nights and now its started during the day, almost not changing at all! I have been to the doctors, who does not say this is diabetes as i do not pass water frequently or have any other symptoms. He gave me and ECG test to see how my heart rate was, which was higher than normal as this feeling was happening the same time. Now i just have to get a blood test to see if theres anything wrong there.  Another thought of heartburn/indegestion crossed my mind as I could feel a slight burning sensation in my stomach. When the sick feeling began i tried Gaviscon, which is used for heartburn abd indegestion, but there was no change.  I really want this to go away as it is scaring me alot now, it is very hard to sleep and when it is really bad i feel like i am going to die it is that bad.  Thank you for your time. Craig\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  Shaking of the body has several possibilitis like Hyperthyroid state, Parkinson's disease, Cerebellar disease [Nervous system], Familial tremors, at the time of high fever, some drug side effects etc.  At your age, Parkinson's disease and cerebellar disease are quite unlikely. Hyperthyroidism could be there, you need a blood test to decide for that. Familial tremors, as the name suggests is there in several members of your family. Drug side effects if you are taking medicines like salbutamol or terbutalin for Asthma. Yes diabetes also should be ruled out.  If none of the above is confirmed then all that possibly remains is a Panic attack. Trigger for this panic attack just could be in your stomach like if you have acidity or dyspepsia and 'gas' the symptom can trigger a subconscious sense of fever and could lead to a panic attack.  First of all rest assured that nothing is wrong with you. Get in touch with a good doctor and get a full body check up. Get treatment for whatever the check up results throw up.   If all negative take some tranquilizer pills.  I am sure you will be fine soon!  Apurva\n\n",

I get it about 10 to 15 times a day, and it is often triggered by something absolutely trivial or nothing at all.  I feel like my heat stopped for a second or jumped a beat.  It's also a bit like a hot flash.  It's always over after a second, but it's getting me a little worried.  Do you have any idea what this may be?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Ariane,  Sudden onset tightness in chest that lasts only a second and comes on repeatedly in a day could very possibly be a panic attack.   Tightness in chest due to heart ailment like angina always lasts somewhere between 5-20 minutes, whereas tightness of a heart attcke lasts much longer unless untreated.   GERD [Gastro Esophageal Reflux Disease] can also sometimes cause retrosternal tightness but still it wont last just a second.  Kindly try to evaluate if there is any reson for you to be anxious lately? Are you anticipating something eagerly? Or are you dreading some possible event that you would not like to happen?  Meanwhile you could start on some antacid with some OTC tranquilising pill. If you don't feel better in a day or two, please contact your physician.  Apurva\n\n",

As I was feeling better I redid the floors of my house,  on my hands and knees scrapping.  Immediatly after I had a strange crushing feeling in my whole chest area.   The doctors in the ER did all kinds of tests,chest x-ray, ekg, blood, and pawned it off as Pleurisy. My GP does not think it is pleurisy, because it does not hurt to inhale. Now have sent me to a cardiologist for a stress test.   Now I have a really distinct bruised feeling in my sternum, it hurts to touch.  Could this bruised feeling be just a muscle strain, or due to trying to cough as directed if it were plerurisy?  I do not cough up phlem or have any other symptoms.  Any other suggestions?  I am taking anti inflammitory meds, they do not help.  Thanks\n\n",

It can cause sever sneezing and watering of eyes also. The bronchospasm will be followed be excess secretion of mucus in your bronchi. This in turn leads to congestion, and coughing. There is also associated inflammation. This inflammed tissue catches bacterial infection from air easily and one feels feverish, fatigued, malaise, tiredness.  A routine course of antibiotic advised by your doctor with a bronchodilator syrup and a mucolytic agent will do you a lot of good.  I hope this is helpful,   Apurva\n\n",

    "title": "Emphysema at 30 and what of this fungal infection???",
    "content": "Seven months ago I went to the hospital where xrays showed an upper respiratory infection.  I was given antibiotics then sent home.  Five months ago just after turning thirty, I ended up sick in the hospital with a \"hole\" in my lung and the doctors thinking I had TB or worse.  Turns out I don't have TB and the biopsy of the spot was negative for cancerous cells.  Unfortunately they still don't know what it is.  I've had many CT scans and most tests imaginable since then.  The inital CT scan showed Mild Bullous Emphysema so the doctors told me to stop smoking which I did. Most recently, the pulmanologist thinks it's some sort of fungal infection although every specific test returns negative including Cocci and histo (as I live in the midwest but visited the west coast just before getting sick).    I was given two kinds of antibiotics in the hospital, followed up with six weeks of another kind after getting out and then became ill again with another lung infection and did two more weeks of antibiotics.  I was fairly well for about four weeks and slowly sick again and am now on antibiotics again.  I've only had two breathing treatments throughout the ordeal and don't use inhalers.  Fact is, I'm not short of breath nor have trouble breathing so they don't feel I need it.     I've also gained 13 pounds since quitting smoking so I'm actually healthier in that regard.  The problem is that, I've yet to stay uncongested for long.  I constantly relapse back to the same symptoms and can yet again feel the spot in my lung which shows up on CT scans as what the doctor explained to be scar tissue surrounding a node.   (It feels like theres a sticker on my back).  The fever returns, the burning and tingling in the lungs return, the stabbing chest pains return, my underarms ache and oddly, my right knee will ache though I've never injured it.  I'm worried that they are missing something or that there might be something more I can do.  I'm also worried that since I'm allergic to pennicillins, the antibiotics won't always work.    Is there anything else it might be?  Is there anything else I can do?\n\n",

TB one cant be sure because a negative TB report doesn't rule out Tuberculosis. So if the general clinical picture suggests, this avenue should be pursued. One point against TB is your 13 lb weight gain.  Lung abcess, fungus, atypical and bacteroids can be diagnosed with a brochoscopy, lavage, and serology from blood.  Finally since you have been a smoker, and your chest CT did show emphysema this could be  Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease [COPD] with refractory lower respiratory infection.  There are several powerful antibiotics now available to replace penicillin and resistance to penicillin need not be a cause of any worry.  Apurva\n\n",

    "content": "Hello. My great uncle was in the World War, and I am completely lost when it comes to medical issues. Here is what I have:  In May of 1917, he was brought in as having trench fever and was cleared  in July of 1917. In August of 1917, he complained that when bending forward of stooping he felt pain in his back, knees, right shoulder, headaches, and was tender throughout his body. No improvement was shown even after vapor baths and massages on alternate days for many months, and was eventually released January of 1918 to a rehabilitation center, still complaining of lumbar pain, shoulder, headaches, and shin pain. It is listed as myalgia chronic positive. Walks with limp on left leg. Pain runs down to knee at nights, all pain worse at night. No vomiting or abdomen pain. Heart and lungs were normal. He left the center October of 1918, still with pain.  In April of 1919, he was seen by a medical board. In that board's record, he is listed as having DIMINUTION RESPIRATORY POWER and BRONCHITIS due to exposure. He received it in January of 1919 while in Germany. The record says that he had a scar running from his lip down his cheek that as not there before. There is no area of dullness over either lung, breath sounds are normal and heard at any place over either lung. There are a few ?rates? over chest in front. Frequent reports of sputum say \"No T.B. found\". Heart is normal in size shape and rhythm. Vascular sounds aere normal. Temp remains normal. Man states that he eats well, sleeps well, coughs slightly, expectorates slightly, does not have rigors, but is in a more delicate condition than before joining up. He has lost the strength and energy which he formerly posessed.  June 28th, 1919: The man states that he was much afflicted on the journey south from Germany and that he developed a cough on this journey. He never reported sick and was sent to hospital by standing med board at Bramshott when he was paraded for return to Canada with his division. The board asked for him to be treated for his chest condition and for observation as to underlying cause. He had a slight temp on admission, but it had been normal for 8 days.  That is what I have- constant sputum and urine tests came up 'No T.B.', and yet he was found to have died of either phthisis or pulmonary tuberculosis March 24th, 1921. I would greatly appreciate anyone who could explain what happened, or offer an alternate cause. Thank you so very much!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  From the history that you have stated it seems that your great uncle had chronic cough, expecroration, loss of strength and stamina, body pains, fatigue, occasional fever. He was also found to have 'rales' on his chest meaning a sound called 'crepitation' was heard on his chest while listening with a stethoscope.  These set of symptoms and signs COULD result from a pulmonary tuberculosis. Testing the sputum for TB is not always positive even in a confirmed case of TB. Having said this, these symptoms could go either way like chronic bronchitis with bronchiectasis can also have a similar picture.  It is very difficult to precisely give a reason for your uncle's disease after all these years just from some fragmented medical history.  Apurva.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  Pain on chest which is brought on or aggravated by moving or deep inspiration is usually of chest wall origin-musculoskeletal. It can also be from an intrathoracic muscle pull.   It could also be a 'Pluritic pain', coming from the covering membrane of the lungs. In this case it is usually an infection.  One particular kind of chest pain here is the one which comes on on assumig an upright position, is severe and it could be from the outer covering of the heart called pericardium and the disease called pericarditis.  Otherwise the usual heart pain or angina is central in the chest or below the sternum, is vaguly localized, it has a gripping or a squeezy feel about it and it is brought on by exertion unless it is a heart attack.  From what you describe yours seem to be the musculo skeletal one. However it is better to get in touch with a physician and get the routine chest pain work up done.   Apurva\n\n",

I have slight mild discomfort in the exact same place on both sides of my chest, right under my lowest rib. I also have what feels like a muscular pain on just the right side of my neck that seems to go up to the base of my skull.  On my right side, I feel slight pain in my upper right chest/under my arm and also my back. I actually have a problem telling where the pain is coming from. Sometimes it feels like my back, other times it feels like my chest.  All of the pain is a mild discomfort, like a twingy pain that feels like a muscular thing.

This type of pain may aggravate on movements and on deep inspiration.

These symptoms have been more or less non stop for a month now, being worse for the first 15 minutes after i wake up and at night. And its starting to concearn me.The symptoms occured overnight but i did have symptoms similar to this for the past year but only lasted for about 15 minutes generaly after i smoked. I did go to see a doctor and had an xray of my chest. Which my lungs were clear and apeared healthy. I was given an albuterol inhaler ( which doesnt seem to help very much ). Sypmtoms started when i caught the flu, i was sick about 4-5 day s with a mild fever. Bronchitis is common after you get the flu, but im not sure how long bronchitis lasts. I was told symptoms could last 2 weeks or so. But it has been over a month now and i don't feel and relief from when it started. I do smoke, but i am not a heavy smoker, a pack usualy last me about 3 days. Sorry for the long topic but these symptoms are greatly concearning me and any information that could possibly help ease the symptoms and my nerve's or a possible diagnosis would be greatly apreciated. Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Greg88, You did not mention at which time you were able to consult with your doctor, and it was unclear if that visit was related to this onset of symptoms or to those of the past year.  An xray is a valuable diagnostic tool, but it is limited to what it can reveal to the practitioner:  infiltrates, consolidations, masses, certain anatomical abnormalities, etc.  It cannot however give the doctor a picture of the actual tissue health of the lungs. There are non-invasive tests that could prove to provide additional information to the practitioner such as PFTs - pulmonary function tests, VQ scans - ventilation/perfusion scans, spiral CT - computed tomography.  There are also simple blood tests that can aid the diagnosis of infection or inflammatory processes.  You may wish to ask your doctor if any of these or other tests may be of value to determine what is causing your cough and shortness of breath. And, not to preach at you, but it may be worth your while to curtail your smoking altogether, sort of a self-test if you will.  If eliminating the smoking altogether changes your symptoms, then you may wish to factor that information into your decisions for a healthy lifestyle.  You are young, and hopefully have a long and healthful life ahead of you. Please consider only putting into your body those things that will lend toward a happier, healthier, cough-free life!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I am a 24 year old female who is relatively healthy.  I have been experiencing these random, infrequent chest pains every now and then for quite a few years now.  Every now and then, perhaps once a month (maybe more, most likely less), I will feel a sharp pain underneath my left ribs as I breath in. It seems to be a few inches above the bottom of my rib cage, underneath my heart.  It almost feels like a restriction of some sort, when I try to breath in deeply.  When I feel it happen, if I take a normal breath in, or a deep breath in, I know it will really hurt.  It's a very uncomfortable, scary feeling; therefore, I just breath very shallow for a few breaths until I can feel it has gone away; then I can continue to breath normally again.  It only lasts for a few breaths.  As I said, this happens quite infrequently and randomly, but I do get nervous when it happens.   I have never smoked and drink only socially. I used to have asthma in high school, but outgrew it.  Please let me know if there are any other details I can provide.  I think I saw a similar post by \"Patient\", dated 2005, but I am not sure if this is the same thing or not.  I am looking forward to any help you can provide.  Thank you so much.\n\n",

I tend to get extremely dizzy and fatigues by around 5 or 6 in the afternoon, once I checked by blood pressure when i felt this way and it was 100/60 this was after i had walked around the mall for 40 minutes. Someone suggested that I might have had low blood pressure all along and thats why i feel dizzy and like i lack oxygen. Recently I developed a new symptom I have a burning on my upper back that radiates to my neck and head it feels like a burning pain and like someone is streching me. Could low blood pressure be the reason of my chest pains? Should I see a doctor?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Joel_desm,  If this continues it is probably a good idea to have this evaluated by your doctor.  Most commonly, blood in the saliva is actually from a slight nose bleed.  It may be that you have a very slight nose bleed that is draining backwards with the blood pooling at night so that you are noticing it most in the morning.  Keeping the air moist can help prevent nose bleeds.  This can be done by using a humidifier or even a nasal moisturizing gel (or spray although the gels work better in my experience).  There are other less common causes so if it isn't getting better your doctor can help determine if other testing is needed.  Best wishes.\n\n",

An Xray chest and some blood work is all you need.  Once the above mentioned major causes have been ruled out, then your cough can be due to a sinusitis with a post nasal discharge, or some environmental allergy.  You have not mentioned if you are on any other medications. Some BP medicines can be the reason of persistent dry cough with even a headache and urine incontinence.   For you I suggest a chest X ray, a complete blood count and if bothe are normal then to take a course of a broad spectrum antibiotic with your Family physicians advice.  Apurva.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I'm an 18 year old female, and I keep fairly fit. The last time I came back from the gym, my chest was very tight around the outside of my ribs, and painful around my sternum when I breathe in; and I began coughing up blood, which only lasted for about 10 minutes, but the spit contained a fair amount of blood (enough to make it more red then pink) and I was slightly dizzy. Two hours after getting back from my workout my chest is still tight and I have a dry cough, a wheeze, and a severe headache. Before, during a difficult workout I sometimes had a metallic taste (like blood) in my mouth, but I've never actually coughed up blood.  I've also had problems with chest tightness before, but my chiropractor dismissed it as muscle pain. I had severe asthma as a young child, but for about 12 years, it hasn't been a problem, and I don't have any symptoms. Lastly, I've had pnemonia several times, but I haven't had it for the last 4 years or so.  I remain very healthy, with a healthy diet and active lifestyle.  I'd just like an opinion from a doctor rather then one I've looked up on the internet, so I can make a decision as to whether I should go to the walk in clinic or if it's something I shouldn't be terribly concerned about.  Thank you for your time.  Mal Lakins\n\n",

I would suggest that you see your doctor for an evaluation about this.  You may need some imaging studies to get a better look at your lungs and make sure everything is OK.  If you are having any significant trouble breathing you should go to the emergency room or call 911.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Since quitting, my husband has started to have problems with coughing more (which I realize is normal after quitting for a while), difficulty breathing or feeling like it's hard to get a breathe in, shallow breath.  We do not have insurance, so pay our own way, and want to be efficient about what this may be and who we go see, rather than jumping around to various doctors.  Wondering if this is an asthma type issue, or if we need to go to a pulmonologist?  of if this is just typical side effects after smoking cessation and that it will eventually subside?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Cybrwolf,  Quiting smoking can cause some temporary increased difficulty breathing but most people actually begin to feel better fairly quickly.  If this difficulty continues or gets worse I would recommend your husband see his primary care doctor for evaluation.  It may be that he is having an asthma exacerbation or even an infection such as a pneumonia.  Seeing his primary care doctor is probably the best way to go.  There also are often clinics that can see patients without insurance on a free or reduced fee scale.  Your local health department can probably point you to these clinics if needed.  If your husband develops severe difficulties breathing I would strongly advise he be seen right away in the emergency room.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Aberoo,  Actually, there is very little difference between the two.  Both men and women have breast tissue; however, women have significantly higher levels of estrogen that causes the breast tissue to enlarge and the breasts to develop.  The reduced levels of estrogen in men do not stimulate growth of the breast tissue.  This is why it is possible for a man to develop breast cancer.  The small amount of tissue present makes the chances much less likely but still possible.  In some cases, such as in obesity, men can have elevated amounts of estrogen in the blood and can have some breast development.  Boys going through puberty may also notice some breast development that tends to reduce as the boy gets older and the hormone levels stabilize back to typical adult male levels.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello. I am 35 year old female, in realtively good health. Since April, I have lost nearly 50 lbs (was 286- now 236) and I exercise 5-6 times a week by walking or running. For the past two years, I have been experiencing PVCs which have gradually become more pronouced. They began as slight flutters and have now progressed to feeling as if the heart literally stops. I, of course, know that its not \"stopping\" per se, but nonetheless, it feels as if it stops and I get almost like a surge of adrenaline when it happens. Every morning I wake, I have extreme pressure in my chest on the left side under my breast that radiates to my left shoulder and aches all the way to my back. It usually gets better throughout the day, however for the last week and a half, it has gotten worse and has been lasting all day. For three weeks, I have been experiencing bouts of dizziness, also. I tried antacids hoping it was related to gastro symptoms, but I recieved no relief what so ever. I went to my PCP on Wednesday and he immediately sent me to the ER.My blood pressure was elevated ( I am usually 110/60 and it was 172/120) I was admitted and had numerous blood tests (enzymes negative), EKGs( one showed two different places where the line should have gone up and stayed flat) and a stress test that said everything looked fine.I was given a nitrogylcerin patch while in the hospital and actually slept without any discomfort for the first time in months. The inpatient physician and hospital cardiologist felt it was safe for me to go home with instructions to take 81 mg of aspirin once a day, continue with exercising and a heart-healthy diet. She wrote me a prescription for Protonix and stated she thought it might be gastro related. I nearly had a heart attack when it came to paying for the medicine (insurance covered $20, I paid $110) and have been follwing doctor's orders. Its early Sunday morning, and I awoke at 5:45 with extreme discomfort again. I took antacids (no help) and my aspirin and Protonix, and still feel pretty crappy. I have some stresses in my life ( work/single mom) but nothing that's too tough to deal with. I had Rheumatic fever in my early teens but have been told their was no permanent damage, I partied in college and did partake in recreational drug use but never extensive overuse or abuse. I am probably the healthiest I have been in 15 years, The pressure is not better nor worse with exercise; the same after eating or drinking. I do not smoke and have not for nearly 8 years. I do not believe its anxiety. I have never had a panic attack. I have no family history of heart disease or heart attacks. Something to note, I was flying to Florida and fighting a cold. I took Sudafed to relieve sinus pressure and afterwards, it felt as if my chest was in a vise. After an hour, the symptoms subsided and I was ok. I just thought of it as a fluke. Then, I had a horrible headache a few weeks ago. I tried Advil and it was still pretty severe. Thinking it was perhaps sinus-related, I took some sudafed. Well, I thought my chest would burst. So I just made a mental note not to take it again. So, basically, I am scared. I don't think its \"all in my head\". I have legitimate discomfort and I am really concerned. Even though it has only been 3 and a half days on the Protonix, I feel as bad if not worse. Any suggestions? [/b]\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I'm a 31 year old male and have been to the doctors a few times over the past two months. I have generalized chest pain, a cough producing mostly clear flem, nasal congestion and mild headaches. At first I was diagnosed with an upper-respiratory infection. The medicines given for that were ineffective, so I went to a different doctor and was diagnosed with lower acute sinusitis, I think. I was put on a dose of amoxicillin, which I still am on today, and prometh codeine syrup which I had to stop because of the side effects. I went back to the doctor after 1.5 weeks because of 1) stopping the prometh and 2) I now had tightness in my throat. A chest-xray and blood tests turned up negative. I was also given albuterol (and am still on), which I noticed was used to treat asthma. After a get together with a number of my friends this weekend, two of them were undergoing similar treatments and had similar symptoms. Their doctors seemed to think it was the onset of seasonal asthma. My generalized chest pain goes away when taking tylenol or other pain killers and when it does come on, I can usually put my finger on the area and it feels like bruising. I also talked with the doctor about panic attacks but I couldn't figure out any pattern to when these symptoms occured, although lately I have noticed it is usually occurring when I change environments (different rooms, outside to inside, etc.). The cough has been reduced to maybe two or less episodes a day and the same with the nasal congestion. I'm mostly left with the lessening chest pain (front and sides) and throat tightness. I have also begun getting what feels like pressure on the front of the chin. I guess I'm looking to see if my doctor has prescribed the right tests and gone down a reasonable path or if there are other tests I should request of him or if it is worth getting a third opinion. Thanks and happy holidays!\n\n",

    "content": "22 yr old female. I've been having mostly sharp chest pain on the right side of my sternum for a little over a week. It comes every time I eat, a few minutes after i start eating, but also at other random times throughout the day. The past few days, it's been there when I woke up as well. Occasionally, it will feel like a lot of pressure on my chest and I will have trouble breathing, but it's mostly just sharp pains in one spot. It lasts anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes at a time. I would appreciate any advice, thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi KristenNicole,  There are a few possibilities.  Your pain may be due to a condition called pleurisy.  Pleurisy is inflammation of the lining of the lungs and chest wall.  Typically, this pain is fairly precisely located and occurs in the same area (since the inflammation doesn't really move around).  It often is worsened by deep breathing.  Eating would not necessarily be expected to change this pain or make it worse.    The other possibility is reflux.  Eating often can make reflux much worse.  You may want to try using an antacid to see if this helps some.   If your pain doesn't improve or gets worse I would recommend you see your doctor for an evaluation.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi jjnlcarter4,  Thanks for writing in.  Your symptoms could be consistent with gallstones.  The gallbladder is located on the right side by your ribcage.  Sometimes the pain can radiate into the chest or back.  Nausea and belching can be a symptom of gallbladder disease.  Gallstones are very common in people who are overweight and female.  The attacks usually occur after eating a high fat meal.  If the pain continues I encourage you to have it checked out.  An ultrasound is usually done to check for stones, as well as lab work.  If a stone is passed by the pancreatic duct, this can cause pancreatitis.  Please keep me informed and good luck. Sandy RN\n\n",

I had x-rays done which did not show any fractures or breaks.  However, my sternum has been extremely swollen the entire time.  My doctor prescribed anti-inflammatories and said the musculature and ligaments had been traumatized and should heal.   After 5 weeks, although the pain has eased, my sternum is still swollen to the point that it looks like the size of an orange on my chest.   Is it normal that it should still be this swollen?   There has been no improvement in the swelling after 2-3 weeks of anti-inflammatories, and ice treatment.  If anything, the swelling has increased.   Thank you.\n\n",

It may also be that there was a fracture there that was not seen initially on x-rays.  Occasionally, fractures that do not move the bone any may not show up on the initial x-rays. They subsequently become visible as a bone callous forms for healing (which subsequently goes away after weeks or months).    Having your doctor reevaluate this will be sure that everything is still healing well.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 34 y/o female, that until this past month has been healthy.  I have a sharp pain in my upper breast (primarily left, but sometimes on the right), which extends under my armpit (this has been ongoing for the past 4 weeks).  Pain is felt upon touching the area and seems exacerbated by deep breathing.  Original diagnosis was pleurisy, but I'm uncertain this is accurate, based on pain to the touch.  Pain radiates to back clavicles.  Sometimes feels like a cold draft is in my breast.  I tested positive for Influenza last week (though I've been sick for 4 weeks).  2 chest x-rays have come back clean.  EKG and Echo are fine.  No pericardis.  I finished my first dose of Clomid at time pain started.  Quality of pain has changed over 4 weeks (started as sharp and shooting and has become more dull).  Ibuprofen does not work (only vicodin and I don't want to become addicted).  Surgeries: Leep/cone biopsy; C-Section (4 years ago).  Meds: Only IB (began fish oil and magnesium when this began).  Family history of coronary artery disease (I had calcium scoring done last year and I'm completely clean).  Thanks in advance for any help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello there,  Its good to hear that all your tests came back positive. Chest pain that increases on deep inspiration may be pleuritic, due to pericarditis or due to neuromuscular causes in the chest wall. This could be pain originating from a nerve in the chest wall (intercostal) or a muscle in the chest. It could also be bony pain from the ribs but most conditions affecting the ribs would have been caught on radiology.  Neuromuscular pain is characteristically tender and may also be positional (meaning it can be affected by a change in position).   Have you discussed this possibility with your doctor. Unfortunately, there usually isn't much to do for this type of pain except treat with analgesics, anti inflammatory drugs and wait until it resolves by itself. The change in character of the pain from sharp to dull may be an indication that its getting better.  Please keep us updated and I hope you are already feeling better!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello pokerman,  The chest pain you describe does have some of the characters of cardiac pain. Your smoking history does put you at risk. The sharp quality of the pain is not characteristic of ischemic pain. However, this is a very subjective issue. The fact that your pain is accompanied by shortness of breath on exertion and is relieved by rest is enough to warrant a thorough examination of your heart.  Regarding your pea like lump that would require an examination as there are many causes. The commonest cause as you mentioned would be a thrombosed hemorrhoid, it could also be a skin tag, or a wart.  Please refrain from smoking and visit your doctor immediately.\n\n",

I have since been to two doctors, the first thought it was the result of a viral infection and needed anti-biotics which did not work and another doctor then sent me for a chest x-ray. The x-ray came back fine. He has since advised me to go for an asthma test and CT scan of the chest/lungs. I have not been for these yet.   The pain seems to have affected my back now, and I am now finding it uncomfotatble to sit etc. Im fine when im standing up straight or laying down. My ribs however do kind of feel bruised alot but are not sore to touch. If I go for a run my breathing is not hampered in any way and my lungs/rib cage feel fine, however the following days I feel bruised underneath my rib cage and sometimes on my sternum.  Just after what steps I should possibly take, whether I have pulled a muscle in my back or possibly something more serious.  Thanks for your time  I am 24 years old, male, no past surgeries, and no family history. I am not on any current medication either.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there,  Chest pain is usually tricky especially if examination and investigations do not reveal anything. Generally speaking, chest pain that appears to be aggravated by deep inspiration is either pleuritic (due to inflammation of the pleura which is the layer that lines the inside of the chest wall and covers the lungs) or due to a neuromuscular problem in the chest wall. The chest wall is mainly made up of nerve, muscle, and ribs (bone). Neuromuscular chest pain can also be tender as well as positional (more in certain positions than in others).  If there's no fever, no shortness of breath, cough etc. I would say its very likely that it is neuromuscular. Obviously, this is something that only your doctor can decide by direct examination. If your doctor excludes anything serious, he may or may not decide that its safe to put you on analgesics until the inflammation subsides.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Robby85710,  From the description of the chest x-ray there are a few possibilities.  1st is that what is being seen (the vague density) is actually nothing.  This is common.  It may simply be a bad x-ray technique or some shadowing from something else.  It may also be some areas where the lung has collapsed a little, such as from the film being taken after one has held their breath for too long or during breathing out.  If anything, I would tend to agree that them most it would be is an early pneumonia.  A tumor or other more fixed/solid object would tend to be a more defined area on the x-ray.  This area was not seen on the side film, only on the frontal film.  It would be incredibly unlikely for a tumor to do this.  Actually, it would be really unlikely for anything real to show up only on the frontal x-ray and not on the side, including pneumonia.  If you are having the CT scan solely for this, I would recommend first repeating the chest x-ray to see if the issue has resolved.  If there are other reasons, the CT scan will give an excellent look at the lungs to see if there is anything, such as a pneumonia, actually there.  Regarding the question of infiltrate vs. density this is a common question.  By strict definition, infiltrate is a diagnosis that must be made under a microscope.  It refers to cells invading the area (inflitrating the area).  The proper term in radiology is opacification or haziness.  X-rays can only differentiate different shades of x-ray penetration.  There is no way to know that something is an infiltrate.  However, infiltrate is a very commonly used word in radiology often to indicate an infectious rather than some other process.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I had sudden symptoms which occurred yesterday morning. I awakened with severe chest pain, mostly centered over left side of chest and radiating into my jaw and neck. The night before these symptoms appeared I had some right-sided chest pain along my sternum. Chest pain worsens upon breathing in.  When I had the severe chest pains I took 81 mg baby aspirin just in case it was a heart attack.  I tried to lie back down again and found the pain worsened upon lying down. Basically the only comfortable position is sitting or sitting up slightly forward or standing and leaning over slightly.  I called 911 and was taken to the ED. Rule out diagnoses where done but no conclusions drawn. No pericarditis, no pulmonary embolism, no pneumothorax. In the ED I had a fast pulse, 78 (normally 60 while sitting up) and no fever. The ED doctor wasn't concerned over my pulse because he said it's normal to have a faster pulse in the ED. For me, it's not and 78 is high.  After getting back home I developed a fever, 100.6. Chest pain continues and sleeping is difficult due to pain upon lying down. My heart rate went up to 80's at home.  54, female, Hashimoto's, Hypertension (mostly controlled), Cholesectomy 1997, CAD ruled out 8/16/2007; Synthroid, Percocet for chest pain, Cytomel (T3), Triamterene/HCTZ, Vitamins.\n\n",

I have pericardits, pericardial effusion, mild myocarditis, and atrial fib. It's been over a month since I was first diagnosed and I am finally feeling a little better.  I found some excellent websites which helped me understand why it is difficult to diagnose pericarditis. There is no protocol for diagnosis or treatment in the US. There is in Europe. I am on the treatment protocol recommended by European Cardiologists.\n\n",

    "content": "1. 19 2. Female 3. No diagnoses 4. Recent c-section (7 months ago) 5. Mom and brother have slight asthma 6. No medications being taken besides b.c.  About two weeks ago I put my baby down for her nap.  I had been feeling completely fine.  I went back to sit down and as soon as i did i got a SHARP PAINFUL feeling in the right side of my chest that spread up to my right ear and across the left side of my chest.  It was short but EXTREMELY painful.  Right after that i got a taste in my mouth like i had to vomit.  (Just had a taste but never actually threw-up).  I had a hard time breathing for about and hour or two after.  Over the period of this past two weeks the symptoms have gotten worse.  The pain has started on both sides of my chest randomly; and have a VERY hard time breathing.  If the pain is on the right side of my chest then my right arm has a dull pain in it.  Same goes for the left side of my chest.  Also, i feel dizzy and faint.  Anything i do whether walking or holding a long conversation or anything involving getting my lungs pumping springs these symptoms on a lot quicker.  As of today there is a constant pain, and i haven't been breathing well at all, and my arm got a dull pain in it.  All i did was go for a walk and i didn't think i was going to make it home.  If anyone has any ideas please help me.  At the point I'm trying to get health insurance and i don't have the money for an E.R.  But the way it's looking i might be headed there soon if another \"attack\", so to say, happens.   Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi L0ostnwundrland,  There are a few possibilities.  This may all be a condition called pleurisy.  This is when the lining of the chest wall/lungs becomes inflamed.  It can cause severe pain and often is worse with deep breathing.   Another possibility is that you had/are having reflux episodes.  The stomach acid can burn and cause severe chest pain (sometimes mistaken for a heart attack).  If some happened to get into your lungs it can cause a chemical burn that can also make it hard to breathe.  If your symptoms are continuing you should see a doctor.  There may be a local clinic that can see patients on a free or reduced fee scale based on income/ability.  Your local health department can help find these clinics for you if you need.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,   The possibility that you have gastro-esophageal reflux disease should be addressed. If this is the case therapy in most cases is very simple. Long standing GERD can lead to complications.   When you say you have breastbone pain - was this due to a trauma? Did you have tenderness on touching or pressing the area?  NSAIDs (nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs) are common analgesics such as aspirin, ibuprofen etc. They can lead to gastritis.  The reason I am stressing on GERD as well as other GI conditions is that they are a known cause of chest pain. In addition your age and being female without any known risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) as well as your atypical presentation make CAD less likely but does not rule it out altogether.   You must be evaluated for the new pain you are experiencing and your doctor will be able to assess the need for further investigation.  Good luck and let us know if you need any further assistance.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Emrehan_01,  I would recommend you be tested for pertussis (whooping cough).  If it is pertussis you should be treated with azithromycin at the full 500mg per day for 5 days.  This is a little different than typical dosing for this medication.  Your doctor will likely know this but it can be overlooked.  There is no risk to your baby if you have whooping cough while you are pregnant.  The risk comes after delivery.  It would then be possible for the baby to catch whooping cough from you.  Whooping cough in newborns can be very dangerous.  Treatment of whooping cough does not change the course for the person infected.  The cough will still last  several months.  The other name for this disease is the 100 days cough.  Treatment does make it no longer contageous though.  Also, azithromycin is safe to take during pregnancy.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Recurring cough",
    "content": "I'm a 55 yo male and have had this problem since I was 18. It started one nite after breathing in a lot of second hand smoke at a restaraunt. A  post nasal drip cough started and ran for about 14 days. Nothing I took over the counter would help it and by the time it ended I was physically and emotionally exhausted.  Another exposure to cigaret smoke kicked it off again and as before, it ran for about 14 days. I would get this thing 2 or three times a year. It was always a clean cough and there was no fever, just a lot of lost sleep and a boost in sales for the makers of Contact, cough syrups and the like.  When I was 19 I had my tonsils removed as that was the diagnosed cause. I hope the doctor liked his new golf clubs.  I got the cough again within a few months. Through the years I would get it a couple or few times a year, sometimes set off by smoke, other times by something else. As I aged, my sensitivity to the cigaret smoke decreased.   When I lived in Tucson the spring bloom of everything that people dragged to the desert would set it off and as usual, it lasted for about 2 weeks. A doctor there gave me an injection of a cortizone and that stopped it immediately and I still worship his memory as it was the only thing that ever gave me instant relief. He said I could have the one injection a year without side effects.  While living in Georgia, I was able to get in and see a doctor while I actually had the thing and he did a throat culture and said it looked like a bronchial infection that was set off by something that I was allergic to.   I now live in the Pacific Northwest and have been getting this about once a year and have had all sorts of things prescribed including inhalers and nothing worked until I convinced my doctor to give me an anti-biotic and it went away within a few days. They thought I had some pneumonia but it was just the same old thing I'd had a hundred times before.  Now I have it again and the PA I saw at my HMO wouldn't give me an AB so I wasted more money on his prescribed cough suppressant and antihistamine so I guess I'll just suffer through until it goes away.  As an aside, my maternal grandfather developed emphysema from second hand smoke and died and I follow his geneology just about to the to the letter including his barrel chest.  I've been hospitalized twice in my life, for an appendectomy at age 5 and then the tonsilectomy at 19. There is no heart disease on my mother's side of the family. I currently take venlafaxine, 37.5 mgd.  I wish someone could tell me what this is and what causes it.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I am not a pulmonologist, however, it is perfectly normal to have cough due to many different causes in the course of a lifetime. I wouldn't try to tie them all down to one cause. However, it seems that the recurring cough that is triggered off by an exposure to certain substances is an allergic type of cough which could be a manifestation of a minor degree of asthma among other things. Allergies respond very well to steroids. In other situations a productive cough would signifiy bacterial infection, hence the response to antibiotics.  I would recommend you discuss your condition with a pulmonologist if this is a recurring concern.  Please keep us updated.\n\n",

Thank God, always clear, except for a lose weight once and a high blood pressure once. About a year back(Sept), I was taken to the ER at 4 in the morning when I awoke with a pain like I'd been shot in my right side back below my shoulder blade. i was finding it difficult taking a deep breath and as a result breathing was very shallow. At the hospital, they administered a pain killer and took an ECG, which was clear, BP was elevated. After spending a day there and going through quite a few blood tests, etc, needless to say, all clear, I was released. Soon after, I had a heavy cough that persisted for about a month. It was after this time, my chest discomfort/heaviness began and has persisted till this day. My breast bone and the area around are always tender and a heating pad relieves for a while. My breath is always labored and I feel I am not getting a full lung.  I have had always had a problem with gas, usually continuous belching/burping and i do feel that it does offer some relief. I have a sort of \"burning feeling\" in my throat almost constantly I feel like i'm walking around with a 10lb weight strapped to my chest and is affecting my life in many aspects I have visited my doc twice and except for my blood pressure which has always been genetically on the higher side, all has been clear, but this problem persists and i have come to no clear understanding.

This is generally picked up on a chest x-ray but may not be present early on.  You may need a repeat chest x-ray to see if it looks like this now.  Also, occasionally, asthma can present this way.  This can be treated with inhalers and it may be worth a trial of albuterol to see if this helps your symptoms.  Seeing a lung specialist may also be of some benefit.  Best wishes.\n\n",

My chest discomfort actually starts, strangely enough, at or around 7pm everyday. It is present but not so prominent during the day. Also, I had mentioned that I have a \"heavy breathing\" feeling in my throat.  What I have noticed that seems to offer temporary relief is a gas release (burp/belch), of which there seems to also be plenty! Could this be GERD? or similar? I feel like I have to also stretch my upper torso very regularly, looking, for a \"pop\" from around the breastbone/rib joint region. This provides me maximum relief. Somewhat like cracking one's fingers. This area sometimes does get quite tender and a NSAID and a heating pad helps greatly, so I was even thinking costochondritis.

    "content": "Hello I am a 29 year old female. I am not on any medications.  I have mild Scoliosis, lumbar Spondolisis, and PCOS.    I have always had a phlegmy cough.  As a baby they said it was croup.  As a child and teen years Dr's argued whether I had asthma, bronchitis, or neither.  The Dr's always say my lungs sound fine and x-rays come out fine.  I always have this cough.  It does not get better or worse during any part of the day.  It always the same. I have a hard time coughing it up because I cant get it high enough.  So Im usually have this gross cough or sound like I\u2019m clearing my throat all the time.  Sometimes I'll go into a coughing fit and finally throw up alot of phlegm, sometime with streaks of blood.  Then I\u2019m better for a few hours, maybe.  When I was younger the Dr's tried inhalers, rescue and steroid.  This didn\u2019t change anything.  I\u2019ve tried Allergy meds.  This hasn\u2019t changed anything.  Am I doomed to have this disgusting cough my whole life?  What is wrong with me?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Mplovesap,  A sometimes overlooked cause of a chronic cough is gastroesophageal reflux.  Occasionally a chronic cough is the only symptom and there is no classic burning pain of esophageal irritation.  You may want to talk with your doctor about trying a reflux medicine for a little while to see if it helps.  If it does not I would recommend you see a pulmonologist for further evaluation.  You may need a bronchoscopy (where they use a small camera to look at your airways) to help figure this out.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I am 22 yrs old male and my chest slightly comes out around nipple area like breasts.  I hav had this for years - probaly since i was 13/14.  I have had it checked from doctor and they say its not harmful.  One can get it removed through cosmetic surgery.    However, on the social side it is very embarassing to have this problem and I was wondering if there are ways of reducing the tissues around the nipples through natural methods as i really don't want  surgery.  Also, it may be useful to know that I am 6'1\" and am 11 stone, hence I am not obese.  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I have 25 years old, female, and for a month I have a dry cough, with sharp (not constant and not coughing or breathing related) chest and back pain. First I started only coughing a little bit, and three weeks ago I started feeling pain under my shoulder-blade on the left. Progressively, this pain extend to under my ribs and my arm also on my left.  Of course, since I got scared, two weeks after my symptoms appeared I went to see a doctor. He first thought I had a pharyngitis, and gave me some antibiotics. The therapy had no effect and my symptoms persisted. After that, I have done all kind of analysis - lung x-ray and CT, blood test, and they all came normal. Moreover, the doctor didn't hear any wheezing in my breathing.  The doctors don't know anymore what could be causing my symptoms, so please tell me what else I should check because I am becoming desperate. Could this maybe be caused by a heart or kidney problem?  Just to mention, I was a smoker until six month ago and I have a history of lung problems - bronchitis and pneumonia. Moreover, on my mother's side, my grandfather died of lung cancer and my grandmother was had asthma.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Dreamy2103,  I have a couple of thoughts.  First, often this type of cough is caused by silent reflux.  It may be that you have gastroesophageal reflux that is not causing the classic heart burn type pain but is irritating your trachea enough to make you cough.  It may be worth trying a reflux controller medicine, such as pepcid or zantac.  Your pain may be caused by sore muscles from coughing.  Pleurisy is possible although this typically is worse pain with deep breathing.  You may also want to see a pulmonologist (lung specialist).  They can do some more specialized lung function testing to see if you have a condition such as an asthma variant such as cough variant asthma.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Can't Breath While Leaning Forward",
    "content": "My name is Mary and I am a 33F. I was struck by an SUV while walking about 30 months ago. The back of the SUV hit me in the front, upper torso while I tried to protect myself with my hands. First symptoms were sore ribs, bump on back of head. X-ray came back ok. Chiro treatements not effective. Orthopedist who saw me for 10 seconds sent me to physical therapy. PT noted poor posture, shoulders raised, possible right rotator cuff injury. Popping sound and immobility in right shoulder, especially lifting right are straight over head. Left and right trapezius are excruciatingly sore. Slightly hardened muscle tissue in right side of neck and throat area.  Breathing problems arose and this is why I am posting in this category.  I saw a general MD to test lungs and heart. Lungs clear and heart good.  Went back to orthopedist for 5 second visit. Provided sonogram of shoulder. Still waiting for result.  Current symptoms causing me most alarm: pressure while breathing, difficulty breathing, shallow breath while leaning forward, standing, sitting upright, rotating shoulders forward and laying on side. Cardio activity fine. Breath normal while reclining or laying flat. Pain in neck and throat, right side. Trapezius muscles, muscles separating shoulder from spine, rotator cuff, all areas around clavicle, sternum, and between upper center ribs on both sides are all sore.  New lump - bone cartilege between the ribs that are three inches north of belly button and slightly to right, possibly dislocated? Maybe the xyphoid process? Would appear to be the xyphoid process if it was always there, was never poking out so profusely, nor was it favoring the right side. The bone-cartilege area was an inch in diameter, connects center upper ribs near diaphragm, is tender to touch, possibly swollen and all ribs connected to it are blindingly sore. Maybe the diaphragm?  Otherwise in good health, heart, lungs, blood pressure, no cough (although sometimes I have to clear my throat). I had an AVM removed successfully 5 years ago. Doubt it has any relevance but i do have titanium in the right rear skull if it matters.   God bless you if you have any clue what is wrong with me. My deep breaths hurt somewhere in upper chest throat while leaning forward and it is scaring the heck out of me. I have seen a neurologist, internist, chiro, orthopedist, PT, had x-rays and have been sent home with no help yet.   Thank you so much for reading and any guidance\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Marytmary,  Your description of the pain while breathing only in some positions makes me think that the issue is not with the lungs, as your general doctor has suggested.  I suspect that what is happening is that when you lean forward you are putting more pressure on an area (be it a muscle, bone fracture or other problem related to the trauma) that is painful.  When you breath in these positions it is likely causing these areas to either move more or be pressed on more causing the pain.  You may need to have some further imaging studies such as an MRI of the chest and neck to see if there is any ongoing muscle or bone problems.  A CT scan may suffice also.  I would recommend you continue to follow up with your doctor and orthopedist regarding this.   If you feel that issues are being missed it is always reasonable to seek a second opinion.  Most physicians would not be offended by this as it is often helpful to have a fresh, outside evaluation of the issues to identify new ideas.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Sometimes the end of the sternum pokes out a bit, making a hard, bony lump noticeable, especially when lying on your back.  If this is the case, it has nothing to do with your exercise activities.  I am assuming it is not painful.  If you need to know for sure, you should have it examined at your next appointment with your doctor, along with having your cholesterol checked, etc.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Blewi, l am glad you decided to quit smoking even after so many years!  It will take a long time, up to many years, smoke-free before you will realize the wisdom of your decision.  The build up of pollutants in your lung tissue will go away slowly, and sometimes the damage is not easily reversed, or not reversable at all.  Our lungs are complex organs and are highly responsible for the exchange of oxygen in our tissues.  When they are compromised by tar, nicotine, and the damage that inhaling smoke can do, they respond by causing you pain.  Pain is a sentinel, it tells you something is wrong. The best response to pain is to explore the origin of the pain. The best one to explore this is your primary physician. There are several basic tests, including a chest Xray, EKG, and blood work, that will give your primary care provider a better picture of your lung health.  If you are experiencing pain that does not go away on its own, and you are sure is not a result of muscle strain due to heavy lifting, it may be prudent to get these tests done.  The headaches could be caused from dissociated issues - such as sleeplessness, or caffeine withdrawal, or may be stress related - especially with you having just recently quit smoking!\n\n",

I could only breathe in a very shallow way, anything else would cause very sharp stabbing pains in the lower portion of my rib cage, and across my chest. coughing or movement made it worse. generally sitting up i was ok, if i maintained shallow breath, but this made me cough, including bright blood. It was almost impossible to lay down so I didn't sleep for a few days. I had no other symptoms other than I got very feint and dizzy if I stood up too fast. Upright, the pain was more in my shoulder, laying down; in my chest. This lasted for about 3 days and nights, I didn't visit a doctor, just rested at home as I didn't feel ill at all, and didn't want to sit in A&E unless it got more serious.  I have had 2 prolapsed discs in the past causing sciatica, but that was on my right and altogether different, with no chest pain or shortness of breath. I'm guessing this was a trapped nerve too (hence not seeing a doctor) as I had no fever or other symptoms. I am curious to know what this may have been caused by, and whether I should go to the hospital. No other history of this kind of thing from me or my family.  ta\n\n",

Basically this is driving me absolutely insane.. When I am active or working out I don't I feel a thing.. but when I rest it is extremely annoying. I go to bed and wake up with this akward feeling.

    "content": "I am a 57 year old female.  For the past 2-3 weeks, I have experienced severe pain in the chest and left arm around 10-11 am each morning.  The pain lasts for at least 30 minutes, and is relieved only by sitting or laying down.  If I do not rest, the pain continues and becomes more severe. I have no history of heart disease or gastroenterologic problems. I presently take Allegra for allergies, Lipitor for cholesterol, Arthrotec for osteoarthritis, and Evista. I had hoped that the problem was temporary, but it does not seem to be improving.  Does anyone have thoughts regarding the possible cause and resolution of this problem?\n\n",

    "title": "Persistent Tightness/Pains in Chest for Over 5 Weeks",
    "content": "I'm a 22 year old male, and quit smoking 6 weeks ago. I smoked at least a pack a day for about 5 years. However between the ages of 14 and 18 I also smoked alot of pot and think that this may have had an effect on my lungs.  I have had acute bronchitis twice and have been hospitalised once with pnuemonia over the last four years, which is why I have finally decided and managed to quit. Apart from these respiratory problems in the past and my present problems I am healthy, I had a blood test 4 weeks ago and the only abnormality was raised levels of ALT (95) and Albumin (55) in the liver function test.  For the last 5 weeks (it began a week after I quit smoking) I have had a persistent tightness and feeling of discomfort in my chest, I just feel like I can't fill my lungs to full capacity and take a slow deep breath. It feels tight in my upper chest and it also feels like I hit a kind of wall in my lungs when I try and breathe deeply. The discomfort is most pronounced in the left side of my chest. I also get pains that come and go, some days I will experience little pain and other days the pain will be present almost all the time. These include aches down the left side of the chest, sharp and or dull pain in the middle of the chest, and or a tingling painful sensation in the middle of my chest. The pain will last for anywhere from 5 minutes to half an hour at a time, if I sit or lay down it becomes more managable. The tightness and discomfort in my chest is constant and I have had no relief from these symptoms for over 5 weeks now.. I also have a persistent productive cough bringing up white phlem and grey phlemp occasionally (tar I think).. I am also having heart palpitations every day or so. Cold air and physical exercise, even walking and lifting, seem to worsen my symptoms.  I have had a chest x-ray and this came back clear. I have had a spiro test and my lungs can hold 6 litres. My doctor has eliminated asthma as a cause, and has found no problems in a blood test covering LFT, Renal function, Electrolytes, Glucose Random, FBC and ESR (I don't know what most of this means by the way). When I first saw him he thought it was a chest infection and prescribed me Moxiclav Duo Forte 875/125, after a week this had no effect so then he gave me Prexige Lumiracoxib, thinking that it could be due to muscle strain in the chest area. This also has not helped. I am now taking Roxithromycin to see if this will have any effect but I am not optimistic as I don't think I have an infection. My doctor did suggest it may be anxiety (I do get mild panic attacks from time to time, and self manage this), but I honestly don't feel that stressed at the moment, and the tightness and discomfort is constant, not being brought on by a panic attack. If anything I feel that the discomfort is causing me some anxiety (as I am prone to it), but my symptoms feel so physical and persistent, and I honestly feel good mentally apart from this, that I find it hard to beleive it is anxiety. I also do alot of walking normally so I am not deconditioned. My doctor has also suggested it may be a virus of some sort?  There is no history of heart disease in my family that I am aware of, however there is prostate cancer and cholesterol problems on my fathers side, and severe mental health issues on both sides of the family. I suffer from mild depression and anxiety from time to time but it is not disabling and not severe.  It has been 5 weeks and I am starting to feel like they will never be able to work out what it is. I'm going to a respiratory specialist in 2 weeks so hopefully he can help. Also my doctor said it isn't my heart, but from the tests he has conducted can he really rule that out as a possibility? I was not going to university or work as a result of my symptoms.. I am now back at university, doing what I can from home, but still feel definitely unfit for being on my feet for 8 hrs at work. My condition has overall not really improved since I woke up with my symptoms 5 weeks ago. Sorry this is such a long post, I just want to provide as much information as i can in the hope you may have an idea of what is causing my troubles.\n\n",

However, it may be a good idea for you to have a CT scan of your chest to evaluate the lung tissue a little better.  One would think your spirometry numbers would be abnormal if you had a restrictive lung tissue disease; however, I'm not sure if this is always the case.  Following up with your pulmonologist is important.   I hope you are able to find some answers soon.  Keep us updated if you don't mind.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for the reply Dr. Chan. The specialist told me that my lungs are in great shape, so I'm going to have to start beleiving what they say even though I feel terrible. He thinks I'm having post-nasal drip that is irritating my vocal chords and causing them to swell up and spasm so I can't breathe properly. He also thinks I have developed Chronic Hyperventilation becasue of this. I didn't realise that hyperventilation could cause so many symptoms including my chest pains and distressing chest tightness. I have nasal sprays to clear the sinuses and relaxation breathing exercises to do to hopefully get me breathing normally again and rid me of the chest pain and tightness etc. Am also being tested in case I am allergic to our cat, as he thinks this could also be a factor. I have a follow up appointment in 5 weeks, if my symptoms are still there then I suppose it will be time to look at psychological and other possible causes.  If anyone else is reading this post and having similar unexplained long-term symptoms, have a look into Chronic Hyperventilation Syndrome, it might be the cause of your troubles, or at least a factor, and it is apparently highly underdiagnosed.  Cheers\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Clmspartan,  This number of upper respiratory infections is still in the range of \"normal\" infections so I doubt that you have an underlying immune problem making you more susceptible.  If, however, you begin to get many (> 10) infections or they are particularly severe/prolonged it may be a good idea to do some simple screening tests to look for an immune problem setting you up for these infections.  There really isn't a medicine to help prevent these infections.  The best thing to do is try to keep your body healthy by eating well, getting plenty of sleep, and exercising.  Good hand washing habits will also help prevent exposures.  You may want to consider taking a multivitamin to help make sure your immune system has all the vitamins/minerals it needs to be at its peak.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I am  a 24 year old male.  I have been experiancing chest pain, palpiltations, light headedness accompanied with weakness in jaws, and sometimes pain in my left arm.  I have gone to the ER several times thinking that something was horribly wrong.  I have had chest x rays, stress test, 24 hour heart monitor, EKG, echocariogram, and catscan.  The doctors all say that everything seems very healthy and this could be anxiety.  I have been drinking heavily since I was 18... typical college behavior I assume. I am not a smoker.  For less than a year I had a minor fling with cocaine.  The last time I did cocaine was in Febuary 07.  I don't believe I have done much of the drug... at least compared to other people.  However this problem of mine first occured while using cocaine.  It was much much more intense at this time.  Since I have stopped the drug I still get daily chest pain, rarely palpiltations, akward heart beats,  and sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and my whole body feels numb.  My symptoms will sometimes go away for a week or so.  My symptoms hardly ever occur during activity.  I have greatly reduced my alcohol consumption.  I used to drink up to 5 times a week, during football season I would sometimes drink over twenty beers in a day.  Now I only drink about once every two weeks or so.       After I drink I will seem fine for about a day sometimes two... but then the symptoms will come back strong and slowly fade away in a period of 1 - 3 weeks.  I never feel any symptoms at the time of alcohol consumption.     I have a hard time convincing myself that this is anxiety for the following reasons...  1.  I have never really stressed about anything, I actually think that stress is something that I lack  2.   All my symptoms started from what seemed to be a cocaine related incident  3.    Symptoms are intensified by alcohol.     Any suggestions to what my problem may be and how i can cure it would be greatly appreciated.  I hate losing sleep and walking around everyday in constant pain.  I am a good kid with high ambitions and I really feel like my bad decisions may have injured me.  thanks so so much!!\n\n",

There are also some prescription medications that can help even more by getting to the root of the problem, rather than treating symptoms after the fact.    The fact that the pain stops as soon as you stop eating makes me wonder if this is the diagnosis, however.  Typically this problem persists after you stop eating.  It is associated with eating and this is a good reason to eat small, rather than large, meals and to not eat soon before retiring.  You want gravity to help keep the stomach acids down.    Take note if there are any foods that especially aggravate this condition so you can stay away from those.  A visit to your doctor is in order if the simple measures here don't help.\n\n",

    "content": "Age: 25  Sex: M   I have had a dry cough for about 7 months that started with a tight feeling in my chest I felt it might be a virus. I went to see my allergist see preformed some tests. And determined that I have year round allergies. She also had me due a Spirometry test including testing the effect of inhaled steroids, results normal. See prescribed Singulair so I tried that, my cough did not seem to get better immediately but over time it seem to be less of a problem. My general doctor had my due a chest x-ray that came back normal. She ordered me a Z pack that had no effect.   I had little cough or tightness in my chest for at least 4 months, but the Singulair I was using I felt might be making my breathing feel funny and most likely was killing my liver. I stop using the Singulair and the cough is back. But I am not convinced that stopping the drugs is the reason. The cough cam back about 3 days after stopping Singulair.   I considered acid reflux as a possible cause because my research indicated you could have acid reflux without heartburn. I really don\u2019t have any of the symptoms of acid reflux but I still tried over the counter drugs for a few weeks and they had no effect. I tried cough suppressants no effect. I also considered postnasal drip and have tied over the counter drugs. No effect. I didn\u2019t expect much effect considering my nasal passages feel open and clear.   I do not want to mask my symptoms with drugs I would like to find the cause and try life style adjustments first, and most importantly know what its is I am treating.     What could be causing this cough?   What should be my next step?   Treatments without drugs are great?   Please any suggestions are great thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Jeremyjar, The fact that you mentioned \"my allergist\" leads me to believe you have had ongoing problems with either breathing difficulties or dermatological reactions to certain substances.  The verification that you have \"year-round allergies\" cements the notion that you have the physical disposition to react to external stimuli with either a respiratory or a dermatological symptom.  What kind of environment do you work or live in?  Do you smoke or are you around smokers?  Ambient smoke, or allergens can certainly trigger the body's mechanism of defense - a desire to cough up the irritant to protect the individual.  A stuffy nose is not always the body's reaction to an unwanted substance. Are you on any other prescribed medications for any other clinical issue?  Some medications have a known side effect for some people of a \"tickle\" cough. If any of the above scenarios are possible, you may wish to ask either your allergist or your primary physician for a different type of allergy control medication. Not all meds work equally well for all people .Sometimes the doctors have to try you on something and see if it works, and switch it if it is not effective, or has other unwanted side effects.\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for your help and quick response  I did contact the nurse at my allergy clinic way back about switching drugs and she was not helpful. She refused to talk to the doctor about switching drugs sighting the doctor wanted me to use Singulair and to help with my breathing.   I have in the past tried other allergy drugs such as Allegra; Claritin, nose sprays seem to cause bleeding. Now that I have been Singulair for a week I feel it may have been helping some with the tightness in my chest and cough. But still not sure. The Singulair was causing my throat feel funny, but only after sleeping not really so much as a breathing problem. Maybe I should stat using it again.  I live in sub tropical warm and humid climate and my home and work are climate-controlled environment and free of smoker or smokers. I am non-smoker and have never smoked. Have used no other dugs other than Singulair   What other drugs could I try?  What is a dermatological symptom?  Might the tightness in my chest and possibly the cough some type of heart problem? Or would the chest x-ray I had done ruled that out?   If its respiratory in nature would are some things I could do to help?    Thanks once again greatly for your help jeremyjar\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Jeremyjar, Excellent questions! I will tackle the easy one first.  A dermatological response to an allergen might be hives, or rash, redness, itchiness, or swelling.    No, a chest xray will not be sufficient to detect cardiac problems, more appropriate tests would be an EKG, Echodoppler ( or Echocardiogram), or in certain circumstances, TEE or transesophageal echocardiogram.  And yes, sometimes a heart condition can cause a cough.   Singulair belongs to a class of drugs which inhibit leukotrienes - part of a allergy response by the body.  It works best when taken routinely and faithfully.  It does not work well as a rescue drug.  Some of the other meds you mentioned trying also help against a histaminic response, but your original post stated that you do not have nasal stuffiness, which some of the other meds are useful for.  This may explain why you did not find them tremendously helpful. The manufacturer of Singulair is Merck Pharmaceutical.  As a company, they are available to answer questions about their products.  You may wish to contact them to see what they can tell you about the use of Singulair for you.  Congratulations on being a non-smoker!\n\n",

    "content": "First a little reassurance.  Given that you can cause the pain by pushing on your ribs there is essentially no chance this is from the heart.  Most likely you have a condition called costochondritis.  This is when the cartilage of the ribs becomes inflamed.  It often can produce quite severe pain.  Movement can make it worse because the ribs move.  Pressing on the area reproduces the pain.  Treatment is with non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (such as ibuprofen).  If these do not help or if the pain worsens or doesn't get better you should see your doctor for an evaluation.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "constant chest pains, tightness, dizziness and more.",
    "content": "Hi.  Thanks so much for this site and for being here.  I'm having some difficulty focusing so please bear with me.  I am a 21 year old female and for the past several months I've been having daily chest tightness and pains that often last for hours at a time. Pains also come into my back, jaw, shoulder blades, rib area and oddly enough, into my right collar bone as well.    Occasionally the pains are more pronounced when I breath in. I've these symptoms regardless of whether I'm resting or exercising... but consuming certain foods, caffeine and some alcohol definitely aggravates them much more.  I've eliminated most of those out of my diet but these symptoms still persist, just not as harshly.  I am 5'3 1/2 and 116lbs.   I exercise regularly and try to eat fairly healthy. I've been experiencing panic attacks that usually come on when I feel like I'm about to faint, or like I'm becoming disorientated, or I feel flutters in my chest, like bubbles - maybe palpitations?  I went to the ER a few months ago thinking I was going to die and they performed a chest x-ray & ECG, which they said they saw nothing abnormal. My oxygen levels & blood pressure were noted as being good.  I followed up with a doctor and because I have no insurance and at this point in time cannot get on any insurance they decided to see if nexium would help without running tests, thinking perhaps it's my esophagus contracting.  I took it for a week with little improvement but rather some pretty bad stomach pains and cramps. I stopped taking 'em, the stomach pains eventually ceased and I then went back to the clinic .I was prescribed a cheaper brand at 20mg, but upon taking them again the stomach pains returned.  So, I've stopped taking them again but now I actually do have heartburn from eating just about anything.    I had a test run for my thyroid and for the h pylori virus a couple of weeks ago - I don't know those results yet, I'm assuming they're good since they didn't call me but I will be calling them when they're open again to find out for sure.  I'm just so tired of not knowing what this is and not having the money to check farther into it. I don't know what to do.  I'm tired of living in dread, wondering if I'm dying or not...\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Lilium, The various symptoms you express are certainly of great concern to you.  At the same time, I detect that your current ability to cope with additional stressors in your life is very poor.  While I absolutely agree with your search for the underlying cause of your pain and indigestion, I suggest you consider seeking professional support for your panic attacks.  Whether the pain and gastric disturbances are clinically based or not, the pain and irritations are certainly heightened by your current inability to cope.  I don't know where you live, but I do know that most towns/cities in the US have mental health clinics that will work with you on a sliding scale basis. If your life happens to be filled with stressors normally, the concerns about your health are certainly negative contributors at this time.  Please consider obtaining consultation with a psychiatrist or psychologist, as you are seeking medical input to your symptoms.\n\n",

    "title": "21 yr. old female w/ chest pain",
    "content": "Like the subject says, I'm a 21 year old female who has been having some serious symptoms for almost two years that I feel like doctors are not taking seriously.  I will try to make this as short and to the point as possible:  January 2004: As I would drift off to sleep at night, I would begin to develop this panic feeling and I would have dizziness, chest discomfort, and an ache or tingle in my left arm/hand.  I would lose all energy.  I had none of these symptoms in the daytime or during activity or exercise.  I did suffer from migraines more than usual when these spells would occur. (I usually have a migraine every few months, during these night spells I would have migraines anywhere from 3 times a week to every day.)  Over the spring 2004 I was given an EKG, CAT Scan, and several blood tests.  Everything came back normal, and after trying several medications that made me feel like I was having a heart attack, I was prescribed Atenolol (25mg).  The doctor felt I had high blood pressure, but I don't think my pressure is high enough to need medicating.  (At the doctor's office it is high because I have such a hospital phobia, my anxiety is through the roof!  When I check it regularly at home however it ranges from 115-130/78-89.)  So I've been on Atenolol from April 2004 to now and these symptoms went away for the most part.  My migraines were less often as well.  Then last Sunday I got up in the middle of the night convinced that I was dying or something.  I had chest discomfort, the tingly ache in the arm, nausea, and dizziness so bad that I could barely hear my own thoughts.  I was scared to move.  When I finally made it to my friend's room, she said that my heart was beating very fast, then it got normal, but anytime I made a sudden movement it would speed up again.  I sat up for 3-4 hours like this.    I took my Atenelol the next morning, and I felt a sharp pain in my chest and I felt weak the rest of the day.  I was convinved it was the medicine, so I took half of a pill on the next day.  I went to the ER, was basically patted on the back and told I need to wean myself off the Atenelol and that I was too young to have heart trouble.    So...I still felt a little off the rest of the week and then felt better over the weekend, when suddenly last night I had the same attack I had a week ago only even worse.  I was *this* close to calling 911.  It eventually eased off after staying up for 3 hours. Yesterday I also didn't take my medication - today was the last day I would be taking it.  I ended up taking it at 1 in the morning and that helped the pain a bit.   I can't get an appointment with a doctor until Oct 11. I've seen 3-4 doctors about this and everyone says they can't find anything.  I'm scared out of my mind - to be young and having symptoms like a heart attack or stroke is terrifying, which probably makes me feel physically even worse.  What could be going on, and why does it occur mostly at night when I try to go to sleep?  I feel like my spirit is leaving my body when this happens.  I can't think clearly either.  It was followed by a headache.  I'm scared to go to bed at night.   I am about 50 pounds overweight but have totally changed my diet as of late 2003 and do exercise a few times a week - I am having tons of trouble losing weight no matter what I do but that may be related to my Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, according to my gyno - who I do have an appointment with tomorrow.  I'm hoping she can get me to a doctor sooner than the Oct 11.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear LexiA,  Cardiac causes, should be excluded in any case of chest pain especially if the pain is similar to that caused by cardiac ischemia. Some other cardiac causes like Mitral Valve prolapse give pain that may be similar to that of ischemic heart disease and is usually associated with palpitation.These conditions should be investigated by ECG, stress ECG, Echocradiography and cardiac catheter if needed.   I would also suggest that these symptoms could represent Panic attacks. The symptoms of a panic attack appear suddenly, without any apparent cause. They may include  Racing or pounding heartbeat  Chest pains  Dizziness, lightheadedness, nausea  Difficulty breathing  Tingling or numbness in the hands  Flushes or chills  Dreamlike sensations or perceptual distortions  Terror--a sense that something unimaginably horrible is about to occur and one is powerless to prevent it  Fear of losing control and doing something embarrassing  Fear of dying  Flushed Face and Chest  A panic attack typically lasts for several minutes and is one of the most distressing conditions that a person can experience.

I think it all started with a cold or flu a couple of months ago. I have NOT experienced other cold or flu like symptoms for quite some time now other than a stuffy nose which could also be related to the dry climate or allergies.

You state you note mildly swollen lymph nodes. 3. The mucus is yellow. 4.  The mucus contains brown specs. You could be fighting an infection, but it would take a doctor to diagnose and then prescribe the right antibiotics. I am particularly concerned about the brown specs. This could be old blood. You may wish to visit the local ER where they would do tests that might include a chest xray, and check your breathing status as well.  Sometimes waiting to see if something will clear on its own can lead to further complications.  I think it would be in your best interest to have a doctor evaluate your symptoms, and not to wait til the end of the month.\n\n",

I am posting because lately I get a tight and/or heavy feeling in my chest everyday. It comes and goes and sometimes I have found that movement can trigger it as well. I have it somewhat right now actually. I am sure it is probably digestive and I have had digestive issues for a long time,mainly in the form of chronic constipation. But I haven't been getting this chronic tight feeling for a long time. I had diarrhea on and off since the 19th of last month too. That is when it started that is and there were times including once just last week that I got it again after the 19th. Based on my symptoms,does this sound like chronic indigestion or maybe reflux? If so,what would you recommend for getting rid of it so it stops coming back?  I did see a doctor on Monday of this week. I didn't like him a lot though. I mentioned the indigestion and he just told me to take tums or pepcid. I take tums all the time. He listened to my heart but didn't tell me anything was wrong. I just need to get rid of this feeling so it doesn't come back. Thank you.  Michelel\n\n",

    "content": "Reflux is a possibility.  If it were, I would expect the Tums to help at least a little.  You may want to try an acid blocker such as one of the over-the-counter medications to see if this helps more.  You can ask your local pharmacist which ones they carry.  An H2-blocker is what you want.  If this is not helping I would be suspicious that there is something else going on rather than or in addition to reflux.  It may be that you have a bit of pleurisy.  Pleurisy is when the lining of the lungs gets inflamed and can cause significant pain.  Usually it is worse with deep breathing.  Also you may be having some mild asthma issues.  This can be worsened by reflux.  If your pain continues I would recommend you follow up with your doctor again.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  Thanks for responding. I actually don't have asthma though. Maybe it is reflux,I don't know. My main concern at the moment actually though is that my heart beats too fast sometimes,lately everyday at some point. I usually feel fine during it other than being concerned of course. Last night I was driving home from the store and I started feeling this weird feeling in my throat and my heart started pounding. And I felt different in my chest,like something may go wrong with my heart. I had to stop before I could continue driving home. My Husband thinks it is sleep deprivation and/or not taking care of myself as he says{not exercising and he thinks I need to eat better,though I could eat much worse than I do.} I know my blood pressure has always been good at least and I don't smoke and I'm not overweight,not that you have to be I know. I'm only 27 too,but heart disease runs in my Dad's family. I was sleep deprived yesterday but not THAT sleep deprived. I don't know. If you need more info,please let me know,but based on what I've told you,what is your opinion? Thanks.  Michelle\n\n",

If it speeds up like a light switch is turned on and stop suddenly you may have a heart rhythm known as SVT (supraventricular tachycardia).  This heart rhythm can give feelings of a tight chest as you describe.  You may want to talk to your doctor about checking your heart rhythms to see if there is anything suspicious.

Over the past month i have been getting a TIGHTING & numbing of my left arm during my time of retiring for the night. It happens about a hour or so into my resting. I cannot get a DEEP sleep started at all. Then i will raise up & sit on the edge of the bed & feel somewhat relief. I am so so tired during the day do to this. I had been on ATIVAN due to ANIXTY & taking it in the morning.. But now i HAVE to reach for it at night due to this chest trouble.. After i take it in about a 45 min span i feel a BIG difference in pressure & am in fact able to close my eyes and grab whatever sleep i can. It does not happen during my excersie or swimming. I just wnat to throw this at ya as i may be way off but since i really ONLY feal it at it's STRONGEST & most uncomfertable time during lying down & ready for sleep could it have anything to do with my stomach or something along that line.? Again i say this only due to it being at it's MAX during my lying down.. Any info would be DEEPLY DEEPLY apperictaed as i TRUELLY am EXTREAMLY scared.... Thank You.'\n\n",

    "content": "Dear MELISSA555, Based on the information you presented in your post I tend to agree that it is very possible that your chest pain is related to your GI  (Gastrointestinal) system.  GERD (GastroEsophageal Reflux Disease) very often causes chest pain that leads the sufferer to wonder if he has a heart problem.  Since this seems to occur only at night when you are lying down, it is possible that stomach acids can irritate the distal part of your esophagus (food \"pipe\") and cause great pain under your sternum (breast bone).  Have you tried taking any antacids?  There are many type now available OTC (over the counter) such as Pepcid (famotidine), Zantac (ranitidine), Mylanta, Tums, etc.  It might help you to ask your pharmacist what he/she would recommend.  If you have a primary care physician, it would also be a good idea to talk about your concern with him/her.  If all else fails, or you do not have a primary care doctor - the local urgent care center or emergency room may be able to assist you.\n\n",

If left untreated, it can lead to Gastroesophagitis (a very painful inflammation of this area which lies just under your breast bone or sternum).  GERDs is actually fairly common and treated frequently with such known products as Zantac, Pepcid, Prilosec, Nexium, Protonix and others.  Long term states of untreated can potentially lead to esophageal erosion which would require a long healing process.  I recommend you seek advice and appropriate medication from your primary physician.\n\n",

It typically can produce very sharp pain that is worse with deep breathing.  Costochondritis is also possible.  This is inflammation of the rib where it becomes cartilage instead of bone.  This is characterized by pain that is reproduced by pushing on the affected rib.    Both are generally quite responsive to non steroidal anti-inflammatory medications.  If the pain persists I would recommend that you see your doctor.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I hope I'm posting this in the right area. I'd really appreciate any advice that can be given.   About 5 months ago I started to notice a strange pain in the right side of my chest. It was roughly under the lowest rib. The pain is hard to describe, it feels like a raw pain, not intense, but noticeable. Over time the pain has become more apparent and is the constantly. Further to this, I know have a sharper pain to the left of my chest, approximately under my second rib and similar pain just below my sternum. Frequently I also have sharp stinging pains in both sides just above the waste. This pain lasts for a few hours at a time and is accompanied by sensitivity in the skin in the area of the pain. Occasionally I can also feel a dull pain in my back, on the right hand side, just below the ribs.   I have had the symptoms of IBS for over a year now, but this seems to be separate, having no affect on the chest pains. Other than this, I don't seem to have any other symptoms. I feel reasonably healthy, don't feel fatigued and have no cough or anything similar.   I have moved around between a few cities recently, so trying to see doctors has been a bit awkward. The initial doctor a saw a few months ago thought that it may be stomach related and prescribed me with proton pump inhibitors. These did seem to ease my IBS symptoms, but had no affect on the chest pain. I saw a second doctor a month later and she thought that it may be chondritis and suggested taking Ibuprofen, but this had no affect. I saw a third doctor in a different city. He sent me for a frontal chest x-ray, which came back clear. I have since moved again and have arranged an appointment with a new doctor, but unfortunately the earliest I can see him is in 2 weeks.   The reason I am posting here is because I am going on a 5 day adventure sports course next week which is is a compulsory part of my recently started PhD. I'm really looking forward to the trip, but am a bit concerned that I may be putting myself at risk. Stretching and moderate exercise does aggravate the pain slightly, but not to any great extent. It just becomes a bit more apparent, but never intensely painful.   So, I apologise that I have rambled on here at the risk of sounding like a hypochondriac (I'm not). As I said, any advice would be very much welcomed. Perhaps I am just looking for peace of mind.   Thankyou in advance,   Andy :)\n\n",

Since they have not gotten better with appropriate treatments, I would suspect the possibility of some ongoing muscle inflammation or irritation.  Another possibility would be pleurisy (inflammation of the lining of the lungs) although this would normally respond to ibuprofen that was used for costochondritis.  You may want to consider seeing a physical therapist to see if some stretching excercises specifically targeted at the painful areas may help alleviate your pain.  Follow up with your doctor is also important.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Mild pressure in chest but no trouble breathing, walking, climbing stairs, exercising, etc.  EKG was normal and my doctor prescribed Nexium.  Have been taking it for 5 days and symptoms may be somewhat better but still there.  As much as I trust my primary physician, I do not believe that GERD is the problem, so I am trying to think of other symptoms that may be related?  For several months, I occasionally wake up with pain in my midback -- never in my lower back.  During the day it goes away.    Three weeks ago, I was sleeping on my right side and awoke with pain where my ribs attach to my sternum behind my right breast.  As I turned onto my back, the pain was stabbing, but stopped as soon as I lay flat on my back.  I had done the chest press that day at the gym, so I dismissed it.  It happened again a couple of days later.  10 days ago, the chest pressure described above began.  Now the pressure that seemed to be around my heart has stopped and is between my ribs near the sternum and behind my right breast.  My back is hurting in exactly the same lateral line.    I am a 54 year old female, quite slim and very healthy.  I have been working with a trainer 3x weekly for the past 17 months.  I also do 20 minutes 3x a week on the treadmill or bicycle.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I'm a 35 year old female and for the past 1.5 to 2 weeks I have had this pain that seems to be located in my ribs or lungs behind my right breast and it goes around the side, under my right armpit to the back of ribs. It doesn't hurt constantly, like if I lift my arm or anything like that. It hurts a LOT when I take a really deep breath, cough, laugh, sneeze, yawn or try to blow my nose. To me, it doesn't seem to be pain in my muscle, because I can lift stuff and it really doesn't hurt. There are no lumps or swelling visible on the outside. It doesn't hurt to press on the area, either. I am pretty much healthy and live a normal, healthy lifestyle. I recently had a bad case of the flu that lasted about 3-5 days. Could this be related? Thanks.\n\n",

I noticed this when I was throwing right and left jabs.  I havnt noticed this in the past when doing similar routines.  I have no other symptoms such as cough, short breath, etc.  This doesnt really effect me much other than it created an uncomfortable sensation (tickling almost) in my throat, and I am worried that it might be a sign of a more serious problem.     A month ago I worked for a few days in a barn that is used to house elephants that had been exposed to Tuberculosis, but I was careful to wear a TB mask during the time.  I have no other symptoms of TB as of right now, but was concerned that these 2 things may be related.   Should I be concerned?\n\n",

It may be that when you are turning the trachea is compressed a little more causing your wheezing.  I would suggest that you discuss your symptoms with your doctor.

I have been to a cardiologist who only said I have mitral valve regurgitation but that it was trivial and I should not have any symptoms from it. I have had xrays, echos, even a stress test and everything came back fine. But these pains do not go away. I have stabbing sensations sometimes in the middle of my chest, but most times under my left breast. I have had them under my left armpit. I have dull aches running down my left arm at least twice a day everyday for the past 2 years. Everytime I go to the cardiologist he tells me that everything is fine. I don't understand that if everything is fine, then how can I keep having these pains. Sometimes I feel short of breath, sometimes I get dizzy but these symptoms have not happened all together. I worry alot because my father is 52 and he has suffered 3 heart attacks. I don't know what else to do...please help.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Bellaluce,  If you have had the opportunity to see a cardiologist, and more than once, I am guessing you have insurance.  Unless your primary MD is a cardiologist (it happens), then I would be interested in knowing what other options your primary recommends for you. Assuming the cardio tests did indeed all return clear, then logic dictates that other areas be explored - such as gastric, pulmonary, and musculoskeletal.  Each of these areas can have maladies that can cause the symptoms you indicate.  These can range from simple GERDS (gastric esophageal reflux disease), to constochondritis (a sort of inflammation of the cartilage between the ribs), to muscle strains, or spinal misalignments, etc.   Your insurance company generally prefers to dictate who to see, based on your primary MD recommendation.  Have any of these areas been also explored?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Im a 17 year old female. I was bit bit overweight when I was a preteen but managed to lose it over the years.I am about 5'4 and weigh around 138 lbs. About 3 month ago I experienced a pain when breathing in that seemed to increase the deeper I tried to breathe. That went away a day or so later. Also at times when I breather in I notice a sort of popping noise, I dnt  know whether it comes from my back or what. I have been under a lot of stress due to family issues and life at college and so have not been eating nor sleeping as much as I Should. Im March I had a bit of a cold or sinus infection and took augmentum. As I must walk to school I have had to carry heavy backpacks. This caused me to develop poor posture. I have been consiously tryingto improve that, however. Six days ago while playing with my 3 yr old brother, he accidentally threw his head back, hitting me in the sternum. Later, after examining my chest i realize that on my left chest theres a bone or lump or something that isnt there on the other side. It is firm and does not move. Its not on my breast but about 1.5 - 2 inches beneath my collar bone, not in the center of my chest but closer to it, though Im not sure that it wasnt there before i got hit. Now my chest feels tightend and breathing seems not aas deep as it should be and at times I wonder if my heart is breating too fast. What do you think is the problem?\n\n",

    "content": "Your initial symptoms sound consistent with pleurisy, a condition where the lining of the lungs becomes inflamed (often do to a virus).  This causes pain that is worse with deep breathing.  The lump you are describing may be a lymph node that enlarged in reaction to the illness that caused the pleurisy.  If I am understanding the location properly the lump is located below the collar bone but above the breast tissue.  This is the area that we refer to as the \"tail\" of the breast (similar to the tail of an upside down comma).  This location does have lymph nodes but one must always be suspicious of lumps in this area because breast cancer is so common.    I would suggest that you see a doctor to have the lump examined (even though I think the likelihood of it being anything serious is very, very low).  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Chest discomfort, and fatigue",
    "content": "Dear Camus,  Usually, if there is tenderness at the site of chest pain, the source of the pain is the chest wall, meaning, the skin, the tissues under the skin, the muscles or the ribs.  Having back discomfort means that the cause is most probably muscular strain.  Emphysema is not manifested by chest pain or discomfort, it presents with shortness of breath, cough and phlegm production and wheezing and it takes years of smoking before someone develops emphysema from smoking cigarettes.  About lung cancer, it usually presents in older patients and again in patients who have a long smoking history and it can present by coughing up blood, weight loss, night sweats or chest pain if there is invasion of the chest wall.  If you are still worried, i would encourage you to go to your doctor and have a chest x-ray done. Personally, i don't think that this is something worrisome in your case.  You can try some pain relievers such as over the counter advil or aleve and the like medications and hopefully they will help.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and I hope that this information helped.  Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

Lately He smoked for consequtive 3 days (3 cigarettes per day) and after 3 days he stoped smoking.I noticed on the second day he was coughing vigorously  in the night while sleeping.Today he coughed very loudly in the morning and he said a few drops of blood came out while coughing(without mucus). He claims he had a feeling as if something got stuck in his throat and after getting rid of those blood drops his throat is cleared and freed out of congestions.  He got severe cough and fever 5 months back  and doc prescribed some antibiotics. It was not much of help, so the doc did another check up and said he could not find  any infection in his chest, probably some viral infection is there in the back and prescribed a way stronger dose of antibiotics. Apparently it helped him to get rid of that metallic sounding coughing.  Please suggest me what  to do at this moment. Should I consult a family practice/internal meds doc or specialist? What specialist should I consult? What could be the possible reason for throwing a few drops of bood?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Anjalika,  Coughing up blood can be because of inflammation of the lining of the bronchial tubes in the lung (breathing passages), lungs infections such as pneumonia or because of cancer.  In your husband's case, it could have been from the vigorous cough.  If coughing up blood is improving, then i don't see anything worrisome at this time. My advice is to see a pulmonologist (lung specialist) if needed.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and I hope that this information helped.

    "content": "Hi I am 32 years old mother of 4 and I am breast feeding. I have been having pain in the middle of my chest bone. It had been getting worse. It is not affected by my breathing. It does hurt when I twist or pull my arms back. My upper back has been hurting. Sometime the pain does move to the left and sometimes but not often the pain is on the right. I have been healthy up until 1 year ago. I had a miscarriage and the ultrasound showed I had a dermoid cyst. That was removed months ago. I had a hernated disk L4-L5 during pregancy. Emegency surgery to fix that since the dr, thought it was the baby on my siatic nerve.   Diagnoised with Divticilois. 3 months ago. Two weeks ago when to dr. with stomach pain. Found out sludge around gall bladder. I Just don't know what to think. I want to go to the dr. but afraid he will think here we go again. Any advice. Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "It may be that you have some muscular irritation although this would generally have pain with movement or pressure.    If your pain is worse with deep breaths it may be pleurisy, a condition where the lining of the lungs is inflamed.    A less likely possibility is an infection in the breast.  The location is a bit unusual for this.  I would recommend you have this evaluated if it does not begin to improve soon.  You can try some ibuprofen to see if this helps.  Ibuprofen is safe during breast feeding for short durations.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Karin - I think your doctor is correct, and that you appear to have what is usually called costochonritis, or an inflammation of the cartilege between your ribs. If the ibuprofin (Advil, Motrin) is upsetting your stomach you might want to buffer that with over-the-counter ranitadine (brand name Zantac) as there is little else that will help this problem, and it can be rather persistent.   Bear in mind, please, that cardiac pain will not be worsened by deep breathing, sneezing, nor twisting of the upper body, but costochondritis definitely will. It is a very common problem and often mistaken for cardiac pain, but the motion test (moving the upper body, deep breathing or sneezing - this last hard to provoke on purpose but a handy diagnostic marker) moves the focus away from the heart and straight to the cartilege between one or more pairs of ribs. It will go away eventually, but there is no strict schedule, especially if it is caused by a passing virus, which is often the case.   Good luck to you and no cause for concern.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello. I am a 28 year old female. I posted the other day about shortness of breath. I've had shortness of breath for 2 weeks, just problems catching my breath. Went to the dr., chest x-ray & blood work came back fine. Was prescribed albuterol & prednisone to help clear w/the breathing. The shortness of breath has gotten better, but not perfect. Last night I ate dinner and came home and sat on my couch and started having the shortness of breath, upper right chest pain that radiated to my shoulder blade/back area. The pain was worse when moving my right arm. After 1 1/2 hrs I went to the Emergency Room. They did blood work, chest x-rays, EKG, & APG. All came back fine. I arrived at the ER around 11 p.m. and by 2 a.m. I was very nauseated and started vomitting. The dr. there came to no conclusion as to what was wrong with me, and sent me home.  The pain is still there today, more when I move or take a deep breath.  Any ideas on what this  could be? I had my gallbladder removed last October, so that can be ruled out.  Thanks, Mandy\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Mandy,  What you described in your first post might be some kind of allergic rhinitis (nose inflammation because of allergies) but the ent physician ruled that possibility out i think. This being said, however, feeling of stuffy nose and not being able to breath because of this problem could be because of allergic rhinitis especially if you have environmental allergies. What you describe sounded to me more like an upper respiratory infection with ears being affected (with the dizziness that you were having).  The chest pain that you have might be related if it was caused by the same process (an infection that reached your lungs) especially that the pain increases by taking a deep breath which is very suggestive of pleurisy (inflammation of the membrane surrounding the lungs).  The chest pain could also not be related to the arm pain that you have and they could be related to a neck problem.  i am not an advocate of prednisone use unless there is an indication like asthma or other ailments that require steroids for their treatment.  If there is a suspicion that this might be asthma, a test called methacholine challenge test should be done.  Shortness of breath and chest pain can also be caused by a condition called pulmonary embolism (blood clot to the lungs) but if you went to the er, this was most probably thought of and was ruled out.  Silent reflux can cause some of the original symptoms especially if it was severe. If you don't want to take medications for long periods of time without a good reason, you can have a test done called 24 hours ph monitoring and this should tell whether or not you have reflux.  Obviously, tests and medications cause money, time, effort and stress. i think you should wait for a while and see. If you improve, then no need for further testing. If you don't, then you might make the case of going back to your primary care physician for more testing.

Any sputum production? Any fever? Any shortness of breath associated with the pain?   The hilum is the area where the blood vessels of the lungs and the bronchial tubes come out and where the lymph nodes are located.   Fullness of the hilum is a term used to describe that area if it looks a little bit larger than normal. It is an absolutely non-specific term and if there is anything suspicious, the way to go is to have a ct scan of the chest to take a better look at this area.

    "content": "Dear Mindy,  Why did you have the ct scan of the chest done?  When a person lies flat on their back, a part of the lung is compressed and this might lead to what is known as mild atelectasis or collapse of this compressed part of the lung, but once the person is up and about, this area of the lung opens up again and there should not be any problem.  In recent years, this finding has prompted doctors to ask for ct scans of the chest with the patient both lying on his/her back and then lying on his/her stomach especially if the doctor wanted to make sure that this is not something related to a disease that affects the base of the lungs where is finding is mosly observed on ct scans.  You don't have to worry about such a finding unless there is any other abnormality that was reported on the ct scan that you had done.

    "content": "There are a few possible causes for your pain.  To first ease your mind a little-chest pain that is worse with deep breathing is almost never related to the heart.  Heart chest pain tends to be a little \"vague\" in its location and is often described as pressure.  Having said that, not all heart pain reads the medical books and can present differently so if you have a family history of heart problems or other symptoms that might be concerning for heart problems (high cholesterol, obesity, diabetes, etc.) I recommend that you have your heart evaluated.  An occasional extra beat is very common and not particularly concerning unless it begins to happen a lot.  Now, on to your pain.  There are three possibilities that are most likely for your pain.    1) Pleurisy-this is when the lining of the lungs becomes inflamed.  Deep breathing causes the inflamed lining to rub against the lung and chest wall causing sometimes quite severe pain.  This may be triggered by a recent cold, trauma, or may just appear without a definite cause.  This pain typically cannot be reproduced by pushing on the chest.  Treatment is with NSAIDS such as ibuprofen.  2) Costochondritis-this is inflammation of the area where the rib bone becomes more cartilaginous.  This is commonly caused by trauma to the rib (although it may have been relatively minor trauma and may have been quite a while in the past).  Occasionally these inflamed areas flare up causing pain.  This pain is generally reproduced by pushing on the area, is located over a rib bone (as opposed to the interspace between ribs), and is more towards the middle center of the rib as opposed to the back or near the arms.  This, too, is treated with NSAIDS.  3) Precordial catch syndrome.  This pain is typically described as a sudden, sharp, stabbing pain that feels as if the diaphragm is \"caught\" on something when a breath is taken in.  It is sporadic and irregular in its timing.  After a few seconds, the \"catch\" gives and the pain resolves.  The exact cause is still unknown.  It is not dangerous but can be quite painful.  This is most common in adolescents but can be seen in other age groups.  There is no specific treatment but it tends to resolve itself over time.  If the pain persists I would recommend that you be evaluated by your doctor in order to have a more specific diagnosis made.  This way treatment can be recommended based on your exam.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "You may have pleurisy.  This is inflamation of the lining of the lungs/chest wall.  Deep breathing, moving, etc. causes the irritated lining to rub up against the opposite wall and produces pain.  The best treatment for pleurisy is a nonsteroidal antiinflamatory medication such as ibuprofen.  Taking the recommended dose 2-3 times per day for about a week usually will do the trick.  Ibuprofen is safe during breast feeding.  However, before starting any medication I would recommend that you follow up with your doctor for reevaluation.  Please do not start any treatment recommended via the internet without first consulting your doctor who can examine you directly.  This could be quite dangerous as I am solely going by what you are describing and may be missing some crucial piece of information.  That being said, you do have a pretty good story for pleurisy and I think the ibuprofen will likely help if your doctor agrees.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

Also had my gallbladder removed in October of last year for gallstones. I am currently taking questran 2x daily for post gallbladder issues. I have never smoked and do not drink alcohol.  The only medication I am on is the questran and birth control. For the past few months I have thought I was getting recurring sinus infections. I've had facial pain, mucous drainage and problems catching my breath. I've been on various antibiotics which seem to help each time. I just recently started getting dizzy when laying down to go to bed. It lasts for a few short minutes and then stops. I also am having problems catching my breath. I feel like the problem lies within my nose, b/c that is where it feels like I can't breath. My nose is not stuffy...it is just dry and feels \"full.\"   I have been to an ENT and he thinks it is reflux?? He told me to try Nexium, but I just don't see this as reflux. I do have ocassional reflux, but not all the time, only afer spicey meals. TH ENT only did a limited CT scan of my sinuses. No blood work was done.  Do you have any idea of what this could be? It seems as if no doctor has an answer. The problems catching my breath lead to panic attacks, b/c I can't breath! :-)   Thanks, Mandy\n\n",

In fact , reports indicated that the acid reflux in patients with GERD into their pharynx result in sinusitis  This because the acid secretion that reaches the pharynx and nearby the sinuses induce inflammation of nasal mucous and block the sinuses.  Thus , individuals with GERD may also  have a chronic sensation of a lump in the throat and difficult breathing.  Hope you find this information useful. I advise you to follow up  with your gastroentrolgist to recommend you better treatment for the GERD.  Keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "First, some reassurance.  Pain that is worse with breathing or moving the ribs is almost never from the heart.  While I've never heard the term \"virus in the chest bone\" before this is probably a fairly descent way to think about it.  What you are describing is consistent with one of two things.  First, pleurisy is inflammation of the lining of the lungs/inside chest wall.  It can become inflamed and produce pain.  This often will be precipitated by a virus.  This may have been what your doctor meant.  Breathing and moving the rib cage by moving your arms causes the lining to move and rub the irritated area causing increased pain.  Ibuprofen is an anti-inflammatory and will help alleviate the pain.  The second possibility is costochondritis.  This is inflammation of the area where the rib becomes cartilage in the front of the chest.  This pain is located on a rib as opposed to between them.  Also, the pain can be reproduced by pushing on the area where the pain is (as opposed to pleurisy where this does not happen).  This may be caused by a recent infection or trauma to the area.  Ibuprofen will help this also.  If your pain is not improving over the next few days with the ibuprofen I would recommend that you follow up with your doctor.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

That is why a lot more information about the character of the pain is always needed to reach the diagnosis.  These information include: the site, the time of onset, duration of pain or the course of the pain, nature of pain e.g.dull, crampy etc, and any associated symptom or possible precipitating factor.  In general pain felt in the upper part of the abdomen as you mentioned can be due to many causes including: - Gastritis - Gastric ulcer - Excess gas and distension  -  Indigestion     - Irritable Bowel Syndrome - IBS in which the diagnosis is mainly by exclusion of other causes. Investigations include Complete blood picture , blood chemistry. Abdominal US.  People with IBS may have associated headache or coexisting.   Complete history, physical examination and investigations are the only way to reach proper diagnosis and treatment. So, I advise you to  take an appointment with your doctor to reach the correct diagnosis.  Best regards.\n\n",

Last clots were April 06. But in the last few weeks I have been experiencing extreme chest pain in the left lower and right middle lung. I am also short of breath and feel my heart racing. I though I was experiencing another clot, (although I am not sure if this is possible whilst on warfrin although my INR had been too low for a number of weeks?) so my GP sent me for a VQ scan which showed two mismatched area, in the lower left and middle right lungs. On comparison with previous scans it was determined that these clots were from previous episodes of clotting. So no new clots were found( How long do these clots take to dissolve.)   MY biggest concern is why am I getting severe pain now??? I don't want to go to emergency department, when I know they will just look for a clot and tell me there is no new ones. What else copuld be causing pain that feels like a clot?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi abbydabbydo: Good question. The likley reason you are having pain without any  new clots having arrived is that the old ones are still in there, and can cause numerous forms of irritation while they are slowly dissolving. The actual process of dissolving can produce by-products which may be irritating to lung tissue or could even conceivably produce a pneumonia, which may or may not be a concern (pneumonias range from the merely annoying to quite disabling). Something is causing your pain, and it is undoubtedly related to the remains of those original clots. There may be some way to hasten dissolution of them, or you may simply require antibiotics for a cystic pneumonia. A pulmonologist probably should take a look and a repeat VQ might be in order. These are, of course, only  guesses, but pain usually does signify something, and if it's nothing serious then anti-inflammatory medication may not only reduce the discomfort but also speed the dissolving of the old clots.  Good luck to you.\n\n",

Depending on the causative factor of the heart attack, possibly resuming an exercise/activity program/walking may be recommended after the routine follow up is completed by a Cardiologist. I would strongly suggest that you have an evaluation by a healthcare professional. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Serenity22 - I would just like to second the advice of Ms. Jones and urge to you find some way to get to a medical facility for at least a primary cardiac workup. If you have, in fact, suffered a heart attack you will need some sort of regimen and medical follow up.   It's entirely possible (unless you were actually diagnosed by an MD as having had a heart attack) that you have something else more benign going on, in which case I know I would want to know that so that I could be sure I was taking the proper approach to caring for it (this could just as easily be something like gastric esophgeal reflux disease - GERD - or something related, and the therapy for that would be very different from what you might do following an actual heart attack).  I can understand your reluctance to travel such a great distance, but when the question is one of whether or not you have a life-threatening medical problem, I think it would be well worth the trouble to impose, if necessary, on a friend or relative or someone to help you get to at least a basic healthcare facility, where it can be determined whether or not you even require \"advanced\" care.   Good luck to you and please do stay in touch.\n\n",

    "title": "Difficulties breathing & feeling of a lump in the throat",
    "content": "Two weeks ago today I was admitted to the Acident & Emergency Dept at my local hospital complaining of difficulties breathing.  The main feeling was one of tightness in my throat (below my Adam's Apple, behind and to either side of the base of my larynx), disorientation, cold feet and hands, shaking and disturbed vision.  At the time I was probably hyperventilating out of panic, and was suffering from a chest infection.  I had recently returned from Bangladesh.  The hospital checked my blood oxygen levels (normal), ECG (normal although pulse rate high) and various blood tests for tropical infections (also normal.  We are trying to establish which ones they tested for).  They kept me in for 24hrs under observation, gave me high doses of intravenous antibiotics and discharged me the next day with a mixed course of 2 further antibiotics which amounted to just over 2000mg/day for 1week.  I stayed off work for a week and took it very easy.  The chest infection cleared up and I started feeling better, but not normal - still getting very tired, feeling as if my muscles are working slower than normal and a sort of heavyness in my head, neck and sternum (not in my lungs themselves) and my voice keeps changing.  Last Monday (the day before yesterday) I returned to work. After only 4 hours, and in the middle of a meeting I had the same symptoms as the previous time - tight feeling in my throat (like there was a ball at the lower front of it), voice going gruff, disorientated / dizzy feeling in my head, heavy head, pressure behind my eyes, like my scalp was crawling, cold feet and hands and shakes.  I felt like I was having difficulty breathing (but not as if air wasn't getting into my lungs, more like it wasn't reaching my brain).  I made a concious effort not to hyperventilate, so I know my breathing and oxygen levels were OK (they checked this at the hospital shortly afterwards).  I was taken to A&E again where they decided it might be an alergic reaction to something that is closing my throat. I was put on a short course of steroids and antihistimine.    However, its now 48hrs after this incident and I'm not convince this is an alergic reaction (I've never had anything like this before).  I can still feel this tightness/lump in my throat.  The lump feels like its under and just behind my Adams Apple.  The tightness/thickness feels like its in the deep tissue on either side of my larynx.  I am not experiencing any difficulties swallowing and my trachea feels like its open as usual.  However, my voice is still croaky and if I talk for too long, it makes the feeling worse.  There is a tiny bit of thick mucous in my larynx but it looks normal.  I am aware of my pulse in my neck and head, too.  I feel very tired and my eyes feel like they're moving in treacle.  My head feels thick and my scalp feels like its crawling sometimes.  My sinuses are clear and my nose isn't blocked.  The sense of disorientation is still there, like I'm a micro-second behind everything.  I tried walking to the local Post Office yesterday (15 minutes each way) and whilst I didn't have problems breathing, I had to make a concious effort to breath and felt like I was walking in treacle the whole way.  Had to lie down when I got home.  Oh, and my period is late as well (and I'm usually as regular as clockwork - and there's not chance I'm pregnant).  I won't be able to see an alergy specialist until the end of June, but becase I don't feel any tightness in my chest and my throat doesn't feel obstructed from inside I'm not convinced this is an alergy.  However, I have no idea what else might be causing this.  I'm going to see my Doctor tomorrow morning to discuss the next course of action.  Any ideas what might be causing this?    In the meantime, I'm making an appointment to see an Ear, Nose and Throat specialist to check out the feeling in my neck.  I'm also trying to find out from the hospital which tests they did on me the other week so that we can rule out infectious diseases (although Chaga's Disease seems to be the only one with any link to symptoms of the throat.  By the way, I travel overseas for a living and have been to most continents over the last 15 years so this is not an unlikely option).  Other things that might be possibilities include a dental filling that was exposed a few weeks back when half my tooth broke away.  I've not had it seen to yet as until I am safe in a Dentists chair, they won't treat me.  The alergy option that is currently being checked out is to new cleaning products and carpets at work, they also removed a lot of asbestos during last years refurbishment.  This all seems like I'm clutching at straws but until we know what's causing this I'm stuck at home and feeling aprehensive.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Age:32 Sex: Male Past diagnosis: Costal Condritis (ithink I've a spelt it right)  though the doctor pressed in several areas and there was no specific point which was painful. Past sugeries : none Family History : No known history of chest problems in the family. Current medications: None  I have been getting infrequent chest pain over the past several months/year.    There is no real pattern to the pain but can occur when I eat or after I lift/carry one of my children.  But sometimes occurs for no real reason. It is not linked to twisting hence I'm not convined it is costal condritis.  Since getting an erroneous high blood pressure reading a couple of years ago, I have been very focused on my heart/chest and get palpatations at various times.   Additionally, I've been getting aching in the left bicep and regular but very mild headaches.  The problem I have is that I'm not sure which of the symptoms are geneuine and which have been caused by my neurosis.  I've visited my doctor several times over the last couple of years and each time they perform simple checks; listen to my heart/chest and everything has come back normal (including an ecg whihc was normal)  My bp is also pretty normal i.e 130/80 to 145/90)  Unitl I know for certain what the chest pain is my mind just mulls the possibilities over and with the headaches and aches in my arm I come to various conclusions.   I don't want to end up inducing a condition though my anxiety whihc wasn't there in the first place.  Logicicaly the most likely outcome is that I have a muscular strain and hence some inflammation which has meant I can feel my heart easier.  This would explian the pain/palpatations. the headaches are probbably the stress and the arm from carrying my children... Who knows..  Any advice or information would be greatly appreciated.    Apologies if this is very long. Lee\n\n",

After listening to my chest he thought that it could be either a stomach or muscular problem.  He offered me some impreprosol but I declined.

Whenever I rotate my chest my chest/airways make a sound as if I'm breathing heavily. I'm not breathing at the time.  Additionally, sometimes  if I've been sitting down hunched over the computer and then get up or if I stretch I feel things rearranging themselves within my chest.  Is it possible that I could have cartilidge damage. I'm intending to visit somebody to have a feel and see if there is any muscle problems.

    "content": "Hi zjwieber - OK, here's the deal: you may have had some simple, transient physical symptom that set this off by tapping into some anxiety of which you hadn't been aware. For instance, you say you'd been \"dizzy\" for a couple weeks prior to the initial episode. You describe having had a \"numb\" head and having \"almost passed out\" at that time. Suppose you had been having vertigo (a form of dizziness usually associated with an inner ear problem) prior to that day, and had been becoming slowly more anxious about what was causing it - or had been anxious or stressed anyway, due to some issue you had chosen to set aside.  Many panic attacks are attributed  to vague but scary physical symptoms, but especially to      vertigo. Panic attacks also can be characterized by strange feelings in the head, especially numbness (most usually in the face and around the mouth, but also in the scalp) due to unwitting hyperventilation. One thing leads to another and before you know it you've created a whole galaxy of disturbing symptoms (anxiety is a great cause of palpitations and premature beats, and they are also famous for causing anxiety once they start, so there's a cycle that takes on a life of its own rather quickly).   Everything you have described fits with new onset panic attacks and chronic anticipatory anxiety. Ativan is not always as effective against this as is generally thought, whereas a related drug, clonazepam (brand name Klonopin) is far more effective in breaking the cycle without the attendant drowsiness Ativan often causes).   Lexapro, as a seritonin uptake inhibitor (SSRI), is indicated in the treatment of depression and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). While the SSRI family of drugs can sometimes be helpful in Panic Disorder (PD) it is less so than with GAD, because the SSRIs have a tendency to lift one's mood, which means they can have a stimulating effect in some people, not what you want if you've begun having panic attacks. While PD and GAD can coexist, the tendency to panic operates on a different principle than chronic anxiety and I have observed a number of people react to use of these drugs in a negative way (more panic attacks). Again, my observation of these kinds of situations leads me to believe clonazepam is a superior drug if in fact a medical approach is to be taken.   You might also consider at least consulting with a mental health professional and perhaps exploring some short-term psychotherapy. Everything you have described sounds very much like new-onset PD and it will cause you to slowly shut down your usual activities and even become fearful of social commitments or travel (agorophobia) because of fear of another \"episode.\"   Discuss the possibility of clonazepam as an alternative to both the Ativan and Lexapro, at least on a trial basis, and look into the psych consult as well. You can miss a lot when this sort of thing kicks up, and there may well be an underlying emotional basis for it that was simply kicked open by an innocent physical symptom. Because of its cyclic nature, it's unlikely to get better by itself. Don't waste time waiting for everything to just get better. Be proactive so you can begin to enjoy life again. And if there is some recurrent, benign physical problem that can be corrected as well, all the better.   Good luck with this and please do keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi serenity22 - While all your ER exams and tests were interpreted as normal, it does sound as though something is going on. It may not  be cardiac, but I think a follow-up is in order. If you are too weak/lethargic to drive yourself to the doctor and can't find someone to drive you there as a favor, then (and I say this with some trepidation) you might want to make another appearance at the ER. If you are having chest pains and are extremely weak, there is something that requires addressing. Quite often women do not get the same consideration in this sort of situation that men get, because of a lingering mindset that women are somehow immune to heart disease until much later in life. This is becoming less common, but still persists in the minds of some medical people.   Hopefully what is going on is not cardiac related, but it could nonetheless be something that warrants medical care. Clearly you're not feeling well enough to function right now, and you have pain. You could have something as simple as a viral pneumonia or a number of other non-cardiac problems, but if you feel as bad as you say, you definitely require further attention. If there's no way you can make it in to your doctor's office then the ER is one way to be seen and maybe they will look farther this time.   Good luck to you and please let us know how things go.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello nslick - At first glance I was thinking your pain sounded cardiac-related, but then I came to the part about the affected area being very tender to touch. Pain in the chest, even in the sternal area, if aggravated by touch, is almost never cardiac-related but is usually Tietz's Syndrome (costochondritis, or inflammation of the cartilage which connects the ribs to the sternum. This area is surprisingly flexible and can become irritated any number of ways, sometimes for no apparent reason.   The fact that you describe the pain as an \"ache\" instead of sharp leaves some slight question in my mind as to what exactly is going on, but the sensitivity to touch pretty much rules out cardiac involvement. The abdominal pain, occurring when you are seated (and so bent at the waist) is probably not related and may well be due to unconscious swallowing of air.   With the other pain you describe also occurring in other areas, you may have some sort of neuritis (inflammation of nerves). This can be caused virally or for other more obscure reasons.   The first thing I would do is try an anti-inflammatory agent such as ibuprofin or naproxyn (available over the counter as Advil and Aleve respectively). If this causes the upper body pain to decrease or go away, then there's no reason for further concern. However, these can irritate the stomach, so should be taken with food, especially if you are already having abdominal pain.   If nothing changes after a day or two of over-the-counter NSAID self-treatment, I would bring this to the attention of your regular physician. I don't think it sounds heart-related, however..  Good luck to you with this.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 30 year old male, non smoker.  For a few days, I have had a dull pain on the right side of my chest area near the center of my rib cage.  It worsens when I take a deep breath and becomes more of a sharp pain.  The area is tender to the touch but there is no visible bruising.  I have had some slight shortness of breath since it is painful to take deep breaths.  The pain seems worse when I am sitting rather than standing and I was unable to sleep on my right side.  About 12 years ago, I had a spontaneous pnuemothorax.  Could this be a recurrance or does it sound more like a muscle strain?  I haven't done anything out of the ordinary lately?

This area is susceptible to inflammation producing the pain.    Costochondritis is typically diagnosed by pressing on the affected area.  If it causes the same pain, then this is the diagnosis.  If one presses on the painful area and the pain is not recreated it is unlikely to be this.  Ibuprofen or other anti-inflammatory medication is the pain medicine of choice.  If this doesn't help or if the pain continues for more than a day or so, I recommend you be evaluated by your doctor.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 79 year old male. Recently, while constipated, I was straining to induce a bowel movement, when I suddenly felt a sharp pain in the middle of my chest at about the level of my armpits. This was like a popping or tearing, and immeduiately became a line of pain across my chest. It was at about the same level as heartburn pains; but they are more of a burning sensation. This was more of a raw feeling. It went away after an hour or so. Since then, every time I go outside in the cold air (30s and 40s F), the raw pain starts up again in the same location. This is while walking at a moderate speed, breathing through my nose only. Indoors, this does not happen, even with energetic exercise. Ice water and ice cream do not cause this pain, so it seems to be associated with my windpipe or lungs, rather than my esophagus. Could I have damaged something in those parts? If so, what should I do about it?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I am a 37 year old male.  I am currently on no medications and have been a lifetime non drinker/smoker.  Today, I have noticed some pressure in the middle of my chest.  I don't have any symptoms of a cold/flu.  If I take in a very deep breath, the pressure seems to get a little more apparent, but not much more.  The pressure is not painful, but I definitely would describe it as a slight \"tightness\" or \"pressure\".  It has been like this for 10 hours or so.  It just seems to sit there.  I used to be very physically fit, but I have completely strayed from this way for the past 3 years for 500 different excuses.  I would now consider myself overweight and sedentary.  I went from 1 - 2 workouts a day and eating remarkably clean to no exercise and high fat meals and sugar drinks.  Since this time I have managed to put on 50 pounds.  I am currently 6'1 and weigh 250 pounds.  Seeing as how I was active my entire life and I now feel so unhealthy and sluggish, everytime I feel something, I think the worst.  This is no different.  I am worried that this drastic turnaround could have caused me some serious potential harm like high blood pressure, possibly Type 2 Diabetes, and or heart problems.  When I started searching the internet, the main diagnosis sounds like I am having a heart attack.  My father did have a heart attack at the age of 57, but he was not active ever, drank alcohol regularly, smoked, and did not eat very well.  3 months ago, I went to have my blood pressure checked after I felt lightheaded after a heated argument and it seemed to be high.  I don't remember the exact numbers but I think it was called borderline hypertension.  1 month after that, I had to get a tube inserted in my ear.  Before the surgery and throughout the day, they took my blood pressure.  All was OK.  I never pursued it further.  However, I do know if I get into a stressful situation and I end up getting very mad, I feel immediate pressure in my head.  I do not know if this means elevated blood pressure or a headache, but I have never had a headache before, so I am unsure of what this sensation is.  People tell me that it I must have high blood pressure.  My question is, does the pressure in my chest sound like something I need to immediately take action on like driving to the emergency or is this something that could wait 3 weeks for my yearly physical?  Thanks for your support.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,   The chest contains many organs, like the heart, lungs with its pleural covering, esophagus, muscles, ribs, tendons, and nerves. They all can be the source of the pain (tightness) felt in the chest.   It sounds like muscle spasm is the cause of your symptoms.   Muscle spasm alone can cause this pain which can be an unidentified cause but in many cases is the result of inappropriate posture for long time like traveling, driving, carrying heavy objects, and certain types of work.   Muscle spasm can also occur due overexertion of the chest wall muscles to maintain the chest in certain position to avoid pain of skeletal disorders like costochondritis or spinal problems or their inflammation (viral infection).   Self care and avoiding the precipitating cause will lead to a gradual but clear improvement in the pain. Home treatment includes the use of Analgesics, cold or hot therapy. Rest for maximum two days is also beneficial.   -Asthma, which is associated with either shortness of breath, wheezing, or dry cough.   - Pain due to rib or chest wall bone disease is also another cause of chest pain. They are also tenderness over the affected areas.   Other causes to be excluded: -Pleurisy is an inflammation of the pleura, which is a double-layered membrane covers the lungs separating it from the rib cage. Viral infections are commonest cause and dry cough is usually present which increase the severity of the pain.  -Evolving lung infection.  -Cardiac causes should be excluded in any case of Chest pain.   - Psychological or emotional stress and Anxiety, in these cases the diagnosis is made by exclusion of other causes.   Direct clinical examination is essential.  I advise you to follow up with your doctor.  Keep us updated.  Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "I went to the doctor and they did some blood work.  They called me back to tell me that if was definitely not heart related (I think they checke the Troponin T), my blood sugar levels were normal, BUT, I did have a slight elevation in my most sensitive Liver enzyme.  I can't recall if it was ALT or AST.  The normal range I believe was between 0 & 60 and mine was 138.  The doctor said that this can be normal and that I may have had this since early childhood but that it may have gone undetected.  He was not concerned at all, but, he wants to do a second checkup in 2 months.  The doctor concluded that he feels that it is most likely Chest Wall Pain caused by lifting something heavy and that I should take Advil for the next 5 days to see if the inflammation goes down.  My only concern is that after 7 days, I can still feel it.  It seems to not be as bad, but nevertheless, it is still there.  I will start taking Advil tomorrow.  It is hard for me to be completely assured of this diagnosis seeing as how I never experienced anything like this before, including all my years of weightlifting.  I always thought I was in tune with my bodies aches and pains.  However, I will be ecstatic if this is the problem, and not something else.  However, I have another issue that may or may not be related to this.  I have noticed that my underarms become alot smellier easier than ever before.  I used to be able to put deodorant on in the morning, and never worry about it.  Now, when I get home, I find myself putting more on as I can notice an odor.  Around 3 months ago, I switched underarm deodorants.  Not realizing the connection, I started to notice a discomfort in my armpits.  Once again, not really painful nor rashy, but definitely unpleasant.  After discussing with people and searching the internet, I was told that some people have issues with the ingredients of some of the brand of deodorants, that they contain titanium or something of that nature.  So, I decided to go without anything for a couple of days.  My discomfort went away!  I have since gone back to my normal deodorant.  However, during the last 4 weeks or so, I have been noticing the discomfort once again, and at times if I apply pressure deep into my right armpit, I can get it to actually cause slight pain.  I do not have a rash, or any noticeable lumps that I can see or feel.  When I searched the internet, it seems that chest pain and armpit lumps are often grouped together when diagnosing certain ailments.  As you are most obviiously aware, these ailments include breast cancer and lymphnoma.  Because I have no lumps, I try to tell myself that it is nothing serious, but I always think the worst.  Any help would be appreciated.  What kind of tests would I hope my doctor to perform on me that could put me at ease?  I am starting to feel like somebody who is constantly paranoid.  I have never had so much stress in my life.  First, I am dealing with an inguinal hernia that I need to have looked at, now I have this chest pain, and lastly, I have this annoying issue with my armpits (mostly the right one).  Can all these be somehow linked and what kind of advice can you give me.  Thanks for taking the time to listen.  Trevor\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 53 year old male previously diagnosed with MVP. I am not taking any medications but am a 1 1/2 pack a day smoker.  My father had heart bypass surgery when he was in his late 50's.  This morning I was talking on the phone in a relaxed state when I felt a sudden sharp constriction in my chest and back. It passed after a minute or so but I am still experiencing some dull pain across my mid-back. If it weren't for the initial tightness in my back and chest, I would suspect a muscle pull focused on the region just below my left and right scapula.   I am inclined to wait and see but thought I should ask in the event some other action should be taken. Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 40 year old female.  I woke up this morning feeling pain and tightness over my entire chest area.  It was something I had never felt before.  When I turned over and laid on my back, the pain was better.  From then on, I have had only pain in my left side.  It seems to be mostly around my breast area even though I do not believe it is my breast.  The pain is not sharp or extreme.  It is somewhat dull, but bothersome.  I have been experiencing this pain for approximalely 4 hours.  I do not seem to have any other symptoms.  The pain can sometimes get worse when breathing deeply and sometimes disappears for a few minutes all together.  I have lung and heart history in my family.  Do you have any ideas?  I have digestive problems but have never felt anything like this.  Thank you for your help.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Doctor Mahmoud, Good Day. I am a male, 31 years old, non smoker/drinker, 5'11\" and 196lbs.  I am usually always stressed and am constantly anxious. About a month and a half back, I woke at about 4am with this searing, stabbing pain in my right side back. it made breathing difficult so we ran to the ER which is only 5 minutes from home, where they immdiately did an ECG, blood tests, chest X-ray, sonography, and administered a pain killer. They kept me overnight for observation and discharged me soon after. All reports and the ECG were absolutely normal. The pain went away in a day but I got a cough that lasted about 2 weeks (pretty heavy) and it still persists but only a little. After that, I felt a little discomfort/tightness in my middle chest sometimes right, rarely on the left. My back sometimes pains, very much like a bad nights sleep(I do slouch a lot). I also sit a lot at work, maybe 10 hours, then go home and lie on the bed. Very little activity. In the evenings, I do tend to get tired and exhausted and my breath seems shallow, this subsides after about 2 hours. I made another trip to the doctors, who found my pressure high. 140/110.I have a family history of high blood pressure. he gave me Nebicard SM twice daily, that has brought the pressure down to 130/96 within a week. I  have undergone a rigourous checkup less than a year ago that entailed EEG, ECG, stress tests, sonograms, x-rays, blood tests, etc and apart from the pressure, everything was clear. Nebicard was issued then too, which I stopped after a month. Due to my always anxious nature, I am quite tense about this now and am constantly wondering about it. Please would you advice me on what to do. Thank you kindly Regards\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Your description is more likely to be due to respiratory tract infection and inflammation of the pleura (pleurisy).  Inflammation of the pleura covering the lung gives a sharp pain that is associated with cough and is more severe when taking deep breath. It makes also breathing very difficult. The condition is due to viral infection in most of the cases.   You have mentioned that you suffer also from cough, thus a viral infection is more likely to be the case, and it has affected his pleura.  Inflammation in the respiratory airway results in spasm of the muscles of the bronchial way with swollen cells in the airway lining, as a sequence narrowing of the respiratory tract and decreased airflow. This results in shortness of breath.  The condition gradually improves with rest, plenty of fluid. NSAID can help reduce the pain.  If you have a productive cough with yellowish or greenish sputum, or high fever, you should visit your doctor immediately to receive the proper medical care. In such cases, bacterial infection is possible to be the cause and unless you receive the proper antibiotic it will be a prolonged attack and may be complicated.  An additional cause for pain could be, Overexertion of the chest wall muscles or their inflammation as a part of viral infection like flu or cold results also in chest pain, the pain is usually aggravated with certain moves and is usually associated with tenderness over the affected muscles.  In all of these conditions the chest pain is usually aggravated by taking deep breath and cough.   Sometimes spasm of the chest wall muscles occur as reflex to pain felt in the chest, this will make breathing more difficult and shallow. If your type of work, or your habits make you remain in certain inappropriate posture, the pain will increase and the spasm will not be relieved.   Direct clinical examination is essential. Keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  The chest contains many organs, like the heart, lungs with its pleural covering, esophagus, muscles, ribs, tendons, and nerves. They all can be the source of the pain felt in the chest.  The pain you have described is more likely to be due to pleurisy.  Pleurisy is an inflammation of the pleura, which is a double-layered membrane covers the lungs separating it from the rib cage. Viral infections like flu, are the most common cause of Pleurisy. The pain is felt as sharp pain which get worse by Coughing, sneezing, moving, laughing and deep breathing. Auscultation of the chest shows a characteristic sound known as pleural rub.   Another possible cayse is pain due to myoskeletal problems. Overexertion of the chest wall muscles (excess cough) or their inflammation as a part of viral infection like flu or cold results also in chest pain, the pain is usually aggravated with certain moves and is usually associated with tenderness over the affected muscles.   In these conditions the chest pain is usually aggravated by taking deep breath, and cough.   The condition gradually improves with rest, plenty of fluid. NSAID can help reduce the pain.

    "title": "pain & pressure in chest (& hollow feeling)",
    "content": "Hello. I am a 38 year old female, morbidly obese, non-smoker, non-drinker, non-drug user, not overly active. I'm a mother of two teenagers, and a substitute teacher, so I don't sit around all day, but I don't exercise. My weight has caused me to get out of breath when I do strenuous activities, but other than that I have been overall a healthy person. My blood pressure is always 120/80 on the nose, and my blood sugar and insulin levels have always been in the middle of the normal range. I have always had normal cholesterol levels, and last had it checked about 3 years ago, and the doctor said it was exactly what it should be, and my triglycerides were on the money. I've never been hospitalized or had a surgery, or been on any types of medications other than antibiotics and such. Diabetes and heart disease have been diagnosed in my family, along with breast cancer, but my last check-up 3 years ago showed no signs of any of these.  About a month ago I started having bad chest pains. Not when I'm active, but more when I'm sitting or laying down. It's a constant pressure (like something is laying on my chest), with some pains (not always shooting, more like a long pinch, sometimes dull, sometimes sharp), that come and go, but in the past week have gotten more constant. Right now it's just a constant pain in my chest, and has been for about two days. The pains are almost always located either in the very center of my chest, or just to the left, toward the top of my left breast. I can push directly over the pain it is so centralized, usually, but pushing on it does not make it worse or better. The pain is not in my shoulder, neck, jaw, or upper back. It's not interfering with my breathing. I've always tended to be a shallow breather, and breathing deep does not cause it to hurt more or less. Sometimes shifting my shoulders a certain way can affect how much it hurts. I have had a pinched feeling in my left arm a couple of times, but that could have been because I was so worried it was a heart attack that my mind ran away with me. I don't have a cough or sore throat or chest congestion. Sometimes it feels like my heart is fluttering, or running away with me, a few beats that seem to be really forced, but when I check my resting heart rate it is always around 70-72. Sometimes when it feels pressure, it begins to feel like my chest is hollow, and when I talk it's like I can feel my voice vibrating deeply in my chest. I've had a couple of dizzy spells also. I have not been to see a doctor yet, but plan on going next Tuesday, Jan. 2, if I can. I'm not blowing this off and it really does scare me, it's just that I don't have insurance, so I had to wait until after getting Christmas gifts for my children.  As for what I've done differently in the past month, I did sit for long periods of time back before Christmas, making Christmas presents, and some of the crafts involved pulling strenuously. But that's been at least 2 weeks ago, so if it was sore muscles, shouldn't it have been better by now? I sleep on a very uncomfortable couch, (and after one area breaking down a few weeks ago, for a couple of nights my head was slightly lower than the rest of me, but I've fixed that and now the end where I put my head is slightly elevated, but it's still very uncomfortable) so I deal with a lot of back pain. I'm not on any medications, over the counter or prescription, though I did take two aspirins a couple of times when I worried it was a heart attack. It was just never bad enough for me to actually go to the emergency room. I've looked up info on panic attacks, and don't think that's it, but I do worry that my stress over the situation is causing me to feel exaggerated symptoms. Any info, advice, anything to help me understand some of what's going on would be greatly appreciated. I'm sorry if I rambled too much, but I wanted to cover everything. Thank you very much, Carroll[/u]\n\n",

    "content": "It still doesn't hurt when breathing deeply, but I've noticed it does seem to flare up slightly when breathing out all the way, and I forgot to mention, it hurts more after eating or drinking. I've had heartburn before though, and my ex-husband had reflux, so I know it's not either of those or an acid in my stomach problem. It also hurts if I go all day without eating. But this isn't in my stomach and it's not a burning sensation. It's became more of a stationary pain (this evening makes three days it's hurt continuously), directly in the center of my chest and sometimes just left of center. Again, I'm sorry to go on so much, but this has me terribly worried and I figured the more info you have the more accurate the ideas of what could be wrong, and it looks like I'm not going to make it to the doctor next week, but will have to wait till the week after or the week after that, unless it gets bad enough to send me to the emergency room. Thank you again, Carroll\n\n",

Thus your hear rate is within normal (although low normal). Your cardiological assessment came back normal too. This makes your symptoms less likely  to be of scardiac origin  .  Chest causes should be investigated which include: - Asthma may present with chest tightness, pressure and dry cough. - Drugs like RISPERDAL may cause chest pain and shortness of breath. - Anxiety and stress cause similar symptoms. -Lyme disease may present with chest symptoms (during the active disease status). Did you perform and X-ray chest or respiratory function tests? If not you may ask your Doctor for this. ESR and CBC is advisable too.  Direct clinical examination is essential. Best regards.\n\n",

Costochondritis is an inflammation of the cartilage as it connects a rib to the breastbone (sternum). It is commonly seen in females. When a swelling is felt the condition is known as Tietze's syndrome.  Pain and tenderness are usually present. The condition may result in breathing difficulties or chest pain similar to that of cardiac origin.  Chest X-ray is usually normal.  I advise you to seek orthopedic consultation. Direct clinical examination is essential. Best regards.\n\n",

She's 22 years old, about 5'4\" 110 lbs. She's been having completely random shooting chest pains for a while now, which lead to shortness of breath. She described it as being under her left breast. The pains can come if shes on an escalator or if shes sitting in a chair.  Non-smoker (she doesn't drink either if that makes a difference) and I don't believe her family has any history of CVD or HD.   She does have a history of multiple UTIs causing some on and off problems with her kidneys. Only medications i remember her being on are Macrobid (spelling?) and Ciprofloxacin.  I would greatly appreciate any help that would help me get her to a physician. Thanks, Junior\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  The pain you described can be due to different causes like:  - Muscle spasm alone can cause this pain which can be an unidentified cause but in many cases is the result of inappropriate posture for long time like traveling, driving and certain types of work.   - Pleurisy is an inflammation of the pleura, which is a double-layered membrane covers the lungs separating it from the rib cage. Viral infections like flu, are the most common cause of Pleurisy. Recurrent form of infection may occur in individuals with lower body immunity due to other medical problems or stress.  The pain is felt as sharp pain which get worse by Coughing, sneezing, moving and deep breathing. Auscultation of the chest shows a characteristic sound known as pleural rub.   - Sometimes Chest pain is not originating from the chest itself; instead it is due to problems in the digestive tract. These problems include IBS, Gastritis and GER.   Cardiac causes, should be excluded in any case of Chest pain although it is likely to be in your case (young age, non typical symptoms).   Direct clinical examination is essential.  Best regards.\n\n",

I'm getting this strange deep itch/tickle sensation on the left side of my chest, under the bottom rib towards the center of the chest. I do not have a cough, but when I do I get a dry feeling in the lung, sometimes a little hoarse. I noticed i do feel it a little bit in my back as well, just under the left shoulder blade. I'm also experiencing some weakness in my left leg, especially the knee , sometimes twitching but nothing overwhleming. Once in a while it burns after I urinate and my eyes have been glassy sometimes red .. something just doesn't feel right and my body feels fatigued,.. i do have GERD but im not so sure if this is related to it .. I've had an EGD, EKG, Chest x-ray, chest CT scan, abdominal ultrasound, and CBC blood test. all came back clear. any ideas what this coulld be from?\n\n",

    "content": "What you are describing is actually a fairly common phenomenon.  There are a couple of possible causes of your pain.  The most likely is a syndrome known as Precordial Catch Syndrome.  It obtained its name because people describe the pain as if something was caught and tearing with intense sharp pain.  Then the pain goes away as if what ever was caught gave way.  It's not well known why this happens.  Unfortunately, because the pain is intermittent and irregular, treatment is very difficult.  Ibuprofen may help reduce some inflammation that may be at the source of the pain.  The other possibility is pleurisy, which is inflammation of the coverings of the lungs/chest wall.  This can be quite painful.  I suspect that Precordial Catch Syndrome is a variant of this.  Pain here tends to be worsened with breathing.  Also, it tends not to suddenly appear and dissappear, although it can. A course of ibuprofen to help alleviate the inflammation.  I would suggest talking with your doctor to get a thorough exam.  This is always safest to rule out other causes of pain, and to decide on a treatment course.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "title": "Pain in lower chest, from smoking?",
    "content": "Hi, I am a 25 year old male about 183 pounds with 10 years of smoking cigarettes.   For the past 6 months I have had chest pain come and go on my left anterior side around the 6-7th rib (vertically) about an inch lateral to my nipple (horizontally).  The pain has feels like sort of a discomfort rather than sharpand like a 4 out of 10 on the pain scale.   I have noticed that I get it bad the next day if I go out and smoke a lot. Went to the doctor about 3 months ago and he said I should quite smoking.  he listened to my chest and found nothing wrong.  Tonight laying in bed, after smoking a ton because I've been studying for a huge exam, I feel a sharp pain (7/10) around the same area but now on my back on just short of maximum inspiration.   Maybe around the 7-9th rib.  No pain on twisting my torso or moving around at all.  I've noticed shortness of breath lately, but I have been smoking alot this past two weeks (much more than usual) which I guess is from that.    I understand it could be a muscle since I have been sitting on a bed studying for my exam for a bout 10 hours a day for the past 2.5 weeks with probably not the best posture.   But it just doesn't feel like a muscle.  anyway, no GI symptoms or anything else significant.  I know I could have two separate problems.  But the intermittent chest pain in the front is really starting to bug me and with the pain on breathing in on the back, I am starting to worry.   I feel like I need an MRI or CT just so I know I don't have cancer.  I am quitting smoking after the exam because I just can't stand it.   Any insight is appreciated, thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  According to your description pleurisy is more likely to the cause of your symptoms. Pleurisy is an inflammation of the pleura, the double layered membrane that covers the lung.   The condition is due to viral infection in most of the cases, or other lung lesions nearby the pleura causing its irritation and inflammation. Smoking decrease the local immunity of the respiratory system and predispose to recurrent chest infections.  The pain is felt like sharp pain on one side or less commonly in both sides, it increases with deep breath. The pain usually stops once you hold your breath and result in rapid, shallow breathing.   The condition gradually improves with rest, plenty of fluid. NSAID can help reduce the pain.   If you have a productive Cough with yellowish or greenish sputum, or Fever, you should visit your doctor immediately to receive the proper medical care.   Another causes to be excluded or may coexist is: Overexertion of the chest wall muscles or their inflammation as a part of viral infection like flu or cold results also in Chest pain, the pain is usually aggravated with certain moves and is usually associated with tenderness over the affected muscles. Muscle  Pain due to wrong maintained postures are also possible and gives similar clinical picture.  Chest X-ray would be helpful if there is any doubt on clinical examination.\n\n",

    "content": "I just thought I was post here because I have been experiencing a similar problem for around a week and I am trying to decide how worried I should be.  I can't really specify an area that hurts aside from the lower left side of my chest.  The pain increases when I take a deep breath, and especially if I stretch or twist my body to the right.  If I take a deep breath and press on my rib cage on the left side just as it starts to taper that is I guess where I would say there is the most pain.  I only experience pain in that portion of my chest, and only when I am inhaling deeply and turning my body.  I might also mention that this pain started almost immediately after I recovered from a rather nasty chest cold.  The pain seems to be the least in the morning, but then throughout the day will continue to get worse, although never more than I would say a 5/10 type of pain.  I am a smoker, but have significantly cut back on my tobacco use since this has happened, although obviously I know this isn't a cure I was hoping it might help some.  Anyhow, any thoughts on this?\n\n",

The rash starts as reddish bumps that  turn into blisters in few days. The blisters usually crust over and fall off in 7 - 10 days while the pain may last longer.  Other causes of nerve compression or irritation should be excluded. Your pain is not typical for cardiac causes, however in any type of chest pain, cardiac causes should be exclude.

But the gas and palpitation throbbing were there.  -\tOn 30.10.2006 I again went to (another) doctor (2) in the same hospital with same complaints as above in addition to right side chest congestion and throbbing / palpitation on temples.  She told it could be due to acidity and advised me to go for a walk for an hour daily and prescribed Seczole DS tablet and Digene syrup (for acidity).  It could also not give me much relief.  -\tWent to doctor (1) on 10.11.2006 with the same complaints.  He prescribed 5 Alprazolam capsules in addition to digene syrup.  I could feel better for a week.  -\tIn the meantime I started walking for 20-30 minutes daily and drastically decreased salt intake.  -\tWent to doctor (2) on 21.11.2006 with same complaints in addition to spasm/congestion in right side of the chest and palpitation/throbbing on both the temples and hands and sometimes cheeks and lips.  She measured my BP which was 140/90 and prescribed Omeprazole capsules + alprazolom for three weeks and asked me to under go Hb, S. Cholesterol and Blood Sugar tests.  Further she referred me to specialist.  The report of the tests are as under: Hb - \t14.0 gm Blood Sugar\t-\t96 mg% S. Cholesterol-\t162 mgm or % (?)

After a two-day brisk walk I started pain on neck. After some minutes it disappeared.  -\tWith all these problems, I went to a private Chest Specialist on 27.11.2006 with explaining all these complaints, who in turn told that it could be due to the enthusiastic brisk walk, myopia chest.  He advised Chest-P X-ray, ECG, Chest-l x-ray which turned out normal (the technical at ECG told that some irregularity was there but otherwise almost and further asked to consult cardiologist!)  First the chest specialist prescribed Ocid, Cobadex fate, Nucoxica, Volini gel for 7 days.  But I went with the test results the next day.  He examined the X-ray and told that its not clear so that I should get HT-CT Scan Chest test done (which I cannot bear) with prescribing Tramadol, Nucoxia, Belriesol, Parbodac, Ocid and Equirex to take twice a day. I took two doses but it was intoxicating and left them.  But I felt that there was no pain. He further advised not to walk or do any exercise but other docts insist on walking/exercise. -\tThe next day I went to the dispensary where the doctor again told that they are all waste and asked me to continue what she prescribed earlier, omeprazol, alprazolom and syrup atonic constipation. For last 10 days I am having constipation. Thereafter the case is same.  -\tThe first reason Gas seems to be reducing. But the occasional pain on left upper chest, precipitation of blood all over the body, palpitation/vibration/numbness in left cheek, left temple and occasionally on lips (left), forehead continues in addition to recent (today) occasional pricking pain (for a second or two) in the middle of chest and discomfort.    PLEASE HELP ME OUT BY ADVISING  -\tWHAT EXACTLY IS MY PROBLEM -\tIS IT HEART-RELATED? -\tIS IT LUNG RELATED? -\tIS IT GASTRIC RELATED OR ANYTHING ELSE -\tIS IT DUE TO STRESS/ANXIETY -\tCAN B.P. BE CURABLE? -\tSHOULD I UNDER GO FURTHER TESTS, IF YES, WHAT KIND OF TESTS  THANK YOU VERY MUCH IN ADVANCE\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The chest contains many organs, like the heart, lungs with its pleural covering, esophagus, muscles, ribs, tendons, and nerves. They all can be the source of the pain felt in the chest.  Your symptoms may be due to one of these causes:  - Pleurisy is an inflammation of the pleura, which is a double-layered membrane covers the lungs separating it from the rib cage. Viral infections like flu, are the most common cause of Pleurisy. The pain is felt as sharp pain which get worse by Coughing, sneezing, moving and deep breathing. auscultation of the chest shows a characteristic sound known as pleural rub.   -Overexertion of the chest wall muscles (e.g.excess coughing)or their inflammation as a part of viral infection like flu or cold results also in Chest pain, the pain is usually aggravated with certain moves and is usually associated with tenderness over the affected muscles. Pain due to rib or chest wall bone disease is also another cause of Chest pain.   -Sometimes chest pain is not originating from the chest itself, instead it is due to problems in the digestive tract. These problems include gastritis and gastric ulcer, gall bladder disease, GERD.  People with GERD present with severe pain and discomfort in the chest in the morning. Others may experience a feeling like tightness in the throat, neck pain, dry Cough and Shortness of breath similar to Asthma.   Stress and smoking can increase these symptoms. Certain foods as well are known to aggravate the condition, and you better avoid them.   -Psychological or emotional stress and Anxiety, in these cases the diagnosis is made by exclusion of other causes.   -Cardiac causes, should be excluded in any case of Chest pain although it is likely to be in your case (young age, non  typical symptoms).  Investigations include: ECG X-ray chest\n\n",

They all can be the source of the pain felt in the chest.   - Cardiac causes, should be excluded in any case of Chest pain especially if the pain is similar to that caused by cardiac ischemia although less likely to be the cause in your case (young age with no risk factors and no typical symptoms). Some other cardiac causes like Mitral valve prolapse give pain that may be similar to that of ischemic heart disease and is usually associated with palpitation. These conditions should be investigated by ECG, stress ECG, Echocradiography and Cardiac catheter if needed.   -Muscle spasm alone can cause this pain which can be an unidentified cause but in many cases is the result of viral infection, inappropriate posture for long time like traveling, driving and certain types of work.   -Sometimes Chest pain is not originating from the chest itself; instead it is due to problems in the digestive tract. These problems include IBS, Gastritis and Gastric ulcer, gall bladder disease, GER.   Regarding the Vertigo, or dizziness sensation when climbing, it is usually a result of problems in the inner or neurovascular disorder like postural hypotension. It is probably a separate problem not related to the chest pain  Direct clinical examination is essential.  I advise you to follow with your Doctor for proper management.  Best regards.\n\n",

Shingle is due to reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus (the virus causes chickenpox),  in the dorsal root ganglia when the immune system is lowered , e.g. during periods of stress.  Typically patients with shingles present with a painful, blistering rash along dermatome of the affected nerve, however, the pain may starts a few days before the appearance of the rash (preherpetic neuralgia).   The rash starts as reddish bumps that  turn into blisters in few days. The blisters usually crust over and fall off in 7 - 10 days while the pain may last longer.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "title": "chest and esophagus pain and blood in spit",
    "content": "I am a 24 year old male, and I have no history of any serious medical conditions. However, over the past 6 months I have developed a chronic chest pain.  I have had a chest xray, and an echocardiogram - they are both fine.  Also, the pain does not subside with acid indigestion tablets.  The pain usually increases with stress. During the past week, I have noticed blood in my phelgm in the morning. I have also had a sore throat and cold the last week.  I have absolutely no cough, no fever, and no joint or other bodily pains.  There is no blood coming from my nose.  I was wondering whether the blood in phlegm was related to my chest pains (given that the chest xray and the echocardiogram was fine).   I do not have health insurance, however I will be going back to the UK in 3 months, and will be covered there.  Should I wait until I get back, or see a doctor without health insurance before I go?  Also, could this be an ulcer?  Thanks for your help,  Nick\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  It would have been more helpful if you described more the character of this pain and if there are other related symptoms or signs. However I would give you a general idea about what it could be.   The chest contains many organs, like the heart, lungs with its pleural covering, esophagus, muscles, ribs, tendons, and nerves. They all can be the source of the pain felt in the chest.   Possible causes include: - Pleurisy is an inflammation of the pleura, which is a double-layered membrane covers the lungs separating it from the rib cage. Viral infections like flu, are the most common cause of Pleurisy. The pain is felt as sharp pain which get worse by Coughing, sneezing, moving and deep breathing. Auscultation of the chest shows a characteristic sound known as pleural rub.  If you are smoker or allergic then the possibility of having recurrent attacks is high.  - Sometimes Chest pain is not originating from the chest itself; instead it is due to problems in the digestive tract. These problems include IBS, Gastritis and Gastric ulcer, gall bladder disease, GER. Although you mentioned that you have received medicines for indigestion, the possibility is still there.  Coughing up of blood or bloody mucus is mainly from the lungs and throat (respiratory tract) and is usually bright red ( to the contrary of dark Brown color for blood from GI origin). Having sore throat and cold recently make the possibility of throat or postnasal as they are inflamed and the blood vessels are congested and can easily bled.  Investigations include: Complete blood count Coagulation studies such as PT or PTT Chest x-ray Chest CT scan  Hope you find this information useful, Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you very much for your quick response. I will describe the pain in my chest.  It is a dull constant sensation, as though a rock was stuck in my rib cage.  It does not get worse or better with exercise, however it gets worse with stress.  The pain radiates very strongly to my neck and sometimes to my back.  Could this be an ulcer, and if it is, can the blood be coming from that?  Or would you say that it is more likely that the blood is coming from a sore throat?  Finally, if this is an ulcer, should I get it treated right away, or do you think it can wait until I get back to the UK? Best, Nick\n\n",

Along with the upset I start to have green poop and each time it got dark and darker. the other day I woke up with a pain in my right arm... And now My left today... both still there. Sometimes there is pains in the center of my chest too and 2 weeks ago for 3 days it felt like there was a lump there.  Crazy thing is that I was on Zoloft for 4 weeks and stopped taking it to see if that was the source of all my problems. 4 days later and it seems it's getting worse :(  My mom tries to conivnce me that it's all anxiety because my family has a history of it but I still try to convince her that it would be smart for me to go get examined by my physician.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Alryth, The chest contains many organs, like the heart, lungs with its pleural covering, esophagus, muscles, ribs, tendons, and nerves. They all can be the source of the pain felt in the chest. Overexertion of the chest wall muscles or their inflammation as a part of viral infection like flu or cold results also in chest pain, the pain is usually aggravated with certain moves and is usually associated with tenderness over the affected muscles. Pain due to rib or chest wall bone disease is also another cause of chest pain. They are also tenderness over the affected areas.  In all of these conditions the chest pain is usually aggravated by taking deep breath and cough. Inflammation of the pleura covering the lung gives a sharp pain that is associated with cough and is more severe when taking deep breath.  Sometimes chest pain is not originating from the chest itself; instead it is due to problems in the digestive tract. These problems include IBS, gastritis and gastric ulcer, gall bladder disease, GER.  Pain due to gastritis increase either after fasting or after meals, while pain due to gall bladder disorder is felt on the right side of the upper abdomen and is associated with fatty meals.  You need to be examined by your doctor, since the pain you described can be any of these causes. Only by complete history and physical examination your doctor can reach the right diagnosis and provide you the proper management. Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Heartburn (pyrosis) is an extremely common symptom, occurring in 7% of Americans on a daily basis and in approximately one-third on a monthly basis.  Heartburn is usually defined as a feeling of burning below the sternum that radiates toward the neck from the epigastrium. Patients may use other terms including \"indigestion\" and \"acid regurgitation.\" Heartburn commonly occurs within an hour of meals or within 2 hours of reclining, especially if the patient has eaten a late snack.  Heartburn is commonly caused by the regurgitation of gastric acidic contents into the esophagus.  Pregnant women are commonly affected. Heartburn may be precipitated by foods that either decrease the lower esophageal sphincter pressure or cause direct mucosal irritation of the esophagus. It may also be precipitated by maneuvers that increase intraabdominal pressure (eg, lifting, bending, straining at stool, and exercise). Cigarettes potentiate heartburn by lowering the lower esophageal sphincter pressure and through relaxation of the sphincter during air swallowing.  Patients with a dominant complaint of heartburn are likely to have gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). However, in patients who complain of a number of symptoms including heartburn and other associated dyspeptic symptoms (eg, pain, bloating, nausea), the diagnosis of GERD is less certain.   Empiric antisecretory drug therapy can be initiated in patients that are not considered at high risk of dangerous disease (such as GI cancer, peptic ulcer).  In all patients, management includes avoidance of ulcerogenic agents (including alcohol), patient reassurance, stress reduction and smoking cessation. All empiric drug trials should be stopped after 6 to 8 weeks, and endoscopy should be performed if symptoms return or continue.[1]  If you have stopped drinking, avoid other ulcerogenic substances and are not smoking then I would strongly recommend that you pay another visit to your doctor and let him know that the antisecretory medication has not been useful. He may recommend further investigations. Once properly diagnosed the condition is reversible in most cases.  References: ========== 1.

    "content": "Hello. I am a 19 year old, active female, 5'3\", 160 pounds. For about the past week, I've had problems breathing. It's like I feel better when I'm not breathing, if that makes sense. I can't get enough breath, and when I'm breathing, it seems very shallow. I can't inhale as deeply as I feel I need to, even when I'm yawning. I don't know if this is related, but I also have had this bizarre insomnia, there have been 3-4 nights this week already where I literally have been awake all night, not one of those doze off and wake up, but literally unable to sleep. I was diagnosed a couple years ago with anxiety, with rare episodes of panic attacks (it's not a major problem anymore) and the only other thing I have is IBS,and I had my tonsils out when I was 7. My blood pressure is generally a bit lower than average. I'm taking Valtrex for frequent facial cold sores, and Yasmin birth control. If you can think of anything, please respond. Thank you!\n\n",

His X-ray shows Fibrotic opacities. He is currently feeling weak and have cold like symptoms in the evenings with chest tightness and pin pricking like sensations. His breathing is also not smooth. He is also having some phlegm. All tests are normal except for the PFT.

    "content": "Hi Leena, Asthma typically presents with abnormal PFT's. Fibrotic Opacities may represent old granuloma disease (associated with TB), and may indicate findings that are suggestive of prior TB (inactive) but an assessment can not be accurately made by one chest xray alone. Generally speaking, regarding this matter, sputum smears (AFB) are completed for identification of active rather than latent disease. If the nodules (fibrotic opacities) are calcified, and have not changed, it would be less concerning. However, if calcifications were not stated or areas have changed, taking into consideration that he is feeling unwell, in my opinion, further follow up would be indicated with some diagnostic studies, ie., serial AFB's, and CT Scan. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

During Puberty, many dramatic changes take place in the body.  Many adolescents during sexual maturity develop Gynecomastia which is a true mammary breast tissue is formed and felt as a swelling under the nipple. Slight tingling and vibrations are commonly associated symptoms during these changes.  They usually regress spontaneously. Steroid hormones (as used in asthmatics) and other drugs can increase the size of the breast tissue.\n\n",

At times I can also feel the tightness in my upper abdomen, just below my sternum.  At times this tightness is accompanied by tingly feelings in the fingers, feet and face.  I also get pain in my left arm near my triceps and the back of my left shoulder.  I sleep on my left side every night if that means anything.  I have had several stress tests that have all come back negative as well as multiple chest xrays.  Years ago I had an echo, but that was long before I started to have this chest tightness.  It came back fine.  What should I do at this point?  On days that I don't have the tightness, I am able to exercise without issue, but on days with the tightness I get fatigued very quickly.  My cardiologist is reluctant to do a cardiac cath with the negative stress tests.  I greatly appreciate any insight that you can bring to my condition.\n\n",

    "title": "strange chest/body symptoms, very scared",
    "content": "I am a 25 year old male. I do not smoke, drink, or do drugs. I have been very physically active for the last 2 years having completed a marathon and 1/2 marathon in fairly good times. Recently, about 3 months ago, I began getting tired. I thought that maybe I just needed a rest so I cut back on the exercise. Prior to these last two years I was a fairly fat fellow and had finally had enough and got in shape. Around wednesday last week I began to feel really run down. As the days went on I felt worse and worse. On saturday I woke up and had some pretty strange numbness in both of my arms and some upper chest pain that seems to generate more to the left. I also get pain in both of my arms. It is mostly stabbing pain or perhaps a dull ache. It presists for a long period of time and seems to go away if I lay down awhile. I am also having pain in many areas all over my body that seem to go from dull to sharp stabbing. I also had some pretty extreme weakness at times during the week. As the week has gone on the numbness has seemed to have been greatly reduced but still present in a reduced form. Most of the random pain remains, most notably in the chest. I went to the doctor on sunday and she told me my heart and lungs sounded fine and my blood pressure was good. I have never had blood taken before but she sent me for tests. They took 6 vials out of me and I am still waiting for the results. The pain I get in my chest does not seem to be a very deep pain, and seems to be affected if I rub the area. I realize that both heart attacks and angina shouldn't be affected by touching, but this pain seems to be. I was wondering if anyone could give me any idea what this could be if not a heart related. Or if it could be heart related and I should get myself to the emergency room now and avoid delay. I do not suffer any shortness of breath and can seem to remain active during this pain. The weakness seems to have passed for the most part and I would like to resume jogging but I am afraid of dropping dead in my tracks. Oh and a possible unrelated note in the last week or so I seem to have developed a small cold. It doesn't really seem to affect my chest at all and is more of a 'back of the throat/nose' type cold so I would guess it's unrelated but am unsure. Having been fairly healthy my entire life, even when fat, I am really scared about what is happening to me. I would like to thank anyone who gives me any reply to this.\n\n",

In your condition, Viral infection and an associated muscle pain and spasm are more likely to be the cause. The throat and ear problems are  mostly of viral origin and your other constitutional symptoms are due to viremia.  In addition to the specific treatment of the underlying cause, In these cases, Rest for maximum two days is also beneficial.   Home treatment includes the use of analgesics, cold or hot therapy. Eating well and a healthy diet are also helpful.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear MyHeadHurts,  It would have been more helpful if you described more the character of this pain and if there are any other related symptoms or signs. However I would give you a general idea about what it could be.  The chest contains many organs, like the heart, lungs with its pleural covering, esophagus, muscles, ribs, tendons, and nerves. They all can be the source of the pain felt in the chest.  - It sounds like muscle spasm is the cause of your symptoms.  Muscle spasm alone can cause this pain which can be an unidentified cause but in many cases is the result of inappropriate posture for long time like traveling, driving and certain types of work.  Self care and avoiding the precipitating cause will lead to a gradual but clear improvement in the pain. Home treatment includes the use of analgesics, cold or hot therapy. Rest for maximum two days is also beneficial.  If these measures fail to relief the pain or to improve symptoms in 48 hours, you should visit your doctor for better evaluation and for exclusion of other causes that need specific therapy.  Other causes should be excluded like:  Pleurisy is an inflammation of the pleura, which is a double-layered membrane covers the lungs separating it from the rib cage. Viral infections like flu, are the most common cause of pleurisy. The pain is felt as sharp pain which get worse by coughing, sneezing, moving and deep breathing.auscultation of the chest shows a characteristic sound known as pleural rub.  Sometimes chest pain is not originating from the chest itself; instead it is due to problems in the digestive tract. These problems include IBS, gastritis and gastric ulcer, gall bladder disease, GER.  Cardiac causes, should be excluded in any case of Chest pain although it is likely to be in your case (young age, non  typical symptoms).\n\n",

    "content": "Dear queenkrs,  - Abnormal Lymph node enlargement tends to commonly result from infection / immune response, cancer and less commonly due to infiltration of macrophages filled with metabolite deposits (eg, storage disorders).   Sometimes, following infection Lymph nodes occasionally remain permanently enlarged, though they should be (peripheral nodes) non-tender, small (less the 1 cm), have a rubbery consistency and none of the characteristics described for malignancy or for infection. These are also known as 'Shotty Lymph nodes'.   Nodes are generally considered to be normal if they are up to 1 cm in diameter; however, some authors suggest that epitrochlear nodes larger than 0. 5 cm or inguinal nodes larger than 1. 5 cm should be considered abnormal.   - The occurrence of significant mediastinal lymphadenopathy together with Lung infections like TB is well known. CT characteristics of enlarged mediastinal nodes can help in prediction the benign from the malignant enlargement. Of these characters is the size comes first, the location and the clinical and the past history of the patient.  An increase in nodal size on serial examinations is significant. Hence nodes that continue to grow in size are to be more investigated with biopsy.  Follow up with your doctor is essential. Hope you find this information useful. Keep us updated.

    "title": "Chest, left arm, neck tightness.",
    "content": "I'm a 23/male.  Heart disease runs in my family, my father died of a heart attack almost 2 years ago.  His blood pressure was quite high although I do not know the exact number, and he had high blood pressure most of his life.  I completed an 18 week treatment of acne with accutane 2 weeks ago.  About a week ago I noticed a tightning in my left arm under the bicep and along the top of my forearm and in my ring and pinky fingers.  I would not call the senstion 'numb', however it is more like my arm is beginning to fall asleep and is tight or tense.  Also I have noticed white/red spots on my palms a majority of the time.  I'm not losing feeling or getting the pins and needles sensation, nor is my arm becoming cold.  When I wake up in the morning my arm feels fine but as I begin my day my arm tightens up again and usually stays that way all day ranging from quite noticeable to barely-noticeable.  Now a week later my arm is still tight and occasionally I feel a tightness in my chest about 2 from my nipple towards my sternum.  Today especially there is a tightness in my middle/left back and also up along my neck to the back of my head.  I'm not sure what any of this means and have been quite concerned since I started to notice these things.  Another problem is that I cannot stop thinking about it and am constantly thinking about worse case possibilities.  A year ago I had a street done with nuclear pictures which came up negative and also have had blood tests monthly which come up normal on every account.  The only high number is my Trygl. which have a baseline of about 211.  Accutane raises that number and I think my last blood test a month ago was at 260, however after treatment is done (as is my case) that number begins to fall back to its baseline.  I have made an app. to see my Dr. on Fri. morning but the tightning feeling in my left arm, neck/head and middle/left back today has gotten me quite concerned.  Please respond with any insight to this asap.  Thanks.\n\n",

Muscle spasm is a body reaction to injury in tissues Causes of muscle injury include: Traumatic Muscle fatigue  Heavy exercise  Flu Metabolic abnormalities like low Magnesium level and Hypocalcemia  In these cases, Physical therapy, home care and proper posture will lead to a gradual but clear improvement in the pain. Home treatment includes the use of analgesics, cold or hot therapy. Rest for maximum two days is also beneficial.  She is not eating well and a healthy diet is also helpful.  I advise you to follow up with her consultant (expertise in Muscular Dystrophy ). Clinicians familiar with the disease are more aware if these symptoms follow the damage of  the weakening muscles resulting in this severe pain.  If spinal or bone problems are expected MRI is of choice.  Hope you find this information useful. Best regards,\n\n",

I ussally do not get shortness of breath during the pain but simple things such as cleaning a room seem to suck the air right out of me. I also feel over heated all the time and am sweating real easy. I have minor Diarrhea. Any help would be great. Thank you! P.S.        It has got to the point I can't even work out. If I get my heart rate going it just hurts more and more. My dad thinks it my be gas. My mom thinks it may be a bone out of place. I am getting a doctors appointment but it is rather imbarrassing at work unable to do something with out losing my breath and sweating real bad.\n\n",

    "content": "Dea Dllamb,  The chest contains many organs, like the heart, lungs with its pleural covering, esophagus, muscles, ribs, tendons, and nerves. They all can be the source of the pain felt in the chest.  According to your description, the cause of your symptoms is more likely to be due to::  - Pleurisy is an inflammation of the pleura (the membrane covers the lung) , which is a double-layered membrane covers the lungs separating it from the rib cage.   Viral infections like flu, are the most common cause of pleurisy. The pain is felt as sharp pain which get worse by coughing, sneezing, moving and deep breathing. Auscultation of the chest shows a characteristic sound known as pleural rub.  Diarrhea could be also part of the viral infection.  The condition gradually improves with rest, plenty of fluid. NSAID can help reduce the pain.   If you have a productive Cough with yellowish or greenish sputum, or high Fever, you should visit your doctor immediately to receive the proper medical care.   - Overexertion of the chest wall muscles (spasm) or their inflammation as a part of viral infection like flu or cold results also in Chest pain, the pain is usually aggravated with certain moves and is usually associated with tenderness over the affected muscles. Pain due to rib or chest wall bone disease is also another cause of Chest pain.   I advise you to follow up with your doctor, only by complete history and physical examination, the correct diagnosis can be reached.   Hope you find this information useful. Keep us updated.

    "content": "Hi I am a 23year old male. And in the last 5 months I've been getting chest pain around the left side of my chest. The pain is almost of that of your back feeling like its being ripped apart. It has also progressed into my back and that hurts from my mid back up over my ribs to where the chest pain is. I have had 2 EKGS. An echo and a CAT SCAN. All of which came back normal except the cat scan which showed a a small nodule in my upper left lung. My doctor says its probably nothing and wants a follow up scan in 6 months. However since last night the pain progressed down into my left abdomine which also hurts now. The pain usually comes and goes in about 15-30 minutes or so. However i got the pain last night and its still here this morning. Anyone have any ideas maybe something my doctor isnt thinking about. Also im not sure if its got anything to do with it but i have been getting frequent nose bleeds atleast twice a week. If anyone has any idea what might be wrong or how i can treat it let me know its painful and consistent and i could do without it. Thanks\n\n",

Careful history, examination and abdominal US can help in the diagnosis.  Having bleeding tendency, mandate complete blood picture and other blood tests to search for an underlying cause.  Cardiac causes, should be excluded in any case of chest pain as your doctor did. Other tests to exclude cardiac causes include Stress ECG, cardiac catheter and Echocardiography.   The lung nodule in the upper part of the left lung is to be followed up by CT chest regularly although it is a remote possibility to be the cause of the pain, but it may be related to the underlying problem if any is discovered later.

Process,  Actually it sounds strange for me to relate these symptoms to the Pasta, however, food is a well known cause (allergen) of many allergic symptoms like throat irritation leading to cough . If the condition is repeated you have to be investigated for food allergies. In such cases nothing can help like avoidance of the allergen.   Similar symptoms are related to GERD. In such cases the reflux of irritant components in the esophagus and the throat results in cough and  throat and chest pain. Certain foods are known to aggravate the condition including chocolate, beverages containing caffeine, fatty and fried foods, garlic and onions, spicy and tomato containing foods.   I advise you to be checked by your doctor for proper management. Keep us updated.  Best regards,\n\n",

I have found,  in trials I have conducted in my diet, that salt that contains iodine seem to provoke the response that I experienced and reported in my original message posted on this site.  I am hypothyroid, and do understand that iodine is prospectively an issue in my metabolism.  I have had some testing done by a immunologist, with no siginificantly conclusive information provided regarding food allergies.  Apparently, I have some sort of intolerance of seafoods, including bivalve mollusks.  The suspicion is, again, iodine, in my most humble non-medical opinion.  The good doc advised me to diligently observe my physical response when I change dietary intake, and to avoid foods that appear to cause intolerance.  It has been suggested that I do not produce the necessary digestive enzymes required to metabolize shellfish.  Thank you, again, for the courtesy of your response.\n\n",

Since last december ive had a pain in my right lung but only at the very top near my shoulder. It hurts when i breath in, not so much when i breath out.  Ive had a chest x-ray done but there was nothing, the doctor seems to think its just a muscle.  Its so deep inside and not a pain that need pain medication its just there all the time. If i stick out my chest or move my arm in a certain way i can feel it but it just doesn't feel like a muscle.  I do smoke and have quit several times but just keep starting up.  Just want to know if i should be worried and go back to the doctors.  Can this really be a muscle?                                                           Thanks, Delcy\n\n",

    "content": "Dear help22,  During Puberty, many dramatic changes take place in the body. Many adolescents during sexual maturity develop gynecomastia which is a true mammary breast tissue is formed and felt as a swelling under the nipple.   The lumps are felt as firm swelling under the nipple which may be painful and tender if they grow rapidly. The condition is known to run in families.  They usually regress spontaneously. Steroid hormones (as used in asthmatics)  and other drugs can increase the size of the breast tissue.  In any case clinical examination is very essential for differential diagnosis of any palpable mass especially if the associated symptoms are not indicative of any possible diagnosis.   I advise you to be examined by a doctor. Only by complete history and physical examination, the correct diagnosis can be reached.   Best regards,\n\n",

    "title": "Chest Pain",
    "content": "Hello,   I have seen several drs and have had xrays for both chest & upper gi and an EKG.  All has come back normal and drs are starting to treat me as though I am nuts.  I am in pain and am finding it hard to do anything.  Drs are having me take anti-inflammatory's for inflamed cartiledge or possibly inflammed sac around heart (that of course sounds terrible to me) and telling me to heat chest area & to rest.  I have been doing this for several days and the pain/heaviness is just getting worse.  Here are my symptoms and the history of when they started:  -Sharp pain in chest started on a regular basis two weeks ago when moving, twisting in bed, wearing a bra, or upon inhaling - after inhaling several deep breaths pain subsides slowly. -Felt heaviness in chest first night - upon exercising for about 2 hours in middle of night, pain went away, exercised more the next several days, may have over done it. -Been feeling very cold - even when dressed in multiple layers and with covers.  Drank a shot on New Years Eve - body got very chilled - stayed under covers for several hours and  took a very hot bath - before I got back to normal. -Felt lots of fatigue next day, layed around house, tried to stay warm. -Next day felt little better and took down christmas decorations - moved a few heavy things - then went to movies, where I started to feel very warm and chilled at the same time, and started to feel an overwhelming heaviness in my chest (especially on right side). -Woke-up following day with swollen upper stomach (very weird) -Since then, I have had a very uncomfortable heaviness in my chest that continues to get worse and still have the swollen upper stomach (can't get bra on and am very uncomfortable).  Now,  just the pressure of my breasts laying on my chest, leads to episodes of not being able to breath without deeply inhaling and my chest now feels heavy all the time (even feel the heaviness when on the anti-inflammatory meds). -Now starting to feel soarness/heaviness in my back (both upper, shoulders, and around ribs).  Note, may have something to do with symptoms, I have always had a sternum that abnormally sticks out.  When laying down - it sticks up out of my skin.  Mentioned this to drs, they said \"yeah, that is abnormal\" and nothing else about it.  Could I be experiencing liver problems?  Can xrays determine liver problems?  What else could it possibly be?  How long would it take for the inflamming to get better?  Is it worth a trip to the emergency room or hospital so multiple tests can be done to determine what is going on?  The anti-infammatory meds do take some of the discomfort away, but they leave other unsatisfying symptoms, like heat through my head (ringing in ears and pressure around ears) and heartburn pain.  Plus, when they wear-off the heaviness is back or much worse.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear sosweet,  The symptoms you have described are very suggestive of viral infection and muscle pain and spasm.  Muscle spasm is a body reaction to injury in tissues Causes of muscle injury include: Muscle fatigue  Heavy exercise  Flu Metabolic abnormalities like low Magnesium level and Hypocalcemia Hypoparathyroidism  The correct diagnosis is easier when other symptoms exist. In your situation, Viral infection and an associated muscle pain and spasm are more likely to be the cause.  Self care and avoiding the precipitating cause will lead to a gradual but clear improvement in the pain. Home treatment includes the use of analgesics, cold or hot therapy. Rest for maximum two days is also beneficial.  I advise you to follow up with your doctor. Only by complete history and physical examination, the correct diagnosis can be reached.

Three weeks later the chest pains have not sudsided and I was experiencing other symptoms, like diarrhea, and body/muscle aches. I didn't have a fever or coughing or anything else. I went to another doctor and she said that I probably have a virus. She said that maybe the cartilidge in ny chest was sore (?!), but when I got home I started doing some more research on the internet and now I am not so sure. I'm about 80% better but still not 100%. My question is what does the bloodwork test for? Does it show if I have a viral infection? Mono, Bacteria, STD? Do I have to go back to the doctor for to find out what kind of virus I have?

    "content": "Dear bestwriter,  It would be of great help if you could describe more the character of that pain, (nature , exact site, exaggerating factors, other associated symptoms and signs).  The chest contains many organs, like the heart, lungs with its pleural covering, esophagus, muscles, ribs, tendons, and nerves.  They all can be the source of the pain felt in the chest.   Inflammation of the pleura (pleurisy) covering the lung gives a sharp pain that is associated with Cough and is more severe when taking deep breath. Viral infection is the commonest cause of Pleurisy.  You mentioned that there were also diarrhea, and body/muscle aches, which makes the viral infection more likely to be the cause.  Overexertion of the chest wall muscles or their inflammation as a part of viral infection like flu or cold results also in Chest pain, the pain is usually aggravated with certain moves and is usually associated with tenderness over the affected muscles. Pain due to rib or chest wall bone disease is also another cause of Chest pain.   Cardiac causes, should be excluded in any case of chest pain with symptoms similar to that of cardiac ischemia (I can not tell from the information you have given how related they are to cardiac causes).   Sometimes Chest pain is not originating from the chest itself; instead it is due to problems in the digestive tract. These problems include IBS, Gastritis,  these medical problems are usually related to meals and are not related to deep breath or physical exercises. In IBS, people complain of abdominal pain, diarrhea and or constipation attacks and gas.  I advise you to follow up with your doctor. Only by complete history and physical examination, the correct diagnosis can be reached.  Best regards,\n\n",

My next rhumatologist appointment is december 7th and should I just wait to bring it up then.    Oh and I'm on fertility meds, been on prometrium 400mg to induce a period for 10 days now, which is making me extrememly irritable, crying, and giving me abdominal pain.  Soon to go on Clomid.

Now I don't expect to be healthy overnight...I am sure I've done a great deal of damage to my poor body! I know all the \"usual\" things to expect when one quits, but I have never heard of the symptoms I have been experiencing:   --Sharp, stabbing pains under my right breast that sometimes start in the same place in my back (and then move through so I feel it under my breast, too); I also felt this on my left side once. Have never felt this while smoking...would have scared the smoke out of me! In both instances, these pains have been followed by belches...could it be merely gas??? They last for a 5-10 minutes, and have happened...so far...maybe once a day for the last three days. Sometimes I feel the same \"pain\" lingering there but it is not as sharp and stabbing.   --Same sharp pains in the right side of my throat, right in the crook of my neck! I experienced this WITH the pain mentioned above, and independent of it.   --I also have a white nodule looking thing on my left tonsil, and another just underneath it. I have been experiencing a burning-type sore throat as well.   I have also experienced what I understand to be typical post-quit symptoms: tingling in hands/arms, feet/lower legs; dizzyness, frequent clearning of the throat (no cough--yet); etc.   Also...I am on the patch...using Step 1, 21 mgs over 24 hours.   I have just moved into a new city/state less than a month ago and work from home. Consequently, I know no one and have no doctor...yet.   I will be visiting the Urgent Care center this afternoon for lack of knowing where else to turn...these symptoms are rather frightening and I have yet to find on online forums another ex-smoker who shares or shared these symptoms.   Any thoughts???   --Ex-smoker filled with regrets but determined never to give in to this addiction again!  P.S. I also posted this in the Chest Disease forum first...I tried to post here first, which is where it belongs, but did not see the POST NEW TOPIC button.  Apparently I had not logged in.

Stress can induce  muscle spasm which is another cause of the chest pain.  - Sore throat is one of the withdrawal symptoms that occur due to renewal of the damaged cells of the throat by the chronic chemical irritation.  - Stomach problems, Nausea, Constipation or Gas are common problems due to readjustment of the GI motility in the absence of nicotine.  Again, Stress and anxiety can cause or exaggerate the GI problems.  - Cough and expectoration which occur also temporarily after nicotine cessation.  However, these symptoms are usually temporary and disappear from few days to few weeks, if they increase in severity or persists more than expected, medical consultation and physical examination is important to investigate other possible causes.  Hope you find this information useful. Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Hello , I'm a 5 foot and 4 inch 18 year old in the US and I'm thinking that I'm losing my mind I usually go jogging everyday....but last week I for a really long time and I think I stressed out myslef. The problem is that from that day onwards...I cant control my mind. I seem to do voluntary breathing when I'm conscious and its difficult. I'm always monitoring my breathing which is making me feel some heaviness in my chest. I usually feel normal if I'm watching TV or doing something when I'm sitting or lying down. However, if I'm just walking around...all what I 'm doing is controlling my own breathing rythym and I cant make it an involuntary action. It may sound funny but its really hard to live with this. I hope that someone could send me some healing light to help me. Thanks Nev\n\n",

    "content": "Dear nev,   Breathing should be an unconscious process. Cause of breathing difficulties can be easily identified if other symptoms exist. From your symptoms anxiety is more likely to the cause.  Self-awareness of the breathing process and breathing difficulty can be symptoms of a panic attack which can occur in people experiencing too much anxiety.  If you do not have any other medical problems, then medications for anxiety will help in addition to the relaxation programs that your therapist can teach you.   I advise you  to consult your doctor for proper management.  Only by complete history and physical examination, the correct diagnosis can be reached.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Dear nayltek,  Although people with GAD tend to exaggerate their feelings, each complain should be taken seriously and investigated properly. Anxiety and emotional causes for any symptom should be considered only after exclusion of all other medical problems that can be the cause.  Shooting pain that goes down through the arm to the hand and fingers is more likely to be due to nerve or nerve root compression.   This can be caused by: Irritation of the nerve inside a joint in cases of arthritis.  Osteophytes which are bony outgrowths in the vertebral bodies that can press on the nerves while they go out of the spinal canal.  Herniated disc (Disc prolapse).  Carpal tunnel syndrome. Thoracic outlet syndrome.  Muscle stain and weakens associated with these conditions results in muscle pain that may be felt in the area of he affected muscle including the chest, shoulder, arm, and the hand.  Nerve compression is usually associated with numbness and parasthesia.  You need to be examined by your doctor for proper management. Only by complete history and physical examination, the correct diagnosis can be reached.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "For about 2 days now I have had a very sharp pain in my left shoulder. It started out mild and not very painful at all. Now it is so bad that I can't really pick up anything altho if I make myself pick it up it doesn't really hurt any more or less. I don't belive this is muscle related. It hurts the most when I lay on my left side or take a deep breath. The pain has been there all day but it tends to come and go. I have taken 800mg of motrin and that has not helped at all I have also tried taking 160mg of simethicone and that hasn't helped either. If I lay on my right side then it feels like it has gone away untill I move. If I lay on my back it hurts but I can live with it. Right now when I take a deep breath it feels like im being stabed in the shoulder and my lower left back hurts too. I don't know if I should go to the ER I don't have Health Insurance if it just might be gas.  I am 22 years old Male and Over weight. I have smoked in the past but do not currently at least for about 6 weeks now.  Otherwise in good health.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi all,          I have gone to the doctor a numerous amount of times to find the answer to a dull ache just left of the center of my chest.  I have had a stress test done and it came back negative but there was  a problem with me being fatigued after the test.  I am currently taking lisinopril and provanchol.  Every time I go to ER they tell me the same thing.  I didn't have a heart attack and it is probably muscular.  The one issue I have with that diagnosis is that the dull ache has continued off and on for 6 months.  I don't know where to go from here and if I should be worried about this.  The doctors have done multiple tests with x rays and ekg tests and all have come back negative.  The one other symptom I have is at night my heart beats very hard.  It almost feels like it is coming out of my chest while I am trying to relax.  I am a smoker and drink alcohol two times a week.  25 years old and do not exercise often but used to on a daily basis. If anyone could help me it would be much appreciative.                                                                                            Thank You\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Toledo025,  Lisinopril is a drug used to treat specific conditions like hypertension and congestive heart failure. I do not understand why this drug has been prescribed to you if all your tests are normal.  Pravachol is a drug that decrease the production of cholesterol aiming to reduce the risk of atherosclerosis, stoke and heart disease.  It would be very helpful if you can inform us about the reports of the results of your blood tests, ECG and the Stress ECG or any other investigations that have been done.  The chest contains many organs, like the heart, lungs with its pleural covering, esophagus, muscles, ribs, tendons, and nerves.  They all can be the source of the pain felt in the chest.    Cardiac causes, should be excluded in any case of chest pain especially if the pain is similar to that caused by cardiac ischemia. Some other cardiac causes like Mitral Valve prolapse give pain that may be similar to that of ischemic heart disease and is usually associated with palpitation.These conditions should be investigated by ECG, stress ECG, Echocradiography and cardiac catheter if needed.   Muscle spasm due to wrong movement or maintained wrong posture can cause muscle pain which can be felt as chest pain according to the affected muscles. However, the pain is related to movement and the affected muscles are painful upon pressing(tender).   Inflammation of the pleura (pleurisy) covering the lung gives a sharp pain that is associated with Cough and is more severe when taking deep breath. Viral infection is the commonest cause of Pleurisy.   Sometimes Chest pain is not originating from the chest itself; instead it is due to problems in the digestive tract. These problems include IBS, Gastritis and Gastric ulcer, gall bladder disease, GER. But these medical problems are usually related to meals and are not related to deep breath or physical exercises.   I advise you to be checked by a cardiologist. Only by complete history and physical examination, the correct diagnosis can be reached.  Best regards,\n\n",

Sometimes Chest pain is not originating from the chest itself; instead it is due to problems in the digestive tract. These problems include IBS, Gastritis and Gastric ulcer, GER.   The second complaint is more likely to be due to sciatica. Sciatica is felt as pain in the lower back or hip that radiates down to the back of one thigh and the leg. Sciatica in some people is felt like leg cramp that can last for long time, it may also result in limb weakness, numbness, or a burning or tingling sensation down the leg.   You have to be properly checked and investigated. Only by complete history, physical examination and investigations, the correct diagnosis can be reached. I advise you to follow up with your doctor and discuss with him the mentioned information and their possible contribution to your condition.  Best regards,\n\n",

You need to be examined by your doctor, since the pain you described can be any of these causes. Only by complete history and physical examination, the correct diagnosis can be reached.

    "content": "Dear rochmom,  Patients with symptoms after cholecystectomy similar to cholecystitis or gall bladder disease are known to have postcholecystectomy syndrome (PCS).   PCS is caused by alterations in bile flow as a result of removal of the gallbladder. The inappropriate bile flow leads to esophagitis and gastritis and or in others, diarrhea and colicky lower abdominal pain.  Causes include:  Residual or reformed gallbladder  Sphincter of Oddi dyskinesia, spasm, or hypertrophy  Sphincter of Oddi stricture   GI symptoms like swallowing difficulties may also happen due to duodenogastric reflux, a cholecystectomy sequel that is considered as a part of post cholecystectomy syndrome (functional bowel disorders).   Dizziness is a non specific symptoms that may be related to any of these complications, but to my knowledge there is no direct relation to  cholecystectomy.  Investigations include:  Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is used to check for esophagitis, including gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and for direct visualization of the ampulla of Vater.  An abdominal ultrasound to evaluate the liver, biliary tract, pancreas should be done.  I advise you to visit your doctor for proper management.  Hope you find this information helpful. Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Ok, this is gonna be a long one, and i didn't really know where to put it, so i hope someone can help.  Ok, first off I'm a 16 yr old male, and a bit of a hypocondriac. About 2 months ago, I felt a small lump on my left side of my neck half way between my shoulder and jaw. It feels like it was attached to muscle. I wasn't too worried, although i'd had the odd headache and dizzy spell in the month that followed. but after about a month it still hadn't gone down. So i started feeling around the rest of my neck, and found another lump, just tucked under my jaw below the ear, on the left again.   At this point i panicked, as i'd read all too many stories in those stupid women's magasines and online about harmless lumps turning out to be cancer. I looked into it on the internet and then proceeded to worry myself sick. I was convinced i had Hodkins disease. After much poking i discoved another lump on the right side of my neck, in the middle again, though a touch lower than the first one. This one felt a bit softer than the other two.  (at this point i should point out I don't know how long they'd been there, this was just when i found them.) Over the following 3 or 4 days as i waited to see the doctor i started to get headaches, dizzyness, and an achy neck. I also found another lump under my jaw on the right side, which felt like a couple of lumps on a string close together.  When i finally saw the doctor, he examined me and thought that i might have glandular fever, and sent me for a blood test to be sure. I was relieved that it was probably something else, even though my neck pains got worse and my tiredness increased for the week that followed. when by blood test results came back, they said i didn't have Glandular Fever, so I just  had a virus.  At this point i started to worry again. What if the doctor had missed something? The neck pains died down slightly and i felt a bit less tired. I had found another lump at the top of my neck on the left in line with my ear, slightly off centre from the middle of my head. It was tiny, and it could have always been there, but i started panicing again. I also found a larger lump, which feels more like a muscle, just above my collarbone on the right. It feels like it's a muscle because it's long rather than a lump. I get/got the odd twitch in in it like a little flinch in a muscle i can't control. It also feels connected to that lump in the middle of my neck on the right.  I also started to feel a shortness of breath at times. If i exerted myself it took me forever to catch my breath, and i could suddenly feel puffed out when i was standing still or even sitting down.l I started to get the odd chest pain, or a feeling of needing to cough when there was nothing to cough. I went back to the doctor, the fear of what could be wrong outweighing the fear of having \"NUTTER\" stamped on my personal file. He did a number of tests: i breathed into a tube thingy, he listened to my chest, he put a thing like a clothes peg on the end of finger to test the oxygen in my blood, and said everything was fine, i just  had a virus. but he sent me for an ECG to allay any fears he seemed to see i had.   I had the ECG yesterday and it showed up fine. In the past week between seeing the doctor and having the ECG i've also been feeling pains in my abdomen. I.'ve also noticed that the right side of my body feels tender to poke, both front and back, like it's become ticklish, which i don't feel on the left side. The chest pains, or heavy feeling has become more frequent, and since getting up today it's been pretty constant, although remaining very mind. I also noticed the big lump above my collar bone also seems to have a pea sized lump on it/beside it (can't tell). So if you're still reading, here's a sum-up:   I don't know what symtoms are connected, what's always been there, and what's just being over exagerrated in my head. Like i said i'm a big hypocondriac, and i'm still worried i have somthing seriously wrong with me, like cancer. Would my doctor have been able to rule it out and just hasn't told me? I can't go back to my doctor, i feel stupid enough as it is, but i need to know if i'm  being stupid or if i should get a second opinion.  thanks to anyone who's read this mammoth, i'd be immensely grateful for any help or putting my mind at rest.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear trolley,  The swellings you have described that are felt in both sides of the neck are probably enlarged lymph nodes as they occur in a lymph node region, however this must be confirmed by your physician.  Abnormal lymph node enlargement tends to commonly result from infection / immune response, cancer and less commonly due to infiltration of macrophages filled with metabolite deposits (eg, storage disorders).  Sometimes, following infection lymph nodes occasionally remain permanently enlarged, though they should be non-tender, small (less the 1 cm), have a rubbery consistency and none of the characteristics described for malignancy or for infection. These are also known as 'Shotty Lymph nodes'.  Nodes are generally considered to be normal if they are up to 1 cm in diameter; however, some authors suggest that epitrochlear nodes larger than 0.5 cm or inguinal nodes larger than 1.5 cm should be considered abnormal.  An increase in nodal size on serial examinations is significant. Hence nodes that continue to grow in size are important and those that regress in size tend to be more reassuring.   A Conventional  US study with or without Doppler can help in confirmation of the nature of this swelling.  CT scan  also would confirm the presence of a Lymph node.  The personal and medical history as well as the clinical examination gives a good idea about the possibility of this node to be of malignant Origin. Further investigations include, US guided FNAC or biopsy.  Anxiety can cause many somatic symptoms including headache, dizziness, abdominal, chest pain and breathing difficulty.  If your doctor had doubts that you have cancer he would not have waited to give you therapy.  Keep on follow up with your doctor and keep us updated. Best regards,\n\n",

It generally hurts worse with deep breaths and comes and goes. I also feel it in my back under my right shoulder blade.  I have a head cold right now, but no coughing.

    "content": "Dear Bayoukitty,  The chest contains many organs, like the heart, lungs with its pleural covering, esophagus, muscles, ribs, tendons, and nerves.  They all can be the source of the pain felt in the chest.   Inflammation of the pleura (pleurisy) covering the lung gives a sharp pain that is usually associated with Cough and is more severe when taking deep breath. Viral infection is the commonest cause of Pleurisy. Being a smoker makes you at more risk for repeated chest infections.  Overexertion of the chest wall muscles or their inflammation as a part of viral infection like flu or cold results also in Chest pain, the pain is usually aggravated with certain moves and is usually associated with tenderness over the affected muscles.  Carrying your baby for long time with a maintained posture results in  muscle pain due to muscle spasm.  Sometimes Chest pain is not originating from the chest itself; instead it is due to problems in the digestive tract. These problems include IBS, Gastritis and Gastric ulcer, gall bladder disease, GER. But these medical problems are usually related to meals and are not related to deep breath or physical exercises.   Regarding the morning chest symptoms that have increased recently after you stopped smoking, these may be related to nicotine withdrawal that can cause many symptoms including the chest pain. In such case however, Chest tightness is normaly felt for not more than few days.   Cardiac causes although are less likely to be the cause in your situation since the symptoms are very atypical to angina pain.   You need to be examined by your doctor, since the pain you described can be any of these causes. Only by complete history and physical examination, the correct diagnosis can be reached.

    "content": "Dear madhippychick,  Sarcoidosis in an inflammatory disease that primarily affects the lungs and lymph node.  Clinical manifestations are mainly chronic shortness of breath (dyspnea) and cough.  Other body organs can be affected by sarcoidosis; in order of frequency these organs are the liver, skin, heart, nervous system, and kidneys. In such cases, symptoms depend on the extent of the disease affection in each organ.  The pain you have described is more likely to be related to the disease itself in the lung, or due to affection of another system like the liver.  GI problems as an association of the disease or due to medications side effects can be another possibility.  I Advise you to take an appointment with a consultant, the pain that prevents you from sleeping well or in a normal position should be investigated properly for proper management.  I hope you find this information useful, keep us updated, Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "A few weeks after having a miscarriage and DNC at 5 weeks, I was having heart palpitations, leg cramp (constant for 3 weeks), as well as chest pain and tightness for 2 weeks which worsened when I would lie on my left side and with exercise. I had a blood test, revealed a high blood calcium level--just above the high end of normal. Doc had also done chest x-ray, EKG and ultimately the cardiologist ordered a stress test. All results came back normal. I learned that I have a \"floppy mitral valve\" according to Cardio. Primary doc tested calcium and PTH levels two weeks later and both were \"normal\". Any ideas of what is going on with me? I'm nervous b/c I want to get pregnant again. However I've read that if calcium level is high at any point that it is likely Hyperparathyroidism if not otherwise attributed to another disease/syndrome. I've also read that this can cause serious complications for mom and baby (if it survives at all). Furthermore, I heard that Hyperparathyroidism can worsen heart valve problems and make symptoms more profound. I also want to add that I was not taking any antacids or anything like that at the time.  I am a 29 year-old,117 lb., 5'4\", non-smoker who only took birth control pills for about 5 years and I stopped taking them a year ago to prepare my body for getting pregnant. I have been on Prenatal vitamin (w/stool softener) since May '05 (miscarried late July '05). Have not had a second opinion--doc simply said \"don't worry\" when I mentioned my concerns. What shoudl I do next? Chest pain has subsided, heart palpitations continue. [/u]\n\n",

    "content": "Dear coconutwoman,  Calcium level is normally in the range of 8.8-10.4 mg/dL (Total Ca; serum); 4.7-5.2 mg/dL (unbound Ca; serum). Hypercalcemia is defined as an abnormal elevation in serum ionized calcium concentration (free unbound calcium).   It would be very helpful if you can inform us about the exact level of your calcium especially the ionized form, as the total calcium level can be affected by many factors.   If you have repeated the test, inform us also about the results of your last blood tests. If not, I advise you to repeat the blood analysis.  The most common causes of hypercalcemia are primary hyperparathyroidism and malignancy due to bone resorption. Reduced renal calcium excretion is another cause of hypercalcemia in cases like renal impairment, volume depletion, and thiazide diuretics.  I think that the causes of your chest pain are more related to your cardiac condition, The Mitral valve prolapse MVP.  People with MVP are usually asymptomatic. Sometimes they have symptoms like: Rapid heart beats or skipping beats  Chest pain that can be similar to that of angina  Shortness of breath  Dizziness  Anxiety or panic which can increase the other symptoms.  Cardiac examination and auscultation of the heart show characteristic feature that help doctors to suspect the diagnosis. Many people do not treatment even if there are mild symptoms.   However, if your symptoms worsen you should be checked by your doctor for proper diagnosis and management.  I advise you to be examined by a consultant and to follow up with your doctor.

    "content": "Dear ask208, I have read your two posts and some possible causes of your complaint will be explained in my reply. Since your symptoms have started after losing your father, Anxiety is to be considered as a possible cause of your complaints. Anxiety and rapid breathing is one of the known causes of Chest pain, probably due to exertion of the respiratory muscles. In this case the pain is usually felt as pressure inside the chest that radiate to the neck and shoulders all around the sides and the back. And is sometimes associated with the feeling of numbness around lips and hands. In this case all what would help you is to lie down, relax and try to slow the rate of breathing. Breathing also inside a bag kept loosely around nose and mouth would improve the symptoms. I should emphasize that this diagnosis is made primarily after exclusion of all other causes of Chest pain by careful history taking and physical examination by your physician, in addition to all the required investigations.  Bronchial asthma: Wheezing is the most common presenting symptom for asthma. It usually begins suddenly, worsens at night or in early morning, aggravated by exposure to certain allergens such as, as moist air, molds, dust mites, pollens and molds. Symptoms are also exacerbated with exercise, heartburn (reflux), analgesics such as NSAID and chest infections. Wheezing usually resolves either spontaneously, or by the use bronchitis. Other patients presents with cough with or without sputum (phlegm), Chronic shortness of breath that is aggravated with exercises and mandate the us of accessory respiratory muscles.  Diagnosis is made by careful history and examination. Auscultation of the chest during the episode shows the very characteristic wheezing sounds. In between attacks the chest is normal on examination and some Tests may help: \u2022 Lung function tests  \u2022 Peak flow measurements  \u2022 Chest x-ray  Pleurisy: Inflammation of the pleura covering the lung gives a sharp pain that is associated with cough and is more severe when taking deep breath.  You need to be checked by your doctor, by complete history and physical examination, the correct diagnosis can be reached.   Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Doctor, Thank you for your reply to my two postings in this site.  Even though itwas  after a long waiting a got this reply, I think it was worth waiting.  I am glad to inform that the pain which I had on my chest walls and cough assoicated with it  which i reported in my last two postings has gradually subsided and is no more now. My only problem now is the wheezing which i have when i walk up hill even for a very short duration.  I have heard from my parents that i did suffer from Asthama when i was a child up to the age of 10 or so.  After that I never had any asthamatic attack.  I never had any problems in staying in any sort of weather or climate.  A few months back I have, under the direction my my physician, I did an X-ray check of my chest.  But it did not reveal anything to suspect. I wish to add here that I am developing a paunch even though i don't seem to have fat settled in any other part of my body.  Do you think I need a checkup on this?  Or is this one of the cause of my breathing problem? Expecting an early reply... regards ask208\n\n",

    "content": "Dear ask208,  Diagnosis of asthma is made primarly by careful history and examination. Auscultation of the chest during the episodes shows the very characteristic wheezing sounds. In between attacks the chest is normal on examination and some Tests that your doctor may recommend include:  \u2022 Lung function tests  \u2022 Peak flow measurements  \u2022 Chest x-ray   Gain of weight and decreased physical fitness may increase the shortness of breath one effort. I advise you to take an appointment with your doctor for proper management.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I'm 37 years old , generally in good health. While I was eating some bread and salad (with seeds) a few days ago, I choked on my food and it went down the wrong way. I started coughing and choking terribly (but could still breathe) and managed to cough some of it up, but I was left with the distinct feeling that some remained. I ended up going to the ER, still coughing and sputtering, and they listened to my lungs and said they sounded ok, and to wait a few days and see how I feel. I do feel better, but I still have some irritation and coughing, and I still feel that there is something in my lungs on the rights side (hard to describe...).  I just wanted to know: what, if anything, should I do about this? Should I just wait it out a few more days, or go back to the doctor? thanks!\n\n",

Generally speaking, after aspiration of food into the lungs symptoms may range from shortness of breath, coughing, elevated heart rate, persistent cough which may be productive of sputum, wheezing, fever. Aside from a physical exam, a chest xray is the typical diagnostic tool to identify if aspiration pneumonia is the factor. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

My doctor has ordered a chest X-ray and a visit to the cardiologist, but my X-ray results are not in yet and my visit to the cardiologist is 3 weeks away.  (He wanted to do an echocardiogram, but my insurance requires that I see the cardiologist first.)  My problem is that I don't know how to manage the symptoms for the next little while to get through my teaching daily.  I have stopped using chalk to teach (as my doctor suspects asthma), but I am still having trouble making it through an entire day.  Sometimes I am so breathless that I have to stop teaching for a bit and wait.  I have even had to go home early on 2 occasions this week.  It feels like I am nine months pregnant again when I try to climb the stairs.  Any ideas to manage this while I am in limbo?  Thank you as any sound advice is appreciated.  Kat\n\n",

    "content": "Dear katnab, Obstruction of the nose, mouth, throat or any other part of the airway tract can cause breathing difficulties.  Common causes of repeated episodes of shortness of breath include: Chronic bronchitis which is common in smokers  Asthma in which chest wheeze (a characteristic sound) is felt and auscultated by the stethoscope.  Coronary artery disease which usually starts with exertional dyspnea and cough. Interstitial lung disease in which progressive dyspnea is common   Pneumonia and other types of chest infection , fever, cough (productive or dry), general malaise are usual associated symptoms  Pulmonary hypertension  Rapid ascent to high altitudes, with less oxygen in the air  Allergies Common allergens like dust mites, cockroach allergens, molds, and pollens and Common respiratory irritants include: tobacco smoke, pollution, and fumes from burning wood or gas  Panic attacks and anxiety are common causes of shortness of  breath.  The diagnosis is made primarily by: complete history Physical examination Imaging techniques Pulmonary function tests ECG and ECG stress test. What I can advise you to do while you are being investigated, is to calm down, and to avoid exposure to any allergen or respiratory irritant. Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Yorkie,  It would have been of help if you could describe the character of this pain like; its site, nature, onset, course, associated symptoms like tenderness, related to movement , breathing problems or any other medical problems or received medications.  The investigations you have done also and their results would give me an idea about the further investigations that might be done.  I will give you a general idea about common causes of Chest pain, hoping to help you understand where you are.  The chest contains many organs, like the heart, lungs with its pleural covering, esophagus, muscles, ribs, tendons, and nerves. They all can be the source of the pain felt in the chest.   These causes include :  Angina that is due to ischemia or decrease in the blood supply to the cardiac muscle. If this occurs during exercise the Angina is named stable Angina, and if it occurs during rest it is named unstable Angina.  However, Chest pain that is similar to angina can occur in people with episodic hypertension , that is why it is recommended to measure the blood pressure during the pain.  Overexertion of the chest wall muscles or their inflammation as a part of viral infection like flu or cold results also in Chest pain, the pain is usually aggravated with certain moves and is usually associated with tenderness over the affected muscles. Pain due to rib or chest wall bone disease is also another cause of Chest pain. They are also tenderness over the affected areas. In all of these conditions the Chest pain is usually aggravated by taking deep breath and Cough.   Inflammation of the pleura covering the lung gives a sharp pain that is associated with Cough and is more severe when taking deep breath.   Sometimes Chest pain is not originating from the chest itself; instead it is due to problems in the digestive tract. These problems include IBS, Gastritis and Gastric ulcer, gall bladder disease, GER.   Pain due to Gastritis increase either after fasting or after meals, while pain due to gall bladder disorder is felt on the right side of the upper abdomen and is associated with fatty meals.   Sometimes the cause of chest pain is not recognized and the possibility of anxiety or panic syndrome to be the cause is high  You need to be examined by your doctor. Only by complete history and physical examination your doctor can reach the right diagnosis and provide you the proper management.   Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Dear sierra123,  The complaints you have described are more likely to be due to sore throat.  Most cases of sore throat are due to viral infection e. g. as part of flu and cold attack. Bacterial infections on the other hand represent a smaller number of cases. Usually there are other associated symptoms and signs that can point to the possible causative agent.    Post nasal discharge and chronic sinusitis are associated with recurrent sore throat  If you suffer from recurring sore throats, it's also possible that your toothbrush needs to be changed as it may transmit the infection for you after you have recovered from your first attack.   Experts says that a sore throat that lasts for longer than a week is often caused by allergies, or exposure to humidity, smoking, irritation from heating and cooling systems. Repeated pharyngitis can also happen seasonally or all year long most commonly due to allergies and in this case usually the allergic individual wake up early in the morning with sore throat.   A sore throat that doesn\u2019t improve or repeated with a short period of time should be investigated properly. By complete history and proper examination your physician can evaluate the cause of this recurrent sore throat and recommend treatment.   Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Dear , Many individuals complain of vague chest pains following stenting or angioplasty.   However, the fact that you have tenderness on the part where you feel the pain indicates a myoskeletal origin for this pain. Overexertion of the chest wall muscles or their inflammation as a part of viral infection like flu or cold results also in chest pain, the pain is usually aggravated with certain moves and is usually associated with tenderness over the affected muscles. Pain due to rib or chest wall bone disease is also another cause of chest pain. They are also tenderness over the affected areas.  In all of these conditions the chest pain is usually aggravated by taking deep breath and cough.  Since your cardiac tests and CT are all normal, you can calm down and keep on follow up with your doctor.  Chest pain of GI origin (gastritis, IBS, ulcer, etc) is also to be considered and may cause chest pain similar to that of coronary heart disease. The condition can be associated with burp like feeling, and gas, however is not associated with tenderness over the chest wall.  I advise to keep on follow up with your physician and to inform him with any new symptoms. Only by complete history, physical examination and investigations, the correct diagnosis can be reached.

    "content": "For the past week I've been having a tightness that rotates between my chest and my neck.  I almost always have the discomfort in one of the locations, but never in both at the same time.  When the discomfort is in my chest, I'm constantly wanting to belch, although that doesn't really help.  It feels like there is some kind of blockage just below the chest.  Every so often I get girgling noises in my chest, which sometimes produce a belch, and that makes it feel better, although just temporarily.  Like I said it seems to rotate between the chest and neck and usually switches locations just once a day.  For example, yesterday I had the tightness / pressure feeling in my neck until about 2 or 3pm and then it switched down to the chest, where it is now.  I get a little short of breath sometimes, but it's usually not too bad.    I went to the doctor and they did an EKG and a chest x-ray and found nothing.  Any ideas?  Thanks!\n\n",

The condition can be a sequence of sore throat or (viral, bacteria) infection that subsides gradually after recovering from infections or as a motility disorder in the esophagus.  GERD  The anatomical relation between the diaphragm and the Lowe Esophageal Sphincter LES prevents the gastric acids to come up into the esophagus (reflux).

    "content": "Dear karen_2005 , At your age group, with no risk factors for coronary heart disease, if the pain you have experience was a sporadic event, and your stress ECG was normal , hopefully the diagnosis of coronary heart disease is less likely to be the cause. Although it should be checked and excluded for any attack of chest pain that gives similar picture of ischemic heart disease. However, it is of importance to investigate the possible causes of this pain and to consider the history of episodic hypertension.  People suffering from episodes of hypertension usually have their blood pressure normal while at rest. When there is stress or physical efforts the blood pressure gets higher and many patients experience chest pain. The chest pain is similar to that of coronary ischemia (angina) in character. The mechanism is due to the fact that the high pressure inside the arteries creates tension inside the (left) ventricle of the heart that needs to push the blood out of its cavity against such increased Resistance. This results in collapse of the Small arterial branches that supply the muscles of the heart, hence ischemic pain. To diagnose these patients who can benefit from anti hypertensive drugs, it is very important to measure the blood pressure while the pain is felt. With time the blood pressure becomes high even  at rest and under normal conditions. At that time, complications including damage to the heart , kidney, eyes, etc have also started and that is why hypertension is named silent killer. I advise you to check your blood pressure once you experience the chest pain, and to consult your physician for proper examination and proper management. Best of luck,\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Anthony, The chest contains many organs, like the heart, lungs with its pleural covering, esophagus, muscles, ribs, tendons, and nerves. They all can be the source of the pain felt in the chest. Pleurisy which is an inflammation of the membrane covering the lung (the pleura), results in a sharp pain in the chest that is increased with deep breathing and cough. Pleuretic pain which is associated with breathing difficulty, usually occurs as a sequale of chest infection, is a common cause of chest pain and shortness of breath. Auscultation of the chest shows a characteristic rub and the condition improves gradually when the infection is controlled. Sometimes pleurisy occurs due to viral infection without an evident chest infection, however, either sore throat, mild fever, or running nose is usually present. Anxiety and rapid breathing is one of the known causes of chest pain, probably due to exertion of the respiratory muscles, hyperventilation effect, indigestion and nerve pain. In this case the pain is usually felt as pressure inside the chest that radiate to the neck and shoulders all around the sides and the back. And is sometimes associated with the feeling of numbness around lips and hands. In this case all what would help you is to lie down, relax and try to slow the rate of breathing. Breathing also inside a bag kept loosely around nose and mouth would improve the symptoms. I should emphasize that this diagnosis is made primarily after exclusion of all other causes of chest pain by careful history taking and physical examination by your physician, in addition to all the required investigations. Spontaneous pneumothorax occurs primarily at rest . The main symptom is dull, stabbing, or sharp  chest pain with shortness of breath that occurs suddenly. The pain may be either dull or sharp or stabbing. .  Spontaneous pneumothorax occurs usually in smokers. The diagnosis can be done by physical examination and Chest X-ray. I advise you to take an appointment for your consultant , by complete history and physical examination, the correct diagnosis can be reached. Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Dear,nikki82, Anginal pain is usually felt as Crushing pain in the middle of your chest, squeezing pain in the chest or left upper arm  that is associated with sweating or shortness of breath and radiates to the neck and left shoulder. Anginal pains are very characteristic although there are some forms of atypical chest pain of cardiac origin. I assume that the history you have given to your doctor plus the results of the examination did not point to the possibility of heart disease otherwise a conventional ECG or stress test would have been recommended by him. Is this pain associated with any tenderness, in another meaning does it hurt you when you press on he place where you experience this pain or any area around? Is it increases when you are exposed to cold air? Is it associated with certain movements? If it is associated with any of these signs, it is probably a myoskeletal pain  If your symptoms are clearly associated with muscle overuse or wrong use(spasm) , then you just need to be more careful to maintain right postures and to do exercise to strength them. If the symptoms didn\u2019t improve after you have been very conservative or they are getting worse, then better be checked quickly by your consultant. I advise you to be on follow up with your doctor and to inform him with any new symptoms. Best regards,\n\n",

I first went to the doc's 20 years ago and he said they was nothing wrong with me, He said that by just looking at me, he did not examine me. I have been to the doc's about 10 times over the years and they say after a quick exam there\u2019s nothing wrong it must be in my mind. so i have just been bearing it. So this last time I changed my doc, s and he has said the same, but if you want you can go private. (2nd opinion) so I went Private I had to wait 6 months for the tests by this time I felt ok again I had an  water, blood, ekg and then I had a running test, cost \u00a3490 he said tests were ok. I\u2019m now starting to get sharp stabbing pains again and have pain under my arm all the time, if I go back to the doc's I know what he will say, (you have had this for 20 years it cant be series) I have told him it very painful and he said take some pain killers, but they don\u2019t work.

    "content": "Dear lee wagstaff, It would be helpful if you could explain the type of pain that you have and if there are other associated symptoms or signs in addition to any other medical condition for which you are receiving any medical care.  The possibility that your symptoms to be of a cardiac origin is not high and this is why your doctor feels comfortable about your complaints. However, being persistent for such long time, more over since they are progressing, it is worth searching for a possible cause. You have to keep in mind also that sometimes chest pain especially of muscle or myoskeletal origin is of unknown causes and in some cases certain conditions are diagnosed by exclusion as in dysautonomia. Brachial plexus compression gives similar symptoms.  The Brachial Plexus represents a network of nerves that supply the upper part of the body (skin and muscles). To reach the upper trunk it passes through different areas where it can be stretched or compressed at different levels. One of them is under the muscles of the chest wall (pectoralis minor) which help the shoulder to be bent froward or in between the scalene muscles at the root of the neck. Symptoms according to the area where it is affected and generally lead to numbness and weakness of the affected part.  Activities in which there is frequent overhead use of arm, forward bending, or heavy weight on the shoulder are more likely to aggravate the condition. For example when a person wake up with the arm or part of chest wall numb after keeping the hand over the head while sleeping is common.  Physical examination and imaging studies can help define the cause.  Maintaining good posture and physical excercise can help improve symptoms.   Muscle pain due to different causes can give similar pain on the chest , of these causes:  Fibromyalgia in which muscle pain (myalgia) that is present at rest and increases with movement, tenderness (pain when press on the affected muscles). That involves any muscles in the body and goes away then recurs in another muscle or group of muscles, etc,  I advise you to take an appointment with your consultant discuss with him this possibility, after complete examination and investigations he can reach proper diagnosis.

Post nasal discharge causes irritation of of the throat and the respiratory airway, and a phlegm is felt at the back of the throat. The condition is felt more early in the morning and improves with time allover the day. Sometimes the phlegm is so thick and coughed in clumps. Anaerobic infections and the growth of germs results in offensive odor.  Drinking plenty fluid can help liquefy the secretions and make them easily expelled. Avoiding also Dairy food and fat contain food, that may thicken the secretion and make them more sticky. Decongestants are also helpful, in addition to treatment of any bacterial infection with the appropriate antibiotics.  You have to be checked by your consultant for proper management.

It feels as though its numb, and I cannot stand to remain laying on my left side. The feeling does not persist on my right side.  Now I feel an almost constant numbness/tightness. Touching my skin in that area almost feels as though it is numb. Even though I have always been active, I have always been a big-time Soda drinker, junkfood eater.

    "content": "My husband has a lump in the center of his chest that is a little smaller than the center of his palm, it is tender to the touch and is painful for him when touched.  The doctor took an x ray but it didnt show up, so he has scheduled my husband for a CAT scan in about a week and half.  The doctor said that it felt like bone to him, and we are a little concerned.  We just don't have the slightest idea what it could be, and were wondering if anyone could give us a range of ideas on what the possibilities are of what this lump could be.  Thank you so much for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear mrsrob143, It is very difficult to tell by the anatomical location and few symptoms what it could be, especially if the anatomical origin is not well defined and the associated symptoms are not indicative for any possible diagnosis. Swelling in the center of the chest, I assume where the sternum is, is more likely to be of bone origin (sternal mas), however a soft tissue mass can also be the cause. Since it is painful, and tender, Traumatic and inflammatory causes are considerd however, benign and malignant tumors can also present as a painful swelling.  In any case clinical examination is very essential for differential diagnosis of any palpable mass especially if the associated symptoms are not indicative of any possible diagnosis.  Only by examination and investigations the nature of this mass can be defined. After CT examination, the exact origin can be known, then the pathological nature of this mass should be defined by either FNAC or biopsy. Further investigation will be defined according to the results. Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Dear texanpride, Contraction and expansion of the arterial wall as a result of changes in the blood flow with cardiac contraction and relaxation is what we feel as the pulse .  Physical Exercise results in changes in the cardiac activity. Both cardiac contractility and the heart rate are increased. Normally we are not aware by these changes. But with exercise when the contraction and the heart rate is increased sometimes this is felt as throbbing sensation in the upper chest or neck.  The reason behind is the fact that a large amount of blood is pushed in the upper chest and neck vessels, which is sometimes felt as throbbing or pain and headache. However, it increases in certain condition e.g. if you did not practice exercise for long time, or if you have anemia.  So I advise you if the condition is repeated to be checked by your doctor to rule out any pathological causes. Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Dear NIGHTOWL269, Overexertion of the chest wall muscles or their inflammation are common causes for chest pain. This usually occurs after attacks of asthma, shortness of breath, chest infections and cough, when the respiratory and chest wall muscles are overworked and in spasm or strain.  Pain due to rib or chest wall bone disease is also another cause of chest pain. They all are associated with tenderness over the affected areas. In all of these conditions the chest pain is usually aggravated by taking deep breath, cough or while doing certain movements like bending to one side of the chest.  Chronic pain syndromes, such as fibromyalgia, results in chronic chest pain of muscle origin. costochondritis is also a known cause of chest pain that is associated with pain and tenderness near the breast bone or at the center of the chest. The symptoms you described are more likely to be caused by a myoskeletal problem that mandate complete history taking and thorough physical examination. So I advise you to take an appointment with your doctor for proper management. Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Hello there  I was diagnosed with esophageal spasms about 4 or 5 months ago and was prescribed Nexium, had a big run around with my doctor and insurance company...by the time the prescription was filled, it was gone, so I didn't bother getting the Nexium.  Here are my symptoms...  Sharp pain in chest from time to time...Feels like my heart is being squeezed, but when I feel my pulse in my wrist at the same time, I have a normal heart beat.  food doesn't always go straight down when I swallow.  It gets stuck sometimes, and I have to wash it down with water.  Almost like my throat gets clogged, but not the same as choking.  sometimes...first thing in the morning especially, I get a really bad stomach ache and feel very nautious.  At the same time, there is a sizzling sound coming from my throat.  Weird?  Yea.  Here's the kicker...  A few minutes after I drink fluids (any fluid) I have difficulty breathing for about an hour.  I feel like I'm not getting enough oxygen, and even the deepest of breaths still makes me feel like I'm not breathing at all.  However, if I try and keep myself from taking deep breaths while I'm feeling like this, I don't feel dizzy, or show other signs of not getting enough 02.  I just get a frantic feeling.  LIke when you swim really deep in water, and you don't know if you can make it to the surface in time for another breath.  It's just scary.  I'm not stressed at all.  I've had this going on since I was probably about 12 years old (I'm 23 now(and female)) off and on, at least once a year.  It doesn't happen when I eat solid food.  It's happened under lots of cercumstances...when I was in perfect shape, and now with a few extra pounds.  All seasons, and when I've been sick (cold, flu...) and healthy.  Now this problem is back after being gone for 4 or 5 months.  I've had chest xrays, showing nothing, and blood tests that showed up fine.  My question is...  I've never heard or read (neither had my doctor) of this strange breathing thing happening along with the spasms.  Does anyone out there know anything about this?  ANY info would be great!!  Thanks so much!  ~Jen\n\n",

The character of this pain is expressed by many like that of myocardial ischemia, or as chest tightness or lump in the throat. The pain is intermittent, but in many cases is aggravated by cold drinks and stress.  Sometimes headache occurs as a result of spasm in the neck or upper chest (e.g. pharyngeal, and esophageal spasm), the so called cervicogenic headache. This type of headache is felt at the base of the skull and radiates downwards with characters similar to migraine. and is sometimes associated with numbness over neck, lips, shoulders, and the upper chest.  Some medications to treat esophageal motility disorders 8spasm ) are by themselves the cause of the headache. You have to discuss all of your symptoms and the medications You are receiving with your doctor. By complete history, physical examination, he can recommend the proper investigations to reach the correct diagnosis. Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 35-year-old female in (other than this) good health. For about the last three months, I have been experiencing shortness of breath and coughing from even the most minor exertion (like walking up a flight of stairs). I also experience pain at the \"top\" of the inhalation on a deep breath, and have gotten in the habit of catching my breath before I get to that point to avoid the pain. The pain is located behind the breastbone, about three inches or so below my collar bone.  I have been diagnosed with acid reflux and have been on Protonix for about a month and a half. Because of the timing, I thought that the pain and other issues might be related to the reflux, but they haven't subsided even with the acid gone. I have had a normal chest x-ray and my primary care doctor didn't hear any wheezing when she listened to my lungs. She has now referred me to a pulmonary specialist and I have an appointment next week.  I'm curious as to what might cause symptoms like this but would not show up on a chest x-ray. Also, I would like to have a good dialog with the pulmonary specialist so that we can get to the bottom of what's going on. Is there anything I should think about before my appointment that might be helpful?  Thanks, Jody\n\n",

    "content": "Dear johnny34, Pericarditis mostly seen in young people is due to viral infections. Bacterial infection or idiopathic( without a known cause)  are other causes for percarditis. Pericarditis can develop in patients with autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. Individuals suffer from pericarditis present with a sharp chest pain that is felt below the breastbone (sternum), below the ribs on the left side of the chest and can radiate to the shoulder region or the neck. Pain is aggravated with breathing and in recumbent position, to the contrary, leaning forward or being supine decrease the severity of the pain The diagnosis is easily made by physical examination, auscultation of the heart which shows a characteristic rub. ECG gives characteristic elevated ST segment in all leads. Echo cardiograph should also be done to see the extent of affection. Other blood tests are done to check for the possible causes especially in recurrent cases. Mild pericarditis can recover spontaneously with bed rest and nutritional support, while specific causes need to be treated accordingly. In most of cases NSAID like ibuprofen can help fasten the improvement of symptoms. I advise you to keep on follow up with your consultant and to discuss with him the possible causes of this recurrent chest pain, and the pericardits he has diagnosed. Regarding the neck cyst , more informations about the exact anatomical location, the size and the pathological diagnosis (if any) would help to understand if it contributes to your complaints, however I assume that if it was of significance, your doctor would have investigated it more. Best regrades,\n\n",

In all of these conditions the chest pain is usually aggravated by taking deep breath, cough or while doing certain movements like bending to one side of the chest. They usually improve with physiotherapy, muscle exercise, pain killers, muscle relaxants. Avoiding exposure to cold humid environment is very important to improve the symptoms. The symptoms you described are more likely to be caused by a myoskeletal problem that mandate complete history taking and thorough physical examination. So I advise you to take an appointment with your doctor for proper management. Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Hi.  Almost a year ago I had an episode of anxiety, shortness of breath and dizziness. Went to the ER and after examination and several EKGs been diagnosed with pretty much nothing (neuro-vegetative disturbances) and prescribed to take calcium and magnesium supplements. Checked with my doc and he ran blood tests which came back normal, except for a mild anemia (low Iron, magnesium and calcium levels, not too low but near-minimum). Doc prescribed iron supplements.  Gradually the sensation of not getting enough air pretty much dissapeared.  During the summer I experienced a mild sinus tachycardia (rate about 90) treated with Propranolol. Now my pulse is around 70 and I do not take any more pills for it (sometimes is rises up to 85-90 bpm, but it doesn't bother me..btw what's the normal pulse for a man of my age?). However, I still get a permanent feeling of shortness of breath, like my lung doesn't fill normally with air or like I can't yawn right. Also my chest hurts, sometimes in the left area, sometimes in the right, near the sternum or under it. The chest hurts when pressed with my finger. Ribs are painful too. The pain is not intense and goes away for a few days, comes back for a few days in some other area in my chest. Sometimes my ankles hurt a bit and my right hand, the small bones right near my fist. Fingers at my right hand are painful at times. These pains go away quickly when applying ibuprofen or the like(spelled it right I hope) to the area. However they are back after some hours and are quite acute at times.  I have done blood tests 3 times in the last year, went to 3 different cardiologists, had echo of the heart, echo of the abdomen, neurological exam, etc. etc, everything is OK. I went to the cardiologist when I was at peak with my symptoms and nothing was found (the only mention was I have high R waves in leads V5 and V6 caused by thin chest).  I am currently taking mineral supplements and following psychological counselling since I have developped a strong fear that something is deeply wrong with me. When in session and days after I feel ok, no more symptoms.  My syptoms are generally not very intense, I feel like my fear is amplifying them somehow.  I am a 25 year old male, no heart disease or other medical condition, good health, good family health, not overweight, smoker (under 1 pack a day), not in best fittness (sitting job - programmer).  My questions are:  1. If sometimes were wrong with my heart, would it have been diagnosed yet?  2. Need I do more investigations regarding my heart/lungs?  3. Does all this look more like a psychological condition than a physical one?  Thank you for reading this message.  Bogdan\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Hefaistos, The symptoms you have described are more likely to be part of autonomic dysfunction, a condition in which the balance between the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous system is disturbed. The condition is named Dysautonomia. Symptoms of dysautonomia include:  Inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST) is a condition in the resting heart rate is greater than 100 beats per minute. People with IST experience also tachycardia with minimal effort that is usually accompanied with palpitations and fatigue. ECG is normal in pattern, Panic attacks, anxiety, shortness of breath which aggravate all the other symptoms, Fibromyalgia in which muscle pain (myalgia) that is present at rest and increases with movement, tenderness (pain when press on the affected muscles). That involves any muscles in the body and goes away then recurs in another muscle or group of muscles, etc, Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) in which individuals suffer from being constantly tired and easy fatigued,  Vasovagal syncope in which persons get fainting or dizziness attacks for unknown reasons,  Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS,) abdominal pain, distension, alternating constipation and diarrhea are the main complaints,  Postural orthostatic hypotension in which Dizziness and syncope occurs on standing. The exact underlying cause of Dysautonomias is not known however it is believed to be of hereditary origin and can be triggered by certain factors like viral infections (after cold, flu, etc), toxic exposures, or trauma (head trauma). In Chronic fatigue syndrome, it commonly happens following sore throat due to viral infection, fever, the pain starts and the muscles are felt weak.  There is no accepted general rule for the diagnosis and treatment of these conditions. However, A daily level of activity and physical exercises are very important to improve symptoms of Dysautonmia. Some vitamins and mineral supplements can help as well in some case. Sometimes anti-anxiety drugs and antidepressant or anti-inflammatory drugs are prescribed by some doctors. I advise you to calm down and to keep on  follow up with your consultant and continue on psychological counseling as you mentioned also that it helps. Best regards,\n\n",

However recently (past week or so) every morning my back/ right side of my chest has been hurting it soon goes away after I take a shower.  On my mothers side heart attacks run in the family however the left side of my chest is fine. I was wondering if you might know if it is just a pulled muscle again (and since I am getting older it just takes a bit longer to get better) or if I should seriously considering visiting a doctor.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Binarymolecule,  First of all I would like to calm you down and to say that it is very unlikely for this type of pain to be of heart origin. Angina pain is usually felt as Crushing pain in the middle of your chest, squeezing pain in the chest or left upper arm  that is associated with sweating or shortness of breath   Is this pain associated with any tenderness, in another meaning does it hurt you when you press on he place where you experience this pain or any area around? Is it increases when you are exposed to cold air? Is it associated with certain movements? If it is associated with any of these signs, it is probably a myoskeletal pain. Overexertion of the chest wall muscles or their inflammation are common causes for chest pain.  You have mentioned that you get the pain after you sleep in a wrong position or muscle abuse, this means that muscle spasm is more likely to be the cause of your symptoms. If your symptoms are clearly associated with muscle overuse or wrong use(spasm) , then you just need to be more careful to maintain right postures and to do exercise to strength them. If the symptoms didn\u2019t improve after you have been very conservative or they are getting worse, then better be checked quickly by your consultant. Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Dear smcleo02, Since your symptoms have started after losing your father, anxiety is to be considered as a possible cause of your complaints. Anxiety and rapid breathing is one of the known causes of chest pain, probably due to exertion of the respiratory muscles, hyperventilation effect, indigestion and nerve pain. In this case the pain is usually felt as pressure inside the chest that radiate to the neck and shoulders all around the sides and the back. And is sometimes associated with the feeling of numbness around lips and hands. In this case all what would help you is to lie down, relax and try to slow the rate of breathing. Breathing also inside a bag kept loosely around nose and mouth would improve the symptoms. I should emphasize that this diagnosis is made primarily after exclusion of all other causes of chest pain by careful history taking and physical examination by your physician, in addition to all the required investigations. Spontaneous pneumothorax occurs primarily at rest .The main symptom is dull, stabbing, or sharp  chest pain with shortness of breath that occurs suddenly. The pain may be either dull or sharp or stabbing. .  Spontaneous pneumothorax occurs usually in smokers. The diagnosis can be done by physical examination and Chest X-ray. I advise you to keep on follow up with your consultant and inform him with any change in your condition, by complete history and physical examination, the correct diagnosis can be reached. Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Hi!  This is my first time on this forum. I am a 31 yr old woman. Had a very stressful few years with the loss of my parents, financial, job, relationship stress. I also have high expectations of myself so things have been tough all around. May 2005 I felt chest cramps 45 mins, left side. Since then chest pain constant. Left arm, neck etc. I didnt have health insurance at the time. Finally saw a few Drs. in july. Chest xray, multiiple ekgs, echo, stress test - thankfully all normal. All blood work normal. except cholestrol 240 with 1:3 ratio of hdl to ldl. I lost my dad to heart disease when he was in his early 50s. Mom in late 50s due gallbladder cancer caused by geographical/environment.   I feel EXTREMELY EXHAUSTED. I used to be able to work etc 16-18hrs. Complaint - I also get constant heaviness, tightness off and on and mild pain left side chest. Especially when I press the ribs above my left brest below my collar bone and below my left breast. I have never had any chest injury. Last couple years ive stopped working out. don't know why. Ive been working from home for the past yrs too and sit on the couch with my laptop and work away. I usually keep my laptop on the right side and type with my right hand and left hand reaching across me. (don't know if ergonomics is an issue. (I also have sciatica in my left leg, old hamstring injury). Also since this week i get the similar pain when i press on my throat. (This worries me) As well my throat feels dry and I feel like a dry cough 1-2 times a day for few seconds, prickly feeling.  I get easily frightened when it comes to health issues. I don't have health insurance at the moment. I was brought up taking herbal remedies / esp. homeopathic. Im not sure what to do. I want to figure it out, who to see, what to do, and get help without further delay. I feel so exhausted all the time. However I havent lost weight or anything like that. I weight 115 pounds and donated blood last week to do a good deed ! and my blood pressure was 96/68 when we began and I came home and had a blackout :( for 5 mins. Had gallons of water for 3 days. Felt better after, but weaker too.   What shall I do? I want to feel better. Thanks and happy new year.\n\n",

Sometimes it feels like the pain is all across my chest, but most of the time is stays right under my left breast. Last year I broke 2 of my ribs when i had a cold, by just turning. I though perhaps it had something to do with that? I also have found latelty that i am more tired. I am also bigger chested that has caused problems for me in my back and my neck..

    "title": "Adult chicken pox: worsening asthma and chest pain",
    "content": "I am a 29-year-old female who has had moderate to severe asthma for most of my life. For the past 2 years I have been taking a combined inhaled corticosteroid and bronchodilator called Symbicort.  I am also an occasional smoker (bad, I know!).  Two weeks ago,  I developed chicken pox. Because of my asthma, I insisted that the doctor give me a prescription for acyclovir. For some unknown reason, she seemed a little reticient to do so,  but did anyway (400 mg, 3Xday for 10 days--I have since learned that the standard dose for adults should be higher than this!).   The spots themselves are doing okay at this point; most of the scabs have fallen off and I'm left with some pink scarring. I have also regained most of my appetite and my energy levels seem better.  However, ever since day 3 or so of the illness, I have noticed a worsening of my asthma symptoms (more wheezing and chest tightness) as well as a slight intermittent pain in the right side of my chest when I breathe. I have a cough that occasionally sounds congested and yesterday morning I coughed up some sputum (I do not have a cold). I have been using my inhaler with more frequency, often up to twice a day. Unfortunately though, my symptoms don't seem to be easing up very much.   I do not appear to be running a fever (although I don't own a thermometer so I can't say for sure--I'm going solely by touch) so rationally-speaking I don't think I have chickenpox pneumonia, but I am feeling a bit paranoid!  I guess what my question is, should I go in for a chest X-ray anyway, just in case? Or is this worsening of my asthma just likely a normal, temporary condition that could be associated with the chicken pox?    I am asking simply because I am temporarily without health insurance and don't have the funds required to pay for a hospital/doctor's visit. I wouldn't want to borrow money unless it was absolutely necessary.   Any advice you could provide would be extremely helpful.   Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear abcdefg, Asthma is due to an inflammatory process in the respiratory airway a disease. The inflammation results in spasm of the muscles of the bronchial way with swollen cells in the airway lining, as a sequence narrowing of the respiratory tract and decreased airflow. You have mentioned that you suffer from cough that is also productive and chest pain, this is more likely to be a chest infection that does not mean you have pneumonia. It can be bronchitis and pleurisy that cause these symptoms. (viral infection can be the cause unless your sputum is yellowish or greenish, in this case, super added bacterial infection is probably the cause). This can be due to your poor general condition that is associated with the attack of chicken pox. Keeping in mind, that asthmatic individual are more prone to chest infections and that asthma symptoms are also exacerbated with any types of chest infections. Since your general condition is getting improved I expect also that your chest symptoms will improve gradually. If the symptoms are gradually improving while you are recovering from your infection then you can calm down and wait till you regain the initial condition, but if you have observed that your symptoms are getting worse or you have your sputum yellowish or greenish you better get checked by your doctor to prescribe you the required treatment.

    "content": "Dear Jenniec, Shortness of breath is usually due to an inflammatory process in the respiratory airway a disease. The inflammation results in spasm of the muscles of the bronchial way with swollen cells in the airway lining, as a sequence narrowing of the respiratory tract and decreased airflow. This usually occurs as a sequence of respiratory tract infection. Do you have any other symptoms like cough, expectoration, sore throat or fever lately? Individuals with Personal and/or family history of allergies, like allergic rhinitis (hay fever) or eczema are more prone to have this spasm. Common allergens are dust mites, cockroach allergens, molds, cold moist air and pollens. Common respiratory irritants include: tobacco smoke, pollution, and fumes from burning wood or gas. Chronic shortness of breath is a diagnosis of asthma a condition that is aggravated with chest infection. Symptoms are usually periodic and vary in duration, may last from few minutes up to few days. Asthmatic symptoms usually imp robe with age especially in children. Diagnosis is made by careful history and examination. Auscultation of the chest during the episode shows the very characteristic wheezing sounds. In between attacks the chest is normal on examination and some Tests may help: Lung function tests  Peak flow measurements  Chest x-ray  Allergy skin or blood tests  Arterial blood gas  Eosinophil count (a type of white blood cell)   Treatment include, identifying the allergens and respiratory irritants and to avoid them. In addition,  People with mild asthma (infrequent attacks) may use relief medication as needed. Those with persistent asthma should take control medications on a regular basis to prevent symptoms from occurring. I advise you to take an appointment for your doctor for complete physical examination and proper diagnosis. Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, My son is 15 and about 2 weeks ago he started having chest pains that he described as stabbing pain.  We went to the ER.  He does have a history of Acid Reflux.  All test came back normal, but still in major pain.  He was admitted and they did a scope to check his stomach and esopagues.  All fine.  Still pain.  We are scheduled for a Esophageal Manomentry next week, but the doctor does not feel this is causing the pain.  The doctors recommend a day program to find a stressor that may be causing the pain because all test given are negative.  The pain has added to going up his back like an electric shock.  The pain does increase in frequency and intensity with playing basketball. We have him in the day program, and are still looking for any medical reasons as well.  Several months ago with some stomach cramps(after we had him not to eat salad everyday they went away) a CT scan found that his spleen was swollen.  No one had any concern of this.  Could this be causing pain like this?  Also no pain medicine or anti inflamatory medicine helps.  It is so hard to watch you child hurt in this much pain and be able to help.  Thank you for your help\n\n",

    "content": "Sometimes chest pain is not originating from the chest itself; instead it is due to problems in the digestive tract. When you have pain in your abdomen, this pain can radiate into the chest, and become confusing of primary chest pain. In that case careful history and examination will help define the diagnosis. For example, Pain due to gastritis increase either after fasting or after meals, while pain due to gall bladder disorder is associated with fatty meals. Since he has his GI checked and no abnormalities till now have been found to explain that pain it is convenient to keep him on the daily medical program to check for the possible stressor and to wait for the manometric results. However, I would like to know to what extent his spleen is enlarged. Abdominal organs that are kept in their anatomical place with ligaments, when organomegally occurs this leads to a dragging pain due to stretch on these ligaments and the pain might be of increasing intensity or frequency when the person moves, runs, or exercises. I assumed that the pain is felt mainly on his left side since his doctors were checking for stomach problems. This possibility as well as the cause or splenomegally should be discussed with his consultant.\n\n",

The tingling feels like it is on my skin and only lasts for a couple seconds.  I am able to take deep breathes without any pain.    I got into a car accident a couple weeks ago (hit head on) and experienced some soreness in my chest for a couple days afterwards.

    "content": "Dear Dave, Cough and soreness for couple of weeks may be a cause of muscle exertion. Muscle strain and spasm are sometimes felt as pain and tenderness while movement. Diminished range of movement is usually a presenting symptom in  cases with muscle spasm. This might explain why the pain is felt while you are coughing as the muscles contract and become more painful. Anxiety and rapid breathing if present are known causes of chest pain, probably due to exertion of the respiratory muscles, hyperventilation effect and nerve pain. In this case the pain is usually felt as pressure inside the chest that radiate to the neck and shoulders all around the sides and the back. And is sometimes associated with the feeling of numbness around lips, hands and shoulders. In this case all what would help you is to lie down, relax and try to slow the rate of breathing. Breathing also inside a bag kept loosely around nose and mouth would improve the symptoms. I should emphasize that this diagnosis is made primarily after exclusion of all other causes of chest pain by careful history taking and physical examination by your physician, in addition to all the required investigations. If the symptoms are getting more frequent or severe , I advise you to visit your doctor to be investigated properly.  Best regards,\n\n",

My concern is- about 4 days ago I noticed a rolling \" LUMp\" under my right lower rib cage. When I grasp it it kind of rolls up into the rib cage but it is kind of in the upper abdomen. It feels slightly tender when i do this and makes me a little nauseous. Any insight as to what this could be????   thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Dear krissyleewicked, First I would like to pint that most probably the mass you have felt days ago has no relation with the ovarian cysts that have been discovered by Imaging. A mass that is rolling, I assume mobile in the upper part of the abdominal wall or lower chest is more likely to be lipoma. If it is tender, probably it is infected and being inflamed made it swollen so you felt it more easily these days. Other cause of swelling that is painful or tender is inflammatory, or traumatic mass.  In any case clinical examination is very essential for differential diagnosis of any palpable mass especially if the associated symptoms are not indicative of any possible diagnosis. You better get an appointment with your doctor for complete examination. Only by examination and investigations the nature of this mass can be defined. Best regards,\n\n",

I went back to bed and I felt a little better when I woke up.  When I was eating lunch this afternoon, it was very painful as the food was going down to my stomach.  Everytime I would burp, the pain travels through my esophagus.  The pain is like a burning sensation but can be very painful sometimes.  I am wondering what caused me to get this pain.  I am taking doxycycline right now.  Could that be the cause of this pain?  Should I worry about this or would it just pass by in a few days?\n\n",

The mechanism of esophageal injury induced by doxycycline is thought to be by different mechanisms that include its own acidic effect. People with hiatus hernia  are more prone to develop DIEI. W ithdrawal of the drug results in improvement of symptoms in one week. Keep in mind that also Certain foods are known to aggravate the condition, and you better avoid them. These include chocolate, beverages containing caffeine, fatty and fried foods, garlic and onions, spicy and tomato containing foods. If you must take the drug, try to take it with plenty fluid , while eating or after eating and not on empty stomach. If your symptoms are severe or increasing stop the drug and consult your doctor.

    "content": "Dear Mole,  I did not understand very well what did they find in your chest X-ray, however, I assume that it was a form of chest infection after which you have been diagnosed to be an asthmatic. Asthma is due to an inflammatory process in the respiratory airway a disease. The inflammation results in spasm of the muscles of the bronchial way with swollen cells in the airway lining, as a sequence narrowing of the respiratory tract and decreased airflow. Wheezing is the most common presenting symptom for asthma. It usually begins suddenly, worsens at night or in early morning, aggravated by exposure to certain allergens such as, as moist air, molds, dust mites, pollens and molds. Symptoms are also exacerbated with exercise, heartburn (reflux), analgesics such as NSAID and chest infections. Wheezing usually resolves either spontaneously, or by the use of antibiotics to treat bronchitis. Other patients presents with cough with or without sputum (phlegm), Chronic shortness of breath that is aggravated with exercises and mandate the us of accessory respiratory muscles.   Symptoms are usually periodic and vary in duration, may last from few minutes up to few days. Asthmatic symptoms usually improve with age especially in children. Personal and/or family history of allergies are present in most patients with asthma, like allergic rhinitis (hay fever) or eczema.   Diagnosis is made by careful history and examination. Auscultation of the chest during the episode shows the very characteristic wheezing sounds. In between attacks the chest is normal on examination and some Tests may help to diagnose the condition include: \u2022 Lung function tests  \u2022 Peak flow measurements  \u2022 Chest x-ray  \u2022 Allergy skin or blood tests  \u2022 Arterial blood gas  \u2022 Oesinophile count (a type of white blood cell)  Treatment include, identifying the allergens and respiratory irritants and to avoid them. In addition, Common allergens like dust mites, cockroach allergens, molds, and pollens and Common respiratory irritants include: tobacco smoke, pollution, and fumes from burning wood or gas should be avoided. There are two basic kinds of medication for the treatment of asthma: People with mild asthma (infrequent attacks) may use relief medication as needed. Those with persistent asthma should take control medications on a regular basis to prevent symptoms from occurring.  A severe asthma attack requires a medical evaluation and may require hospitalization, oxygen, and intravenous medications. A peak flow meter, is an easy home used device to measure lung volume and to monitor the degree of your asthma. Peak flow of values 50-80% means a moderate asthma attack, while values below 50% means a severe attack.  If your symptoms did  not improve on the treatment you are receiving, it means that either you are not receiving the proper treatment or there is an additional problem that recently aggravated the symptoms like chest infection, or you are allergic to certain staff that you have been exposed to recently. I advise you to take an appointment for your consultant for proper management. Best regards,\n\n",

    "title": "Chest pressure, headaches, warm sensations and dizziness",
    "content": "Hi, I'm a 35 year old male and i believe that i'm in good shape. I lift weights 4 to 5 days a week and also do cardio. Approx. 3 weeks ago is started getting a pressure in my chest and that went on for about a week then one day, while at work i got up out of the chair and this light headness, warm sensation across my upper body and shortness of breath happened. I went straight to the ER and they put me on an EKG and blood pressure monitor. EKG reading was fine and blood pressure wasnt high but went down after i calmed down. They sent me home. Two days later samething, went back to the ER and this time my DR. admitted me for 3 days. I had a catscan, ECG, stress test, vaulve sonigram done. Cardioligist said there was nothing wrong with my heart. 2 days later had another attack, went back to the ER. Dr. was there and proscribed Paxil and believes that it might be a panic attacks. Went home and that night had a reaction to the paxil so i couldnt take it. 2 days later another episode. This time the ER Dr. prescribed xanax. Took it and kills my sense but doesnt stop the feelings, seems to make them worse. Cant take xanax anymore don't like the feeling. Chest pressure remains and i get bad headaches.  Can this really be panic attacks? Does the feeling last all day long? My Dr. has prescribed me Wellbutron XL now and i took it today without any side effects so far.  Also throughout the day i catch myself having to take deep breaths. I've done alot of reading on here and trying to figureout what might be going on but i'm at a loss. Any help would be greatly appreciatied. Thanks :roll:\n\n",

    "content": "Chest pain, tightness, Difficulty breathing and headache are common symptoms of Anxiety and panic attacks. Different studies have provided a relationship between psychological conditions, like high anxiety and life stress, with chest pain especially in females. It is also believed that women with chest pain and are known to have anxiety disorders are less likely to be of Coronary heart disease.  And that is why females with prior history of Anxiety disorder, referred for coronary angiography due chest symptoms are more likely to give negative results. However, in any case of chest pain with a possibility of coronary heart disease, at least an ECG during the attack should be done to rule out the diagnosis. In addition other investigations and lab tests are requested according to the physician recommendation after careful history and physical examination. If the exercise ECG is negative a nuclear scan (using thallium) can be given intravenously during exercise treadmill tests. This would allow imaging of blood flow to different parts of the heart. Stress echocardiography in which echocardiography (ultrasound) is used while the exercise treadmill test is being done, is of similar accuracy to Nuclear scan in the diagnosis of coronary heart disease.  I think your doctor has requested different investigations to rule out the Coronary heart disease, you mentioned also that your blood pressure went back to normal when you calm down.  However, I advise you to be on follow up with your consultant, and to inform him with any change in the frequency or the nature of this pain. he can recommend you either to repeat or to do more investigations accordingly. Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Dear kolo, Chest tightness is an expected well known Nicotine Withdrawal and Recovery Symptom. It is temporary and lasts for few days.  It is though to be a result of withdrawal associated or associated with a real biophysical withdrawal effect like, early cleaning, coughing and lung healing.  Relaxation exercises, a warm shower and fluid or ice water intake would make tar and mucus removal easier, hence minimize their irritation effect on the airway.  If the symptoms are increasing in severity or persists for long time, a visit to your physician should be done to be sure of the underlying cause. Good luck,\n\n",

I had a cold about four weeks ago and since then I have been experiencing intermittent wheezing on the right side of my upper chest.  There really isn't much that triggers it, but with the wheezing I ultimately start a coughing fit.  My question is, does this sound like an asthma symptom or something else.  I do also have sharp chest pains on that side but I have attributed that to musculoskeletal discomfort.  Albuterol helps in the shorterm, but the wheezing does come back.  Thanks for your help\n\n",

    "content": "Dear NikkyLeClair, Asthma is an inflammatory process in the respiratory airway. The inflammation results in spasm of the muscles of the bronchial way with swollen cells in the airway lining, as a sequence narrowing of the respiratory tract and decreased airflow.  Symptoms of asthma include, wheezing, cough with or without sputum (phlegm), and Chronic shortness of breath that is aggravated with exercises and mandate the us of accessory respiratory muscles.  Asthma symptoms can be initiated or aggravated after an attack chest infection including a common cold. Being asthmatic is a predisposing factor for repeated chest infection especially if you are a sensitive person.  For the pain you experience, more details about the character of this pain would give a better idea about the possible cause, e.g. if this pain is related to cough and deep breath , it is more likely to be due to inflammation of the pleura covering the lung a condition known as pleurisy, if it is tender it is probably a muscle pain, which could be a sequence of the asthma.  You have these symptoms for almost 4 weeks, which means you are not receiving the proper medications, so I advise you to consult your doctor. Diagnosis is made by careful history and examination. Auscultation of the chest is of great help in the diagnosis. Chest x-ray may also be needed accordingly. Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Dear bellasan, The chest contains many organs, like the heart, lungs with its pleural covering, esophagus, muscles, ribs, tendons, and nerves. They all can be the source of the pain felt in the chest. each gives a characteristic form of pain together with the signs obtained by physical examination and investigations, the diagnosis can be confirmed. Pain due to rib or chest wall bone and muscle diseases, is also another cause of chest pain. They are also associated with tenderness over the affected areas which is characteristic for this type of pain.  In all of these conditions the chest pain is usually aggravated by taking deep breath and cough. however, myalgia and muscle strain can be secondary to a primary respiratory problem like asthma, cough, and shortness of breath. have you got any cold attack before you experienced this pain?  I advise you to consult your doctor, as you need to be properly examined and investigated. Good luck,\n\n",

    "content": "Well after about 8 days of feeling better it all seemed to go to hell.  On Saturday I was feeling like my usual breathing troubles, out of nowhere.  Today(Sunday) it is different.  I feel this sensation in my throat, like I can feel it.  Like I can feel my own tracea, through and through.  Very weird.  And it sortof feels like I am strangling/chocking myself, but not fully of course.  I still feel as if I am getting adequate air but it feels pretty weird and it is worrying me, even as I type this I feel as if it is getting worse.  Nothing really feels swollen, other than my tongue (maybe?).  It's very odd, I am getting pretty frustrated over here and I am worried.  I am almost ready to call off my trip and head home but I am concerned with being in the air for 11 hours if I am still feeling like this.  Currently I am monitoring it, it is Sunday evening.  Hopefully I wont have to head to the hospital.  I am looking forward to sleeping and hopefully feeling relieved in the morning.  And I think regardless of how I feel I will visit a doctor tomorrow.  The URL to my last post if you wish to read the history of this thing. http://www.doctorslounge.com/chest/foru ... hp?t=13200  Basically I've been in Thailand since May 3 and I have been feeling weird in the breathing category for most of my trip.

For accuracy, when in question, rates are assessed for a full minute. For instance, people whom are athletic may have a lower respiratory rate, heart rate, and blood pressure than others may experience whom are less active. If your physician upon your evaluations have found no other abnormalities and is not concerned with this being slightly lower than normal then I would not worry much at this point.

EKG's can detect abnormal rhythms, etc. but generally speaking when identifying if a cardiac origin is present, the tests completed over all is gathered to achieve the diagnostic picture.

I always have to urge to cough and clear my throat and \"hawk\" up mucus, it rarely subsides during the day. The mucus is usually clear or light yellow, but occasionally a larger chunk of darker yellow/tan will come up. I have also noticed at times my chest up through my neck/throat feel really hot inside, like my breath is really hot or something. Also I get a high heart rate at times and it feels irregular at times, too.  Sometimes I get this all day and night, other times just for a 1/2 hr. to a few hours a day.  For some reason I have this fear of pulmonary embolism due to having a high d-dimer. Would symptoms of PE come and go though or would they remain constant or get worse?

    "content": "I really need help with something that I have had for many months now... This all started back in March, when I came down with a really bad cold and burning throat pain. This lasted for about 2 weeks, and just as I was recovering from that, on the 21st of march I woke up one morning to a lot of pain on my left side, I could barely breathe because the pain was so strong.. as if someone was stabbing me on the side. I went to the docter and he just prescribed me some painkillers, ketoprofin etc, which I took for one week... This was monday, and by thursday I was feeling pretty good and since I am so addicted to the gym, I couldnt help go work out since I thought I was all fine by now... Well, the next day I got a fever and was feeling so sick that I went to the docter again and I was diagnosed with sinuitis. That explained all the headaches I had had the previous week... The docter prescribed with me an antiobitic that I cant remember the name of right now.. So I started taking that, but the fever wouldnt go away.. I had the fever for many days and the following thursday II woke up to a really strange feeling on my left.. It was a wheezing feeling that was accompanied with pain. So it felt as if there was something in my lungs or my side, which was really weird.. everytime I breathed it hurt really bad.. Well I went to the docter the next day again, where blood tests and x-ray were taken. Now I was diagnosed with pneumonia!! The docter didnt give me anything for it because he said that the antiobiotics that I was on for the sinuitis would probably kill the bacteria thats causing the pneumonia...... The next time I woke up with the same pain and wheezing feeling.. it was horrible. At times I felt alright, and other times worse... Well,the following monday, the 10th and thus last day of my antiobiotics course, I hoped that the antibiotics had killed everything necessary, but that day I experieced different symptons than before, now I had pain in my chest.. above my breasts, and it lasted for about half an hour, until I took pain killers and it went away.... On wednesday I went to the docter again since I still had some symptons even after my first course of antibiotics had ended.. Now I got a 10 day penicillin course... And I seemed to be feeling alright again, except now, sometimes when I would walk too much or seem to exhaust myself somehow, I started feeling this \"wheezing\" feeling again on my left side... and It seemed to go away with rest...  And especially when I had gone out later at night when it was colder outside, it seemed to just get worse... So i tried to just get a lot of rest and take it easy... A week later when I was climbing up the stairs at school, this wheezing feeling on my left appeared again, and it was accompanied with pain.... The next day I went to the docter again, they took my blood tests and CRP, a heart film just to check that nothing was wrong with the heart.. There was nothing wrong with my heart, thank goodness and the blood tests were pretty normal too... I was feeling good for a few days after that. This visit to the docter was on wednesday, but on saturday morning I woke up with the same pain and wheezing feeling AGAIN.... and even If i went back to sleep, it woudlnt go away... It would normally hurt for a few hours, everytime I breathed in and out... but would go away with pain killers.. Well, the same thing happened again exactly a week later... I felt fine all the other days, but exactly the next Saturday morning I woke up with the same thing... Then I was fine for a few days, but hte following thursday it all came back again.. And normally it starts with a small feeling of \"something\" there on the left... it comes like crawling... It just normally comes out of the blue, with a small \"feel\" or something there, then it gets stronger and then it is accompanied by pain.... This thursday, I could only breathe shallow because If i tried to breathe in deep my left side/lower back would hurt really bad..... Well so I went to the docter again, a different docter this time, and I had my x-ray, blood tests, and CRP taken just in case.. and EVERYTHING came back normal... no inflmmation could be found from the blood tests, and the docter said that the pneumonia also had almost completely dissapeared... the docter just said that the pain must be muscle pain.... It was very hard to believe that since it hurt so much, everytime I breathed in and out.... The docter said I could live just normally, so I waited a few days.. and thought that okay, I guess it is muscle pain then... Now it is may, and its been almost 2 months since I got sick... 5 days after the last docter visit, I had the same pain.. again.... But despite this, i started to gently work out.. I went on small jogs.. and they actually made me feel much better.. same thing again a week later...and then 10 days later, and during all this I had started biking too, because I assumed  that I would just live normally just like the docter had said, and since Its so hard for me to be without my workouts, i was so impatient, and I thought that whatever I had would eventually go away.. but again. the 22nd of may, the same crawling wheezing feeling and pain came up... and it would usually last all day, and the next day I would still feel \"sore\" on the left, and then i I would be fine a few days, and AGAIN the same thing, and now it has been going on for over 3 months!! A week after I just totally stopped working out, the same thing came about every other day.. and now a week ago, it continued for a few days........ I really don't know what it is that I have.. The docters keep saying that it is just muscle pain, but I never coughed a lot when I was sick, and I don't understand if it is muscle pain, why would the symptons reoccur from time to time, out of the blue and be painless at first and then start to hurt..... Maybe the pneumonia that I had caused an inflammed muscle that then radiates to the pleura... or it could be pleuritis.. I don't know, I just want to figure out what it is that I have, because I cant even work out or live my life normally like I used to!! PLEASE anyone if anyone has had simlar things, randomly reoccuring wheezing feeling and pain.... please let me know...\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, this is a reply to dreamer girl. I am also experiencing pain similar to yours.  I had quite a bad cough after Xmas, but it went a few weeks ago. However, lately I have been experiencing pain, on my left side, sort of feels like its under my rib, going from my side to my back. When I breathe it REALLY hurts, deep breathing is especially painful. This is also accompanied by a wheezing sensation, but it doesnt feel like its coming from my chest, the wheezing sensation is felt in my side, under my rib. It is bizarre!  I can;t see how it is muscular as where would the wheezing sensation come from ? I have not yet been to the doctors. Symptoms come and go. One day I'm fine, the next, the pain is back. Did u ever find out what it was? The last u said was that the doc said it was muscular ? Thanks  Jen  (20, female)\n\n",

    "content": "Has anyone ever experienced lung/chest pain (burning, tightnes) that seems to be aggrivated by talking? This usually only occurs to me in the eve. What happens is that during the course of a conversation, my left lung primarily gets a burning sensation, so much so that I need to stop talking. Heavy breathing does not seem to bother it and this usually is not felt on the right. I do have mild asthma and it also seems that my lungs are a bit tight so maybe it's related to that. When this happens it also bothers the left side of my abdomen/stomach so I don't know if it's actually the lungs, stomac or both involved. My doctor seems to think it's either pleursy or maybe reflux. I'v been on prilosec for two months and still this happens. Maybe it's anxiety related?  Thanks\n\n",

Sometimes it's a bit duller, other times it's very sharp and scares me.  There is a large history of heart disease in my family, so i guess I've been scared to tell anyone and/or go see my doctor.  Sometimes it's daily, or it is as little as once a week.  Sometimes it's lengthy, often, or other times it's short.  I have noticed too that it often wakes me up in the middle of the night or the morning, and I just have to lay there.  Is this 'normal?\" Or is there something serious I should be scared about?  I guess I just don't know...I feel like I shouldn't be having any problems like this, I'm a young, healthy 22 year old.  But, the pains do scare me.\n\n",

I felt like I was breathing in and out fine, but the breath wasn't working.. like I was suffocating and breathing at same time.  Every minute or so I had to stop and take really deep breath. Which I could only sometimes get a satisfying deep breath?  After a clear chest xray, I went for a pulmonary function test and got diagnosed with asthma and received advair. After using this twice daily for a week, I felt no better. The feeling of suffocating is as bad as ever, and now 3 days ago I got really bad chest pressure. feels as if someone is sitting on my chest.  My doc then sent me for a cat scan to check for blood clots in the lung and I do not have any.  This is horrible and scary and I feel like Im dying. My doc doesn't seem to have any other ideas, and just blames the asthema. How can asthma this severe come and worsen in weeks? How come my chest is so heavy?\n\n",

If your Advair inhaler has thus far been ineffective, there are other medications used in treatment of Asthma. Is your physician a Pulmonologist? If not, and he/she is having difficulty finding appropriate treatment in alleviating your symptoms, inquire about a referral to a Pulmonologist as these physicians are specialists in treating respiratory conditions.

Age: 17 2. Sex: female 3. Past diagnoses: i had mono about 3 months ago? 4. Past surgeries: i had my tonsils and adenoids taken out when i was 6 5.

    "content": "After trampolining, the other day my chest hurt due to the up and down motion of my upper body. I had never experienced this before but since then the pain has got progressively worse and now i cannot jump, run or allow my upper body to move in an up/down motion without experiencing a reasonable amount of sharp pain in the centre of my chest. The pain, although having never arisen before, happened almost immediately when jumping on the trampoline and i have recieved no shocks to the chest or pulled any muscles as far as i can see. I am getting more and more anxious that this could be a serious problem though i cannot believe that jumping was the trigger. I am only 19, and have had no medical problems before and the pain only occurs when the body moves in the aforementioned up/down motion sitting and lying are not painful, only when my upper body moves up and down. I can't very well explain the sensation, allthough it feels similar to when you're in a car and you go over a hill quickly and your insides feel like they rise really quickly and then come back down to earth (if this helps) only the sensation is also quite painful. I'm praying its a pulled muscle or something, but I cannot think of a situation where this could have occured. I have searched high and low for answers but can't find anything where others have experienced this type of pain when the upper body moves up/down. Why could this be happening? Is it anything to worry about and if so, what should I do? I can't easily get to a doctor, and am trying to take things easy. Should I be more worried about this pain?\n\n",

My 8 year old started complaining of chest pain when he jumped after about 4 days of jumping. I thought he might have just sprained a muscle or something and told him to stay off for a few days. Then about 3 days later my oldest son who is 10 said he was having pain too. They haven't jumped for almost a week and my oldest son pain is gotten a lot better, but my 8 year old still has the pain, even when he is just playing with friends and if he jumps or goes up and down, or runs, it hurts. Any ideas? Thanks so much,\n\n",

    "content": "My husband is 26 years old.  He has constant unexplained chest pains.  He has no family history of heart problems or other related things.  His maternal grandmother did have lung cancer.  He does smoke but he is as active as possible with the chest pains.  He works in construction during the winter months and has to be extremly active and do very physical work.  He seems to have no increase in symptoms when he works.  He has had these pains for about 6-7 years and no doctor has been able to tell him why.  He has the chest pains, lightheaded, and diarehha.  These are the only symptoms, I guess they are symptoms.  He has had chest xrays, blood work, endoscopy, and EKG's.  The xrays and EKG's came back fine.  The blood work indicated that he had a bacteria in his stomach that would prevent damage from acid reflux from healing up, his dr prescribed the prev pack with antibiotics, some type of antacid and an inhaler.  He just got done doing that 2 week treatment but has had no relief.  The endoscopy showed a small amount of damage from acid reflux and that dr gave him nexium and told him it is all in his head.  We are very unsatisfied with these answers.  Is it possible that this bacteria is causing this pain? Does an EKG show if he would have Mitral valve prolapse?  What else could this be?  In the past three years he had started taking pain pills, that I was unaware of.  He came clean to me about 2 months ago and has now stopped taking them after time in rehab.  He really feels that he has pain, how could this be all in his head??  Constant, persisting chest pain that puts a otherwise healthy 26 year old young man laid out on the couch the majority of the time because he is in so much pain, how can that be possible??  We are fighting with getting the dr's to figure out what the cause is and also fighting the addiction and him wanting to return to the pills because he is getting no relief.  Could you please help us??  Any advise would be appreciated.  He was on meds for the diarehha, ultram to ween him from the addiction, and some sleeping meds to help him sleep because of the pain.  He has now stopped taking all and really won't take the nexium because he says that his pain is not acid reflux, he said he knows what that feels like and he doesn't have it anymore.  He had taken nexium a couple years ago for awhile and ever since then he said he hasn't felt the reflux pain.  Could the little bit of damage from the reflux be causing all this pain??  What will heal that up?\n\n",

    "title": "Strange chest pains and sensations",
    "content": "am writing in regards to my boyfriend's strange chest symtoms. He is 36 years old and has been experiencing strange pains and sensations in his chest for approx. 1 year. The pain are in the upper left side of his chest, almost in the shoulder area. He has had the usual tests by a cardiologist...EKG's, treadmill test etc. Doctor's concluded it was Anxiety and put him on a muscle relaxer and 2 anti Anxiety meds....his Chest pains did not subside. Since then he has cut down on the anti-Anxiety meds and no longer takes the muscle relaxer ( it sapped all his energy). He complains on constant uncomfortable feelings, lots of Back pain and strange \"wave feelings in his chest\" sometimes at night. He is currently seeing a chiropractor as he thought the pain may be back related, but it seems to have had little effect. I am wondering if it may be nerve or muscle related. If so, what steps can be taken to diagnosed this issue better. He is miserable and stressed about the possible cause of these symptoms. In addition I will say that since beginning the meds, he has gained 30 lbs and feels worried to exercise more because of the pains. Any help would be appreciated very much.\n\n",

    "title": "Chronic, unexplained lung pain, please help.",
    "content": "I am a 23 y/o female, nonsmoker, with no past medical problems.  In March 2005 I developed a dull chest pain just to the right of my sternum.  When it didn't go away within several hours I went to the ER.  An EKG and chest Xray were performed, doctor said both looked good and it was most likely Pleurisy.  He gave me a 6 day course of steroids and a mild painkiller. I took both medicines to completion with no alleviation of my symptoms.  I followed up with my family doctor who gave me a strong anti-inflammatory and told me sometimes Pleurisy can take time.  To make it short, the pain never went away.  I doubt it is Pleurisy, because the pain is very uncharacteristic.  It is throughout both lungs, from chest to back, and it present at least for a moment everyday, if not hours.  It seems to have remissions where it is barely present, then will come back.  The pain ranges from a 1 to about a 6 at it's worst.  Sometimes it is burning (usually when laying on my back), sometimes stabbing, sometimes a cramping sensation.  It does not improve or get worse upon inhale or exhale, and I have no hemoptysis. I went to another doctor two months ago for a follow-up.  She did a peak flow test since she said my lungs don't sound like they are moving air well.  The result was average, she said.  Another CXR was performed, and it was clear.  She also did Xrays of my C-spine and T-spine to rule out an orthopedic problem.  The C-spine xray shows straightening of my neck.  She sent me to physical therapy for this, but the therapist told me they couldn't help me, as my problem wasn't caused by the straightening of my neck.  The therapist also did manual tests to check for nerve compression and found none. Please help me, I don't know what else to do.  I don't have insurance, which is why doctors visits are few and far between.  Any suggestions about what this could be?  Thanks in advance.\n\n",

They had to go all the way to a pulmonary angiogram to find the PE.  I am not anyone with medical expertise, just a fellow patient, but did they do any other imaging studies? A V/Q scan, perhaps?  That was what led them to continue searching for a PE on me, because it did not rule one out, but it did not absolutely make it positive for one either.  My clot was very small, but I had a lot of hemoptysis with it - no shortness of breath or chest pain or anything.  The second time they found them on the CT with no problem, and I did have chest pain, rather in my back.\n\n",

As for me, i haven't seen a doctor yet so i don't know what mine could be. i was hoping to get an idea from here before i can determine whether i need to see a doctor or whether there are any counter medications that i can try first. Someone please help?\n\n",

The typical feature is that the pain increases when you take a deep breath.  Yes, pleurisy will also cause similar pain which deteriorates with breathing but it will also be accompanied by low grade fever, loss of appetite, irritating cough, weight loss etc.  You have pucca musculoskeletal pain, a few days of Ibuprofen 600 mg 2-3 times a day plus hot fomentation of the local area will resolve the issue.

    "title": "Unknown Chest Pains",
    "content": "I am a 25 year old male living in the UK, not sure of wieght, probably a tiny bit on the heavy side, but not overly so.  I was sitting at work on the Wednesday before Christmas, and noticed that the dull ache I'd had in my lower back shot up to the left side of my chest, which was extremely painful to take a full breath, and really hurt when both inhaling and exhaling.   I have something called Factor V Leiden mutation which means I have an increased risk of blood clots.   The pain wasin  the left side coming round to the left front at the ribs to lower ribs  I was pretty concerned about this, so I went to A&E where I was given the following:  X-Ray to check for broken ribs - turned out to be all clear Blood test - came back with an increase in one marker (I don't know which one) which apparently DIDN'T rule out a blood clot, it didn't suggest there was one, but it was the one marker that had it been normal, would have ruled out a clot. ECG - apparently normal  So they gave me some blood thinning agents and put me in a ward until the following morning at which point they gave me something called a VQ Scan, which was made up of me inhaling some kind of radioactive gas which allowed them to take pictures of the airflow in my chest. They then injected a similar substance which showed the bloodflow in and around my chest. This apparently would have shown up a clot.   The scan came back as perfectly normal, which was good news considering I was a smoker for a few years (gave up 4 years ago). So clear x-ray, ecg, vq scan, and the blood tests suggested no inftection.  The pain went after a few hours in the ward (I was given paracetamol and ibuprofen). However I noticed it came back when I got up to go the toilet, then went away soon after I lay back down.  So they released me from hospital on the Friday, as the pain had subsided, and they just put it down to either being muscular or \"one of those things\".   However on Friday night I woke up with the same pain in my chest (I was lying on my left side) and noticed that I couldn't exert myself to roll onto my back (very painful). By Saturday morning the pain was gone.   Over the Christmas period, I got a little sharp pain every now and then, but nothing like what I had in hospital. However last night I got the same agonising pain in the same bit of my chest (the left side coming round to the left front at the ribs to lower ribs). Again it's now gone.  I have a slight tightness at the front of my chest, which I think is because I'm a little uptight at work (I had a paretty stressful year last year and I'm almost used to worrying about worrying, if you know what I mean!).  So, any ideas what this might be? Could it be muscular? I was thinking about buying some ibuprofen and seeing if that helped. Could it be stress related? I read elsehwere that there is something called chest wall syndrome. I did however get the impression that this was sore ALL the time, whereas mine comes and goes.  I had my blood pressure taken many times while in hospital (I don't think it was perfect, but it wasn't overly high, and I was pretty worked up!).\n\n",

While on my side breathing felt \"crackly\" and \"gurgly\" on the side where the pain was, and I had to twist myself round to get onto my back, and while doing so the point where the pain was would crack or move, and the pain would ease......  I went back to the doctors, as far as he was concerned, there was nothing wrong but I may have inflammation of the chest wall, so take ibuprofen and see how it goes. I did that, and I must admit it's easing....  still really strange though.\n\n",

Also there is pain under my arms at the front. It feels like my chest is so tight all the time. I also have shoulder pain and one doctor I have seen says it is pain from my shoulders radiating to the front but i don't see how muscle pain lasts 4 weeks.  I have had a ECG scan and chest xray about 3 weeks ago and the doctor said it was fine. Another doctor i have seen says i have reflux disease so have been on tablets for the last 7 days and thats was because I drink alot of orange juice but have stopped drinking it and im still not better.  Also I do notice sometimes my heart beat a couple of times which the doctor said is normal.  could you please help me with a explaination cause i have seen 6 doctors now and they are all mainly saying its muscle pain but its really worrying me.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 19 year old female, and about a month and a half ago I was hospitalized for 3 days due to sever abdominal pain, high fever, and a high WBC count.  They did numerous tests and could not find out the source of the problem.  I finally decided to go home without an answer.  The abdominal pain has not gone away, but has diminished.  Then, about 3 weeks ago I went to the ER because of severe rib pain.  They thought I had blood clots in the lung and did a CT scan, and after finding nothing abnormal, diagnosed me with costochondritis.  The doctor said to take high doses of Ibuprofen for a week and that the pain would go away.  The pain has not gone away but has moved up into my clavicle and upper chest.  The pain worsens when I breathe and move.  It has gotten to the point where it is getting hard to breathe because the pain is so severe.  I have a cough every now and then that's deep and vibrates my whole chest, but I only cough every now and then, usually when I'm laying down.  I almost don't want to go back to the hospital because they have no idea what is wrong with me.  What should I do?  Thank you!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Monkey_65775,  Lung nodules can be benign or malignant.  Malignant nodules usually have certain appearances on the ct scan and should be easily recognized by the radiologists.  The benign nodules or the nodules thought not to be malignant have to be followed upo by ct scans or chest x-rays and the rate of growth watched carefully. If the nodules are not getting bigger, sometimes it is safe to go from every six month to each year and see how it goes.  All nodules have to be looked at in the setting of the clinical context.  What initiated the ct scan to be done though?  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

I have a normal BP and Cholesterol, EKG came out normal, chest x-ray came out perfect, doctors couldnt find anything. My family has a long line of heart problems, so as soon as I felt that discomfort, I didnt hesitate to go to the ER. At which time the doctor said I had had my first  panic attack and I was hyperventilating. I went to my follow up and everything was normal.   Since then Ive felt this pain usually when I get up in the mornings and heaviness to boot, Ive also noticed my strength has decreased the past few days, I have a hard time holding my niece when i didnt before.  Ive also noticed that Ive been burping more often. Usually when I take a short nap leaning on my right side is when I feel better.  I have taken antacids and NON-SAID's. I do help alot of people with the lifting of heavier items. I recently had a muscle tear in my lower right abdomen and have been taking it easy for a few weeks.  I honestly don't know what it is, Ive never had any physical health problems in my life. Ive been given heating pads, cold pads to administer over the area, Ive cut down on sodas and spicy foods in case it was acid, Am I doing the right things?  Thank you for your help.\n\n",

Gerd, for example, may cause symptoms of chest pain, acid reflux, etc. Discuss with your physician about a regular medication regimen (Zantac, Prevecid, etc.) to see if this helps alleviate the symptoms. You may also want to use some relaxation techniques to reduce the episodes of anxiety as physical symptoms may result from both anxiety and depression. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "title": "constant chest pressure, dry cough, hoarseness",
    "content": "I had this constant chest pressure for the last 2. 5 months.  I also have a dry Cough and my voice gets hoarse once in a while. all these sytmomes started 2. 5 months ago. I also have blood in my phlem and when I blow my nose. the blood has been present for the last month almost every day.   I went to a dr. he thinks its GERD. I have been taken xantax 150 for 1 month now and I have no signs of relief from my symptoms.  I took a chest xray and a chest cat scan. the cat scan showed I have mild lung scarring on top of my lungs. the pulmonay specialist said the scarring was not causing my symtoms. I also took a pulmonary funtion test, and that came out normal. my blood test came out normal as well.   I have been stressing this a lot lately. I get pains on the back of my neck now and also pain on my back (near the left sholder blade).   I am 26 years old. I drink heavily on the weekends and also smoke on the weekends. I did smoke from reguarly from age 16-21. I have cut down on drinking. if I did have GERD, would my symtoms get worse if I drink? it seems when I drink, the chest pressure is reduced (maybe becuase im intoxicared?)   is this GERD or something else? =(\n\n",

    "title": "Chest pain this week after ovarian cyst rupture last week",
    "content": "I had, as stated in the topic title, an ovarian cyst burst last week and had the extreme pain that went with it (low blood pressure resulted along with tachycardia and syncope) and went to the ER where I underwent CT scans and blood tests.  I developed an infection two days later as I was not prescribed an antibiotic at the outset.  I was then put on 400mg avalox and had been on Vicodin and Naprosyn.  I am still on avalox but last night developed pain on the right side of my chest and around to the back side of my right shoulder blade.  I again went to the ER and again experienced syncope and tachycardia.  They did blood tests and chest x-rays to test for a pulmonary embolism but both came back negative. (I have since read that you can get false negative reports on the blood tests and that it does not always show up on early chest x-rays).  I was diagnosed with costalchondritis (?) and/or pleurisy.  My questions are 1) can my original ovarian cyst rupture be considered a trauma bad enough to cause a PE and 2) if I am on antibiotics, is it reasonable to believe that I could develop a bacterial infection such as pleurisy? (BTW, I have now received two more antibiotic presriptions to fight the pleurisy)  Sorry to be so long winded but any answers I could recieve would be most helpful.  Thanks for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "I have been experiencing sharp pains on the left side toward the middle of my chest.  This began about 3 weeks ago on the right side and then moved to the left.  The sharp pains have subsided to more of an ache over the past 3-4 days with only intermittent sharp pains.  There has also developed a continual pain between my shoulder blades that is not subsiding even with Advil.  The pains in the chest occur when active and when resting although they are better when lying down.  The pain in the back is 24 hours a day.  I have a history of MRSA skin infections and have no idea if this has anything to do with this. I have been on several different medications over the past 2 years due to the MRSA infections (Bactrim DS, clindimycin, vicoden, doxycyclene, etc) although I have not been on any for a couple of months.  Any advice would be appreciated.\n\n",

(I don't normally get colds or bronchitis nor do I have a history of allergies so I don't know why I think I can assume any of that accurately :) ).  It went away so I didn't think anything of it.

    "title": "ride side chest pain +++",
    "content": "Hello Bettylou,   I am having similar pains, and I have also had my gallblader removed. I'll give you the whole story.  First, I am 20 year old female. I had my gallbladder removed when I was around 13. My mom, aunt and grandmother all had theirs removed- my mom on the same day- we all had stones.  Over the past few years I have had gradually increasing abdominal pains. Over the past year - year and a half, the pains have gotten more severe. It seems that 8 out of 10 times I eat I have a bowel movement. Sometimes I don't even get to finish my meal before. I also have abdominal pains without eating and sometimes are relieved by a bowel movement. More often then not it is diahrea. I have been to the doctor and without any testing was told it was IBS. I took the medicine-dicycolime for a little while, did nothing.  That was almost a year ago. Since then I have been to the doctor for another reason... the chest pain.  About 8 weeks ago I was driving around town and had a sudden sharp pain on the center *left* side of my chest.  I went home and laid down for a little while and the pain went away. The next day I was driving home again from our stateline, about 45 minutes away. Still far out of reach of a hospital, the sharp chest pain came back again. This time it was a little more right in the center. This time it felt more severe. My fiance was driving and got us to the hospital as fast as he could. By that time it had calmed a bit and was starting to go away. So I decided to go see my parents. I told my mom what was going on and she thought it was just indigestion. I took some rolaids to see if it would help. To my knowledge, it didn't cause it slowly went away like it did the day before The pain lingered for quite sometime til eventually I bent over and all of a sudden could barely breathe. I was taking short puffs of breathe as we drove to the ER (which is a 15 min+ drive!!) We got there, by then I was crying almost hysterically. They signed me in... and of course 30+ minutes later I was called into the office so they could take my pulse and ask what was wrong... After that I continued to wait and wait and wait to go back... and then continue w/o any visit by the staff for hours. Finally when the doc came in to take a listen to my lungs, the pain was gone. I was fine. So they did a chest xray, gave me some lortab perscription, told me there was nothing wrong and that maybe my chest was inflammed.    The pain persisted for a few days, with shortness of breathe and right sided chest pain. Eventually my entire right side of the chest, not just the center was in pain. My right underarm to my chest and breast was throbbing with pain. It felt/looked like my underarm area and about an inch out toward my chest was swollen. My left underam had a swollen lymph node, which I had before 4 or so months ago. Two week sor so went by the pain went away, or was very minimal and was every other day or so with a few moderate pains. I wanted to see the doctor but was working out an insurance problem. During that time I started having severe right sided headaches as well. I had a lot of pressure behind the right eye, pain in the right temple, in the head above and behind the ear following down towards the right side of my neck/spine area.  My vision would go blurry in my right eye throught the headaches. One time my right upper eyelid swelled really bad and made my eye close half-way. That's when it really started to worry me. Additionally, I started to get a hard knot/lump on my left abdomen right below my breast that would throb with pain as it seemed for no apparent reason. Occasionally with a smaller lump on the left side.   Finally I got into the doctor about 3 weeks ago. He felt around my stomach and did not feel anything - the lumps and pain only appear occasionally so he felt nothing wrong.  He did an EKG and found nothing wrong with my heart either. He decided to put me on 600mg of ibuprofen 4 times a day - he thought I had costrochondits (inflammation of the cartlige between the lungs and ribs) and then if it persisted after 3 days to go to the cardiologist referal.  Then follow up with him in a week to go further with the headaches and stomach problems.   Well, it seemed that the ibrprofen had worked so no cardiologist.. I went back to the doctor a week later and said I hadn't had much pain. Maybe a dull ache here and there. So he decided to move on to my stomach against my request of going with my headaches - as I have been dealing with stomach problems for quite some time, I have learned to deal with it. He put me on levsin - only to take when needed and told me to continue with the ibuprofen for the chest only when needed instead of every 4 hours. To take away the pain from the headaches, he also game me a small dosed persciption of lortab....  He said he thought it was IBS too - even though I told him the last medicine I had (bentyl-dicycolmine) had not worked, and my pain didn't coincide with the reasons IBS has for acting up. He said it was strange that denser-fibrous foods made it act up worse so he wanted to send me to a GI doctor while taking the med - and then to follow up with him in two weeks.  In the mean time, I went to see an eye doctor. My mom is an optician and the doctor where she works checked out my eyes. She first did an eye exam and found that my right eye was barley .25 off. She said it was very minimal but would have me get glasses to wear when I am on the computer & studying to maybe ease any strain it is causing. She then dialated my eyes. She was worried that the pressure I was feeling may have been an early sign for glaucoma. She checked it and everything looked normal. But she noticed my extreme sensitivity to light. My left eye had a normal light sensitivity response to dialation, but my right eye was pretty sever. But it seems my eyes have been light sensitive for quite some time anyway, especially with my headaches.  She said if the pain persisted after two weeks with the glasses to see a neurologist - and also to ask my family doctor for a perscription of I...?? - something for migraines.  Now it has been a week and a half - not two weeks yet (when I follow up with the family doctor) and I had to make an emergency appointmen. My chest pains came back half a week ago while we were at the movies. It started with a gradually pain increasing headache, and then the chest pains started. We started heading home and turned back to go to the emergency room. The pain was sharp again, and all over the right side. Very sensitive to the touch. My breath was short and very painful. But by the time we got there the pain had almost gone away so I went back home. A few days went by and then again the pain came back severly. I dealt with it until the next day. I was in a lot of pain, even my mouth and back of throat was a little sore and sensitive when I inhaled, plus I  had a bad headache so I went and saw the doctor. By the time I got into see him the pain wasnt as severe, but it was still there. He said the pain in my mouth and the higher chest pain was acid reflux from the ibuprofen. I didnt agree with it, as the pain was the same feeling I felt lower in my right chest. Anyway, he decided to give me another cardiologist referal within 48 hours (I am still waiting on) for a stress test. He also told me to take one 81mg aspirin a day until I saw him again (after we got the results from the stress test). He also put me on perscription for Aciphex for acid refulx - he said it would take 3 days for it to work so to take maylox or mylanta in the mean time. Funny though, because he said the refulx was from ibuporfen and to stop taking it. Why would I need a two month perscription for an acid refulx disease medication? I got the perscription anyway, and started taking it today. I think we are going in the wrong direction... Anyway, aside from that I told him I was really worried about my headaches. He said he would deal with that later, cause he wants to put me on a migraine medication, but if something is wrong with my heart, the medication could give me a heart attack... He said to continue taking lortab for the pain when needed and dismissed it.   I am in a bit of pain right now. A couple hours ago I had a terrible pain at the base of my skull-where it meets my neck. It was tender to the touch and very painful. The pain even stemmed moderatly down my spine. I put a cold rag on it and took a lortab. Now, two hours later, the pain has moved more from there to my right temple. It isnt as strong, but theres also a lot pressure.   I don't know what is wrong with me. I don't think my doctor is going in the right direction. I can't help but think there might be a coralation between the chest pain and the headaches... As they are both on the same started, and started about the same time. Some of the things I've looked up online have scared me to where I am afraid to look anything else up... Things from the coxsackie virus - which causes meningits as well as plyueridia, etc., to lupus, brain tumors, and more... Lupus seems like a good posibilty but the doctor doesnt think the pains are related. Coxsackie virus fits good as well. Before this all started I had constant canker sores for a few weeks... and during I had one as well... which is the start of it.... anyway. I know you can fit a lot of symptoms to a lot of diseases so I probably shouldnt try.. I am just scared and worried. When I was having gallblader pains it took them almost two years to find out that it was my gallblader that was causing it... with multiple sonograms and all..and people checking for stones in it... I don't want this to be the same situation. It is straining my daily life. I don't feel like doing much anymore and havent gone to school since this started. I am also worried that there might be something severely wrong that needs immediate attention, and by the time I get it it might be too late...  Well I hope you are feeling better! If you go to the doctors, let me know what they say.  Take care, Renee\n\n",

I recently went for a chest  x-ray due to left side rib pain after a coughing attack.  Dr. suspected a broken rib.  none found.

    "content": "I am not sure why the doctor ordered all of those Ig tests;  a high IgE ocurs in people with asthma (sometimes) or allergy to cetain fungus (i.e. aspergillus).  In the latter, a high-reolution CT should be done to look for bronchiectasis.  A sputum sample or even a bronchoscopy may be needed to further diagosis this.  These test though, have very little to do with the adnopathy seen on the CT scan.  Those nodes may be from an infection (perhaps causing the cough), sarcoidosis is a possibility, and cancer.  The nodes are not very big, so a biopsy may not be feasible.  One option would be to repeat the CT in 3 months.  If the nodes are bigger, they need to be biopsied.  If they are smaller, it would suggest an infectious cause.\n\n",

When infection is not a diagnostic option, in 70% of bilateral mediastinal lymph node enlargement the underlying cause is sarcoidosis. Regarding your question about pawnbrokers sign: the combination of right paratracheal and bilateral hilar lymph node enlargement is often considered a reliable sign of sarcoidosis and has been called \u201c1-2-3 sign\u201d or \u201cpawnbroker\u2019s sign\u201d.\n\n",

I have had 2 surg's on my knee due to it buckeling all the time.  I also have \"boils\" on my skin.. that i have been told is a sigh of being allergic to staff and was given topical cream called bactroban ( it first started in 1997 and i still get it .. some times i have 1 other times like now i have 5 in random places on my body)  All of these meds have been the same for at least the last year, some for over 5 years, the only thing new is the intal, sprivia, and the Avapro.( I was on Altace for 5 years and the doc thought that might of been causing the cough.)  My mom also wants you to know that I have severe Med and Food allergies plus hayfever and indoor and outdoor allergies as well. I have been sick since I was a child.  I had a heart murmor at birth and by 6 months old it was gone.  I was born Blue and at 3 months old had scarlitina. Many upper respritory infections, tonsilitis, chicken pox 3 times (twice as a child and 1 time as an adult.) I had athsma all my life and when I turned 30 my Pulmonologist said that it is now considered COPD??? don't know y but ok.  Since the coughing started I have.. VESELVEGAED 3 times while in the bathroom.. started coughing soooo hard while going that i passed out and when i came to my hubby and mom said i was pastey white and sweating profusly.  but since on the protonix i have not done it again.. (good thing.. it was scarry)  Is there any med on my list that after prolonged usage could cause the coughing?  Should I have my throid checked as well? Can you have 2 out of the 3 signs of Sarcodosis and all the other symptoms and not have it?  Again thank you.. I appreciate all the help and you have gave me alot to ask the doc's as i go to see them that i would not of known to ask.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi again cheftitan. You have a lot of information there. I will try to deal with it in a chronological order.  First, about your heart murmur, it is thought that around half of all babies and young children have innocent heart murmurs. These murmurs are called 'innocent' because they are not linked to any type of disease or structural abnormality. In most cases, the murmur will resolve by adolescence, and your\u2019s disappeared in 6 months. You don\u2019t have to worry about it.  Second, you have PCOS, and most women with PCOS have varying degrees of insulin resistance. Insulin resistance tends to be more pronounced in those who are overweighed and do not ovulate. These conditions put those with PCOS at a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. That will explain your DM II and HTN, both being well treated by your doctors. They also tested for Cushing's syndrome because it can be confused sometimes with PCOS. About having your thyroid checked, yes I think you have to, because some who have PCOS are also hypothyroid, and also thyroid hormone modulates ACE activity, and you have high levels of ACE.  Third, about your allergies. When a person has a history of many kinds of allergies (med, food, pollen), doctors call them \u201catopic patients\u201d. This condition is based on allergic predisposition by family history and is associated with allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis (allergic dermatitis), asthma and food allergy with IgE increased. These allergies can be controlled with medicine and diet.  Fourth, about COPD, if your doctor confirmed it by pulmonary function testing (spirometry, postbronchodilator spirometry, lung volumes, and diffusion capacity), there is no reason to doubt. Risk factors for COPD, among others, are also a past medical history of asthma, allergies and sinusitis. A recent study shows that adults with asthma are 12 times more likely to develop COPD than those who do not have the condition.  Don\u2019t worry, I will answer you about the sputum test and sarcoidosis in a couple of hours.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi cheftitan I\u2019m back. About your sputum results, there is nothing special, I suppose it was ordered to rule out TB (mimics sarcoidosis). Your ACE levels are very high. Also you have an abnormal CT scan, with findings consistent with sarcoidosis involvement of the mediastinal nodes. If ACE levels are high, other diseases have been ruled out, but if you have clinical findings consistent with sarcoidosis, then it is likely that you have an active case of sarcoidosis. But is not easy to confirm a diagnosis of sarcoidosis; a biopsy is necessary. I think you may need a bronchoscopy with a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and also a transbronchial biopsy of the lymph nodes. Ask your doctor about available tests that can be done with the BAL sample. I\u2019m a little concern about your skin lesions. Cutaneous involvement is seen in 25% of patients with sarcoidosis; your doctor can tell if those skin lesions are likely to be a sarcoidosis manifestations, and maybe take a biopsy of one of them.  Hope you find this information useful.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm glad things are going in the right direction. Don't worry, bronchoscopy is a safe procedure and complications are relatively infrequent and most often minor. Also, insertion of bronchoscope through the nose is better tolerated by patients; before the bronchoscope is inserted, your nose and the back of your throat will be numbed with a local anesthetic to prevent pain, coughing and gagging during the procedure. The best you can do during the test is to relax, it will be done in a few minutes. Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "I am not any better than before. Sorry I have not be able to respond in a while. I have been in Michigan and in Wash. State, for family funerals. Just returned.  I am now wondering if it is something in PA or my house that is making me cough. I left on the 15th and returned last night.  While I was gone there was minimal coughing except when extremly upset or tired, and no allergy symptoms, since i have been home (about 12 hours.) I have coughed non stop and can't catch my breath again. It is much more humid here in Pa then in MI or WAsh. There was no biopys on the brochoscope. was told by doc that lymphode was too small now and to wait 3-6 months and repeat? 3 days later I had endoscopy no signifacant findings.  Raw voicebox and raw windpipe.  Changed allergy meds to Tavist.  Still searching for a cure or diagnosis. thanks  wendy  Dr. T The Brochoscopy HURT and Was Painful as well as I got a feeling of drowning. was givin 5units of Verset.. and was still gaging and chouging. Not something i want to do ever again!! sorry. The pathologist and my mother talked after the brochial lavage.. apparently i have the cleanest lung fluid he has ever seen in someone sick. he did say that the pictures show alot of irratation. go figure. thanks again wendy\n\n",

    "content": "Hi  I am a 43 yr old female. I have had constant chest discomfort now since Aug.  I had a heavy cold at the end of July with blocked sinuses and a few days phlegmy cough at the tail end. I was ok for about a week or two and then this strange pain/discomfort started just  in the right side.  It's not a sharp pain or a stabbing pain just an ongoing discomfort.  Sometimes it spreads out and i seem to feel it then in my back or aroung the ribs at the front and side, and occasionally i feel it in the other side of my chest. It is not affected by breathing in or out or exercise and i don't have a cough.  I am a light smoker (4-5 a day) but am also pretty fit and active.  My GP didn't think there was much to it and felt an x-ray wouldn't reveal anything. He seemed reassured that my peak flow rate was 450. What i don't understand is why this doesn't either a) develop into something more or b) go away.  By the way, what would the pain of lung cancer feel like as i think this is my root fear!\n\n",

When I breathe in or out, it feels like bubbles in my lower throat.  I have asthma, but my puffer is doing nothing to help this.  I have bad coughing which is racking my whole body - so much so that my entire torso aches.  Just recently, it has become productive, and I'm coughing up small amounts of yellow/brown/thick mucus stuff.  I am hesitant to go to the doctor or ER b/c I am unemployed and have no insurance.  Should I be worried about this ?  I woke up with this difficulty breathing yesterday.  I tried taking Robotussin but it did not help.  I havent gotten much sleep either due to the difficulty breathing.  Shuld I give it some more time to try to work itself out or should I be concerned ?  I also tried taking a hot shower to loosen up my chest, but all the steam made it even more difficult to breathe and I had to quit when I started feeling light-headed.  Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 29 year old healthy (very stressed) Causcasian female. On Monday Sept. 12th I woke up at 5am with a sharp pain just under my breast bone. It hurt when breathing and certain movements. I was concerned and went to my doctor that morning. He seemed to rule out heartburn (which I have no history of) and said that because it hurt with movement and breathing it wasn't my heart. He said it was probably a strain in the tissue around my breastbone and to take advil and come back if it didn't go away. It did get better that day.  Since then I often have mild chest pains under my breastbone in the early morning (while still in bed) and I had another 'sharp' episode on Monday Oct. 31st. This time I just relaxed and breathed through my diaghram and it was better later in the morning. This morning I had another less sharp but notable breif episode. I am trying not to worry, but it seems that any chest pain is disconcerting. I have been looking at hiatal hernias, hearburn, or muscle strain but don't know if any of these could be the cause. I know that I exacerbate symptoms by feeling panicked about the pain.  I do not do any strenuous excercize. I am under a lot of stress. Could a doctor please let me know if I should be concerned and what action to take.  The pain is more upsetting then physically limiting but I am a worrier!\n\n",

Ibuprofen is a good choice because it also has antiinflammatory properties.  However, if you are very anxiou about this still, it would not be unreasonable to re-see a physician.  But other conditions that cause pain when you breath (like pleurisy - inflammation of the lininng outside your lung) seem much less likely than the muscle strain.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 19 year old female. I took an allergy test two or three years ago, when it was discovered that I have an allergy to dust and dust mites. For quite a long time now I have had sinus troubles -- mucus at the back of the throat, chronically stuffy nose, etc. However, I also have a deep cough that I can usually do at will, which also happens on its own occasionally. If I have been coughing for several minutes I sometimes start to get a coppery taste in my mouth. It doesn't seem to matter how much I clean my (hardwood-floored, fairly bleak-looking) room -- my symptoms still don't change.  I also seem to have slight trouble breathing occasionally. For example, I absolutely cannot sleep on my back at nights, because I end up hardly able to breathe. On my side or (sometimes) on my stomach are my only workable positions. I am also about 30 pounds overweight, which may have something to do with it. I also find that I have more trouble breathing if a room is very warm or stuffy.  Occasionally I have had to sprint to catch a bus. I am not in shape at all, but these sprints would last no more than two or three minutes. However, after sprinting for the bus I find myself coughing and wheezing off and on for at least half an hour. It feels like the cold air chills my windpipe, which then becomes irritated and makes me cough. I did a search and apparently this, and some chronic sinus problems, can possibly be related to asthma.   How likely do you think it is that I may have asthma? Could it just be problems related to my allergies?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello vicky_1234,  Loss of voice (doctors call it dysphonia), or hoarseness is commonly caused by a problem in the vocal cords (part of the larynx), mostly due to an inflammation (swelling), called laryngitis. Persistent hoarseness (lasts for weeks or months) may be caused by multiple problems.  I think coughing and singing are the main sources of your voice strain. Overuse or abuse of the voice can lead to the formation of nodules on the vocal cords (known as \"singer's nodules\" or \"screamer's nodules.\") Other \"bad vocal habits\" can lead to poor voice quality.  Another cause of your hoarseness, in addition to previously annotated, could be related to hormone changes that occur during puberty.  About your chest pain, a bad cough can lead to chest pain. There are several causes of cough. Chronic cough (lasts for more than 4 weeks) in young non-smokers, is frequently caused by allergies (often with nasal dripping), emotional stress (nervous tension) and viral infections. Others, like gastric reflux (acid from the stomach irritating the voice box), are unusual at your age.  I suggest you talk to the chorus director, to your parents, and call your doctor, or seek for an otorhinolaryngologist (larynx expert). In the meanwhile you can try this to lessen your symptoms:  1. Stop singing, and don't talk unless it is absolutely necessary. 2. Avoid whispering, because whispering can strain the vocal cords more than speaking does. 3. Humidify the air with a vaporizer and drink a lot of fluids.  Sincerely, Dr Torax.\n\n",

Three weeks ago, this pain became constant, extremely painful, and stemmed from behind me lower ribs to my pelvic bone.   I spent 15 hours in the ER, went through CAT scan, ultra sound, blood testing, and a pelvic exam.  They discharged me with \"back pain\". I went to my physician a couple days later and he diagnosed me with what he called \"Mycoplasm\" said it was inflamation of the lining of the lungs.   He perscribed me Doxycyline. I took the medication for a day and then woke up in the middle of sleep with intense pain in my chest.  It felt like a huge ball was rolling from my lower sternum area up to my throat.  For 2 hours it was the worst pain I have ever felt.  I would normally go to the ER, but I don't have insurance.  The pain has lessened a bit, but still really hurts when I breath and I can't eat because of the pain.  I haven't been able to get a hold of my doctor because he is on vacation.   Do you think this is serious enough to go to the ER?  Also, any medical suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you for your time!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi klembott,   The type of pain you describe seems to be substernal burning (heartburn) occurring most often after meals, and aggravated by lying down, bending over, or  lifting objects.  Doxycicline might be the origin of your heartburn, sometimes it may cause esophagitis and gastritis. I suggest you take the medication with food or milk and at least 2 hours before going to bed. Otherwise you may ask your doctor to change the prescription.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 39 yo male smoker 1 pack per day. I developed a very bad cough over a week ago.  The cough was dry at first but became very productive.  After a few days I went ot see my family doctor and he gave the usual Robistussin AC and some antibiotics.  The morning after taking the medication I woke up in the middle of the night and began hacking up chunks of green yellow gray clear  and bloody sputum all mixed together.  Needless to say I went straight back to the doctor where he immediately did a chest x-ray blood work and a re-examination. The results all clear no spots on the x-ray blood was perfect.  No explanation for the sputum.  It happens only in the morning the rest of the day it comes out either clear or greenish but no blood only when I wake up first thing.. By the way I still have a very bad cough.  Going on two weeks now.  Any answers.  Thanks in advance\n\n",

I had pneumonia last year...bad cough that didnt go away.... and  i only worried cause I started to cough up some bloody sputum in the morning. A trip to the ER showed pneumonia in one lung...no tumors.  After a round of antibiotics and 7 days later the blood stopped. 5 months later, another cold, not as bad though. It starts to produce bloody sputum again only in the morning. More Xrays....clear or pneu and tumors....suspected brochitis/infection causing blood. Antibiotics again and it goes away. No more blood till 6 months later...as in now... super bad chest cold with some blood in morning phlegm again. Antibiotics again and it appears to be going away again. I am pretty worried cause like u I smoke and am 37yo. I am trying to quit but am worried about the blood each time I get a bad cold. The rest of the time I have never seen any blood,just with bad chest colds. Anyways, good luck and maybe someone will help us figure it out. I do have asthma (mild) as well.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Baroneb and Blackskull. I will try to answer both of you.  Spitting of blood, or coughing out sputum with streaks of blood mixed with it, is called hemoptysis; it refers specifically to blood that comes from the respiratory tract.  There are many causes of hemoptysis (heart problems, trauma, infections, lung disease, etc). Worldwide, tuberculosis is the most common cause of hemoptysis. In the United States the most common causes are bronchitis, bronchiectasis, and lung cancer.  When the amount of blood is small it is considered mild hemoptysis. Blood-tinged mucus is often called hemoptoic sputum (less severe). About 70% of mild hemoptysis have a benign cause which disappears on its own without serious or permanent effects. Indeed, the most common cause of hemoptysis is the least serious, a ruptured small blood vessel caused by coughing and/or a bronchitic infection.  Is different in persons with a history of SMOKING, hemoptysis could be a sign of serious illness, including cancer. Most common causes of hemotysis in smokers are acute and chronic bronchitis, lung cancer, and pneumonia. Lung cancer is strongly suspected in heavy smokers who have hemoptysis and who are 40 yr old.  What both of you seem to have is a mild hemoptysis or hemoptoic expectoration due to a bronchitis; I\u2019m not sure if it is acute or chronic bronchitis. But cigarette smoking is the main cause of chronic bronchitis, which is characterized by cough that produces sputum (phlegm), which may be blood streaked, and usually occurs when the person first gets out of bed in the morning. Both of you smoke and have this problems in the morning.  Chronic bronchitis is one form of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and is irreversible.  First of all: stop smoking. Second, some physicians recommend CTs only when the chest x-ray is abnormal, or the patient is at risk for cancer (40 yr old, smoker). Because of its diagnostic power, others think CTs should always be performed. I\u2019m in the second group, I strongly suggest a CT scan of the chest and a bronchoscopy (the best test to rule out hemoptysis causes).  Sincerely, Dr_Torax\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you Dr.Torax for the speedy reply. **Whew** Bronchitis sounds a whole lot better than the big C.  I am trying my best to quit smoking and it is definately tough. Hopefully I can quit and let my lungs begin the repair process, whatever level  they manage to acheive must still be better than smoking.  I've had 4 XRAYS in the year and a half I\"ve had these episodes and each one came back \"clear\". All my hemoptysis seems to only occur after a bad chest cold starts to \"break up\" and be coughed out. The rest of the time , no blood. Hopefully quitting smoking will help this as well. Thanks again Doc.\n\n",

My friends think I am nuts cause it goes away with the cold......I am panicking a bit with this, but my doctor seems confident its just from my asthma/rad combo with a cold causing this.

It is always worse if I have been laying on my stomach.  -somtimes some shooting pains in front of ribcage (either side) upon waking that I don't have during the day (sometimes I will get this if I push on my ribs)  -lots of burping and some indigestion (which I have never had before--even when I was pregnant!)    -I am having some back issues for which I see a chiropractor for--lots of lower back pain (sciatica) and now, starting 4 weeks ago,  some upper back pain (my upper back feels really tight and will actually \"pop\" when I twist or turn my spine).  I am more than willing to admit to being under a lot of stress lately--we just moved into a new house and this all started when we were getting our old house ready to be sold.  I have had some anxiety attacks/issues in the past but never with these symptoms (especially the pain under the ribs). Could this be symptoms of anxiety?  I am trying to relax now that we are in our new house, but these symptoms are making me really scared and nervous and that is not helping!  Thanks for any help you can give!\n\n",

By default, she told me I had chostocondritis. I already have graves disease and had my thyroid taken out, and gallbladder disease and had that taken out. She gave me a shot of motrin that didn't help at all, and two rounds of steroids, which seemed to lessen the pain, and 800 mg of ibuprofin twice a day, which also seemed to help. The pain kept getting worse, so I am now taking darvocet n-100. I am still in alot of pain. I am a student and had a part time job (which I had to quit because I couldn't sit up in my chair for 5 hours at a time) and now my 3 hour classes are starting to be extremely uncomfortable. For about a week, I feel like I have been having problems swallowing (I get a feeling of a lump immediately after I swallow, but it goes away quickly). I have also been having bad headaches, and don't know if that is at all related to my chest and back pain. Please help...\n\n",

Usually all this pretty much goes away after I get up out of bed.  I do have lots of tightness in my upper back and the front of my chest throughout the day though.  Sometimes I get pains under my left breast too.   I don't want to run to the doctors just to have them tell me it's stress, but it is *something* and I am getting tired of it! Has your gotten any better??  Nicole\n\n",

    "content": "Nope, it has not gotten any better. I did go to the doctor AGAIN two days ago, and she wants me to see a physical therapist and a pain management doctor. My question is, why can't she just take care of the pain management? She said the pain management doctor would want to inject cortisone into my breastbone joints. Im not a doctor, but Ive done research and that was the one thing that most places said not to do. I also have extreme anxiety about getting a shot in my chest... I don't know about anyone else, but that terrifies me. Also, what can a physical therapist do if this is in my joints? I just want this to be over. I have read alot about costochondritis, and it seems it comes and goes. Like I said before, pain meds seem to help but just need to be increased (both the antiinflamatory, and the darvocet) and wait it out, then when we see how frequent it is, the decide on a plan of action, especially when it includes such high risk treatments. I would really like to be both pain and med free!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello  This problem is still persistant today so I hope you can add some insight. Several months ago, in June, I started to taste blood in my saliva. So naturally I went to the doctor and he thought it might have been nasal discharge and gave me some nose spray to remedy it. Well after a couple of weeks there was no chance and i was spitting up more blood and it was becoming more like blood and not spit. So after several visits I was ordered to see a lung specialist who did a bronchoscopy on me and said everything looked fine. Now since then I have started to get huge headaches and this severe pain in the base of my neck. I am also getting very tired for no reason and have a hard time swallowing all of a sudden. My next step is to see a neurologist and get a CT scan done. Any thoughts on this?\n\n",

Does the blood come up with coughing?  What kind of nasal spray did you use?  (This could have actually irritated or dried out the area that is bleeding.) Have they performed any blood tests on you to check for anemia?  This are just some basics.  Maybe with more information we can get some more information to your physicians to work with.

No i have not undergone any blood tests what so ever, the nasal spray itself was for rhintitus, i think.

Over the past few weeks I developed a naging cough where most of the time nothing comes up and then the next minute I could be filling a sink full of blood.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello I am a 24 year old male who does smoke but rarely drinks if ever.  Lately I have been getting chest pains that come and go almost in the middle of my chest, sometimes it moves around under the rib area mostly left sided, around the first rib underneath and moves as far as the side of my chest and lower, (abs) very seldom it does move to the right side but does happen, this has been happening for 3-4 weeks now and it happens random, it ranges from sharp, stabbing or dull pains lasting from a few seconds to 2-3 minutes, also sometimes i get a stiff neck with the pains from the chest or without, from my jaw down to my neck .. also on the left side of my body or behind my neck,  I can breath normal so no problems there. I don't really know if its getting worse or not but it happens almost everyday, something is not right because this has never happened before, im afraid it could be a heart attack or something else pretty bad.  I should note though I have a very very bad tooth that is rotton and have had it for a year or more now and have been on antibiotics twice for it, next week I am getting it pulled, I have thought maby this is causing the pain in the chest, maby from a blood infection or from the decay getting bad or something such as this ?\n\n",

    "title": "Chest discomfort-cannot sleep!!",
    "content": "Hello.   I am a 23 yr old female and I have been experiencing sharp chest pains above my left breast. The first night I had them I went to the ER (I am a military wife in Germany so I had to go to a German hospital) After doing an EKG and running bloodwork the Dr said that everything looked fine. He said it might be the muscles or bones. But he said just to be sure I should stay the night in the hospital so he can run my blood again in them morning. That bloodwork was also fine. So then he sent me on my way with no real explanation.Also, my blood pressure had been slightly high over the past few months but my regular Dr said it was probably due to being overweight. I started an exercise program and I have brought my once high cholesterol down to normal numbers. Now I am working on my weight. I just started a strenuous workout program called \"Boot Camp\" and during my workouts I feel no discomfort or pain. But when I am doing nothing such as watching TV I feel slight discomfort on the left side of my chest. Also, my blood pressure was 143/93 that day.   It has been about 3 weeks since then. After going to the ER I was fine. Every once in a while I would get a feeling of discomfort in on the left side of my chest, but no pain.  But about a week ago the discomfort was more frequent. It mostly came at night when I tried to go to bed. I tried to go to sleep but I couldn't due to the discomfort. It kept me up all night long. This didn't happen again until 2 days ago. All night I tried to sleep but the feeling would not go away. It is hard to explain. It just feels really uncomfortable. Tonight it was worse. I have been trying to sleep for the past 6 hours and I cannot. When I lie down it feels uncomfortable and then as I think I might be dozing off, I get a huge feeling of anxiety or something. Kinda like someone just walked in and scared me. I don't know what is going on. I plan on going to see my Dr on Monday but over here in Germany they don't really pay any mind to what is going on.   Can anyone help?\n\n",

The pain has persisited in my upper right chest above my breast sometimes immediately under the breast, pain will move to the upper back and right side of my neck. My doctor ruled out indegestion due to lack of stomach pain. I can not pin point a cause of the pain because it comes and goes at odd times of the day. Belching or anacids help on occasion but not this morning. the pain will not subside. I do not smoke tabacco but, have smoked canibis for several years, just recently quit. Canibis was used to help sleep at night, and reduce anxiety. Blood tests revealed slightly elevated cholestrol every thing  else normal. Any suggestions would be appreciated. I also excersise three to four times weekly.\n\n",

We are wondering what the best test is to loook at the entire aorta to rule out problems there. She is fearful of ct scans and radition so were thinking MRI. Should she have an MRI or MRA of chest?

    "content": "Hi, I am 20y/o male 5'10\" 197lbs.  For the past 10 months I have had some very confusing chest pains.  They are dull most of the time but at times can become sharp.  Sometimes I have both at the same time.  Most of the pain is in the upper left chest area and under my left armpit and down my left arm.  I also have had some shortness of breath at times.  My doctors have done a great deal of testing: Echo-Cardio Stress Test, EKG, enzymes, lung scan, Upper GI, CT Scan of chest and abdomine all fine.  I have had several EKG's and one(during a very sevear attack) showed \"very unusual wave patterns.\"  Thats what my doctor said and put me into the CCU overnight then released me the next day with no further testing.  I have had EKG's since then and they were fine.  I don't understand this and it is a major cause of anxiety about the whole problem for me.  This week I go for upper endoscopy but I am unsure whether it will show anything or not.  I'm very confused and my doctors seem to be as well.  I have had some anxiety which clonazapame .5mg-1mg(different doses at different times) seems to help with but it does not relieve the pain.  Lately i have had some very sevear palpitations(just feeling my heart beating very heavy) and some faintness.  I have also started having some headaches.  I can excercise though it seems to cause some burning pain which i believe to be caused simply because i need to get myself into better shape.  Yesterday I played a game for abourt an hour and a half where I was running much of the time and all that happened was alot of palpitation and burning. After my first round of testing my doctor seemd to think it was anxiety/depression and put me on Cymbalta 60mg for 4 months.  It did nothing.  Neither did therapy though i didn't go for more than a month or so.  Sometimes i have trouble sleeping but i believe the anxiety to be caused by the pain and not the other way around.  I'm really not sure and could use any advice.  I do know that I have some Acid-Reflux(have been taking tums for about 6 years and now i am on Prevacid 30mg).  The Prevacid seems to help a little but i still have pretty constant pain.  Is this my heart?  GERD? Anxiety? Something totally different.  My chest is very sore making me think it may be muscle or bone problems.  What kind of tests should be done for that?  Any help would be great.  Thank you.    -Matt\n\n",

    "content": "Hi pew2005, In my opinion, I would relate your symptoms to both anxiety and a strained muscle. The dizziness and ringing in your ears may be related to an inner ear disorder. You should have your parents call your physician for an evaluation. This should clarify the cause for the physical symptoms and they should be able to guide you in some relaxation techniques to reduce the episodes of anxiety/panic attacks. I would question and  be vey hesitant in accepting medication related treatment for a panic disorder prior to attempting the nonmedication related stress relieving techniques. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "content": "I can imagine you are worried about many things at thirteen.  First of all do your best to take a deep breath blow it out slowly and do it again a couple more times in times of anxiety. The more a person worries the more scared they become.  That happens to ALL  people when they feel anxious.  If you do indeed have frequent chest pain, it is always a good idea to have your doctor check things out.  It is simply a wise thing to do, and it will be one of the things that will help you be able to calm down and stop worrying.  Sometimes taking too much over- the- counter medicine such as aspirin or ibuprophen can cause ringing in the ears.  When you do exercise, make sure and do warm up exercises first to prevent the strains and pains that come from not doing so.  Finally, make a list of all of the things that you personally can do to help yourself relax and relieve your anxiety i.e. listening to music, walking and jogging,  watching your favorite show etc.  Those things that work BEST for you.  If you continue to feel too stressed,  seek professional help.  My brother did just that years ago and now lives a happy, healthy, professional(he's a graphic artist) panic attack free life.  Good luck to you!\n\n",

    "title": "Pleuracy? Sharp Chest Pain",
    "content": "I am a normally healthy and happy 38 yr old female from canada. I am living and working in sweden. I have had this sharp terrible pain when breathing deeply in for the last three weeks. When I first got it I thought I was having a heartattack as it woke me from my sleep. The pain was in my chest on my left side sort of at the bottom of my ribs, and it travelled down my left arm and up into my shoulder, neck and face. I went to emergency where they gave me blood thinners and pain medication and kept me overnight at hopsital. They gave me an ECG and a lung xray and CT scan which were all normal. After two nights I was released after one doctor said it was possibly a problem in my back. I of course left there simply not buying it.  I have shortness of breath and can't get a full breath in or even out. I shake involuntarily (convulse) if I attempt to breath all the way in, and sometimes the pain even cuts into the halfway mark of breathing in. Hunching over helps. Laying down or standing especially for too long is agonizing. I haven't had a cold or anything other than a small cough about a month or two ago.  Over the past three weeks I have spent three separate occasions overnight in hospital. I have seen 8-10 different doctors (some were students). They have tested my heart and lungs, CT scans for possible bloodclots in the lung, they have said that it could be broken ribs or a pulled nerve in my back, but weren't 100% of that either since my pain seems to be coming from  my lung. No xrays for broken bones have ever been taken, but two of the doctors I saw ruled this out anyway. The pain has been also through to my back (the back side of my lung) and has slightly moved down toward my kidneys. They ruled out any kidney problem because my bloodwork showed that was normal.  I have unfortunately been at the mercy of the hospital here in sweden because I do not have a regular family doctor here. My left arm had been slightly purple (off and on over the past few weeks) which they have told me is from lack of oxygen. The doctors found a slight infection in my bloodwork and I had a slight temperature while in hospital during the first week of this.   I have been seen by a neurologist also who thought perhaps this was spinal meningitis, and also wanted to check me for an aneurysm or stroke. One doctor (the head doctor? in emergency) who did not even meet me or examine me sent me without my knowledge (until arriving there) to the phyciatric ward of the hospital, after making the pathetic comment that this could all be in my head. Of course I have made a complaint about this and he has admitted to making a huge mistake by doing this. It comforts me to see that there are others on this forum with the same pain as me. This is not in our heads. I can validate that!  I have passed out once from the pain, and blacked out completely and had to be taken by ambulance to the hospital. I have also been forgetting things which frightens me. The doctors here blame it on lack of sleep. I have lost confidence in the hospital here and have been desperately searching for a north american doctor that may now be practicing in sweden. I am considering going to canada to get help but I work here and am also afraid to fly with this. During one of my visits to the hospital I was given an anti-inflammatory injection, but the nurse who gave me this hit a nerve causing paralisis in my right leg for about 5 hours. I have yet to return to the hospital since this, even after spitting up blood due to the lack of care performed there.  I have contacted my family doctor in canada by phone. She said that it sounds like pleuracy. She told me that an antibiotic could be prescribed... BUT swedish doctors do not give antibiotics if you can believe it, telling me that no antibiotic could be given for this anyhow. They have yet to even mention pleuracy to me here, even though I have mentioned it to them. They said they would have seen it in the lung scan, however my doctor in canada said that this isn't always the case. The doctors here have me on tons of pain medication which is not helping. In the hospital morphine barely took the edge of the pain I am experiencing. Another shot they gave me which was stronger than morphine (similiar to morphine) gave me some relief with breathing in, but this isn't a drug that they can give me to take home they tell me. I hope someone can help me, I am so exhausted with this. I have averaged 3 hours sleep nightly since this began.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I am sorry to hear about your continued suffering. I agree with your doctor in Canada, it sounds like a classic case of pleursiy. Pleurisy is quite tricky however, it could be a diagnosis in itself and heal with anti-inflammatory drugs and antibiotics when appropriate. However, it could also be a manifestation of a more serious disease. Pleurisy may develop in the presence of lung inflammation (pneumonia, tuberculosis), rheumatic diseases, chest trauma, certain cancers, and asbestos-related disease.  Its a good thing that the CT turned out normal that would exclude many of the above causes.  Infective causes are curable. I would like you to elaborate on two points: You mentioned \"The doctors found a slight infection in my bloodwork and I had a slight temperature while in hospital during the first week of this.\" What were the exact results. If that is the case did you discuss taking an antibiotic to treat this infection. It could very well be the causative agent.  Another thing, you said \"up blood due to the lack of care performed there.\" What do you mean by that? Were you coughing blood? Or is this related to a procedure performed at the hospital.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi again.. and thank you so much for writing back to me. I am sorry it has been so long since last looking in. I have been in the hospital since last posting. I am still quite ill. I am on morphine patches now (which have the side effect of shortness of breath.. unfortunate since my problem is with pain when I breath.. now I just can't breath at all). I will get back to you with the exact levels in my blood that we found. I met one pulminary specialist doctor here who has worked in canada for one year. He said lung sack inflammation.. which seems to be pleuracy.. but he said he can't say for sure because he can't see anything on my lung scan. Is it true that if I had this it would show? I have seen claims of both over the internet. I have heard that dry pleuracy is hard to see.  Another thing that is really concerning me is that I am forgetting things, fainting and have been throwing up (very rare for me.. I hardly ever throw up). You asked about the spitting up blood. No, it wasn't part of the hospitals treatment.... but rather I did not go back immediately to the hospital when that happened because I was so discouraged with the lack of proper care I felt I had received, I just as well thought not to go back at that time. I went to another hospital an hour away, that is where I have stayed for the past few weeks. I am down to 46 kilos (I am 164cms/5.4). I am still so sick and this has been since december 29th or earlier. It is so exhausting. What else can I ask the doctors here to do? I was so desperate that I went to a homeopathic doctor who gave me some herbs two days ago. I still haven't felt any different. Also, when I eat (I can only eat a little) I feel like my stomach or diaphram is pushing against my lungs or heart and taking my breath away even more. Please help me. I am so scared now. My work friends saw me and said they were shocked that they don't recognize me and that my skin looks grey. I myself don't see the same person in the mirror also. It is frightening me, and just getting worse. How long will this last if it is pleuracy?  Thanks for any help or advise you can provide.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I totally understand. I hope I can be of some help here for you.  After not receiving any help in Sweden I went back to canada to see my own family doctor (doctors in sweden are a joke!). As it turns out I have two things.   First off they found a minor heart condition, nothing major but does explain some of the symtoms. I am quite annoyed that they didn't see this in Sweden, but then again I didn't see a proper Cardiologist in Sweden, I only had emergency nurses and doctors. My family doctor in Canada sent me to a very good Cardiologist who did some different types of testing to look for problems such as these. She found this immediately. Actually the second thing that I have is the one that is more likely to be causing all the problems, so please don't worry about your heart being the culprit.   She told me It is likely congenital (from birth) and is of course non life threatening. It is a regurgatation in two of the three valves in my heart. I am a non smoker and quite healthy otherwise so they think it is something that can be monitored. They also saw that I had some thickening of two arteries aswell.   The second thing: My doctor also sent me to a Rheumatologist where I was told that I have Fibromyalgia and probably something called Costochondritis which is in the same family of illness. This can often come to the surface as a result of other things happening in the body. It can be quite painful and cause all sort of symptoms that mimic other illness, and especially because Costochondritis is in the chest. It is related to arthritis and can make your entire body ache, you can even think you are having a heart attack because of the pain and shortness of breath. It can be quite scary.   Apparantly people who have this are often misdiagnosed. It can last for a few months or longer. I had the first period of pain for close to 4.5 months. I recently got very bad chest pain this past week with the whole shortness of breath thing too, so I pulled out this prescription and took a few of the tablets over the course of two or three days. The doctor prescribed me something called Amitriptyline 10mg's. I took them for a short period in May, but stopped once my chest pain stopped. These seem to aid things.  I have recently had surgery for something unrelated and have had some trouble with that which could explain this sudden revisit from the chest pain (costochondritis). With this illness it is related to stress in the body for one reason or another. Apparantly the best thing for Fibromyalgia/Costochondritis, and those related illnesses is to keep moving. Don't knock yourself out with physical activity like a huge workout or anything, but DO take a walk. I know you want to stay in bed probably if you feel at all the way I did, but this can actually have the opposite effect. I think the best thing to do is to see more than one doctor, and of course be sent to some specialists.  I am no doctor but I do understand and completely sympathize with you. You can write me back at any time. I will respond asap and offer any help or information I can offer. I do hope you feel better soon. Please let me know how things are. I will be thinking about you.  Kindest, Rae\n\n",

    "content": "Hey,  I am new here so just seen the post about fibromyalgia and costochondritis.  I have both.  I have had fibro for Several yrs now.  I used to live in Ohio and in 1995 I went to see a Rhuemotologist for pains I was having.  He also gave me Amitriptyline 10mg's.  It helped me sleep I know that, and from what I can remember it might have helped with the pain too.   Well I sense moved to Ga.  I have no regular dr yet.  I have seen many specialists here trust me.  I gave birth to my daughter in 2004 and sense the epidoral wore off I felt an immiditate tightness/pressure in my chest/rib cage.  Then came the god awful pain.  It was unbearable.  I was freaked let me tell u.  I thought for sure I was dying and having a heart attack.  After all I had heart failure from a condition brought on by pregnancy called Cardiomyopathy.  That has sense improved.  After leaving the hospital after the birth of my child, I still had that terrible pressure./tightness and pain.  I went back to my cardiologist who performed a muga scan on me and an ultra sound.  I was healing up not worsing.  He told me looked like my cardiomyopathy was healing and going away and my heart was doing fine.  Still I complained of this.  I got scared and let me tell u after going through what I did I was thinking daily I was dying.  I later seen someone cause I was having even more and more pains.  Found out I had to have gall bladder surgery.  I thought AT last maybe that is the reason for this and if it is removed it will all go away!! Well, it didn't.  I have had CT scans, Xray's, blood tests you name it all come up normal. TO make a long story short... So far I have seen 6 different dr's.  Most of which are specialists of some sort.  They range from Rhuemotologist, 2 regular internal medicine doctor, a surgeon, my Cardiologist, an acupuncturist/internal med. Dr, and tomorrow I see an Orthopedic Dr.  I have yet to have my acupuncture, I begin that on Tuesday of this week, will let u all know if it helps.  Out of all these dr's not one can actaully help me get a grip on the pain.  The either look at me like oh you couldn't be in that much pain, or some feel so sorry for me they write me out a script and send me to someone else.... then the rhuemotologist wanted to just drug me up even more so and that cause great stomach upset.  I mentioned this to him he basically yelled at me and said he was the dr not me and he knew best and to just shut up and deal with it.  I left there last month.... Hence my venture out to see the acupuncturist and Ortho.  I run out of pain meds and I have no where to really turn.  I promise you I do not wish to take them.  But I have no choice.  I have a daughter that needs constant care and with this it's impossible to even function.  I hope the Orth dr and acupuncturist combined can help me.  Should I mention the Amitriptyline to the Ortho tomorrow and maybe try that again?  Someone please offer me some advice and hope.   Oh and I wanted to say I did find a natural herb that helps a little bit with pain it's called DL-pheynalalaline.  <SP?  or known as DLPA complex. You can get it at any herb store.  It's allows your brain to produce more of the brains natural morphine to help fight off pain.  I only been taking this for 3 days.  I will keep you posted on that as well. God Bless, Karen\n\n",

The Empire State Bldg. is not nearly so high, though perhaps pollution also can affect respiratory symptoms on some days.  It seems most likely that if dizziness or related symptoms are unusual for you the effect was mainly psychological.  Everyone has psychological reactions more or less to heights or edges of dropoffs or both.  You could post more if I am not dealing with the way you felt.  You could perhaps manage how you feel by approaching such situations cautiously but not avoiding them, or you may reinforce the idea you can't handle heights.  If you have periodic related symptoms, are there any reasons to suspect you may have anemia, heavy smoking, or some reason you may not carry oxygen well?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I'm a 27 yr old female who works as a production assistant for a local news company and is a full time student studying to be a radiology tech. I just recently had a bout with bronchitis and am still recovering....about 2 days ago I woke up coughing really hard and as a result I've had a sharp pain under my right arm and front of chest that also causes a dull pain in my back. At first I thought that I'd just tore a muscle from coughing so hard, but I've torn muscles before and I don't recall them feeling this way. I still have a cough so you can bet I'm in some pretty awful pain when I cough, sneeze, take a deep breathe or move a certain way, such as pushing or pulling, picking up things. The only thing that comes to mind is that it might be a fractured or cracked rib. I don't want to go to the doctor b/c I cannot afford it right now. What does it sound like to you? Do I need to seek medical attention? My problem is that if I go to the doctor and get x-rays, what could they do about it if it is a cracked rib? I've only heard of old people getting cracked ribs from coughing, does it happen to young healthy people too?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Crozzy,  It's possible you could have pulled a muscle in your chest wall. If you are not experiencing difficult breathing, or pain as you normally breathe, it's probably not a broken or cracked rib. Very deep breaths could aggravate an already strained muscle, but can also be symptomatic of something more serious.   If you are having trouble breathing, \"air hunger,\" can't get enough air, excessive wheezing despite clearing sputum with coughing, hurts to breathe normally, etc., you need to see a doctor for proper assessment and diagnosis.  Assuming you were treated for bronchitis, if symptoms do not clear up shortly (bronchitis symptoms can last a few weeks, but should be diminishing,  not worsening), you should see your doctor.   There are numerous other causes for symptoms like yours, some of which can be serious, and if your symptoms have been worsening, you need further evaluation. Your bronchitis could have progressed to pneumonia and the pain you are experiencing could be \"pleurisy\" which is an inflamation of the lining/sac around the lungs. This would need treatment.   Possible causes or aggravating factors for coughs can include everything from smoking to certain medications, to new exposure to animals, a lung infection from birds called psittacosis, TB, to asthma . . . and others. It is very important that the cause of any cough be determined.  Meanwhile, in general for upper respiratory infections, besides any medical treatment by your doctor, OTC cough medicines may help relieve your cough and allow the strain to heal. When you do cough, try to splint the affected side with a snug pillow or rolled up towel or small blanket, to minimize the strain and discomfort.   As always, plenty of water to help liquify secretions will assist in clearing any congestion faster. You should certainly avoid overtaxing yourself. . . don't pull, push, or lift anything that aggravates your symptoms.  If such pain persists despite your efforts to control it, please see do not hesitate to see your doctor.  Hope this helps and that you're feeling better soon.  Holly, RN\n\n",

    "content": "Hello! I'm a 21yr old, white female, works as a florist/artist. For about a year and a half I have had chest pain. I have never smoked/drank/ or done any drugs.   The pain is a dull ache/pressure on my chest (high/middle) that can be very subtle or really painful. It can last an hour or a couple of days. It makes me feel tired/achey all over sometimes. Sometimes it's so bad it will wake me up in the night. Alot of times I get it in the morning. And especially if I lie down on my front, then it pretty much always followers.  I don't' kow if it effects my breathing, but soemtimes when it happens I feel like I can't breathe, I don't know if this is just because breathing makes it hurt/because it feels like a pressure pushing down on my chest/or if I really can't breathe well during those times.  I have spent six months goign to a heart speciallist who gave me antiinflammatories thinking it was periocarditis. We eventually ruled out most heart problems. Now I'm going to a doctor here in victoria, He had me do a blood test which came back normal (negative on diabetes, anemia etc). We tried medication for acid reflux but that didn't help either.   I would really apprieciate any help, I'm very very tired of this pain and feeling tired alot of the time. My doctor just kind of shakes his head, and has hinted at anxiety attacks or that I'm just 'bored'. Since different positions and tiredness seems to be main causes, (although it often comes on just for no reason that I can tell) and I live a rather stress free life, I don't think it is anxiety attacks. However, I realize I could be wrong.  Thank you for your time! -Crayon Monster\n\n",

    "content": "Dull, aching chest pain can be very difficult to diagnosis as there are so many possible reasons or conditions that might cause this problem.  You have seen a cardiologist and heart problems were ruled out for the most part.  You have tried antiinflammatories which didn't give you any relief and you have tried medications for reflux disease without relief.  My suggestion would be to approach your physiciam about medications that reduce anxiety or depression.  I know that you stated that your life is stress free but I have seen other young females with the same complaint, who tried using antianxiety medications or low dose antidepressants with good results.   Discuss this possibility with your doctor and see if it might help.  Also keep after the problem, dull, aching chest is not normal.  You know sometimes we don't realize just how stressful our lives are and having this continual pain only is adding to your stress level.  Best of luck and hope this might help you.

    "content": "Hello all. I'm a 21 year old male EMT in the Pacific Northwest with a couple of questions for anyone willing to shed some light for me. For the past two weeks I have been having an increasingly more painful dull pain in the right side of my chest, a few inches above the nipple.   The best way I know how to thoroughly describe it is to go through the acronyms in my head on an incidient, so bear with me here.   Onset : I haven't done anything to cause the pain that I can recall.  Provocation : A deep breath can increase the pain, although it seems random.  Quality of pain : It's a dull pain, about the size of a golf ball, if not a little bigger.  Radiation : The pain doesn't radiate anywhere, although I have had a stiff neck for about the same amount of time now. I don't see how that could be relevant, though.  Signs/Symptoms : I don't have a mark where the pain resides,  and don't seem to have any other symptoms  Time : The pain came on gradually, so I have no idea how long this has been bothering me. My guess is two weeks.   The only real medical history that I have would be a laminectomy about 5 years ago for a staph infection on my spinal cord. Sounds creepy I know, but I recovered fully (thanks to the folks at Harborview Medical Center).  Anyhoo, thanks for any help or advice you can offer.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi NightOwl_, I would be more inclined to consider your chest and neck pain to be associated more so muscular in origin since the pain appears to increase with inspiration. Although on occasion, coronary disorders and  gallbladder dysfunction may also present with these symptoms. If you do not have any increased risk factors for coronary disease, for example, high blood pressure, high cholesterol/triglyceride levels or first degree relatives with heart disease, etc., then I would most likely not consider this the cause. Also generally with gallbladder dysfunction symptoms present themselves after for instance, a fatty meal. Diagnostic studies such as a xray, CT scan should be able to determine if the chest pain is actually a radiation from your neck and identify the cause. I would suggest an evaluation by your physician. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

On Sunday about 3:00 PM I visited a local Urgent Care facility and they went nuts and did all the test for heart attack but determined it was not a heart attack or angina but reflux. I had not had a reflux attack since 1983 so I was very surprised.  The doctors suggested I take a reflux medication and that was all. Went to my military doctor and he suggested the same thing.

    "content": "I have a question about chest pain.  I'm a 49 year old female who has been having a dull ache on the left side of my chest.  It has only been in the last 4 months.  The pain is not bad, but I also have a pain under my left shoulder blade.  Sometimes I can feel it on the right side.  My left arm aches sometimes, also.  I have had a stress test and an echocardiogram.  My cardiologist says my heart is fine, even though an EKG showed a past heart attack.  Two different doctors showed an EKG with a past heart attack.  My doctor assures me it is not my heart.  There is no damage to the heart.  I was told the EKG's were probably false/positives.  Any ideas on what might be causing the pain?\n\n",

    "content": "Gender: male  Age: 20  Weight: 245  Height: 5'11  Condition: sharp chest pains on left side  Smokes: no  Drinks: no  Drugs: marijuana  General symptoms: -Sharp stabbing pain in left side of chest but closer to the center of my chest -sometimes pain in arms and shoulder -occasional neck pain -nervousness/anxeity   This all started about 5 months ago, I was sitting with friends at my home and suddenly I felt a sharp pain in my chest, I had just had a big meal and I thought that was it but the pains continued,  I had everyone leave except my girlfriend,  the pains increased over that night, I went to the ER around 1am. They ran blood test and ekgs and everything came back normal. I wasn\u2019t having a heart attack, but  they kept me there for 2 days and the pain continued. They did a sonogram of my heart and chest x-rays, everything came back fine, they released me but never told me what was causing the sharp pains in my chest, the pain continues for the next 4 months, I went to my family doctor who is a specialist in heart disease o and has me do a stress test and ekgs, everything comes back normal, but I'm still having chest pains. He suggested it  might be GERD or an ulcer, but since I have no health insurance I have no way of finding that out. I started buying every over the counter acid reflux medicine I could find, (Tums, Zantacs prlsact OTC, I even bought a blood pressure monitor to record my BP but its never gone higher then 120/80) but it seemed nothing was helping, the pain was still there.  I began to develop  anxiety and convincing myself I'm going to die. One night I was woken up by my chest pounding and a cold sweat, I thought I was having a full fledge heart attack so I had my mom rush me to the ER again, they ran the same tests but still no signs of anything heart related, and the doctor told me I had a anxiety attack.  At that point I had told myself that all these pains where in my head, and I was fine, the pain was there but I just kept saying its all in my head, until a couple of days ago when the pain suddenly came back. It was late at night and my heart started to race, I took my blood pressure it was fine but my pulse was around 110, I got freaked out and went to bed, I couldn\u2019t really sleep and kept waking up checking my blood pressure, still it was fine\u2026 I got up and went to work (I'm a short order cook at a busy golf resort) , I remember reaching for something and getting the sharp pain again. It feels like someone is stabbing me in my chest, its quick, and the sharpness goes away, but the pain is back, for the next couple of days I continued to have the pain, until the past Friday.  I was working  I had a bunch of orders in front of me and I go to reach for my knife and I get the pain again, but this time it makes me keel over, I cant take it, it's so intense, I rush out of the restaurant and find a place outside I can sit down and breath, the pain is so intense I pause and don\u2019t take a breath till it goes away, the pain lessens and I can feel the sharpness go away, my boss (who is also my aunt) sees this happens to me and throws me in her car and go to the ER (again!) We are there for 3 hours waiting for the doctor to see us, I calm down and the pain practically goes away, he tells me that it doesn\u2019t seem to do with my heart or anything and doesn\u2019t give me any tests, just tells me to take ibuprofen 3 times a day for 3 days, but that was 3 days ago and the pain is still here\u2026 PLEASE somebody tell me what's wrong with me!!! Could this be angina or heart disease (which I would hope would come up on EKG and stress test), could it be acid reflux or Gerd? Could this all be related to stress?

Drug therapy for this is usually Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatatory drugs (i.e. mefenamic acid, ibuprofen, aspirin) on a full stomach or you can ask your physician to prescribe you a cox-ihibitor (i.e. celecoxib, etoricoxib) for 5 daysduration of therapy.\n\n",

    "content": "My wife (who's in her mid twenties) was admitted to the hospital last weekend with chest pains, dizziness, nausea, and short of breath. She was tested with ddimer, chest xray, echocardiogram, ecg, cardiac enzymes and other blood work. The only thing they ever found was runs of SVT on the montoring and also low potassium level. They hydrated her and gave her oral potassium and then sent her home.   She is now still having the chest pains and also developed leg pain after being on bed rest for a couple days (she walked a small amount). She is still feeling short of breath off and on. She went to the doctor to see about getting a VQ scan since they didn't do one in the hospital. She has read ddimer only rules out clots in those with low probability and doesn't feel given her symptoms that she is low probability. But the doctor refused. She said she would do a leg scan just to put her mind at ease but now lung scan. My wife has read that leg scans can be negative even in the presence of clots in the lungs. She went in for a second opinion today and they doctor treated her quite poorly and laughed off her concerns.   What can she do??? She is about to give up but still fears that decision could cost her her life. Any suggestions??? What is your opinion on this???\n\n",

Does she have pain for example in her calf when she walks or pulls her toes upward towards her chest? If she is experiencing any of these symptoms a VQ scan certainly is in order to rule out a DVT (deep vein thrombosis.).If she had a PE (pulmonary embolism) she would likely be experiencing severe shortness of breath etc., along with the chest pain and the D-Dimer results should have indicated if this were the problem.

    "content": "Thanks so much ahead of time for your time/assistance.  I've had this intermittent feeling of a lump in my throat (below Adam's Apple) when I swallow or breath.  Sometimes it feels like it's hard to breath with it, but I'm also freaking out about it. Seems to have started around the time I took up an exercise regime after a long period of being out of shape. I started about two months ago and have lost about 10 pounds.   I'm 26 and have smoked since I was 16, albeit it took some time to work myself up to my current level of self destruction (1 pack to 1.5 a day).  It comes and goes; for example, in the morning I don't even really notice it, but after I smoke a lot or drink diet coke (I drink ridiculous amounts of that a day too) it is a more pronounced feeling.  I don't notice it so much when I excercise.  I did the water and neck check and didn't see anything odd, although I've always had a fairly pronounced Adam's Apple, and any amount of worry about this now could convince me that it feels \"different.\"  Thanks again, and I hope I'm not being a hypochondriac.  I'm freaked out that it's some kind of larnyx or thyroid cancer or something.\n\n",

It definitely hurts more when I take a deep breath.  I am 22, in decent health, not overweight, and a light smoker. I probably drink more caffeine than I should (I work at a coffee shop). I was a heavy alcohol drinker in college, but now I drink moderately and infrequently. I had pain like this for a few nights in a row about a month ago, then it went away when I went on a trip to Europe, but now it has returned.  Any idea what could be going on?

    "title": "Left Chest Pain and dry cough?",
    "content": "Hi All, (sorry for the long post but I am trying to give as much information as possible).   I am a 38 year old mail having intermittent chest pain for almost 3 months now. Let me give you my recent history. This started 4 months ago with episodes of near syncope and heart palpitations (no pain) for no apparent reason. It would happen at any time of the day and follow no pattern. I had several trips to the ER because I thought I was having a heart attack. They couldn't find anything in the ER and said it was probably stress. The episodes lasted on average for about 30 seconds to 10-20 minutes. After about two weeks of these I started having very mild chest pain just to the left of my sternum. Since then the syncope episodes have all but vanished, but I am having singificantly more chest pain and it seems to be broadening laterally across my left chest. I have also developed this chronic non productive cough. It is hard for me to inhale or exhale completely withough coughing and feeling like something is tickling the back of my throat. I also get fatigued very easily now. I used to be much more active with sports and such but just don't have the energy. I have had numerous EKG's, and and Echocardiogram, the only thing they found was slight left atrial dilation. The valves all worked normally. My blood pressure is normal, cholesterol and blood sugar tests also came back normal. I was tested for H-Pylori and blood in my stool but both were negative. I had a CT and MRI of the head which were normal. X-rays of the chest were normal. I have been in and out of the doctors office at least a dozen times since this started. They have tried putting me on Prilosec which hasn't helped the chest pain at all.. The last visit in the doctors office about a week ago I asked him about the possibility of lung cancer or lymphoma. He seems to be stuck on thinking it's GI stuff. I asked isn't there some kind of blood tests or other tests they can do to screen for it? He said a lot of cancers don't have markers they can look for... I am wondering if he is giving me a brush off or is this true? I get the feeling they are not taking me seriously. I am a physical therapist and am somewhat trained to look for red flags in my patients. Right now I feel I have a few, but because I am fairly athletic and don't smoke or drink, I don't think the doctors I have seen think anything serious can be wrong with me. What do you guys feel about this? What other tests should be done? I know x-ray is not a gold standard for cancer screening..does this sound like GI stuff.  Oh another thing my cough and chest pain seem be better in the AM, or after laying supine for a while. I tried eating a lot of food befor bed a couple of times to see if there was reflux/gerd symtpoms overnight, but still my symptoms are better in the AM...I swear if one more doctor tells me it's anxiety I'm going to have anxiety just to spite them....I'm just kidding, but this has been going on way too long and I am a very relaxed person. I don't stress too easily.  I just feel  like if this is something very serious we should be treating it as soon as possible instead of waiting till my condition worsens and possibly become more serious...any info would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in Advance  PPT  P.S. Iposted thisin the Lung Cancer Forum, but I read that they don't answer questions unlessw someone if Dx with Cancer, so I thought this might be a better place fot it...\n\n",

When I started to run I had these bad chest pains in upper left of my chest, My heart never dropped below 80 all day then... but resting is at 50 now.  So I went to doctors shortly after and she listened to chest and never found anything. She refered me to get an X-ray done and blood tests.  I had the x ray done today and blood tests in the morning so I probably wont know the results untill sometime next week.  I hate waiting this time  because symptoms seem to be getting worse....  I look after myself probably better than anyone I know and most of the worlds population.  I 'don't smoke or drink. I eat extremely healthy, mostly Vegetables, fruits, fish and low GI foods. but for some reason... I seem to be prone to more illness than anyone else!   unlucky genes !     Since Im in the same situation and can't get a straight answer untill next week, possibly. I'll let you know how mine turned out.  I originally suspected that the cough may of been caused by an allergy or something.  the dry cough feels like its caused by some irratation in my throat.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Matthew,  I can tell you the results of my tests and treatments so far.  I have had several chest x-rays, all I have been told were normal.  I have has several EKG's most of them indicated left atrial enlargement but otherwise normal rythyms.  They did an ehocardiogram whih also showed silght left atrial dilation but all valves worked properly and no signs of stenosis.  I just had a treadmill stress test yesterday, don't have the official results but I was told my heart did very well.  I lasted 13 minutes and got my heart rate up to 182 bpm (which isn't something new for me, I regularly get it at least close to that high when I exercise).  I also had a pulmonary function test which I haven't gotten the official results from the doctor yet, but the tech told me that my inspiration was normal, and I had a little decreased expiration flow rate, which improved some with albuterol but still wasn't quite normal.  I have seen a GI doctor and he stated it very well could be some kind of acid reflux, I think he said something like 70+% of chronic coughs are caused by GI problems.  So I am scheduled for an edoscopy in September.  (I hate the waiting also).  I have a hard time thinking it's reflux just because I have this cough mostly on expiration, and a full stomach doesn't seem to affect it that much.  One interesting thing though, I had these chest pains before they thought it was GI stuf, but they tried putting me on  Prilosec.  I had been taking it for a little over 1 month regularly and the chest pain and coughing was getting worse, so last Tuesday I stopped taking the prilosec because I really hadn't been getting heartburn and my symptoms were worsening.  By last Thursday my chest pain had almost completely gone although the cough persists.  When I saw the GI doc this past monday he thought it was interesting but said to cotinue with the prilosec anyway.  So I have been taking it all this week and I get a faint glimpse of the pain every now and then but it lasts only a couple of seconds.  The cough still remains.  I know how you feel but unfortunately diagnosing the human body is not an exact science and some diagnosis' are made by excluding everything else that could cause your symptoms.  So let us hope for the best, and hopefully we will figure this thing out. -Paul\n\n",

    "content": "I might have an idea what are causing my symptoms.  I've been monitoring my BP and it is always around 100/60 and resting heart rate around 50.  So no probs there.  Today I was thinking of all the possible things it could be and thought about hygiene and where my cough is usually worse. Well it happens to be my bedroom where I do a lot of studying at the computer and sleeping, of course.  Im good at hygiene when it comes to preparing foods but really bad at keeping this place tidy and keeping good hygien.  So I took a look at my bedroom where i work at most and sleep and there is soooo much dust, even mold in some places where bits of food havnt been picked up.  So I've gone through everything today and cleaned any item in my room. It was a complete mess. I have a feeling that my symptoms are because of litrually months of letting mold and dust accumilate where I spend a bit of time each day.  I've also got my mother to agree to smoke outside the house now.   Maybe this is the problem for me, I don't know... But I believe its worth a go. Unfortunatly i don't know how long it will take to recover after months of living in this.  At the moment the doctor agreed to put me on antibiotics, he said It is possible that I could have a mild infection but not certain.. So I will take these untill i get X ray results and blood test results and go from there. Hopefullly by cleaning daily the accumilation of dust and other  things, my condition will improve.  I do have HayFeve, the immune system over reacts basically..  So Im considering that I have the same probs with dust and mold.   Hopefuly This is the problem and now can be resolved!    About my genes  Although there are 2 people that have or had heart dissease, they didnt lead the most healthiest lives. My grandfather died of a heart attack before I was born I believe and my mother had 4 heart attacks but due to complications and smoking.  I on the other hand should have a much lower risk...  I practise Calorie Restriction with optimal nutrition which puts me at an extremely low risk of disease ( read up on it if you wish ) and I have lead a very active life style so far with no probs untill now.   Obviously I do get worried about 2 people with heart disease in my family... but I feel they were self inflicted and other people in my close family have had lives upto 80-90 without major complications through life.\n\n",

I want to say the statistics on this show that HIT can occur in about 30% of patients receiving heparin, but that the rate of complications such as a pulmonary embolism are much, much lower. Don't quote me on these stats though... just something I'm pulling from a memory that could be incorrect.  Try doing a Google search on HIT.\n\n",

It is quite hard to describe how it feels it just kind of feels like the area around the bottom of my ribs is opening up  and normally when I am trying to sleep I position some of my cover around the area to make it feel more comfortable.  I felt quite reluctant to post this as the description is pretty bad and kind of makes it sound worse than it is but its quite a hard feeling to describe but its worth a try I guess. Its not like immensely bad or anything I just figured it would be good just to ask about it here to see if I could get a little bit of input about what could be causing it.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I am currently 48 years old. When I was 18 I was diagnosed with Spontaneous Numothorax and spent a week in the hospital resting until the problem healed on it's own. At that time my symtoms were; severe pain in the chest, shortness of breath, and constant burping of air. The doctors told me that the lung was not collapsed but a lot of air was formed around the heart, indicated by the x-rays, and every time I inhaled the air put pressure on the heart. My x-rays were up for x-ray of the month due to the rarity and multiple doctors visited my room to listen to my chest. Via a stethascope it sounded like someone squeezing a ball of paper. I believe what caused this problem was the fact that for some reason I tend to take huge deep breaths from getting ocassionally very hypor and that night continually did that for a few hours or more. Since then I have had reacurrence of the same symtoms about once every five to ten years. A few times I have visited a doctor about it but they seem to shrug it off as nothing seriuos. I am currently experiencing the same symptoms. A few days ago, for what ever reason, I started taking these huge deep breaths again (note: lots of time I take these deep breaths while I am eating because I feel I can't get my breath) I am currently having pain and pressure in the middle part of my chest and I am consistently burping air. This has been going on for about four days now. I just don't know what to do about it. For now I will do what I usually do, try not to take anymore deep breaths, rest, and hope it clears up within a few weeks or so. It is very frustrating. Do you have any thoughts or advice for me?  Thank you\n\n",

    "content": "I'm 18, never smoked (cigarettes or otherwise), and only a slight social drinker. Recently I've noticed a discomfort on the left side of the chest. At certain times when it's really bad it feels like there's a hamster in the left lung trying to squirm its way out, but usually when I do feel it, it's just a slight pressure on the left chest. There's no pain or any other symptoms in any of this, only the discomforts, which sometimes are as annoying as an itch that you just can't scratch, although I'm worried it might be something serious. Just sitting here right now I can feel a slight pressure, but nothing more. It would be great if somebody could give me some help here. Thanks.  Edit: I notice this more when I'm sitting down, especially if I am leaning forwards or bending over. I thought it could be somehow a baseball is lodged under my diaphram and every time I do lean forwards it gets pushed up towards my lung. But I don't have any breathing problems, besides it just sounds ridiculous. Of course usually when I'm sitting I'm bored, so I probably notice it more.\n\n",

    "content": "For the past two months i have has some mild breathing difficulties, consulted with Doctor and she ran some tests, chest x-ray which came back with possible mild asthma, PFT which came back normal and now a chest CT which came back with a couple of things.  One was a 5mm spot on lung, too early to tell, have to repeat test in 6 Mo.  The other showed that Pulmonary artery looked bigger that Aortic artery which could suggest possible pulmonary hypertension.  Next week I have to go get an echocardiagram and was also referred to pulmonary specialist.  My Dr said sometimes these CT's are not very accurate and that she was surprised by the possible findings.  I have smoked for 15 yrs. I also suffer from panic/anxiety attacks and I have a hypothyroid.  My breathing issue comes and goes.  Is it really possible that this could be pulmonary hypertension?  I am only 32.  Please shed some light.  She said she was not sure that this is where my breathing issue is stemming from.  Also had EKG which was normal.\n\n",

I was just switched over to the Lexapro last week, I was taking paxil CR 10mg and was switched to Paxil 10 Mg and then was boosted to 20 Mg.   You are right, since being told of this news my symptoms have become worse, I was actually doing better with the SOB and when my doctor told me about the possible PPH, I started to have the SOB almost immediately!  I just don't understand how they came up with this possible answer, I do know that PPH is a very rare Lung disease, I have done extenssive research on the net about PPH, what causes it what is it.... I guess what really gets puzzels me is that I will feel the need to take a deep breath every few minutes on bad days and if its really bad I will yawn frequently throughout the day to catch a breath.  I know that this cannot be normal.\n\n",

I don't think it has kicked in yet. As far as my thyroid is concerned, it was checked a month ago and it was right on target.    I did go to my appt yesterday with the Pulmonary specialist and it was not a good experience at all, the doctor who attended to me did not really settle with me too well.  First they had me tell all my symptoms and history to a Doctor who is still getting her residency and then she relayed all of this info to the Dr. along with her opinion of what could be ailing me.  Once that was done the Dr came in and spoke to me breifly and checked me.  She displayed a very concerned look on her face and in a matter of minutes had an attitude which seemed like she was making the confirmed diagnosis.  She totally freaked me out, I was already having attacks throughout the day, she mad it worse.  I guess she realized this and calmed down with her abrupt attitude  I questioned the CT Scan results & the only thing she had to say on the matter was that these tests are merely a suggestion and that there are time when it can be off.  I didn't feel that she was at all sympathetic. Today I go for my Echocardiagram, I'm not as nervous today but I am scared out of my mind.\n\n",

    "content": "I had a collapsed lung in December 04.  Occasionally i get pain in my left side, cramping pain, ocassionally feels like something is pulsing, but it's not always in the same place and quite random, sometimes it hurts, sometimes it doesn't.  Anyone it has come and gone since i had my collapsed lung and i have been to see my Doctor, she says i can expect pay for anything upto a year after my collapsed lung.  For the last few days it has been back but seems there more often, it sometimes hurts when i breathe in deeply and sometimes it doesn't.  To make it worse i woke up with a sore throat in the middle of Thursday night, today is now Saturday and i lost my voice completely at work, i can only really whisper, hoping my voice will be back within a day or so.  Do you think i was getting the pains in my side as a result of the sore throat being on it's way making me extra sensitive?  I am worrier at the best of times and this does worry me, i try not to panic over things, i just want to be ok and to get go on with my life.  I get scared when it comes to hospitals and i get worried when im there.  Anyway back to the point, what do you think the pains in my side are?  Sometimes they are also round the front of my chest.  Is my doctor correct?  Hopefully you can supply me with an answer and i would be very grateful.  Allan\n\n",

    "content": "Just want to add a few things:  I have had an annoying chesty cough for around 3-4 weeks before this, wasn't really bothering me too much as i wast coughing often, maybe 2-3 coughs an hour.  Sometimes the pain in my chest scares me as the tight pain sometimes feels around my heart, but my doctor was 100% adamant it had nothing to do with my heart, so im hoping by her saying that, she has listened to my heart and is also confident in my health.  Out of curiosity when i visited her i told her i sometimes feel short of breath and also i get quite anxious when reading forums like this or imagining all sorts of problems within my chest.  She let me take the Asthma test and on the meter i could only blow upto 500 when she said i should be blowing to 700, but she said it wasn't a big deal and she was fairly sure i wasnt asmathic.  I am around 5 foot 10 inches tall and i weigh 9.5 stone  I am probably making most stuff in my head and hopefully there is just a simple explanation, when i get anxious i feel ten times worse.  The anxiety making me short of breath is a horrible feeling, when i concentrate on my breathing action, thats when its worst.  When your not conscious off your breathing, thats when i don't notice a thing, which makes me think i probably don't have a breathing problem and it is the anxiety.  Anyway, sorry, i have left you a lot of things to take into consideration, if you would like anymore info, just ask.  Allan\n\n",

Also how young are your children are they particularly hyperactive , hve they changed any of their usual habits recently?  Also you don't mention a partner in your relationship, I don't mean to pry into your relationship but all of these factors can contribute to stress related headaches.  Do you have any other symptoms at all? These headaches could be migraine in nature and if so analgesia and anti-inflammatory medication can help also having, if possible some time out in a darkened room with little to no interruptions, agin I don't know if this is posible for you but these are things that you can try initially,  If this doesnt help then you would have to visit your doctor for some further tests to rule out any other medical problems.  The pains in your chest can be associated with this type of stress related headaches,  try the suggestions if you can  Good luck and best wishes\n\n",

    "content": "thank you for your post. These headaches came on suddenly 8 days ago... the headache seems to be there at all times, and just ranges in intensity... the dizziness and nausea starts after the headache becomes intense. I have a history of migranes, but they always started with the \"aura\". this headache I don't have an aura. I have been seeing a chiropractor, who has been trying to treat my headache, he has pointed out some very tight muscles at the base of my neck/head on the left side which he says is causing my headaches, but after his treatments I don't feel any better. I have been icing the area he says is tight, that can be painful after a few minutes. My children are 3.5 and 10. I have been carrying a lot of stress around, as my 3.5 yr old is very defiant and is getting ready to be kicked out of his daycare... but my headache started the morning prior to me finding out he was getting kicked out. I do have a husband, he does help out some when he is home in the evenings... I don't sleep much... I have a hard time getting to that \"tired\" point. usually I am up til 1-2 am, occasionally I get to sleep by midnight. I get up at 7:30 every morning and take my kids to camp and daycare, then work from 9-3. Today I had to leave work because the pain was so intense I was nauseas and dry heaving again. I did schedule an appt with my primary dr for tomorrow... so I guess i'll wait to see what he says. My person as a whole just doesn't feel \"right\". Thanks again\n\n",

    "content": "I have had the following chest pain for years now and my doctor cannot figure out what is causing it. The pain is sharp and happens a couple of times a day. It is over the rib cage and always the exact same spot on the chest wall. When it starts happening I can immediately massage the same area and it will aleviate the pain, however, it is obviously ebarassing to be in a social or business situation and have to do that - people think I am having a heart attack ! My doctor has sent me for all cardiac tests and they ahev shown that there is nothing wrong with my heart. The area where the sharp pain occurs is on the left side of my chest, about half way between the nipple and the middle of the rib cage, but about 1 inch up from that straight line.  About the time this started happening (now about 5 or 6 years ago), I had a rather large pimple on my chest that - unbeknownst to me - got larger under the service until eventually I recognized the problem and lanced and drained it - it got rather large under the surface - perhaps as much as 3/4 of an inch across before it was taken care of. This problem was taken care of 4 years ago but I still have the same chest pain \"events\". It almost seems like there is a nerve just under the surface of the skin that flares up for some reason and the massaging of that specific area seems to take care of the problem temporarily. Any suggestions or opinions on what this problem could be would be greatly appreciated - I think short of exploratory surgery my MD is out of ideas on what to try next to determine what the problem might be.....THANK YOU !\n\n",

I am thinking along the same lines as you are... that it is related to some sort of nerve issue. It definitely doesn't sound cardiac in nature.  Try asking about a specialist consultation. I don't know what direction he'd send you in, to be honest. Neurology to rule out a nerve problem? Dermatology due to the large pimple that was there? I don't know, but I'm sure your MD has the answer to that.   But definitely continue to seek an answer to your problem.   Good luck to you, and I hope you find some resolution to your pain.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Sir/Madame:  Yesterday, I was standing in the kitchen and suddenly a sharp pain exploded under my right lower rib cage.  It was like someone was repeatedly kicking me from the inside out.  When I placed my hand in the area, I could feel the movement of kicks.  It came on in spirts.  At one time, it was so intense that I was screaming.  Then after about ten minutes of the kicking going away and coming back, it stopped.  Later on today, it came back for a few kicks but was nothing like the day before.  Any ideas as to what this is would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I'm just hoping that someone can give me some advice or general information.   My boyfriend is 19 and has been experiencing sharp chest pain for a some time now. He went to see a doctor about 6 months ago but they couldn't find anything wrong with him. I have been urging him to go to another doctor which I believe he will eventually but he has little faith in doctors as he has seen enough in his childhood, having had to wear a back brace as he had Schuermann's Kyphosis.  He still has pain in his back from the kyphosis and I was wondering if maybe the chest pain could be related to it, the pain is not always in the same place and he sometimes has shortness of breath with or without the pain.  What confuses me is that his brother & sister also complain of the pain and shortness of breath although they have not had Kyphosis, so maybe it could be some kind of hereditary thing?  Does anyone have any advice, I just want to be able to tell him something so that maybe he will stop trying to ignore it.\n\n",

Its painful in some positions when I lay or sit.  I really want to know what this is and when it will go away sometimes its so bad that I cry.  Not recently, thank god.  I\u2019ve tried upping fiber, getting rest, not doing strenuous activities, its kind of hard being a college student with a backpack.  I\u2019m wondering if its my liver or appendix its to far front to be my kidney and to far to the side to seem to be my gallbladder.  I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s a strained muscle I just don\u2019t know when its going to heal, it came so suddenly like a gas pain in my side but its not, and it just developed in one day from feeling fine, we drove for 8 hrs that day for a camping trip.\n\n",

So im sitting here in 2 minds about phoning the doctor. But the likely hood of it happening again  but to the other lung seems pretty remote to me.

He looked at my tonsils and said that they were pretty back and I had to get them taken out. The medication didn't do anything and I wanted to get a second opinion on the tonsils issue in which I went to a second doctor and he told me that as long as they don't hurt and there is no yellow or white stuff on them i dn't have to get them removed. I get alot of mucus in my throat and it feels like somthing is stuck in there. When i got to sleep at night i do have trouble breathing. I've also tried mucus medicine to thickin the mucus but nothing seems to help. I don't have a high fever at all but somtimes my coughs are really bad. I don't know who to go to or what the cause is for this issue. Should I get a chest xray or go to a tonsil doctor?\n\n",

I think there's more blood that flem!!  It's usually worse in the mornings as with any cold, but it's seriously worse in the mornings, the deepness of this cough is quite restricting. I also manage to blow a bucket load of thick green mucus  from my nose every morning although apart from mornings there doesn't seem to be any congestion.  Anyways, that's about as much as I can say... I think the bloody flem was the bit that got me worried. Any help would be greatlt appreciated.  Thanks\n\n",

If you feel like there is something in your throat or lung go get checked right away. It can cause an infection or shut part of your lung down.\n\n",

    "content": "I am desperately searching for a reason of having this strange feeling in my upper chest.. I had a terrible stomach virus in mid December. I had extreme vomiting and diarrehea. In the weeks following, after it had seemed to go away, I started regurgitating in the middle of the night and inhaling some of the liquid which woke me up gasping as if I swallowed wrong. The liquid was very acidic and burning. I do take nexium for gerd. I went to see my doctor about this because I was getting terrible pains in my sternum. he did double the nexium for a 30 day period, he said until things settled. He checked my heart and gave me an EKG that was fine. He also checked my lungs that he said sounded very clear. I then started having a heavieness also in muy upper chest. I saw a cardiologist and had a stress test with the IV. He said everything was perfect. I was on the treadmill for much longer than normal. My heart rhythm was perfect and I had no blockages. I still have the extreme heavy feeling in my chest and it feels as if there is a ball of air and I need to belch. However, belching does not take away the feeling. I have gained 10 pounds in this time also and I am very uncomfortable even though that is not a tremendous amount of excess weight. What is the problem here? Nobody can find one yet I have this disgusting feeling in my chest and sometimes a fluttering feeling also. Do you have any suggestions?\n\n",

If you suffer at nighttime from heartburn due to acid reflux disease, elevating the head of your bed at least six inches with blocks or placing a foam wedge under your torso will keep you in an upright position as you sleep, and this may help to keep stomach juices from rising up into your esophagus.    Try not to eat dinner or snack within 3 hours of bedtime.    I hope this helps I know that it has worked for many people.\n\n",

Anyways I was just wondering if you might be able to tell me what I am coughing up, and if I need to go to the doctor, because I have no insurance so I do not want to go for no reason. P.S. I smoke very occassionally.  Thank you for all your help and I hope to hear from you soon!!   Kelley\n\n",

    "content": "I am 39 yo female and went to ER yesterday with chest discomfort , shortness of breath and my blood pressure was elevated 210/105.. I have had high blood pressure readings in the past but chalked it up to nervousness and have never been on meds for it... but every once in awhile it does seem to spike up high like it did yesterday.. I felt weak and dizzy along with the symptoms mentioned above.  The ER did blood work, EKG and xray and all came out fine .. the only thing they said was I had pleurosy on my lungs and I was told this usually occurs after having pnemonia or some type of sickness and I have not been sick in a very long time.  They kept me there til my blood pressure came down.. they also gave me a breathing treatment and nitroglycerin(sp?).  This didn't rerally help with thr shortness of breat but did take away the chest discomfort.  I am just confused as to what pleurosy is and could that have caused the symptoms I had and why did I have it if I have never been sice and what do I do about it? Alsol should i be on blood pressure meds?  Thanks in advanced for your help and answers.\n\n",

    "content": "Pleurisy is an inflammation of the pleura which is the membrane that lines the lungs. Pain due to pleurisy is characteristically related to breathing. Patients complain of inability to take a deep breath without feeling pain. While pleurisy can be related to other diseases such as pneumonia, it can arise alone. In this case the cause may be a viral infection, bacteria, or even TB.  If you are not complaining of other chest manifestations (cough) or fever then ibuprofen will probably do the job. Otherwise you may need a chest x-ray, CT or antibiotics depending on your clinical evaluation.  I would advise you to keep a close eye on your blood pressure though.\n\n",

    "content": "Is it normal to have pain in the lungs after being out in the cold? This has started happening to me in the past month. I know cold can trigger asthma but I'm not wheezing or anything--it just hurts like a dull ache on both sides of my chest to breathe in afterward but seems to feel better after 10 or 15 minutes of taking very deep breaths.  I was thinking maybe it is related to blood vessels constricting in response to cold (since I have been told I have other problems related to vasospasm--ie, raynaud's, migraines, livedo reticularis). But occasionally the pain has happened  just walking around at the store though the air there isn't very cold. Any thoughts? I do have mild aortic insufficiency too but wouldn't think this pain is angina-related as it's in both sides of my chest. Aany thoughts? Or is likely just gas or something? Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Jenniec, If your cough is green or yellow this signals the presence of a bacterial infection. If you have  a fever you should be on antibiotics. If you are constantly breathing from your mouth instead of your nose (because of the flu) then it would be normal to have white substance on your tongue as a result of dehydration of the mucous membranes of the mouth. This leads to desquamation or shedding off of epithelial cells. If however, your mouth is sore and the white substance is sticky and thick it could be moniliasis. This is more common in diabetics. I understand that you do not have this condition.\n\n",

First they said it was a sinus infection, so they gave me amoxocillan (not spelled right probably) and it didn't help at all.  I went back and they did another blood test and chest x-ray.  They didn't see anything in my chest.  They then said I had something like microplasma, or something like that.  I started taking a z-pack for that and I got a strong cough medicine with codine, or something like that, in it.  The doctor said that it would be cleared up by now.  Its not, and I think its getting a worse a little bit.  I don't think it is allergies because Im not coughing up a bunch of mucous when I cough.  I have piercing headaches sometimes.  I am going crazy with this cough!!  My cough isn't just a regular smooth cough either, its a rough, body jerking, cough.  When my friends at school heard me coughing, they said it sounded like I was going to die.  I just want to know what it is so I can get rid of it.  PLEASE HELP ME!!!!  I am out of school now because of my cough and I don't like missing school.  Please help me find out what this is!   I will be happy with any information that anyone could give me!!!\n\n",

Have you ever been diagnosed with asthma? I would suggest that if you have had a persistent cough for two months which has not been cleared with antibiotics, further investigations need done,such as a CT Scan which may identify problems not evident on chest xray and a pumonary function study at the very least. I hope this helps. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

A persistent cough especially since you don't smoke and taking into consideration that you have not been exposed to any communicable diseases (for example tuberculosis) is certainly abnormal. It also seems that your current inhaler regimen is not providing relief and if it is asthma there are other treatment options. I hope your better soon. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

A physician has to take many things into consideration while trying to diagnose the cause of dyspnea. This includes the associated symptoms and diseases, the character of dyspnea, risk factors such as age and family history.  Please check our dyspnea page for a list of causes broken down into various categories.   You will see that the causes are broken down into 5 major categories. The doctor carefully excludes these causes until he reaches at the very end of the list psychogenic causes. This is diagnosed by exclusion.  Best regards,\n\n",

My G.P. said he could hear nothing but sent me for a chest x-ray which came back clear.  He insisted that he could still hear nothing and I returned for re-examination to the company Dr.  On visiting the company Dr. again, he was adamant that there were clear sounds of basal congestion particularly in the left lung.  I was refused employment until my G.P. had given me a clean bill of health which he did.  As I was asymptomatic at that time I accepted this.  However since that time I find I get breathless more rapidly than before, when exercising.  Also upon awakening in the morning I can actually hear a faint crackle as I inhale.  This ceases when I become ambulant.  My G.P. still insists that he can hear nothing.  2 weeks ago I happened to hear that there was a locum working at the surgery and asked to see him.  He too said that there was clear evidence of basal consolidation but was reluctant to overrule my Dr. who still insists there is nothing untoward.  What do you advise I should do???  What redress do I have on the British national health???\n\n",
