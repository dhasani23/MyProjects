    "title": "Renal dilation in fetus with two pregnancys, is it common?",
    "content": "I am currently 33weeks pregnant with my 3rd child and my first boy, after a routine scan two weeks ago they found his right kidney had renal dilation.  With my previous pregnancy 4yrs ago, at 15weeks pregnant they found renal dilation also.  She continued to have it in following ultrasounds, but when she was born they decided to wait and see and did no further testing, she is fine.  With my current pregnancy they did not see it at the 19week scan.  I have done some reading, so know what can cause it etc, but due to having two babies with it, is it more likely to be my hormones that are causing it, rather than an actual problem.  And is it common to have more than one pregnancy with this problem.  Im trying not to worry about it this time like i did with my daughter, and was hoping you may be able to answer my question.  Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Hanaezma,  This finding is actually fairly common.  After the baby is born the physician can choose to do a follow up ultrasound or simply wait and see (often the choice).  Most of these babies do fine.  Babies with severe dilation seen before birth need close follow up to be sure that everything is OK but mild dilation most often ends up being normal with no issues later.  Our ultrasounds are incredibly valuable tools but sometimes we find things that just end up causing worry.  It's one of the unfortunate side effects of our technology.  Try not to let it worry you too much.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Dull Right Flank Pain & Frequent Urination",
    "content": "This pain all started exactly one month ago. The first experience with this pain was what I would call intense pain. I went to bed one night feeling absolutely fine, then woke up 2-3 hours later with intense pain in my right flank area (also had the urgency to urinate although little came out when I went to the toilet, nausea, vomitting). I took pain killers and waited around 1-2 hours before calling the Emergency 24 number. They booked me an appointment to go in around an hour after I called, and they tested my blood sugar, urine, blood pressure, pregnancy test, and examined my abdominal area. The only thing they found was some blood in my urine and they said it was most likely renal colic and sent me home with pain killers. The pain killers took the edge off the pain, and all in (from when I first woke up with the pain) it must have lasted about 6 hours until I was nearly pain free. A couple of hours later I had the pain again but much more dull, and I went to the doctors who took blood and urine (both showed fine so no infection was present at the time). He booked me a scan which I had last week, and I just received the results - no kidney stones, which is what they were testing me for.  What I am wondering is, is it possible for a ct scan to miss kidney stones? Also while they checked the scan images for kidney stones would they also have checked for things such as appendicitis and looked at my liver and gall bladder? As I am not sure of whether I should ask to have those areas tested in case they have already looked at those?  Anyway my main concern is that I am still having pain and frequent urination. It is always worse in the evenings - unsure why? I am having trouble sleeping because of it (I can't sleep on my sides and this is how I usually would sleep). I am also having ache in my left flank area now too, but it is not as bad as my right side. Here are my current symptoms:   * Dull cramp ache that does not go away - is very mild at some points of the day and very uncomfortable at other times of the day. * Feeling very tired. * Frequent urination throughout the day but especially in the evening. * My sides have a swollen sensation and is tender to touch or put any sort of pressure on. * I get very sharp stabbing pains a few times a day which then makes the pain much worse for a few hours afterwards. * I think I am still having blood in my urine. Can't see it in the toilet but when I wipe, the urine on the tissue is sometimes a light pinky browny colour.  Thanks in advance.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Although the CT scan may not show stones, they may still exist or might have been passed during the colic. Helical CT is considered the best modality for identification of urinary stones. But even helical CT is known to miss very small stones < 2-3 mm size.  The other possible scenario to be considered in such cases is a \"clot colic\", wherein, the colic is caused by a clot.  You need to have the basic labs, and a urine culture to exclude any underlying urinary tract infection. A plain film of the KUB region sometimes, may come handy in situations like this.If no stones are found, and if your symptoms should continue, you would need a full urological work-up.  Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, With the advent of the newer imaging techniques, an increasing number of renal asymptomatic renal 'masses' are being detected. Based on the size of these lesions, the fraction of solid renal masses that are likely to be benign are as follows. < 1 cm - 46.3% 1 to < 2 cm - 22.4% 2 to < 3 cm - 22% 3 to < 4 cm - 19.9% 4 to < 5 cm - 9.9% 5 to < 6 cm - 13.0%. (Frank I et al. (2003)  Solid renal tumors: an analysis of pathological features related to tumor size. J Urol 170: 2217\u20132220).  Larger kidney masses (greater than 7cm or about 3.5 inches) are more commonly malignant tumors. Indeed, > 90% of these growths are likely to be malignant in nature.  Difficulty arises at times in differentiating \"high attenuation\" renal cysts (hyperdense or hemorrhagic) and renal cell carcinomas. High attenuation indicates that the a renal lesion that has an attenuation greater than that of simple fluid (ie, 20 to +20 Hounsfield units) on a single phase of enhancement CT(with only portal venous phase images). This dilemma may be sorted out by using additional imaging studies such as ultrasonography (US), multiphase CT,  or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Internal heterogeneity of the lesion also favors a diagnosis of a renal cell carcinoma. Bleeding into a renal cyst is sometimes very difficult to exclude, as fresh blood clot has an attenuation of 60\u201380 HU. Your urologist, in all probability, would discuss with the radiologist before planning further management. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "First of all, please forgive me if this is not in the right category, and feel free to direct me to the correct one if you think that something else is better suited. I have been dealing with severe swelling/edema that popped up out of the blue in May of 2008.  I swelled up 30lbs in a few hours, and 20 more lbs in the next day or two. I went to one ER and was told it was in my head, given an ativan and sent home.  I went to another one (two days and 5o total lbs later) and got oxygen and blood drawn but then was told that since I \"wasn't gonna die today\" that I had to leave. MY PCP had not done much.  In his office, I have not been in a gown. EVER.  He met me AFTER I swelled up, so maybe he thinks I'm just fat. I don't know.  I think it is pretty obvious that I am full of fluid. I am losing my ability to function.  I am, scared.  I can't put on my own socks and shoes.  I can't wear a bra because I can't reach around back to fasten it. I went to a nephrologist and she has had me off and on diuretics since September.   2 weeks ago, she said to me in front of my mother, that if I was on diuretics that I WILL end up on dyalisis and die.  The next week, in front of my boyfriend, she said that she wanted me back on them, but when he called her on her previous statement she said \"well, yeah...\" and refused to give me the prescription. She says she wants me to get a 2nd opinion from another nephrologist at a major hospital, but I can't get an appointment.  I called HER office back about this and they said they would figure it out and get back to me and they have not.  I have been to the ER more times than I can count because the swelling and pain keeps getting worse and worse and I just don't know what to do. I have been documenting what I can on a blog at http://acuriouspatient.blogspot.com if that helps you.  (this blog does NOT contain ANY names, including mine, nor any doctors or which hospitals I have been at, it is simply information I have been documenting in case there is anyone out there who can help me.  I am scared out of my mind and I do not know what to do. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Also, lately my boyfriend brought up that I have been snoring, which is not normal for me, and I have been feeling like I am not breathing well when I am drifting off, and I wake up having to cough up fluid/mucous.\n\n",

The authors have found a significance of reduction of Albumen levels due to abnormal level of degradation of plasma albumin leading to edema in women who do not have other cardiovascular or kidney disease. This reduction leads to lowered blood volume signalling the secretion of aldosterone which in turn conserves sodium leading to odema.  Hope this information is useful to  you. Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Kidney donor - \"Atypical\" cells in urine - waiting for FISH",
    "content": "Hi, False-positive results are higher in urinary cytologic specimens than in most other cytodiagnostic specimens.Transitional cells can normally show marked variation in size and shape, can be multinucleated and polyploid, and can frequently exhibit nuclear and cytoplasmic changes that can mimic malignancy.Paradoxically, cancerous cells can be composed of nearly normal-appearing monomorphic cells with bland nuclei.   False-positive diagnoses are commonly due to reactive changes as a result of viruses, stones, radiation, chemotherapy, degenerative changes, benign prostatic hyperplasia, pseudopapillary clusters, and prostatitis. The upper urinary tract (ureters and renal pelvis) specimens are the most difficult types of urinary specimens to interpret.  Polyoma virus nephritis is increasingly being recognized as a cause of allograft dysfunction and graft loss in renal transplant patients.Tubulo-interstial nephritis sets in following renal transplant due to reactivation of latent virus in renal epithelium. The epithelial cells with polyoma viral inclusions in urine cytology specimens are termed \"Decoy cells\", which may lead to a false positive diagnosis of urothelial cancer.  You should wait for the fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) test results to come in, rather than speculate. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "I am 31 years old and have a rather inexplicable case of osteoporosis -- I do have bone pain with it, especially over the bumps on my upper back, and sometime my skull hurts.  My bloodwork generally comes back normal (hence the inexplicability) but this last time I had a phosphorus level taken (which I don't recall having before) and it came back as elevated at 4.7 mg/dl -- which is really only slightly elevated.  My dr. tells me this isn't even significant: but it's the only clue thus far to why my bones are deteroriating, so I would like a second opinion just to make sure: is such a slight elevation significant?  I don't eat a diet all that high in phosphorus (no junk foods, very little pre-packaged) & everything else is perfectly normal: in fact, great: I have low cholesterol, low all the bad stuff, am mostly in the middle on all the good stuff, though I'm at the baseline on sodium in spite of eating an incredibly high amount of salt :-).  I have 'half and half' nails, and I don't know if that has any relevance whatsoever -- a dr. remarked on it one time.  Is this something I should try to follow up on, or simply let drop? I did have white blood cells in my urine (but I pass mucous in my urine all the time, and often have lower back pain that is not bone pain but is more on my sides). I don't know if that's significant either. Thanks so much.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: is slightly raised phosphorus level significant?",
    "content": "Hi, Reddish-brown distal nail bands with whitish, ground-glass  appearance of the proximal parts is called as brown arcs or \u2018half and half nails\u2019. Half-and-half nails are characteristically seen in chronic renal failure.  It affects fingernails more often than toenails. No correlation exists between the severity of azotemia and the depth of the distal colour band. The band usually tends to remain unchanged even after dialysis but has been reported to disappear after successful renal transplantation. The pathogenesis of half-and-half nail is unclear. Estimates of prevalence among patients with chronic renal failure are reported as 15%-50%. However, it must be noted that \"idiopathic\" half-and-half nails have also been reported in the literature.  You have not given much information on your \"osteoporosis\", the radiological findings, and serum calcium levels and other labs.Your serum phosphorus levels will be considered normal according to some laboratory reference ranges.But an isolated serum phosphorus level can not be used for diagnosis.  However, for the sake of discussion, i would like to mention a few possibilities for hyperphosphatemia.  Hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia with low/normal parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels can be observed in hypoparathyroidism (HP). This disorder may follow an autosomal dominant (AD) or autosomal recessive (AR) mode of inheritance. It can be idiopathic as well.   Similar biochemical changes may also be seen in pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP) type Ia and Ib, but the affected individuals usually have elevated PTH levels indicative of PTH resistance. Features of Albright\u2019s hereditary osteodystrophy (AHO) are typically not seen in patients affected by familial forms of PHP-Ib.  Hypomagnesemia also may be associated with hypocalcemia and may also cause hyperphosphatemia. Some examples are as follows.  - Late-onset glycogenosis type II with renal magnesium wasting, hypomagnesemic hypocalcemia, hypocalciuria and osteopenia.   - Gitelman syndrome (GS), also known as 'familial hypokalemia-hypomagnesemia', is an autosomal recessive salt-losing renal tubulopathy that manifestsis with hypomagnesemia, hypocalciuria and secondary aldosteronism, which is responsible for hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. Prevalence of heterozygotes for this condition is approximately 1% in Caucasian populations.  Although it is not possible to offer any likely diagnoses based on the information given, i feel that you should have your serum  magnesium levels checked. Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 59 yr old male in good health. In March 2009 I had a kidney stone and an ultra sound was done. No cyst at that time. Now, 16 months later I went to the doctor because of the persisting pain in the area of my right kidney. The ultra sound showed a 6.5cm mass on the bottom of my left kidney. I have a CT Scan and MRI scheduled for this week.  My question is why is the pain on my right side when the mass is on my left? The pain is pretty constant ranging from 4 to 8. I also have bone spurs growing in my lower spine. I thought that the pain was from the spurs.  What are the chances of this cyst being cancer? If it's not cancer what could it be?  Thank you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Cyst on left kidney - pain on right side - why?",
    "content": "Hi, You have not mentioned a few important details... - on which side was the stone which was discovered earlier? - what happened to that stone? Was it seen during the latest ultrasonographic examination?  Also what is not clear from your history is whether what was discovered was a cyst or a mass.  When a cyst is discovered on imaging, the crucial question that arises is whether it is a simple, benign cyst or is it a cancer? Bosniak's Classification of Cystic Renal Masses into four classes, lends help in this regard.  Cysts of any Bosniak class,  if symptomatic, will need a CT and should be seen by a urologist.  If asymptomatic, - Bosniak class 1 cysts(simple cysts): will need only to be observed and CT if symptoms occur. - Bosniak class 2 cysts(probably benign): preferably renal CT every 6-12 months. - Bosniak class 3 cysts(indeterminate): renal CT/MRI/possible surgery. - Bosniak class 4(presumed malignant cyst) : as for class 3.  There are many causes of solid masses and malignancy is of overriding concern.  Your right sided pain in the right loin may be  - related to your spinal problem(radiculopathy) or - may be related to the kidney stone identified in the past(if it had been present in the right kidney).This stone could have moved down and perhaps started to cause a problem now. - or some other cause.  You need to keep in touch with your urologist as you are symptomatic.Renal stone as a cause of this pain needs to be excluded.Helical CT is of value in this regard. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Floaters in urine, Lower back pain, Kidney Problems?",
    "content": "Hi, Urine normally, should be clear. A freshly voided sample of urine may under certain conditions, may contain \"suspended debris\" (crystals, pus cells, red blood cells, casts etc). Given time, most of these tend to settle down to the bottom of the container. Centrifuging (as done in the laboratory) accelerates this process.  You say that your urine contains \"floating debris\". This is rather unusual. Voiding into a toilet (from a height) for example, may cause a frothing effect and this may trap some of the voided debris and float (surface tension). Certain chemicals (if present in the toilet) may also be capable of causing this due to a detergent effect.  You also complain of loin pains.Therefore you presumably need a urinalysis and a urine culture among other tests. But, first and foremost, you must have yourself examined by your regular family doctor, who will be able to examine you and then guide you depending on the physical findings. Best wishes!\n\n",

The next morning she called to tell me there was blood in urine and that she wanted to send me for CAT scan. I was still in horrible pain, running fever, and had begun vomitting. Dr. told me to go to ER which I did they did another urinalysis, blood work, and cat scan. They hooked me up to IV with Phenegran, Morphine, and Toradol. They came back and said no stones and sent me home, with a prescription of Cipro and Percocets for pain.I went back to my dr. the next day to follow up and she said there was gram positive bacteria in my urine - she said I had Staph in my kidney. OK? She referred me to a Nephrologist which I see next week. I am just wondering what this could be, should I be concerned, I still have some slight pain in my left back/flank side. Just hopping this antibotic is not just a temporary fix. What could this possibly be?\n\n",

Fluid around the kidney may be broadly classsified as - renal-related perinephric fluid collections and  - non-renal perinephric fluid collections.   Let me list some of the reported causes of renal perinephric fluid collections.... - Spontaneous perinephric urinary extravasation (perinephric urinoma) in an adult secondary to an over distended neurogenic bladder is known.   - Urinary extravasation in a status post partum patient although not that common, has been reported. - Urinary extravasation due to urinary stones causing hydronephrosis is known. - Urinary extravasation due rapid intravenous infusions in management of ureteric colics is well known.  Some of the causes of non-renal perinephric fluid collections are.... - acute pancreatitis - bleeding diathesis - Trauma etc  As you can see that without further information, it is quite difficult to offer a better opinion.

    "title": "Re: I was born with one kidney",
    "content": "Hi, Proteinuria is well recognized as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular and renal disease and as a predictor of end organ damage.   Because the excretion of creatinine and protein is reasonably constant throughout the day when the glomerular filtration rate is stable , some have proposed the use of a ratio measurement of protein to creatinine in urine samples collected over shorter time periods, or even random (or \u201cspot\u201d) urine samples to correlate well with estimation of 24 hour urine samples(which are perhaps most reliable, but more bothersome to peform).  Proteinuria may be defined as a Protein:creatinine ratio >45 mg/mmol (which is equivalent to Albumin:creatinine ratio of >30 mg/mmol).  Some workers have proposed a cut-off value of P:C ratio < 0.22 to rule out significant proteinuria.  In your case, as you may be a newly discovered diabetic, and have a single kidney, you need to be extra careful regarding control of your diabetes, should control risk factors such as smoking,hyperlipidemias etc, and for subsequent pregnancies, should have periodic testing of P:C ratio to make sure that your risks are minimized.

    "content": "Hi, The fact that you had pain associated with UTI's and gross hematuria, certainly would prompt a suspicion of urinary stone disease.  As far as endometriosis being a suspect, the odds are rather small. The incidence of urinary tract involvement in  endometriosis  is estimated to be about 1%. of which vesical (urinary bladder)  involvement is the most common. Usually  women in the 3rd or 4th decade of age are affected ,with a peak incidence between 30-35 years.  Cyclical haematuria(if present), would have pointed towards endometriosis.  It is better to wait for the contrast CT report, which hopefully will sort out the problem. Best wishes!\n\n",

I have never had issues with my kidney's before until this past year.  The urologist said that i must have had significant kidney infections as a child.  In talking with my mother she said not to her knowledge had i ever had any issues as a child or young adult.  The lower right quadrant pain as well as lower posterior back pain is still continuing.  During the release of urine i experience most intense pain in lower right.  The back pain is intermittent.  I have just completed three months of antibiotics (cipro, macrobid and zythromicin).  So far i have not had anymore UTI's.  But i have not any clue why i have had this problem.\n\n",

    "title": "Pain in right side could it be kidney or appendix??",
    "content": "Over the past year I have had reoccuring pain on the right side and back region. It is a sharp stabbing pain that comes fast out of nowhere, but can last up to several hours. It is almost a constant stabbing pain that takes my breath away. If you take your hand and place your palm flat on your mid-side and move it a hand to the left and a hand to the right that is the region it is affecting. Used to this would occur once every 3 months. It has progressed to once a month. And recently it has happened twice in one week 3 days apart. It used to help if I would drink water, cranberry juice, and pop azos. But these last two times nothing helped. On Wednesday it lasted from 11pm-4:30am. I had drinked water, took an azo, drinked cranberry juice and took 3 different hot baths with empsom salt. The baths made the pain go away but only when I was submerged in the burning hot water but once I got out of the bath the pain would come back. 3 days later on Saturday the pain came again but this time it lasted from 12pm to 2pm. The pain finally subsided but since I have had a numbness pain in my side region like something is inflammed or swollen but it doesnt look like it to the eye. And since the last attack I occasionally get sharp short pains on my belly button and to the right and left side of my belly button. I had thought maybe it was my kidneys, but now not even drinking water is making this go away. I think its either kidney stones, gallstones, or appendisitis. I pee frequently, have no burning or pain when peeing, no fever, no nausea, no blood in my urine. Please help me!!!! Thank you. It seems like it is becoming more frequent and lasting longer each time except for the last episode I had saturday night. This is the first time I have had this lingering numbness. Please help me! Thank you.\n\n",

A urinary cause also should be kept in mind (stone disease, UTI's).  So,work-up may include urinary cultures, stool microscopy, stool cultures,and certain serological tests. Best wishes!\n\n",

I just had the test done to find my defect and will know in a few months. there is only 1 state that can do the test and that is why I must wait a few months as they have to take my results out of state to do it. As far as I know (I know all I know from my kidney doctor who found this in me) the only thing that can be done is monitor and treat the problems as they come. I am on 2 Potassium pills RX form every day with HIGH potassium foods on top of it. You need to know BOTH parents MUST at lest be carers for this other wise the child will not show the problem. My doctors are saying they THINK they may soon know how to slow or maybe even stop the defect that makes this all happen. I do want to say they feel it is a few years away but it gives me hope. I am always learning more on this so if you have any more questions you can ask me at my e-mail leias_sister@yahoo.com I read it every day. I think the best thing to remember is ALWAYS ASK QUESTIONS!!!!. A kidney doctor (Nephrology Doctor) will always know the most on this. I hope this helps.\n\n",

After I was diagnosed many symptoms seemed to come to light that I hadn't given a thought to.  I was constantly tired no matter how much rest I got.  My nights were disturbed with constant trips to the loo which I believe didn't help with my tiredness.  I was very clumsy, always walking into things or dropping things.  I also became very irritated at the slightest thing and would fly off the handle.  My weight also shot up and I still find it hard to shift despite good diet and regular exercise.  Despite all these things I manage to live with it and just get on with day to day life.  As my gran would say, \"Theres always someone worse off.\"  The best thing family and friends can do is to be supportive and patient with the sufferer, this can be hard when someone is shouting at you for nothing.  Also its important to ensure that sufferers are taking their meds! I took me almost 2 years to get into the habit and also to admit that I did need to take the meds.\n\n",

    "content": "I recently had an ultrasound during which a renal cyst was found in the same place as was found a year ago. Both times, the cyst was found incidentally. Not remembering hearing that they'd found one last year, I recalled one was found previously--looking back over my records which are outlined below, it seems to me that considering I've had renal cysts since at least 2001, should I see a nephrologist (should I HAVE seen a nephrologist previously?). This did not seem to be cause for alarm, but it seems odd I've had a cyst on the same kidney for 8 years:  12/2001--\"a lesion on the left kidney which could be infectious or inflammatory; also 1-cm hypechoic mass on left kidney.  11/2002--1 cm hypoechoic mass mid pole of the left kidney. From examination report: \"Evaluation of the kidneys demonstrates that both kidneys excrete contrast without evidence of hydronephrosis. With the medial and anterior aspect of the left mid-kidney, is a focus diminished attentuation measuring approximately 9 mm. This is not clearly a cyst, aloth this could be due to the lesion's small size. ...cannot exclude a focal infectious or inflammatory process involving the left kidney such as a focal nephronia. The appearance is not typical for a discrete abscess collection.\" 10/2006--silmple left renal cysts, no renal mass seen (from a pelvic us).  From radiology report: 1 cm fluid density lesion in the interpolar region of the left kidney. Unfortunately, no precontract imaging was performed due to a techincal error, however the Hounsfield units are low on this study suggesting a simple cyst; probable additional tiny bilaterial renal cysts; bilateral partially duplicated collecting systems...\"\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Cassielo I accidentally found your question. It may be somewhat late to answer a consultation after 40 days, but .. ok, lets go the question ... I could understand from your post that: 1. you had a single lesion (mass) in the left kidney 2. it was 1st discovered on 2001 3. it didn't change is size till now (i.e. it is not a growing tissue) 4. on ultrasound (US) is looks cystic (i.e. purely fluidy) 5. on contrast CT it still showed low density (i.e. it didn't take or retain the dye). This means it is not a living tissue that gets blood supply. -- These findings should make you comfortable. These are the typical classical criteria of simple renal cysts. Simple renal cysts usually don't produce symptoms. So, you don't need to see a nephrologist (if you didn't already through these 40 days .. !!!), unless you have other kidney symptoms (e.g. blood in urine, pain in the loin,, etc.). Other nephrologists can discuss kidney symptoms better than me. -- Simple renal cysts are not tumours. They are not well understood. One possible mechanism is that they are a closed nephron (single functional unit of kidney). Urine can't get out into the ureter, so it collects. Over years they may enlarge to reach large size (10cm or more), and then they may press on the nearby structures causing some problems (easy to resolve .. just give it a prick and aspirate the fluid). That may explain why they are commoner in old people. A fairly confident diagnosis is usuallyby US only. -- Hoping this is helpful to you. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you still have other inquiries\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  Are we certain this is a kidney stone? At one inch it's unlikely to pass on its own if it is a kidney stone. Home remedies, which are questionable in the best of situations, would likely do nothing to move this thing. It should be evaluated for possible lithotrypsy (disintegration by powerful, concentrated sonic waves, a non-invasive and quick procedure). This also will often work to eliminate rather large, lodged gallstones as well, in case that's actually what's showing up.   X-ray isn't the gold  standard for determining the nature of this object, but I would expect that if it is a true kidney stone there would be significant additional symptoms such as excruciating pain, nausea, blood in the urine, etc. If this is a true kidney stone it is an emergency. If it's a gallstone its an urgent matter. If it's neither, it needs to be identified for whatever it really is, and managed accordingly.  Hope this is helpful. Good luck to your brother.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Can lisinopril cause kidney damage?",
    "content": "Hello --  Lisinopril is often associated with increased creatinine levels. There is also a relativity factor, in that a level of, say, 2.0  might be a normal baseline number of a strapping male athlete, whereas a level of 1.2 could indicate serious kidney dysfunction in a frail, elderly woman. So assuming you're in decent shape overall and are taking lisinopril, the 1.4 level is probably not markedly out of line, and if your doctor felt it was suggestive of kidney damage he'd want to explore this further. If you don't feel comfortable with such an assumption you're certainly within your rights to ask for clarification, but this is likely a relatively normal level for your age, gender, etc., and the fact you're on lisinopril.   Hope this is helpful. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "4 yr old w/hydronephrosis and poss upj obstruction",
    "content": "My son was diagnosed with 15 mm hydronephrosis in his left kidney before he was born. After he was born he underwent a mag3 renal scan which show mild reflux and sluggish drainiage. With those results they were happy just to monitor him with yearly ultrasound scan. My son also suffers from gastro reflux (gerd) which in the last six months has got a much harder to control and he has been suffering from severe daily stomach aches and intermittent vomiting.  We had our annual review with the with his Dr yesterday who reviewed his latest scans and they are now referring him to nephrology because they say his hydronephrosis has got slightly worse and is now showing signs of possible upj obstruction and possible duplex kidney and mentioned he will quite possibly need an operation to fix this and also thinks his stomach pains could be related to the kidney and not his gerd.  Is it possible he could be getting such pains from his hydronephrosis - which i'm lead to belive is 15mm but grade 5 so not sure how it is such high grade or how that can lead to such stomach pains. Also is it possible that this is a new obstruction or has it been missed in previous scans as they also mentioned he could have a duplex kidney which surely would of shown up on the mag 3 scan?  I'm a bit overwhelmed with all this new stuff as we were quite happily going along with the conservative management thinking that was all it would ever be and suddenly its all been turned on its head!  Any info, thoughts etc very welcome and thanks for reading.\n\n",

    "content": "I am at my wits end as to what I am supposed to eat! Because of other medical problems (fibromyalgia, high blood calcium, high triglycerides, etc.), in relation to my renal failure, I can't find a suitable diet. Give me a break...LOW CARB, LOW CAL, LOW CALCIUM, LOW CHOLESTEROL, LOW SUGAR, LOW PROTEIN, LOW ACID, LOW PHOSPHORUS, LOW POTASSIUM, LOW SODIUM, LOW CAFFIENE...AAAGGGHHH!!!!! What am I supposed to live off of...lettuce? If I should eat something...say protein for my fibro, I'm not supposed to have too much of it because of my kidney & triglycerides. I've just about had to give up all dairy (I miss my cheese!). My \"health care providers\" just give me pamphlets and general info about things I already know, and none of the info relates to all of my conditions together. In the past 2 years, I have practically abandoned all of my good eating habits because of the confusion. This has lead to greater problems. I can find medical diets online all day long, but I have to look at each condition seperately. I need something that will help me with it all. On top of everything else, I have a growing 11 year old boy to feed. In this economy, I can barely feed us. I certainly can't make two different meals every time I cook. And what about eating out ( I really, really hate cooking)? How do I manage that? I don't think my insurance covers a dietition, either. CAN ANYONE HELP ME! I'm gaining weight and my health problems are getting worse.\n\n",

    "title": "think tekturna damaged my kidneys",
    "content": "I was given tekturna about 4 months ago for mild hypertension.  Within a couple days I was having an excessive volume of urine.  My husband said it sounded like a hose left running.  Friends said that blood pressure pills do that, so I waited until my follow-up appt. about 6 weeks later to tell the doctor.  By then, I had also developed mild right-side flank pain, especially when I take a deep breath.  He had me stop the tekturna and gave me benicar, which I never took.  BTW, tekturna did not decrease my bp.  My symptoms continued for the next 2 and a half or three months even though I stopped the medication, so I went to a urologist. In office urinalysis was normal, cystoscopy was normal, couldn't have the urinalysis with microscopy until tomorrow because of possible blood from cystoscopy.  Blood work came back with low albumin, ast, and alt was at the lowest end of normal.  All other blood work was good. Kidney ultrasound showed \"small 4x5 mm early forming, non-obstructing calcification vs hyperdense hemorhagic cyst or solid lesion.\"  I never had one urinary symptom in my life until I took those pills.  I am totally freaked out.  Urologist wants to do a CT scan with dye, but I hate having all of that radiation.  I'm totally freaking out and don't know what to do.  I did lose 40 pounds over the past 10 months by walking 3 miles each day and eating healthfully, but I still got adequate protein and nutrition, so I don't see it as a factor.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: think tekturna damaged my kidneys",
    "content": "Hello --   First, was this regular Tekturna or Tekturna HCT? The latter, which includes a diuretic, might well have accounted for the remarkable amount of urination. However, there's nothing in the literature regarding adverse effects on healthy kidneys, although neither form of the drug is recommended for use with anyone who already has kidney disease. You could possibly have had occult kidney disease (mild) which this may then have aggravated. It sounds, from your labs, as though you are slightly out of range in some areas, while  ok in others, so this will need to be followed. You'll also probably be  wise to follow Tekturna to learn if there eventually is uncovered any reason to suspect it of having caused any problem or damage (and if there is a problem it may not represent permanent or serious damage). You'll need to be followed by a urologist regardless, but since this drug is known to aggravate underlying kidney disease, even though you've had no prior history it is possible you had some latent disease. This would have set it off. Also, if it was Tekturna HCT it would have been even more of a problem, but that would also account, as I said earlier, for the remarkable outpouring of urine. If that continues now, something else is wrong and needs to be addressed.  I'll continue to scan the journals for any news of this drug coming under suspicion for this sort of problem, but as of now I know of none. I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you and please do follow up here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for your response.  I took regular tekturna, not the hct.  My doctor has now ordered a 24 hour urine collection.  He said that although we have to get to the bottom of this, he is not as concerned as he would be if my creatinine and gfr tests weren't good, but they were normal.  He also said that although we need to follow-up, it would be worse if my Albumin and AST had been high instead of low.  My urinalysis last week showed bacteria, but the 48 culture was normal, and I have no symptoms of a uti, so I guess it was just from the cystoscopy, even though I took an antibiotic while at the surgery center.  I didn't think my diet could be a factor, but I did realize that I have been loading up on vegetables, fruits, and yogurt, with occasional whole grains and nuts, but  no meat.  Maybe the lack of protein and the increase in exercise had an effect on my blood work.  I don't know, but I will update when I learn something more.  Thanks again.\n\n",

In order for malpractice to actually take place you have to prove that the person (Doctor) had a duty to act, failure to exercise due care and that the injury or damages caused were done because that person didn't do their job to the best of their ability and level of training. Usually the burden of proof is on the patient to prove damage WAS done not on the Doctor to prove damage wasn't done, does that make sense?  If you feel that this Doctor didn't do the right tests or was grossly negligent, make sure you get all the records and test results you can (you may not be able to get any if you aren't legal guardian) - hospital, emergency room, fire department, ambulance, labs, doctors offices, whoever was involved with the care of this person.\n\n",

    "title": "High Renin Level, Hypertension",
    "content": "Hello,   Ive been having some unexplained problems for the last 7-8 months. I am a 28 year old male who has been in excellent health until now (tonsils and appendix removed). I've seen multiple doctors who cannot figure out what is wrong with me. maybe someone here can help? Here is a list of what has been wrong with me in chronological order.  June-July Moderate pain in my back towards the bottom of the rib cage on both sides of my spine. This pain felt like pressure from bloating or swelling, almost as if someone blew up a small balloon inside me. It hurt mostly when laying down in any position, especially just after waking up in the morning. Sitting relieved the pain somewhat. Also, some sharp pains in my abdomen, sensation of increased heart rate or raised blood pressure. Urine becomes more yellow (normally clear to very light yellow for me), and begins to smell more pungent. Went to primary doc, all standard blood and urine tests turned out ok, blood pressure was mildly elevated.  August Feeling of fatigue, easily worn down, especially when having not eaten for a while. Some occasional pain in my back similar to the pain described before. Joints hurt, especially my knees. Urine remains very yellow and continues to smell, notice that it seems to be denser than usual and flows directly to the bottom of the water instead of dispersing through out it.   September-October In early September I had an episode where I got incredibly off balance with the sensation I would pass out, my skin flushed and turned hot, my head started throbbing and my neck became sore. I had a ringing in my left ear. Went to the E.R. and they did a cat scan of my head and some blood work, it all turned out ok. Blood pressure was elevated. From that point on, I have had a sensation of lack of balance, and my skin turns flush, especially in my extremities. Hands shook in most any position, especially when outstretched. Muscles are generally weak and shaky. Joints still hurt, knees and hands mostly. Also notice some swelling of my knees and ankles, warm to the touch and red skin. Starting to gain weight.  November-December Symptoms remain the same, still shaky and weak, flushing still occurring, balance still impaired, ringing in ear comes and goes. I Started to see some specialists. Neurologist ran an MRI, everything came back normal. Gastroenterologist did some blood work and did a cat scan of my abdomen as well as an endoscopy, everything came back ok except raised BP.   Endocrinologist ran some new blood tests and urine tests, Only thing we found was a raised rennin level of 3.3. Blood pressure remained elevated. She prescribed Metoprolol and had me do a MRA of the kidneys. That test did not show evidence of Renal artery stenosis. Weight gain continues (20+ lbs since august). Doctor prescribed metoprolol er 25mg 2x/day. All problems still persist.  Recent Recently my condition is worse. balance is off all day, every day. Sitting, standing, or lying down I feel like my body and head are moving in a back and forth motion, almost like I were on a boat. My muscles are very weak now. I can barely hold my arm up for more than a few seconds. All muscles shake when strained to do any normal function, especially movements requiring a soft touch or slow movement. Knees continue to hurt, especially when bent. Swelling in legs and flushing of my skin still apparent. Urine is still more yellow than usual with odor remaining (not vitamin B or dehydration).  Can anyone provide some help? Im pretty miserable here!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: High Renin Level, Hypertension",
    "content": "Hello --  First, one wonders why specifically renin was measured, unless it was done along with aldosterone and possibly cortisol, looking for Cushing's disease. However, if the only \"out of order\" number was the renin -- and that was actually within normal limits -- then Cushing's would seem unlikely to explain what's going on, although I do wonder about pituitary problems and maybe even incipient Cushing's syndrome. However, there are a number of other possible causes of your symptoms,  and these should all be ruled out. For instance, much of what you describe could be caused by MS. Have you had an MRI of the brain?   Also,  it sounds as though your balance problem is inner ear/eye based rather than due to muscle weakness (which doesn't eliminate MS, but may eliminate idiopathic peripheral neuropathy -- IPN --although this should also be ruled out, via EMG and nerve conduction studies).   Clearly it is impossible to diagnose and sometimes to even guess long distance, but we can throw out hopefully some helpful  ideas and suggestions. This is one of those cases, and I'm thinking neurological causes, possibly endocrinological, but I don't think the urine color is telling us anything other than that you probably need to drink more water. That being said, you probably also should have a 24 hour urine test to see if potassium is being lost via that route (even though it would appear to be normal in serum -- which doesn't necessarily mean it's going where it needs to be).   I hope this is at  least somewhat helpful. Good luck to you and please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Within the past few days, I've developed a dull pain in my lower right back side. I was in the emergency room several days ago for abdominal pain, and all blood tests (CBC, LFT, amalyse, lipase) came back normal, but they found occult blood in my urine.   For months, my urine has looked concentrated--and often doesn't mix uniformly with the water in the toilet. The color is normal, and becomes clearer when I drink more liquids, but the urine seems to be heavier than the water, and sometimes sinks to the bottom of the bowl.  I had a CT scan today without contrast. It found no kidney stones. Any other ideas about what could cause these symptoms?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It would be helpful if you can inform us about the exact results of the tests done, CBC, KFT (urea, creatinine), uric acid, and your serum protein and the lipid profile.  For the urine analysis, it is very important to know the PH, specific gravity, the amount of proteins, blood, and any other solutes in the urine tested. If the urine anylsyis showed pus in urine or any bacteria and its count would be very informative.  If you have symptoms like loin pain and fever, UTI should be excluded. If you have dysuria, frequency and or urgency, this indicated urinary tract infection. Blood in the urine and pain is seen in cases of infection in the kidney (pyelonephritis), and bladder (cystitis) or a moving stone in the ureters or the urethra. The presence of a blood clot can give clinical picture similar to that produced by stones. CBC and blood smear may suggest the presence of blood hemolysis and anemia.  Concentrated urine is seen in dehydrated persons, kidney or endocrine diseases. Evaluation of urine specific gravity and the complete urine analysis provide an idea about possible causes.  I assume that your doctor wanted to first exclude stones since it is a common cause of pain and hematuria, then he will go for further investigations based on your medical history and the results of your clinical examination and lab tests.   I would advise you to follow up with your doctor and to complete your investigations. Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I am a 24 yr female. About 2 years ago my doctor told me that I had protein in my urine. I had a 24hr urine test that he said was not a large amount of protein but all my urine tests always show 2+ or 3+ protein. Then 1 1/2 years ago I noticed my urine was dark brown/red. I had an IVP, cytoscopy and CT. The IVP was normal, cytoscopy showed blood coming from R ureter and CT showed 2mm x 3mm stone that they did not think was the source of my bleeding. The blood in urine went away and I did not have further tests. Well all of it has started again a few months ago. I will have dark brown/red urine for few days and then it goes away and so on. One episode (a couple months ago) I had a CT that was normal and the last episode (2 weeks ago) of brown urine I called my doctor and he had me drop off a urine sample. He said it had blood, protein and Bilirubin in it. I had yet another IVP that was normal and he wants me to get another CT when the blood comes back. By the way the doctor I am refering to is a urologist that I was referred to 1 1/2 years ago when this all started. I feel they keep doing the same tests and they are all normal. What should I do? Is there another test I should have? All my blood tests as of a few months ago were normal. My only medical hx. is I had ITP for which my spleen was removed in 2002 and my platelets have been normal since that time. Thank you for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "There can be many causes of blood, protein, or both in the urine.  They range from completely harmless to very severe.  One of the most common reasons to have blood and protein in the urine is a condition called post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis.  This is a condition where the kidneys are damaged by the antibody complexes that form in response to a strep infection of the skin or throat.    There are several nephrotic syndromes (conditions where protein is lost in the urine, but not blood).  Occasionally a renal biopsy is needed to best determine the cause of the nephrotic syndrome.  When both blood and protein are present it often indicates an inflammatory state that is causing the kidneys to have problems.  Possibilities include IgA nephropathy, post-strep glomerulonephritis, Alport's syndrome, and many other glomerulonephritic condtions.  When blood and protein are persistently in the urine it is important to be evaluated by a kidney specialist (a nephrologist).  They will want to do a 24 hour urine test to formally tell how much protein is in the urine.  In your case, Emmalis, if there was not a significant amount of protein and your kidney function is normal you may have assymptomatic hematuria/proteinuria syndrome and your doctors will want to follow your kidney function and urinalysis periodically.  However, other causes need to be excluded first so seeing a nephrologist is probably in order.  A urologist can be helpful if it is determined the issue is not in the kidneys; however, with protein in the urine the kidneys most certainly are involved.  Also, if you had a kidney stone, you will want to have a 24 hour urine calcium or a spot calcium/creatinine ratio performed.  High urine calcium (even without stones) can hematuria and proteinuria.  Hope this helps a little.  The kidney is quite complex and there are many possible causes of our conditions.  A nephrologist evaluation will be helpful for both of you.\n\n",

I do have a heart history which confuses things, as does all my meds. Currently I take flecanide, digoxin, cardizem, coumadin, aldactone and lasix. The doctor ran tests that showed my plasma renin level to be in the 70s, which he said is extremely high.  At that time I was running very low blood pressure as well.  He has tested me multiple times with the same findings.  I am taken off many of my meds. for about a 1-2week period before testing. He told me he thought I had something called Bartter's disease, but from my understanding that is usually diagnosed as a child.   Here is my new situation and latest test results.  I wonder if anyone can help me understand what might be happening.    Over the last 3-4 months my blood pressure is high rather than the low I had for years, sometimes reaching a systolic over 200 (rarely).  Here are the results of my latest labs. my cardiologist ran.

    "content": "Hi Bartter\u2019s Syndrome is treated by keeping the potassium level in the blood above 3.5 mEq/L. This is done through a diet rich in potassium, some patients require salt and magnesium supplements.  SOME OF YOUR medications like lasix and aldactone , in addition to digoxin may affect your potassium levels. usually in this syndrome pateints will have low levels of potassium usually less than 2.5 because their aldosterone and renin hormone leves are high.   i really would recommend that you talk to your doctors about your potassium levels , they are low , normal values  are 3.5-5. this is very important to prevent arrhythmias.  in addition, your blood pressure of 200 systolic is very high, you should very importantly keep your blood pressure as low as possible to prevent further kidney damage. your blood pressure may have gone up after the discontinuation of some of your medications (which i don't know yet what are they).  lastly, if these results of blood glucose are based on fasting blood glucose , and it is 140, i recommend that you repeat this test again to rule out any possibility of diabetes.  thank you\n\n",

Problem with Relacore is the increase in pain in both my kidneys, not something you constantly feel unless your in the process of passing a stone or have one stuck in your ureter. Not the case here. I can tell it's inflicted by the diet pill. It's only in my kidneys, no pain in my ureters or bladder.   I don't want to quit taking it because if I continue to smoke, I continue to live with chronic fatigue.

    "content": "Hello -  You've certainly endured more kidney stones than several people would in several lifetimes. Is there by any chance a history in your family of this same problem? There are a few hereditary causes of this, and having so many is really quite unusual. Oh, also do you take large doses of vitamin C by any chance?   The little information  that is available about Relacore shows nothing that would likely cause kidney stones, but in someone with such a high frequency of them,  some of the many components could conceivably help promote  their development. Magnolia bark seems to be the most significant ingredient of Relacore and little is known about its effect on the human body except that it is reputed, among herbalists, to have a mild sedative effect.  I hope you will continue to folow up with a good urologist to be sure your kidneys aren't damaged by all the calculi that keep forming. Also, be certain to stay well hydrated, and good luck to you with the  smoking cessation. That's also very important, as I'm sure you realize.  Please follow up with  us especially if anything new comes to light.\n\n",

No I don't use vit C but I drink orange juice & eat oranges off and on but not excessively. Should I stop doing that?  Last month I had a retrograde pyelogram & it didn't show the stones, after my CT in april, I passed one stone, about 1 week after the retrograde, I passed one more. The CT showed I had bilateral scattered stones, all under 4mm. But the urologist told me I didn't have stones anymore. I have not passed all of them yet.  Do you have any idea why a retrograde might give false results?   My sleep is being severely affected by the flank pain. I take ambien, it's not helping, every night, I wake up hurting & needing to pea, & just can't go back to sleep because of it. I probably wouldn't even be able to fall asleep if it wasn't for the ambien. The pain gets worse during the night, & then for some reason, even worse when I need to pea. I have burning pain going up my back & a constant ache that won't go away in the upper part of my kidneys. I react to about every medication I take now & have tingling sensations & itching from it that won't let up. I haven't stopped taking ambien or adderall yet.   I can't get help since that stupid retrograde showed nothing. I was in the ER twice since that test, one time with blood pouring out of me, but since I wasn't screeming in pain, they wouldn't do a CT. My PCP didn't either. So for now, I'm stuck putting up with it. I don't really know what to do. I plan to go back to the urologist to argue this in Dec but he never wanted to help the begin with because of the size of the stones, since they're passable. I don't know if he'll do anything.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi -  Well that answers the question about family history. This will likely be a chronic problem. The question remains about the stones you no doubt still have and why the retrograde study wouldn't show them. If they are still incarcerated in the kidneys and haven't started moving down the ureters, they aren't going to show up on a retrograde study, because the contrast material can't be forced all the way up and into the kidneys. This study is more useful at looking for obstructions, stones, and other problems in the ureters. If no stones were active (moving down) at the time, they would't show up. However, the study may have helped dislodge one upstream, which was passed about a week later.   I'm not sure why your doctor would tell you there are no stones when the study can't visualize that far up into the kidneys themselves. No stones present in the tract doesn't mean they aren't up there waiting to release. I find that puzzling. Most likely be hearing from them, and your doctor should be hearing from you.   Good luck with this. Please stay in touch.\n\n",

    "content": "I guess that goes to show the dr didn't want to help me. I didn't go to him just over the stones, I went for another opinion about my interstitial cystitis in question as to how that is actually diagnosed in a bladder biopsy, believing it was a mistake, because I had chronic UTI's & focal reactive cystitis. How do you have 2 different types of cystitis & since when can IC be diagnosed on a bladder biopsy? I have an appt with him in December & plan on trying to get him to consider doing a CT but I don't know if he'll help me or not. He didn't exactly want to help the start with. But I least I know how to argue the reason it should be done now. Thank you for helping. I could kiss the ground you walk on for that explanation.\n\n",

    "content": "My urologist said that the contrast does go all the way up in the kidneys & the retrograde may have missed the stones only because they were tiny. He said where I was diagnosed with scattered bilateral stones on a CT before meant they were tiny stones. The retrograde showed the lower poles of the kidneys but by far did not show my entire kidneys, I have a copy of the x-rays.   If it's okay, I would like to ask about my bladder diagnosis. This was to get another opinion on having interstitial cystitis.  I have chronic inflammation inside my bladder. Does that mean it's IC? Can't there be other causes for that? Like medication reactions and reactive cystitis (like burning from taking a bath and using soap)? He failed to do a bladder biopsy.  He claims that IC can be diagnosed on a bladder biopsy. I thought that the biopsy was used to rule out other causes. Since when can a biopsy diagnose IC in the report itself (not what the pathologist says is the pre & post-op diagnosis, my pre-op was reactive cystitis, post-op same), this is on the actual biopsy.  He claims that you don't check bladder capacity with a hydrodistention. Is that true? But yet claimed my bladder couldn't hold much. I can drink 2 large glasses of water and hold it several hours without a good urge to go to the bathroom & I usually pea large amounts, like 15-20 ounces at a time. How is it my bladder capacity is low? How would he even know without measuring the capacity.  I ask him about the size of my bladder and he said it looked okay, so then I told him I was told it was shrinking, and he then agrees it was. Another thing confusing me, how if your bladder is of normal size, could it be shrinking? He never bothered saying such until I asked him. I think he's just taking up for my past doctor.\n\n",

    "title": "renal ultrasound, dilated kidney?",
    "content": "I had a renal ultrasound done because I suddenly became hypertensive + tachy at the age of 24.  It all started when I went to the doctor and was told I had high blood pressure. I was completely baffled as I am young, watch my sodium intake, and exercise.  The only thing that worked is Lisinopril. I've tried Norvasc, Hydrochlorathiazide, and Lopressor. Hydrochlorathiazide didn't work, Lopressor just made me too tired to function, and I had to go to the hospital because I had tachycardia and chest pain, and was told to discontinue Norvasc.  Well, on HTCT, I still had high blood pressure and tachycardia, and I was given Lisinopril, but I am still tachy sometimes and experience chest pan.  I told my doctor all of this and she told me to get a renal ultrasound since I had Grade IV or V urinary reflux and had surgery to correct it when I was 12 years old.  I have chronic UTI and kidney infections (though mostly just UTI's), regardless of antibiotics. I also know that when I drink water, my abdomen swells and it looks like I am a little bit pregnant.  When the ultrasound was done, I happened to see the screen and it said that one kidney was 47 cubic centimeters, and the other one was 70 something cubic centimeters.  I am assuming this refers to kidney volume & I was wondering if those numbers are normal or not. I am going to the doctor for a follow up December 14th.  Someone suggested those numbers meant that I have renal pelvic dilation, but I can't say that is true or not because I don't know what is normal or not.  Any idea what the numbers represent?  I know that I had to hold in my pee during the procedure, and while holding it in, I could feel my kidneys pounding, which sort of sucked. Sometimes I still do, so I will bring that up at the next appt as well and have the doctor check for a UTI.\n\n",

Having multiple chronic pain conditions, I know which pains are for which problems and this is a new, different pain. It is VERY tender to the touch and hurts when I move, walk, twist, etc.  Because I have an auto immune disease I am already at risk for organ failure and the medications I am on increase this risk so I am very scared that something is seriously wrong.

I am confident that sterile technique was used in the placement of the catheter since this is standard procedure but in spite of this, catheters do come with the risk of infection even in ideal circumstances because you are introducing a tube with direct association outside the body into the bladder.  Treatment is necessary if you have infection so you should see your doctor.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: ethylene glycol poisoning",
    "content": "Hello, Ethylene glycol is an alcohol that is used as an automotive antifreeze. The toxicity form ethylene glycol ingestion is due to its metabolic end products which result in acidosis and the formation of oxalate crystals that accumulates in the body and excreted in the urine.   Its precipitation in the kidney results in renal insufficiency. Consumption of the blood calcium results in hypocalcemia. The main effects of ethylene glycol intoxication are on the CNS and the kidney.  So patients will have rapid deep breathing, altered mental status. Renal damage causes oliguria (decline in the 24 hours urine amount) and increased levels of creatinine and urea. Urinary excretion of calcium is high and blood level of calcium is low. Hypocalcemia results in abnormal muscle contraction, altered conscious level and cardiac arrhythmias.  Essential investigations include, ethylene glycol level, calcium level in urine and blood, arterial blood gases, blood Na, blood Glucose, creatinine, urea, blood osmolality (amount of solute in a liter of body fluids) and urine analysis. When blood solutes increase (in this case ethylene glycol) the osmolality and the osmolal gap increase.   Diagnosis is primarily based on a history of exposure or suspicious exposure to ethylene glycol intoxication confirmed by the presence of any of the following 3 findings:  1- The blood level of ethylene glycol is 20 mg/dL or more. 2- Ethylene glycol ingestion is confirmed in the presence of an osmolal gap of >10 mOsm/L.  3- Suspicion of ethylene glycol intoxication with 2 of the following findings that suggest either acidosis or excess blood solutes, or excess calcium in urine  as follows: I.\tArterial pH level < 7.3 (acidosis). II.\tNaHCO3 < 20 mg/dL. III.\tOsmol gap > 10 mOsm/L. IV.\tUrinary oxalate crystals.  Postmortem evidence of changes in the body organs like brain edema and acute renal tubular necrosis are indicative of ethylene glycol intoxication. Oxalate crystals are usually found in these organs and support also the diagnosis. Ethylene glycol  concentration can be measured in different tissues and body fluids.  Hope you find this information useful. Best regards.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: proteinuria & pelviectasis",
    "content": "Hello, It would be more helpful if you can inform us about the exact level of proteinuria in the urine analysis test, if any previous US abdomen was done before this problem was discovered, especially before or after the onset of the previous urinary tract infection.  This is a condition in which there is dilatation of the renal pelvis, the kidney part that is in direct connection with the ureter. The ureter is in direct communication with urinary bladder. If urinary bladder infection occurs, transmission through the ureter to the renal pelvis may occur resulting a more serious infection known as pyelonephritis which was reported to be more common in children born with pelviectasis. Pyelonephritis can cause chronic renal damage. Pelviectasis is usually diagnosed in the prenatal period or shortly after in newborns and is thought to be a self limited that resolves later.  Dilatation in the renal pelvis in adults occurs when obstruction below the kidney level occurs either in the ureter or in the bladder near the ureteric orifice (like stones, fibrosis). Back pressure will cause changes in the kidney usually in the form of renal pelvis dilatation and calcyeal dilatation.  Proteinuria could be a coexisting problem or related to the first one. It should be investigated properly. Kidney function tests; Cratinine, urea, GFR or eGFR are essential. It can be due to a transient problem or it may indicate permanent renal damage. The degree of proteinuria is also helpful in defining the possible causes. Persistent proteinuria indicates the presence of a glomerular lesion (most common) or tubular or increased flow of proteins due to systemic cause like in some hematologic malignancies.  I would advise you to follow up with your doctor and to discuss with him your concerns to get clear picture of your situation. Consultation of a nephrologist is essential too.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

In this second ultrasound, Pelviectasis was still discovered in the right kidney with no change. They found my liver to be enlarged (19.3cm). Liver blood work came back normal. The proteinuria was stated to be albuminuria, with 31mg.  The pelviectasis has never been seen until these 2 ultrasounds, I had ultrasound 3 yrs ago, and 1 year ago before I had my gall Bladder removed in Dec 2007. All of these conditiond seem to be new, since my physical in Feb 2008. The protein is still showing in urine tests - 9 months now. I haven't had any UTIs since I was 6 years old.  I will be seeing a Urologist in Dec 2008 in regards to overactive Bladder and the fact that my bladder has dropped in the last few months.  My GP has ordered an abdominal/pelvis ultrasound which I will be going for tomorrow morning.  I am concerned that all of these issue must be connected, and my GP seems to think they are all unrelated. The Nephrologist is leaning more towards it being a vascular problem.  I am concerned about family history of Multiple Myeloma, and if this could be a possibility. Also, I have had a sore back for months now, especially in the morning, and when sitting. A very widespread throbbing pain, and a feeling of tightness. Can this be related ?? Thank you for your response.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  This is more likely to be a postinfectious glomerulnephritis however, exclusion of other causes like primary renal disease or systemic causes is essential.  Glomerulnephritis is a condition that occurs as a result of postinfectious, renal, and systemic cause.   The most common cause of postinfectious glomerulnephritis is Streptococcus species following an upper respiratory infection mainly in the winter, or a skin infection mainly in summer times.  Other organisms include viruses, other types of bacteria and are usually suspected if no evidence of a group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection could be found.  Systemic causes, like collagen vascular diseases (e.g.systemic lupus erythematosus), vasculitis and some drugs can induce glomerular damage and anemia. Primary renal diseases and different types of glomerular basement membrane damage due to deposition of different immune complexes of idiopathic cause can result in renal failure and anaemia as a consequence.  In cases of a postinfectious acute nephritis, a latent period after the fever and throat or skin infection of about 3 weeks occurs before onset of renal damage.  Patients usually have a history of fever sore throat or skin infection followed by symptoms suggestive of renal damage few weeks later like. Renal affection presents with oliguria (less amount of urine output), more fluid accumulation in their body causing edema especially in the face around the eyes, dark urine, generalized weakness and some have arthritis or arthralgia.  Antistreptolysin O (ASO) tire is increased in 60-80% of patients with a peak in 3-5 weeks post-infection and declines to its normal level in 6 months.  Urine analysis shows almost always microscopic hematuria and proteinuria. High ESR is expected.  Creatinine and blood urea will indicate the amount of kidney damage. US abdomen to evaluate kidney changes and BX may be recommended if renal disease is expected.  This is a concerning situation that requires consultation of nephrologist since a chronic kidney damage may occur if not appropriately treated although the long-term prognosis of these cases is generally good with complete recovery.  Please follow up with his doctor and discuss with him your concerns. Hope you find this information useful. Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  This sounds like infection and dermatitis. Dermatitis can result from infections, allergies, and irritants. Infections can be due to fungi, bacteria both of them (more likely) or less likely virus based on your description.   This part of the skin is very delicate and can be easily damaged due to friction and mechanical irritation (following sexual activity) or exposure to an allergen (soap, cream). Secondary infections can easily occur once the skin is damaged. Foul smell usually occurs with bacterial and fungal infections. White discharge is due to pus formation from dead bacteria.  Infections of hair follicles and the sebaceous glands in this part are common too and give similar picture.  Culture and sensitivity is the best way to identify the causative organism and to prescribe specific antibiotic therapy. It is very important to exclude STDs.  Direct clinical examination is essential, so I would advise you to follow up with your doctor for exclusion of other skin diseases like psoriasis.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "title": "Is it a bad idea to catheterize if a UTI is present?",
    "content": "Please help my grandmother:  She's been very sick lately and I need a second opinion about what we should do to help her.  Grandma is 79 and has severe arthritis.  She's visited a pain specialist and has tried many things to dull the pain: epidurals, morphine patches, pain meds, even a type of electro-shock therapies.  She hurts all the time and especially has problems in her hips, shoulders, and ankles.  She has recently developed a pressure/bed sore that is being treated with antibiotics, a daily saline rinse, and a simple gauze padding.  Since her bedsore has developed, its gotten harder and harder for her to get up and down out of her chair.  This, of course, makes the most simple tasks, like taking her medication, preparing meals, and using the restroom much more difficult. Grandma normally takes lasix to keep the swelling in her feet and ankles down, but due to the sore on her backside, she has since stopped taking her water pills because they cause her to have to get up to use the bathroom quite often.  She's not drinking much for the same reason.  She looks pale and I'm worried shes getting dehydrated.  We recently discovered that one of her legs is about 1.5inches longer than the other.  She has special shoes that balance her legs out, which makes it easier to walk, but the swelling in her feet and ankles is so bad that she can't fit into her shoes.  We're not sure what to do to help her.  Shes getting weaker everyday and this morning, she fell on her way to the bathroom.  We're scared and need some advice.  We're working on getting her a lift chair and we've had someone with her nonstop since the fall.  We asked her doctor if it was possible to catheterize her until the sore heals a bit so she can increase her fluids and start her lasix again without having to \"run\" to the bathroom so frequently.  Her doctor said she couldn't/wouldn't do this because Grandma already has a UTI (which we were unaware of...).  Is this usual procedure?  I work at a veterinary clinic and we catheterize cats with urinary infections quite often, but I do realize there is a vast difference between animal and human medicine.  I need a second opinion because Grandma's doctor has been known to put off treatment of symptoms until she winds up in the hospital.  Its amazing how fast Grandma's health has plummeted since this pressure sore has developed.  Its so difficult to watch her suffer the way she does- she is 100% coherent and sharp as a tack mentally; but physically, her body is giving out on her.  It kills me to see such a strong independent woman in such a feeble and dependent state.  We thought the catheter would give her a chance to recover... any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  I don't know where else to turn.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Sorry to hear about your grandmother\u2019s illness. It is really a complicated situation and any doctor would be challenged to chose the most convenient treatment approach that its benefit would overweigh the risks.  This obviously needs detailed information about her history and a thorough clinical examination. Identifying and understanding the morbidities she has would allow prioritization of her most distressing problems that should be focused on while treating her. In my openion, your grand mother has 3 main problems, the bed sores, the UTI, the dehydration. These are critical situations that should be promptly treated.   I understood that she has oedema for which she is (was) on diuretics, at the same time she also has urinary tract infection.   Urinary tract infections is a common complication for urinary catheter thus catheter is indicated only if necessary and not solely for the convenience of patient care. However, one of the main indications for urinary catheterization is in palliative care for critically ill patients for whom bed and clothing changes are uncomfortable. A major problem would be from extending the infection into the kidney causing pyelonephritis which is also common to occur.  However, since UTI complication can be avoided using strict antiseptic rules in dealing with the catheter and if happened, can be treated properly, consideration of catheter insertion is possible to avoid more critical problems like dehydration and aggravation of bed sore by immobilization. Immobilization is a major risk not only for skin infections but other types of serious infections and vascular complications.  Starting the treatment for her UTI before the catheter is introduced then completing her antibiotic course would be an option.  I would advise you to follow up with her doctor and to discuss with him your concerns about her; he is in better position to evaluate her status properly and providing her the best treatment approach.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a Caucasian 38yr old female. Since the age of 14 I have been getting Kidney stones. I was diagnosed at age 22 with Hyperthyroidism. Once i received the diagnosis i had one parathyroid removed. Though still get stones.  At the age of 14 they told me one of my kidneys, my left was deformed. Nothing was really said much about it other than it was misshapen. When I was 21 just before my diagnosis. I received another ultrasound and was told both my kidneys are deformed.  At 38 again I have been diagnosed again with kidney stones.( I should point out that between age 14 and 32 i would get kidney stones approx every 2 years. This time it was 6 yrs before i got one again.) I saw on one of the forms that i have a eGFR level of 52.  I am just wondering if this is something i should be concerned about considering my history of kidney stones etc\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  It would be helpful if you can provide us information about the results of the last blood tests done for PTH level and the calcium level or any other investigations done. You also mentioned that surgery included removal of part of the parathyroid gland, so information about the pathology of the removed gland is important to know whether it was hyperplasia or a parathyroid adenoma.  Hyperparathyroidism can be due to disorder in the gland the so called primary parathyroidism or secondary to low calcium level and high phosphate level in patients with chronic renal problems. Tertiary hyperparathyroidism may occur after prolonged secondary hyperparathyroidismand this like other causes would result in hypercalcemia and also stone formation.  Nephrologists and endocrinologists recommend periodic assay for parathyroid hormone (PTH) serum concentration to check for a secondary HPT once the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) declines to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Secondary hyperparathyroidism usually resolve after correction of the underlying cause as well as using medications to block PTH release. While primary and tertiary types may mandate surgical intervention.  If you have recurrent stones this means that the underlying cause is still not treated and checking both renal and the parathyroid function tests are essential for proper management.   It is not clear for me the kidney problem you have been diagnosed with but it is essential to follow up the kidney function tests regularly. Your family history is also of consideration and causes related to familial conditions should be explored too.  I would advise you to follow up with your doctor he may recommend new PTH, serum calcium, phosphate, and radiological investigations for the remaining parathyroid glands.  Please keep us updated Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 27YO female, relatively healthy, have lousy allergies, but am otherwise fine.    I have been dealing with right upper quadrant pain for the past 5 years.  It is a dull pain about 3 inches below my last rib.  My whole core is tender when pressed, but especially in that spot. It also hurts when I breathe in deeply.  The pain happens daily usually in the late afternoon and lasts through the evening but comes and goes in waves. When the wave of pain leaves, I cannot stay awake no matter how hard I try.   It lasts for 2 weeks - 4 months and then leaves.  The \"down time\" can last for 2 weeks-10 months.    In the weeks leading up to the pain returning I have low-grade fevers, nausea, heightened white blood cell count and a blood sediment test shows inflammation.  Stress seems to be the only thing that brings on the pain.  Bumps in the car and walking seem to aggravate it.  It does not seem to be affected by food or anything else.    On a pain scale of 1-10, it is generally 4-5 but increases to 7-8 with stress or bumps.  It has gone to 10 only once, when I was in the E.R.  There was never a diagnosis.  They admitted me and gave me I.V. antibiotics and pain medicine.  I was released after 2 days. But was not conscious for most of the time I was there.    I have had 2 hidascans, several ultrasounds, CT, MRI... everything is negative.  I am at my wits end, no one can help me and I feel crazy.  I am looking for any suggestions or avenues that my doctors have not yet thought of, or even the right specialist to see.  I can't keep living with this quality of life.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello-  I can't help but wonder, with all the imaging tests you've had done, if one of them was a cholecystogram (which looks at the gallbladder). While you state the episodes of pain don't seem to be affected by food intake, and while a food connection is common with gallbladder problems, it is not always the trigger, and in other cases it's just not very obvious.   The area you describe and the sensations you describe do sound most like liver/gallbladder related problems, specifically biliary colic such as comes with attacks of the gallbladder. If this possibility has been positively ruled out then I'm at a loss unless there are more facts you can supply. Hopefully this is helpful.   Please let us know if there is anything you might have left out which could have a bearing on this problem. Meanwhile I'll try and ponder this and see if I can come up with any other suggestions.\n\n",

    "content": "I can't thank you enough for responding to me!!!!!!!  I have not had a cholecystogram that I am aware of, I have never heard of it.  I will definitely bring it up with my doctor.    With my last hidascan (according to the tech, but it was not in the final report) my gallbladder waited until the last POSSIBLE second to \"dump,\" after they had me stand up.  Stored it all and then gushed it all at once while I was standing and not under the machine. So, they called it ruled out...  I came in with side pains and they were present throughout, so I don't think that I could have just caught it on a well-behaving day.  I really can't think of anything I am leaving out except that I also have IBS.  They don't seem related in the least, in fact my worst digestive symptoms are mercifully in the off time for pain.  Probably because I tend to eat significantly less when I have side pains.  The next step from my primary care physician was a colonoscopy for Chron's Disease, because two of my aunts have it.  Insurance denied it.  I plan to try again since I now have different insurance, however my aunts do not seem convinced, neither did my primary care physician.  I think he's out of ideas too.    I tried to get a second opinion, but the doctor I went to said I needed to go back to the doctor who knew the history of it and wouldn't work with me, but it didn't sound life-threatening...  gee, thanks.  Otherwise, I think you know everything I know... which isn't much unfortunately. What would happen if I had one of these big expensive tests on a day that I didn't have pain, would it still find something?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, and thanks for staying in touch.   While the family history of Chron's disease certainly does warrant a rule out there, it is more difficult to determine for certain without a biopsy, whether or not this is present. But the odd behavior of your gallbladder suggests to me that it may have some sludge or stones which stay put most of the time and allowed the contrast media to escape when you changed position, which is really rather odd and just adds to my suspicion about that.  It sounds as though the findings from the HIDA scan were not recorded 100 per cent accurately because of the way things went, and a repeat may be in order. Something about that whole sequence of events seems odd and worth further exploration and I think the cholecystogram is perhaps more telling in some cases. I think it might be in your case because of the odd behavior noted by the tech. Being tested on a day with no symptoms shouldn't normally make any difference.  Please keep us apprised of how things go. Best of luck to you. Feel better!\n\n",

The renal function may need to be assessed in more detail with assessment of glomerular filtration rate.  Normally the body can balance intake with output and a change in diet should not normally lead to water/salt retention.  Please keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  High BP is of two types, Primary and Secondary. Secondary hypertension is one which has a specific 'cause' like renal or hormonal impairment.  Primary is just there, like in many middle or old age people. Since you are relatively young and your BP has come to light a little abruptly, your doctor very rightly subjected you to a renal Doppler.   Renal artery narrowing is a major trigger for development of hypertension. This type of hypertension sometimes proves difficult to control and Tekturna [aliskiren] is a recent medicinal class specifically to control renal or High Renin hypertension.   If renal artery stenosis is confirmed on MRA, it can be very well treated with a procedure called Renal Angioplasty with Stent insertion, this is just like what they do in a heart artery in a heart attack. Successful opening of a renal artery stenosis many times cure the blood pressure. Also it prevents the kidney from getting damaged.  Calf pain could be non specific. However in a smoker it may herald blockage of leg arteries. In such a case it may be advisable to go for a leg artery Doppler too, and if positive an MRA of legs.   Take care,   Apurva\n\n",

It is then processed by the liver and excreted.  There are a few other pathways but the liver is the main processing center.  If his ammonia levels are becoming elevated it is very possible that his liver is having problems processing it.  I suspect that his doctors are actively trying to determine what the cause of this is.  Keeping in touch with his doctors will be your best conduit of information.  Best wishes.  I do hope this resolves quickly and your brother gets better soon.\n\n",

My mom urinates a lot she drinks  a lot of water she  has never had a problem with how often or how much she goes.  Recently within the past 2 weeks she ruptured her Achilles tendon and she needs to have surgery on it that what all the blood work was for.  If is completely rupture through and the surgeon said that the tendon moved it way up in to her calf. Could the broken muscle be the cause of the high creatine levels? Also if her kidneys were only working at 5% she wouldn't be making very much urine at all would she?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Sos19528,  A ruptured achilles tendon should not cause an elevation in creatinine or a decrease in kidney function.  Regarding the question about urine output, this can be deceiving.  In some cases the  urine output will decrease; however, in other cases the kidney looses its ability to process fluid so the kidney may not be able to reabsorb fluid that is filtered by passive flow.  In this case, urine output may be normal or even abnormally high.  Further testing is definitely important to find out why your mother's kidneys are having trouble.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Mr. Varghese,  Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APLA) is a well know disease that is associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) but can occur on its own as well.  The syndrome increases the possibility of clotting, which may have been responsible for the development of your wife's hemichorea.    Unfortunately, there is no known cure for APLA or SLE.  To my knowledge, stem cell therapies have not been shown helpful in these diseases.  The main treatment issues revolve around preventing clots and suppressing the antibody formation.  Your wife may want to see a rheumatologist if she has not already.  (Rheumatologists are specialists in autoimmune diseases.)  New breakthrough's in medicine are being made all the time.  Hopefully soon there will be a permanent cure for these diseases.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Mamaw2ps,  There are a number of things that can damage the kidneys causing the BUN and creatinine to increase.  Diabetes is a definite possibility in your husband's case.  Sometimes the actual cause is never identified.  The level of BUN or creatinine itself is not an indication for dialysis.  Basically, when considering when to start dialysis one looks for symptoms related to the renal failure rather than the BUN or creatinine.  Indications for dialysis include uremia (symptoms from a BUN that is dramatically elevated, which include itching and nausea/vomiting), elevations in potassium levels, too much acid in the blood or too much fluid in the body.  Note that uremia is symptoms from the BUN so a BUN of 50 but with symptoms would be an indication for dialysis while a BUN of 75 without symptoms would not be an indication for dialysis.  Your husband needs close follow up with a nephrologist (kidney specialist).  Hopefully, there will be some good treatments to help prevent renal failure and the need for dialysis.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Desiree,  This is actually quite a complicated mechanism of action.  ACE inhibitor have the potential to both protect and hurt the kidney.  Generally, if the kidney is healthy it will be protective and if the kidney is not quite functioning properly it may become damaging.  ACE inhibitor modulate blood flow through the kidney.  In doing this it changes pressures that the smallest blood vessels experience.  This may be good or bad.  The issue of use in a transplant patient is even more complex because of the various medications.  My best advice for you is to talk with your nephrologist about this.  If your nephrologist recommends it it should be safe for you.  If you are taking one, regular follow up with your doctor is important to make sure that everything continues to go well.

Repeated kidney stones make me suspicious that there may be some increased calcium excretion in your kidney predisposing you to developing stones.  If a condition like this is found there may be a treatment to help keep you from forming further stones.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I have numbing/tingling sensations hitting me through my entire body now and it's definetly due to the stone and now my skin is getting really itchy. Is that anything to be concerned about? I take lortab for pain control but it's making my abdomen hurt and causes nausea for 2 days after I take one and I'm getting to where I can't tolerate it.   No matter how bad this gets, I do not want to have surgery again. I would rather be shot in the head than have another sling put in me. That was one of the most horrible experiences I ever had. Is there any prescription medications that will shrink these stones instead of using surgical options?  Thanks for helping & for the advice. Sorry about all of the questions I keep asking.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Dr. Weil,   I often feel that I\u2019m getting thirstier as I drink water. I don\u2019t know enough to understand why that would be but it has me a little concerned about my kidneys or... I really don\u2019t know. When I drink my mouth feels drier, my throat feels uncomfortable and strangely tighter and drier, my fingertips sometimes prune, and I find the glands in my neck feel sore shortly after. I even feel like my circulation gets poorer (I\u2019m drinking luke warm or hot water). I think it unlikely that I\u2019m over-drinking; in fact I may be dehydrated at this point (nervous about drinking much now in case something is wrong) and have barely been eating in the last 3 weeks due to gastro issues (drinking issue has been longer).  I have asked a Dr about this and was told that it doesn't make sense; yet it is definitely happening and has been for quite some time.  Why would this be?  I hope you can help me understand as I am nervous. The Dr telling me it's not possible makes me feel misunderstood, alone, and confused.  Mary R (I am a 29 year old female with GI symptoms under investigation and food allergies. I am not on any medication.)\n\n",

For the last two weeks I have been experiencing a pain in my left flank that begins ONLY when I am prone, escallating in intensity to the point of excruciating and I must arise from the bed.  Approximately 30 minutes after becoming erect, the pain eases to the point where I forget about it.  This cycle repeats daily without change, although I am noticing that the pain seems to be increasing in intensity each night.  I have suffered a kidney stone in the past, but this does not present as the same.  Any suggetions? I presently take PremPro, Norvasc, and Boniva.  My family history includes heart disease and various types of stomach cancer.  I have been hospitalized only for childbirth.  I had a great checkup in July.\n\n",

I'd be more suspicious that you may have a nerve being pressed on when you are in the prone position.  It may be due to tight muscles that are being strained when prone, as well.  I would recommend you consider seeing a neurologist or possibly a sports medicine physician to further evaluate your symptoms.  Bets wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Cmbajb,  The answer to this depends on why you had the test done.  In general, if you are not having excessive infections the low levels of IgG are likely not significant.  Normal levels are based on a bell curve so there will be some people that are still normal but are outside the \"normal levels\".  The testing for EBV is actually a 4 antibody test.  If the EBV IGG and EBNA antibodies were the ones that were elevated it is significant for a past, rather than current infection.  If the IgM antibody or the Early antigen antibody are positive it is more indicative of a current infection.  Feel free to post some more information if this doesn't answer your question.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Warning, this will be long.  I know I have posted in many different topics on this forum, and probably seem like a hypochondriac, but I am at my wits end.    Again, i'm 22 female, diagnosed with PCOS & Hypothyroidism.  I have had no sugeries, am now on Synthroid & just was prescribed a weeks worth of Levaquin for \"possible\" Kidney Infection.    Aside from the things listed above, I have pains that I won't even mention to my doctor because I KNOW he probably thinks Im a quack.  I have been to the doctor so much in recent months it's trumped my entire PAST in doctors visits.    I don't even know where to begin but if somebody could help me and reccomend something I would be VERY grateful.  First off, My doctor told me that when he did the urinalysis to find my kidney infection, he said \"I found more pus than blood.\" Which he said indicated that there could be a possible chance for a kidney stone, but 'more likely' (in his words) an infection.  But then he said my symptoms didnt match an infection, but a stone.  Symptoms are sharp pains that started about 4 months ago, I would have one a week or so, then it escalated this weekend and I went to the doctor yesterday.  (11/5/07)  In accordance with that I have pain in my left hip, numbness in my fingers & top of my foot, random 'shocking' pains in different parts of my body (mostly upper torso), jolting pain just below my right breast (this has only happened twice), low back pain, and the past few weeks it has been VERY easy for me to injur my ankles for some reason.  Just the slightest bend or twist on BOTH ankles is incredibly painful.  Can ANYONE give me some answers, or advice?  I'm sure my doctor is sick of seeing me and quite frankly I'm sick of going to the doctor and being in pain at 22!!\n\n",

An MRI of the spine may be helpful also.  Regarding your urinalysis, blood and pus indicate infection.  Kidney stones can cause pain in the back and abdomen but your pain sounds quite diffuse.  It would not be expected of a kidney stone to have this extensive of a pain distribution.  If kidney stones are suspected a CT scan of the abdomen is the best way to assess for them.  It is important that your doctor know all the things going on.  I would not worry about your doctor thinking you are making things up.  Without all the information it becomes much more difficult to make a diagnosis.  Best wishes. Best wishes.\n\n",

The steroids didn't seem to be helping his minimal change so he has been having dialysis through a catheter 3 times a week also.  I can't find any information on using dialysis for minimal change disease.  He isn't eating much and has probably lost about 40 pounds.  He has had a couple of episodes of dizziness/faintness after dialysis, so is not driving.  A month ago the dr. said he hoped the dialysis would be temporary, but we don't really know how long it will take to get through this.  Is dialysis often used for minimal change disease?\n\n",

Also, it is very uncommon for minimal change disease to require dialysis.  If your father has not had a renal biopsy this would be good to discuss with his doctor to be sure of what is going on.  The need for dialysis makes me wonder if his kidney disease has progressed beyond minimal change disease.  Follow up with a nephrologist is crucial.  Unfortunately, given the uncertainties of his case I am unable to say how long I think he will need dialysis for.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Alaskar,  I've copied your questions to be sure I address them all:  *do I need urgent care? since I did not continue for financial reasons. This should not be something that needs urgent care but does deserve follow up to make sure it is not getting worse.  *how serious is that? The hydronephrosis is mild and likely not a major issue.  The more concerning issue would be to see if it is getting worse (or better).  *is there any recommended diet? At this point, there should be no diet restrictions.  *what could be the cause? There are a few possible causes of hydronephrosis.  It basically occurs because of increased pressure in the ureters.  This may be do to an obstruction such as with an abnormal valve, reflux of urine backwards up the ureter or other obstruction such as a kidney stone.  *my doctor suggested IVU, what's that? An IVU is a test where some die is injected into the veins that is then filtered out by the kidney.  X-rays are taken to follow the dye and see if it drains normally into the bladder.  It can also be followed during voiding to see if the urethra is normal.  This test can show obstructions if they are present.  It is a less commonly used test, now days, but still has some good indications and may be helpful in your case.  *I have some pain and discomfort sometimes in both kidneies? why both?  This is a little harder to say.  It may be due to some increased pressure on both sides, even though the hydronephrosis is only on one side.  I would suggest you follow up with your doctor to determine how best to follow this.  It's likely that you should have a repeat ultrasound in a few weeks or so to see if the condition has gotten better, worse or stayed the same.  If it isn't better, an IVU may help.  It may also help to see a urologist.  Best wishes.\n\n",

It may also be due to a difficulty in getting enough oxygen/nutrients to the tissues so they are signaling the need for more red blood cells to carry these things.  I would recommend you have your HCT checked again in a few weeks to see if it is back to normal or if it continues to be elevated.  Most likely it will be fine.  If not, I would advise you to see your doctor for further evaluation and possible work-up.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Prolonged intermittent kidney pain  I am a 40-year old Caucasian female active, healthy weight, great blood pressure and not taking any medications, with the exception of occasional benadryl.  At an active, healthy 27 I a stone became stuck in the lower ureter near the bladder and was removed via a cystascope (sp?).  At 38, while on bedrest with a high risk pregnancy, a very large stone (8-10 mm) became stuck upper portion of my Left ureter where it stayed 3 months (until delivery).  Initial treatment was a uretal stent then a nephrostomy tube.  At some time after delivery, this stone passed and the tube was removed.  In the two years following the pregnancy I have intermittently had chronic-severe pain.  I just had a diseased gallbladder removed (post-op one month) which seems to have alleviated some of my pain issues.  Unfortunately, I continue to have kidneys that ache or feel as if they are being kicked or sometimes stabbed, particularly on my left flank or under my left rib.  It seems to worsen in the evening, while I am sleeping accompanied by nausea and sometimes headache.  The pain is significant enough to wake me from a dead sleep and is sometimes helped by a Lorotab 5 or 10.  I have done three, 24 hour urines and several blood tests with none of them showing anything out of the \u201cnormal\u201d ranges, with the exception of slightly low magnesium in the urine samples.  Based on a CT done in February, I do still have small stones in both kidneys.  At least, three have passed.  Is there a condition of the kidney that could cause intermittent kidney pain and possibly contribute to the formation of stones that could be missed in typical blood and urine testing?    Could there be scarring or a physical abnormality of the kidney that is leading to the pain and stone formation?    Is it accurate to assume that the stones are the root of the pain?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Lalezzle,  Unfortunately, I'm not sure a cystoscopy will help much.  Your pain is very consistent with kidney stones.  If there were stones in both kidneys it is also possible that you have a smaller stone in the ureter that was simply not picked up by the CT scan.  Drinking lots of water will help flush stones out.  I would recommend you see a urologist to discuss possibly doing some lithotripsy to break up the stones and make them easier to pass.  Magnesium and citrate in the urine help prevent the calcium from crystalizing in the urine to forms stones.  Taking a multivitamine with the daily recommended amount of magnesium and, especially, citrate may help some.  With cacium phosphate stones it is also a good idea to look into causes like hyperparathyroidism or renal tubular acidosis that may increase the risk of forming calcium phosphate stones.  If you have stones present the urine tests are very unreliable so a \"normal\" result does not rule out high calcium levels.  Seeing a urologist may help with management of the stones you have now.  Seeing a nephrologist may help with preventing future stones.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "My teenage son awoke with low back pain and fever 4 days ago. His regular doctor said there was blood in his urine sample and would grow a culture. She perscribed Bactrim. The next day, fever was 102-103, continued low back pain, burning with urination, chills, shivering, vommiting. Also color of urine was orange. Regular doctor sent us to ER.   The ER did a CT scan that ruled out kidney stones. Said that young healthy males his age do not usually  get urinary tract infections, but that must be what he had according to his urine sample, although blood count was normal. ER told us to stop Bactrim and put him on Keflex instead. Also gave him nausea medicine and also phenazophyridin to help him urinate easier. Yesterday he was even worse, so we saw a urologist. The urologist could not get a copy of his culture report, but said to continue on as we were doing and push fluids and he would improve soon.  However, when I called the regular doctor back to find out about culture that was done 3 days ago, they said the culture was negative.  How can the culture and bloodwork be normal?  He still has  high fever, chills, low back pain, blood in urine and burning when he urinates.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi LisaLou,  There are a few possible reasons.  One is that the bacteria that is causing the infection may be difficult to culture.  This is generally unlikely.  Another, very real possibility is that he has a virus causing the infection.  There are several viruses that can cause urinary tract infections and will not show up on a culture.  These will generally resolve in 5-7 days or so.    Also, if the urine was very dilute during the initial part of the infection there may have not been enough bacteria present to grow on culture.  If his symptoms do not resolve I would recommend he follow up with the urologist for further evaluation.  Cephalexin (Keflex) is generally quite adequate for UTI's so if it is a bacteria it almost certainly will be covered by the antibiotics.  If the infection is also present in his kidneys (as it sounds based on his back pain) it may take a few more days to start to feel better than it would if it were a simple UTI.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Hydronephrosis & hydroureter",
    "content": "In 2002, while pregnant, they found hydronephrosis and hydroureter on the right side.  It continued to worsen, so they stented me.  At the beginning, the stent provided much needed relief, but after a few weeks, the hydronephrosis came back.  It continued to worsen, and a month before my baby was due, my left kidney began swelling as well.  They delivered the baby then because of the kidney's swelling.  The docs took the stent out after I had healed from the delivery since it was no longer working and caused great discomfort.  The doc wanted to wait and see if now since the baby was out if the hydronephrosis would go away - it's now been 5 years and I still have it.  I have periodic horrible pain on the right side that travels to the groin (which I assume is the path of my ureter).  It lasts until I take pain meds for a few days, then it will get to a bearable level for a while then it comes back.  Occasionally it is associated with a UTI, but most of the time - urine is clean.    My gp and my gynecologist both tell me I need to find out what the cause is - but the urologist I went to felt like we'll just wait and see - or do exploratory surgery and put another stent in.  My last IVP about 1 year ago showed the hydronephrosis and ureter on the right - but the kidney was not damaged.  I had an ultrasound at my gynecologist office 2 weeks ago due to pain and he said the pain is my kidneys - he could feel it which is why he did the ultrasound.    The urologist said that the IVP's and MRI's do not show a clear blockage which is why there's the whole wait and see attitude.  But 5 years later I am tired of this pain!  I am afraid of surgery because I also have developed a bleeding disorder and have a tendency to hemorrhage after surgery.  I am afraid of a stent because it didn't last and it was extremely uncomfortable.  When he pulled it out it was covered in crystals and you can just imagine how that felt being pulled through my urethra!  Since the urologist doesn't seem all that concerned, should I see a nephrologist?  I don't want to end up with kidney damage eventually which is what I read can happen.  Is it important that I truly find the cause - or should I just deal with it?  Sorry so lengthy, wanted to make sure you had the whole picture.  Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Kidneypain,  There may be some variation amongst physicians so keep in mind that my answer is my opinion.  I believe that hydronephrosis should be worked up to find the cause.    I would be suspicious of some obstruction or external compression, especially since it started during pregnancy.    Another possible cause is vesicoureteral reflux.  Normally the ureters have valves that prevent urine from flowing backwards up into the ureter and kidney after entering the bladder.  In some people this valve does not work properly allowing urine to reflux back up into the kidney.  If this reflux is severe enough it can cause hydroureter and hydronephrosis.  This can be tested with a study known as a VCUG (voiding cystourethrogram).  Seeing a nephrologist is probably not a bad idea.  Follow up with your urologist is also important.  Best wishes.\n\n",

[b]The pain was so horrible that I ended-up on a duragesic patch (dermal pain patch) to control it.[/b] The Urologist acted like  it was rare to have such pain.  I eventually requested a nephrostomy tube.  Although this sounds horrible and placement wasn't fun (I could not be put under and was pregnant) it was much less painfull in the long run.  There is more risk for infection and there are maintenance and vanity issues (your kidney will drain from your back through a tube into a bag), but it was better than the pain.  Google \"nephrosty tube\" and you will find plenty of information on the procedure.  Good Luck!\n\n",

    "content": "My wife is now on dialysis second time after rejection of her cadaveric kidney which lasted about 5 yrs.  Her nephrologist says that a living donor kidney without any match is better than a cadaveric kidney with many matches.  Before her 1st kidney I was being worked up to donate and a cyst was found on my kidney.  She received a kidney before I could complete testing; the surgeon told me to save mine in case she needed one down the line.  This time I am being worked up again and am told that I cannot donate because of the cysts I have and stones.  (This is same hospital as before but that specific surgeon is now gone.)    I have read that many other transplant centers take kidneys such as mine, remove cysts and stones before transplanting them in recipient.  Is there reason why this center is so conservative with my kidney?  Supposedly I am fine.  dr says they just don't know the long term impact of the cysts on my own kidney and that there would be a chance that down the line, I might be in renal failure.  I would really appreciate some thoughts.  What are the statistics with my situation that it could go bad for me--especially when my wife needs a kidney so bad.  Thanks so much.

    "content": "I am unable to give you any specific statistics, etc. but I can give you a little perspective on why the doctors are being conservative.  There are two main reasons.  1) If your doctor was to take your kidney for her and it were for some reason to develop problems it would put her back in the same position she is in now.  and 2) If they take one kidney from you and your other kidney develops problems you may find yourself in need of dialysis and a transplant as well.    While there is no guarantee that this will occur, if there are some known potential problems with the donor kidney it does increase the risk of the transplant.    Each surgeon decides for themselves what comfort level they have in using various donor kidneys.    Best wishes.\n\n",

I know there are no guarantees and that my wife is fortunate to have had even one opportunity at extending her life.  I recently read that life expectancy on dialysis is about 5 yrs which is about the same as with a transplant.  When you love someone, even when there are so many others with much more misfortune, these statistics are nonetheless very disheartening.  She never ever complains; I am the whiner.

    "content": "There are several possible causes for hematuria (blood in the urine).  Regarding your valtrex, valtrex can cause the platelets to drop.  If you have low platelets the blood cannot clot.  This could cause continued bleeding in the urine.  Kidney stones may also cause blood in the urine.  Even small stones that are not causing pain can cause blood, although frank blood as you are experiencing would be less likely to happen without pain.  Urine infections can also cause pain.  If the bleeding continues you should be evaluated by your doctor.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "prominent column of Bertin",
    "content": "Hello , I am a healthy 23 year old Sonographer. I have had several symptoms in the past 6 months pointing towards lymphoma. I am seeing an ENT for that on Tuesday. I have had severe night sweats for 4 months and 2 months prior to those found enlarged lymph nodes in my neck and suffer from fatigue, which is progressivly getting worse.  Anyway I am writing today because I was scanning my gallbladder because of a recent onset of nausea and noticed that there is a spot on my right kidney. It appears to be a prominent column of Bertin.  I know these are benign and nothing to worry about. I was just wondering if you are born with them or if they can just occur?? I graduated ultrasound school in June of 2006. I was scanned almost every class because my anatomy showed up very well. I know for certain that this was not there in june. Do I need to mention this to the doctor I am seeing for my night sweats, swollen lymph nodes and fatigue? (I am going to an ENT that the Radiologist I work for suggested.)  I guess it could be some kind of mass that just has a very similiar echogenicity to that of the cortex of my kidney. ??  I have yet to mention it to the Radiologist because he has already done so much for me with the lymph nodes and he took some time to go over the CT of my neck with me     -Thanks-\n\n",

    "content": "Sorry for the delay in responding.  Columns of Bertin are considered incidental findings. I'm not aware of how long it can take them to appear. It may also be that the scanning probe was not quite in the right plane to have picked it up previously.  If there is a possibility that the findings you were seeing were not Columns of Bertin you should probably have more imaging studies to better characterize the mass.    Given your symptoms and swollen lymph nodes, there may be an infection in the kidney, or less likely a tumor that has spread to the lymph nodes.  Generally tumors of the kidney do not spread to the lymph nodes of the neck firs so I think this is quite unlikely but should be explored if there is a possibility of this.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "The ibuprofen may be related in a few ways.  First, ibuprofen can alter blood flow to the kidney changing its filtering abilities.  This is especially true if you are dehydrated.  While this may cause acute renal failure, it generally does not produce pain.  Also, ibuprofen has been reported to cause acute interstitial nephritis.  This is essentially a type of allergic reaction to the ibuprofen that leads to a build up of eosinophils in the kidneys.  This can cause some pain as well as renal failure.  There are other possible causes of your pain as well.  Connecting the ibuprofen is likely to be one of the two causes above.  I would recommend that you be evaluated by your doctor if your pain persists.  Also, I would recommend not using the ibuprofen until your pain improves.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I'm 38 yrs female and have family history of diabetes. I am not taking any medication currently. My treshold of pain is quite high.  I have experienced back pain for quite some time. The pain are usually on and off kind of dull acking pain though sometime got sharp pain once in a while. The pain is around my right flank area and also somewhere around my right hand side rib and stomach area.  As I also have slip disk, thus I thought that the pain I experience might be due to the slip disk.  Recently, I observed that my urine has bubbles on it and sometimes there are a lot and sometimes not much. Out of fun, I bought the Multiistix 10 sg.  Following the instruction closely, I got the below results:-  All other turned out negative except the following:- 1st test at 11.30 am ph - 6 blood - trace specific gravity - 1.020 ketone - 5 (trace)  2nd test at 1.00 pm ph - 6 blood - moderate specific gravity 1.030 ketone 5 (trace)  Is there anything serious from the above test? Am I having diabetes too?  Thank you very much for the advice.  starshine\n\n",

    "content": "Your question regarding diabetes cannot be answered for sure with the test strips you are using.  Urine testing for diabetes is generally only a \"clue\" to the possibility and blood work needs to be done to confirm diabetes.  If glucose is found in the urine it suggests that the blood glucose may be high (possibly correlating with diabetes).  It does not appear that your test strips look for glucose.  Having said that, a by-product of not having insulin or having insulin resistance as in diabetes is the production of ketones.  Having only trace ketones makes overt diabetes with diabetic ketoacidosis unlikely.    Specific gravity is a measure of urine concentration.  Totally dilute would be 1.000 and generally the most concentrated a dipstick picks up is 1.030.  From your results I would recommend you drink more fluids.  The pH's are likely normal.  (To be absolutely certain, you would need to have a blood test done at the same time to see what your blood pH is-but this isn't necessary for you at this point from the sounds of things.)  Blood will often show up in the urine of women around their menses (thus not actual blood in the bladder).  One thought about this that I have is the possibility of kidney stones or hypercalciuria (too much calcium in the urine).  This can cause microscopic or overt blood in the urine and can cause flank pain.  Usually kidney stones are severely painful but \"microstones\" or hypercalciuria can also cause pain that is less severe.  This may be something to talk with your doctor about.  Hope this helps some.\n\n",

    "title": "different head pains",
    "content": "I am 32 year old female. I was 2 years old when I had a tumor removed from my top left side of my head. It was not cancer. The doctor also removed a large part of my brain with this (which is what other neuro docs have said from MRI's). I am on no medication for this and never was.  I had migrains for more than 10 years til i figured that caffeine was the cause. for the past couple of years I now have what seems to be tension headachs. I have them daily off and on. I usually try a hot rag to get rid of them but if they are really bad i take some aleve. I also notice about a year ago taht a small spot on my head where my scar is, it sounds hallow. The only way i know to describe it is it sounds like as if i stuck my head under water and scatched my head. I does not hurt to touch it, it just really bothers me. I do not sleep through the night the headaches wake me. other docs do not know what it could be. they have tried many differnt kinds of meds with me and some do nothing and others are not better then the aleve. cat scans and mri's show nothing. I thought maybe stress, so i quit my job. i still hve the pains. My biggest worry is that at night when the headaches come at the bottem of my head and neck area, the top of my head, where my scar is from the surgery, hurts really bad. The pain is on the surface, just the slightest touch hurts. If run my fingers through my hair lighly it hurts. Even the pillow touching that part of my head it hurts. If i sit up for a 10-15 min. the pain on top of my head goes away.  so i guess my question is what could be cause tension headaches? How can i get rid of them? could food allergy be a cause of them? and then the pain on my scar at night. Is it a nerve thing and how do i fix that? It seems to be related to my headachs only when i lay down, should I be worried about this?Please any suggestions would help!\n\n",

    "content": "Headaches that wake a person up from sleep are generally quite concerning for the possibility of a tumor in the head.  It sounds as if your doctors have done the appropriate CT scan and MRI to look for this.  Since the imaging did not show a tumor it is quite unlikely that this is the cause of the headache.  Your description makes it seem as if it more that you are awakened from sleep do to your head touching something and causing pain.  Since the pain hurts when you touch your scalp I am quite suspicious that this is a nerve type pain.  It is possible that some how a nerve that feeds the area of your scalp with pain was damaged somehow and now is extra sensitive.  (That's simplified down a bit and not completely what happens.)    For nerve pain there are a few medications that may help.  It is good that the naproxen (Aleve) helps but it would be good to find a controller medicine so you do not have to take the naproxen continuously.  A medication called gabapentin is sometimes very good at controlling nerve pain.  It was originally a seizure medicine that has been found helpful with some pain conditions.  The trick to this medicine is that it takes a while to fully kick in.  Usually it is started at a low dose which is subsequently increased over several weeks.  Have you tried this medicine already?  If not, you may want to talk to your doctor about it.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  In females, hematuria is common due to the high incidence of urinary tract infection (due to their short urethra). Urinary tract infection is usually associated with burning micturition, frequency and urgency.  Viral infections of the urinary tract and sexually transmitted diseases, particularly in women are common causes.  Other conditions that lead to hematuria include - Kidney and ureteric stones, in which pain (colicky) is usually present and may radiate to the groin and the upper thigh. - Kidney disease, such as nephritis. - Blood disorder which should be evaluated properly in your case. CBC should be done during the hematuria episode as well as tests for bleeding tendency.   - Kidney trauma   Investigations include:  -  Urine tests (urinalysis), in this case not only to check for blood in urine but also for pus cells which if present indicate the presence of infection. Urine Culture is to be considered in this condition. -  Blood tests to check also for infection (leucocytosis) and to rule out any systemic causes of bleeding tendency. -  Abdominal US to visualize the kidney.  Cystoscopy to excluded bladder abnormalities.  - Kidney, ureter and bladder-imaging   with (IV) or without dye stenography or X- ray, if stones is suspected.   Doing your analysis during the menstruation is not advisable as contamination with the menstrual blood is very likely to happen. Tests should not be done after vigorous exercise, or sexual activity. You better avoid as much as possible the frequent intake of NSAID (Motrin) for exclusion and also to avoid renal damage.  Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm really hoping someone can give me some advice ASAP, my friend called me at about 2:30 am, about an hour ago. She told me she has been urinating blood since 11:30, she was fine at 11:00 i knw this because i was with her, She says it is very painful and burns horribly every time she urinates. She says she also sees small blood clots or something after she urinates. She feels nautious and has pain in her stomach area also. She has had a couple urinary tract infections before but hasn't had one for awhile. I did some research because she seems to think it may be another UTI, but its strange because she hasn't been sexually active for about a month. She doesn't think she is dehydrated but she is drinking water; she drank about 32 ounces of water already. She is 15 and may not be able to make it to her doctor's office tomorrow so i'm hoping someone could help me to help her. If theres anything that can be done now to ease her pain it would be much appreciated, happy holidays\n\n",

    "content": "With a past history of UTI's, it is quite possible that this is a UTI as well.  There are several viruses/bacteria that can cause a hemorrhagic cystitis (infection of the bladder).    Is there a possibility of trauma to the kidney's, etc.?  This can also cause bloody urine.  I would suggest evaluation in an urgent care if she cannot get in to see her regular doctor today.  The sooner she is examined and diagnosed, the sooner she can begin treatment if this is a UTI.  By the way, sexual activity is not required for girls to get UTI's, so, unfortunately, this doesn't preclude her from getting another UTI.    While UTI is possible, there are other causes of hematuria so medical evaluation is important.  Keep us updated as to what her progress/diagnosis is.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

However, a microscopic examination of the urine can be done to look for white blood cells if this can be done in the office where she went.  Most offices are not able to do this.  Also, if seen where a urine culture can be sent, this is the best test in this situation.  If her symptoms resolve with the antibiotics, she should follow up with her doctor as needed.  If they do not resolve after 24-48 hours (or at least are on the way to getting better), she should be seen again.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Creatinine clearance normal range: 90\u2013140 milliliters per minute (mL/min).  Low creatinine clearance indicate kidney damage. Kidney damage can reversible or chronic.   Chronic renal damage is diagnosed if the findings that support renal damage persists for more than 3 month after conservative measures.   Damage of the kidney is generally due to either reduced blood flow to the kidneys, or urinary tract blockage.  Indomethacin and NSAID are commonly used medications and can result in reversible renal damage in the majority of chronic users.   Measurement of creatinine clearance with 24-h urine collection is considered as an adequate estimate of GFR.   People with GFR above 60 cc/min are considered to have mild form or renal damage that warrants considering  preventive measures that should be recommended by the nephrologist.\n\n",

Dysautonomia means a disorder of autonomic nervous system (ANS) function, which can be  failure of the sympathetic or parasympathetic components of the ANS or  excessive ANS activities. Dysautonomia can be local, or generalized, as in pure autonomic failure. It can be acute and reversible, or chronic and progressive. Diabetes and alcohol can cause Dysautonomia. Impotence (in men) and fall in blood pressure on standing (orthostatic hypotension) are forms of generalized Dysautonomia. On the other hand, hypertension  and tachycardia ( rapid pulse) are forms of excessive ANS activity. They are not treatable but may be reversible spontaneously if the cause is treated.

    "content": "Dear vze3qdxk,  Thank you very much for using our website.  Development of hypertension in a young person especially if associated with an abdmoinal bruit usually directs the mind towards renal artery stenosis and sparks a battery of investigations to make sure that this young person does not have renovascular hypertension which is a curable form of hypertension. In your case, you went all the way to an angiogram which is the gold standard. This was normal. So, you should not carry the diagnosis of renovascular hypertension anymore.  Essential hypertension means that there is no other cause of hypertension that could be found. This means that there are other causes of hypertension, these are called secondary causes and hypertension then is called secondary hypertension. They constitute about 5% of the all the causes of hypertension.  These usually include disturbances of endocrine glands which secrete hormones. These include the thyroid gland, the adrenal glands and some rare tumours of the pituitary gland (through their effect on the thyroid gland and the adrenal glands).  These constitute only 5% of the causes of hypertension. They have clinical symptoms and signs. Your doctor most probably thought them because you are young but most probably did not think that you needed to be tested for them as you didn't have any of the symptoms or signs of those disorders otherwise he would have tested you for them.  You can always discuss these issues with your doctor and see whether he thinks if it is ok for you to be tested for those disorders or not.  If you don't have any of the secondary causes of hypertension then you have essential hypertension. Essential hypertension patients have a family history in 2/3 of the cases (you have a positive family history). It is also more common in the african american population (i am not sure whether you fit the profile) and it is associated with abdominal bruits as well (as in your case).  Once more, thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

I've been the see the Urologist given my previous history of bi-lateral uretheral reflux which was operated on 5 years ago. He's sent me to have a VCUG done to see if the reflux may have returned; it appears from the X-rays to have not. Three months ago at the start of this, a CT Scan was done, which came up negative.

    "content": "Hey there.  I was doing a search on symptoms I've been having & your post came up & caught my eye because I have almost identical symptoms!  Mine started out with just the back pain on my right side and now I am constantly nauseous, have been randomly vomiting, have absolutely no appetite & have to force myself to eat and have been extremely tired no matter what I do.  I need to go get all of the usual tests done but have been avoiding it thus far due to my horrible luck with doctors in the past.  It's pretty discouraging how much they never help any of my problems or even know what is wrong.  So I was just wondering if you have had any luck with your pain or symptoms or if you've atleast figured out what is causing them.  Any helpful information you could give me would be greatly appreciated!!  This is all really getting to me!!  Thanks.\n\n",

    "title": "Polycystic Kidney Disease",
    "content": "I was diagnosed with a polycystic Kidney in 2001 after experiencing severe pain that started in my left side and ended up in the left lower back area.  A CT Scan with contrast was performed and it was determined that my left kidney was totally engulfed in cysts.  The information I have found on this disease indicates that it is genetic and that it will affect both kidneys.  I also had a problem about 14 years ago with similar symptoms in the same area, but no diagnosis was ever given.  I thought I was passing a kidney stone and the ER staff treated me as such.  As far as I know I have never had a kidney stone.  I recently had another episode of severe pain in my left side and back and was hospitalized for a day.  Another CT scan was performed that showed the same thing as the one in 2001.  Nothing had changed.  It appears as though nothing is wrong with my right kidney and it functions normally.  I have been told by the urologists that the severe pain is caused by a bursted cyst in the left kidney on both occasions.  The Urologist that saw me last told me that the kidney was probably deformed when I was born and that caused the cysts to start growing.  He has told me that the right kidney will probably never have troubles with cysts.  This does not seem consistent with my research on polycistic kidney disease.  Is there more than the three types of polycistic kidney disease I've found literature on, Autosomal Dominant PKD, Autosomal Recessive PKD, and Acquired Cystic Kidne Disease?  Nobody in my family has ever been diagnosed with PKD, nor suffered renal failure.  I am a 37 year old white male, diagnosed at age 34.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Polycystic kidney disease",
    "content": "Dear rjdeal,  i am not a nephrologist, but i think that it is extremely rare to have polycystic kidney disease affecting only one kidney.  You have to follow up with a nephrologist not a urologist. If this is indeed polycystic kidney, you have to have ultrasounds on regular basis to see whether the other kidney is going to be affected or not, to follow up on your kidney functions, follow up on your blood pressure since patients with polycystic kidneys are bound to develop hypertension, you have to have a base line creatinine clearance and may be have a genetic testing. Since patients who have polycystic kidney have brain aneurysms, you have to be investigated for that as well in addition to making sure that there are not any other organs affected by the cysts like the liver or pancreas.  Nephrologists have a greater experience with polycystic kidney disease than urologists and i would recommend that you visit a nephrologist for a better explanation and thus understanding of polycystic kidney disease and for future follow up.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D\n\n",

    "content": "I am 33yr old male. In 1999, I was diagnosed with PKD. I was having severe pain in my side since I was 18 but didn't have insurance and because I am a man, I could live with the pain. 1 week to the day, my dad discovered he also had the disease. Actually, he found out first. He has had high blood pressure that is literally through the roof all of his life. It is odd now looking back that the doctors never figured out what he had. Growing up, my dad went through a lot of pain and agony with so many tests and all it took for me was a simple urine test. I am not sure why I am writing this. When I was first diagnosed, I was told in 2 years I would need a kidney transplant.After 2 years have past, they said it would be 5. I have found out that there is not much known other than everything that comes along with PKD. It is a pretty long list. Funny thing is, when I was ready to stop fighting, I met my future wife who has been my rock when I can't be.  I am not one to reach out and say I am hurting. My wife hates that. I have very different symptoms than my father does. I do have very high blood pressure. I have cysts on my Kidneys, Heart, and Liver. I am always exhausted, but I decided a long time ago, nothing was going to stop me from whatever I wanted to do. So, I stopped caring about what happened to me and am living life the way I want to. Sure I am in pain often but I have found out that attitdue is the cure to fighting this disease. I don't dwell on why. I just live. I watch my dad and he has horrible pain. From Gout to Highblood pressure, which has a lot to do with attitude, I notice that if he is happy, there is no pain. If he or I are stressed the pain comes. This in turn drives my mom and my wife nuts because we know there isn't time to be picky about what people think.  My dad has nearly lost most of one of his kidney functions and that in turn does worry me. Not to the point that I am watching my own demise but knowing that my mom has to watch my dad go through this and knowing her son will too. I couldn't imagine what my mom is feeling after 34 yrs of marriage to my dad.  I know this has dragged on but I want everyone to know that you need to be checked for this disease. The earlier you catch it, the better it can be monitored. That is the key.\n\n",

    "content": "In November of 2003 we had to go into the ER to get re-hydrated due to he and I getting food poisoning. He wasn't in DKA, I just am always on top of his care so he doesn't end up in DKA when ill. There at the ER the doc did some routine labs on my son results are as follows: Hemoglobin 14.7 High Granulocytes 93.8% high Lymphocyte  4.1% Low Band 2 Low Neutrophils  90 High Chloride  97 Low Glucose 336 High do to illness BUN 19 High BUN/CREAT Ratio 32 High  He was givien fluids, he ate after about an hour, then we went home.. He did very well  Then we ended up back into the hospital in ICU over night in Jan 04. He was non responsive to insulin, and basically we found that he was in need of more insulin than he had originally been on. So he did well over night we got new dosage and went home. But approx. 4 days prior to being put into hospital he had been having pain in abdomen so my husband took him in and they found a trace of blood in his urine, but they weren't real concened about it. Now here are the labs that were run in the hospital in Jan: Chloride 96 LOw MetHb  1.60 High p02 70.00 low HC03 26.6 High BUN 23 High Creatinine 0.5 Low B/C Ratio 46 high  now being the mother that I am with him i worry about everything going on in his little body, and try to keep up with everything so he doesn'tend up with prob's down the road. Now he has it seems like on some of these tests risen in lab values. BUN and BUN/Creat Ratio, kidney wise is there anything that we need to be looking for with him that could be going on. He has been diabetic now for 3 yrs. These were the only times since dx's that he ever had to go into the hospital for anything. now his urine usually is clear, but he does foam up some.??? not sure what that means. Do we need to look into the BUN thing anymore or is this normal with them rising? Thank You for your time\n\n",

    "title": "Newly diagnosed! Many questions!",
    "content": "Hello,  I'm hoping you can answer some of my questions. I'll try to be as brief and to the point as I can.  I just received a call from my gynecologists office, telling me that my Creatinine level is 1.62 and my Urea Nitro level is 29. When I calculate the GFR, the score is 36. From what I can tell, this puts me in Stage 3, kidney disease. She drew these levels based on my dexascan score which was -2.0. (I guess -2.5 is standard). I am 48, and had a total hysterectomy in 2000 secondary to endometriosis. She is following me as being post-menopausal. I have also been taking Prednisone for a year to control pain from recently diagnosed Polymyalgia Rheumatica. I have been on 20 mg for quite some time, and have tapered now to 5mg and am trying to get off completely. This was diagnosed clinically by my Neurologist as all the blood tests that would have typically been high were normal, i.e. Sed rate and so forth. The Prednisone, of course, dramatically improved my symptoms. Anyway, we would have thought that the Prednisone is the culprit for the abnormal dexascan, but my Dr. always covers all the bases with other workups. I will be seeing her this coming Thursday, the 10th, and am anticipating her referring me to a nephrologist.  One of my questions is this: I know that as of Nov '03 when I was doctoring with the PMR, my Creatinine was 1.1, and the Urea Nitro was 18. Based on these levels and what they are now, is this the pace of progression I can expect before I end up at Stage 4? This is all so new and shocking, and I wonder what would have happened had she not done this workup? I know I don't urinate as much as normal, but thought that this might be something to do with all the meds I'm on, and I don't drink as many fluids as I should, and also my urine can be strong at times, but I attributed that to the same thing, and that the Vit B-Complex I take causes the same signs.   2nd question: Do most patients have to wait until their kidney functions drop pretty low before starting dialysis..........I heard 10 percent. Could  you receive a kidney from a living donor perhaps at my stage or early stage 4 to avoid dialysis? I know that people on dialysis lead normal lives, working and so forth, but with the 3 to 4 hours a day 3 times a week, I can't see where working full time is possible. I am very fortunate to work in MN, in health care, where in the building I work just a few floors down, is the Transplant Center, and one of the big names in the field!  Well, this isn't as short as I anticipated, but I guess that can be difficult to avoid when you are new! Oh, I also  have a history of seizure disorder since age 10, this has been under control since Aug '95.  Thanks for taking the time to read this...........I'll be looking forward to your reply!  Sincerely, Brina\n\n",

I  am surprised your gynecologist didn't recommend it with those kidney scores.  Don't think in terms of transplants/dialysis yet-they are not desirable alternatives.  A nephrologist is MUCH better qualified to give you an opinion and possibly help preserve your kidney function depending on what is causing the kidney failure.  Good luck.\n\n",

It started one night 3 years ago and after 2 hours it went away. 6 months later again one evening the same thing and 6 months after it came back and has never gone away. I went to A&E and I was given an X-Ray which showed that I had 1 big stone lodged in the tube to my bladder. I was told I needed surgery to remove it. I asked if I could have Lithotripsy instead but was told I couldn\u2019t due to my pelvis being in the way. I also had a Urine infection that would not clear up and was given antibiotics for that.  I had the surgery under General Anesthetic and woke up with bad news. I was told they could not grip it and that it was stuck to the wall of the tube and that I needed to have Lithotripsy. I was fuming because I had gone through the whole surgery for nothing. I had Lithotripsy and it was sorted. I now believe that this stone was found by luck and that there is something else wrong as I still have these pains that are constantly there and now on both sides. I was sent for an Ultrasound Scan which showed that the tissue surrounding my left Kidney was extremely thinner then my right. I was not told what this would mean. I was given a follow up appointment and the Doctor said the stone is gone now you are fine. I told him the pains have nothing to do with that stone and he sent me for a pelvic and abdomen CT Scan. I am waiting to be called for the results. I have now started to get pains in my chest and severe heartburn. Please can you tell me what could be wrong so I can take this to my Doctors and tell them to rule these possibilities out. I am desperate.\n\n",

    "content": "I had Echerichia Colli in my urine and it lead to severe kidney pain, high body temperature and I was therefore hospitalized for two weeks. My diagnosis was 'acute pielonephritis'. After being under medical control for 2 months I had negative urine results and no pain. One year later I had Echerichia again with the same symptoms and again ended up in a hospital. I was taking antibiotics and Vit. C for almost 2 months. 4 months have passed since then and I again have Echerichia Colli in my urine. At the moment I don't have pain in my kidneys but I'm afraid that if it happens again it might become chronic and will again lead to great pain and fever. My questions are: - how does it get into my urine (I know the bacteria lives in the intestines, but I take great care about hygiene) - how can I permanently get rid of it ? - on what temperature does the bacteria get killed. I'm asking this b/c I'm afraid I might catch it while waxing my bikini line at a beautician. The waxing is done with hot wax so I don't know if the bacteria survives the hot temperature.

    "content": "Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is a measure of how well your kidneys  are filtering wastes from your blood. Your GFR  is estimated from a routine measurement of creatinine in your blood.  Creatinine is a waste product formed by the normal breakdown of muscle cells. Healthy kidneys take creatinine out of the blood and put it into the urine to leave the body. When kidneys are not working well, creatinine builds up in the blood.  GFR of 87  is normal, based on the limited info you have provided  However, as we get  older, the average GFR number drops. Low GFR with a value below 60 suggests some kidney damage has occurred. This means that your kidneys are not working at full strength.  GFR IS VERY IMPORTANT NUMBER as the doctor use it to as one clue to how well your kidneys are working. Your doctor will also look at other factors, including:protein (albumin) in your urine ,diabetes , and high blood pressure   Depending on these factors, your doctor may decide that you have chronic kidney disease. If you have chronic kidney disease, controlling your diabetes or high blood pressure can help prevent more damage to your kidneys and other problems like heart attacks and strokes.  hope that helps.  thank you\n\n",

    "content": "Chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) is a condition in which the kidneys gradually lose their ability to perform their normal functions, such as the removal of wastes and extra fluid from the body.This means that they lose the ability to excrete wastes, concentrate urine, and conserve salt and water.   With reduced kidney function, there may be a certain amount of clinical and sub-clinical fluid retention in the body, due to poor elimination of fluids and poor control of sodium. Perhaps more importantly, the kidneys are a major component in the body's regulation of blood pressure. As such, the kidneys have their own ability to raise blood pressure via release of a hormone called renin. Release of renin triggers a cascade of events all over the body which eventually cause constriction of the blood vessels (vasoconstriction). This cascade of events is called the renin-angiotensin-system, or RAS for short. When the kidneys sense that the glomeruli (the actual filters in the kidneys) are not getting the blood perfusion that they need (this means good, adequate blood flow within the glomeruli), they cause release of more renin, and blood pressure is eventually raised throughout the body. Since chronic kidney disease does affect blood perfusion within the glomeruli, chronic kidney disease is almost always accompanied by hypertension to some extent, even if there is no fluid retention. Some high blood pressure medications work by inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-system specifically, and these are therefore most effective in the context of chronic kidney disease.  GFR OF 87 reflects a mild form of chronic kidney disease, the main point is to control your blood pressure and have freqquent checkups with your doctor.  AGAIN , this is important because the kidneys play important role in regulation of the blood pressure as they are responsible for sodium and water homeostasis. preservation of renal function is very important for controling blood pressure or hypertension. Meanwhile , controling bolod pressure is very important for the prevention of further kidney damage.  overall, since GFR  is a reflection of kidney function, and having said that CRI is a form of mild kidney disease (GFR OF 87), GFR will increase as the kidney function deteriorates.  thank you and hope that helps.\n\n",

My creatinine level was 405.1 mg/dl (normal is 27-260) and my protein level was 33 (normal is 0-30).  My blood creatine level was normal:  1.1 (normal 0.7-1.5).  I did exercise (cardio and weights) about an hour prior to giving my urine sample and had not had anything to drink in about 2 hours, so I may have been a bit dehydrated.  The purpose of my blood and urine test was to qualify for a life insurance policy.  The insurance agency did not see any problems with the tests and granted the policy.  I was just a bit worried about the abnormal creatinine.  From what I have read, it sounds like it may be related to muscle mass and working out prior to the test, but I just wanted to confirm.  Thanks.\n\n",

I was staying moist in the perineal area and asked for a u/a check in the physician's office on Monday.  I don't know all of the results, but the physician did state that I had protein in my urine and started me on Bactrim DS BID for a UTI.  My question is a two part question.  First, what is the significance of protein in the urine --- what could it be an indicator of in light of having multiple UTIs this past year (probably 5 or 6 since last November)  Second, In April of this year, I was diagnosed with Bilateral pulmonary embolisms (blood clots of ths lungs) secondary to  a Protein S deficiency.  Would there be any correlation to a hematological protein S deficient while having too much protein in my urine?  I'm not sure if these two type of proteins are related or not. It's just a hypothetical question in case there could be a correlation.  I'm not familiar with all the different kinds of proteins the body has.  Thanks for taking the time to answer thise questions for me.\n\n",

Conditions that may cause ketones in the urine are diabetes, malnutrition, alcoholism, illness, etc. Essentially production of ketones could be attributed to one of these conditions. Protein is not a usual finding in the urine. Fever, kidney disorders, pregnancy, strenuous exercise, etc. may produce protein in the urine. Some people may have traces of protein in the urine for unexplainable reasons. I would suggest that if your diet is normal and you do not use alcohol that you inquire with your physician about testing for diabetes etc. to identify the causative factor.  Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

When the nutrition requirements are less than a person's food intake the body begins using it's own stores in an attempt to halt starvation. Malnutrition can be very serious as initial signs or symptoms may be slow to appear but once they become apparent damage can already be done. My first suggestion is improve your diet. A healthy diet will provide your body with energy to function without causing weight gain. You need adequate fluid intake/water to keep you body hydrated. I would suggest that if your physician is not aware that your dietary habits are less than adequate you discuss this with him/her to find a healthy approach. Malnutrition or starvation is not the answer. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

Can someone PLEASE tell me what these test results may mean? She said that I had chronic renal insuff., but didn't tell me much after that. I've got 3 children and I'm in my mid thirties.  It's been almost a year since I met with the neph., and I've noticed a couple of things that she said to watch out for.  On just a few occasions I've had high BP and swelling in my feet and hands.

    "content": "The issues you describe are things you should sit down and discuss with your Dr. , especially if this information is a year old. Because you have noticed your BP to be elevated at times and you are possibly retaining fluid in your hands and ankles, you should be seen. You may want to meet with your Primary first, since you should always keep them in the loop with your overall care. You should make another appointment with your nephrologist and let them know you specifically want time to discuss the information given to you. It is quite possible you will be scheduled for tests again to do a comparison with last years findings. Make sure you write down all your questions before you go so you don't forget any of them. Your primary may also be able to help you with your questions. To answer some of them here, resistive indices are assigned to your kidneys through ultrasound. There are \"normal\" ranges which are frequently associated with .70 or less. Higher can mean obstructions. But these numbers can vary with each patient which is why you should discuss it with your nephrologist. Ask him/her what changes may occur over the next few years and what you can expect. Chronic Renal Insufficiency means that your kidneys are not functioning to their normal filtering capacity and may decrease in time. (the amount of time can be many years) Again, this is something you want to monitor and discuss with your Dr how frequently you should be seen - yearly, twice a year, ect. Best wishes.  nys1emt\n\n",

    "content": "Hi worried mom here - sorry it took a few days to answer; my connection was down..    Diminished parenchyma bilaterally - parenchyma refers to the functional part of an organ - thus diminished means functioning less than it should - bilaterally means both sides.   I know you are probably feeling discouraged having gone to your primary and feeling like you didn't need to go and wasted your money - BUT - here's the deal why it is important to go...when you go to the nephrologist, usually one of the first things they want to know is if you have been seen by your primary recently. Your nephrologist CANNOT be responsible for your standard care and medications. If you had required BP meds, or any other meds for that matter (cholesterol meds, arthritis meds, ect), only your primary is usually responsible to prescibe these things. These are things the nephrologist needs to know in case they have to prescibe meds as well to make sure they do not give you anything that will interact with what you are already taking. Any tests you had, you should request that your primary fax copies to the nephrologist and also the ones you have from them should be copied to your primary. This way they are both involved in your care and you get the best of both worlds.  nys1emt\n\n",

Do hormone levels have a factor in my creatin levels? My testosterone level is 102.

    "content": "Serum creatinine level or /and \"creatinine clearance\" are different ways of determining kidney function.  Creatinine is a protein produced by muscle and released into the blood. The amount produced is relatively stable in a given person. The creatinine level in the serum is therefore determined by the rate it is being removed, which is roughly a measure of kidney function.   If kidney function deteriorates, you will see the creatinine level will rise.  normal creatinine levels are 0.5-1.5 mg/dL   There is a relationship which exists between Diabetes Mellitus and raised creatinine levels. Usually this situation arises when DM is chronic and uncontrolled.,  this situation is called as diabetic nephropathy meaning kidney disease due to DM. Initially this presents as protein in urine but as the disease progresses creatinine level goes up. This type of kidney failure is irreversible and these patients need dialysis and renal transplant.  glucovance (metformin) should not be used if creatinine is greater is elevated .  the main point is to control diabetes to prevent further complications, such as end stage renal disease, and over all kidney problems including infections.  hope that helps\n\n",

    "content": "Currently I am participating in Drug Court due to an unfortuate situation where I was in the wrong place at the wrong time.  To complete and graduate out of this program,  I had to participate in a drug rehab program, test weekly for ANY kind of drugs (Alcohol included) for six months with NO positive test results.  I have finished my rehab program and complied completely with everything the court has requested.  To date, I have had NO positive drug tests.  However, just as I was about to graduate from this program,  the Judge threw me in jail for 2 days and made me start all over again for having a low Creatine level (20.5mg/dL).  She (the judge) accused me of flushing my system with large amounts of water.  Something I most certainly did not do.  I was shocked.  Six weeks later she remanded me to jail again for having an 18.5 level.  I tried to tell her  that I didn't do what she was accusing me of but to no avail.  Again, I had to start my program all over again.  I have no medical ins. or doctor but I did go to an Urgent Med Clinic and questioned this and why it was happening.  The doctor there told me it could be because I drink iced tea daily and said to cut back.  But she also discovered that I had  hypertension and put me on Propanolol 40mg.  I went back to court this last week and almost got thrown in jail a third time because my Creatine level was 20.5 on my last test.  The judge's cutoff is 20.0 and under.  She will not accept anything I say and continues to accuse me of flushing my system.  She's now ordered me to get counseling on Creatine levels and why they mean that I'm flushing my system.  I am totally frustrated and depressed because I have not been drinking large amounts of water like she claims.  I don't drink water at all.  If I try to tell her that, she accuses me of lying to the court and is threatening me with being remanded to jail again.  I don't know what to do.  I can't control my Creatine level and never know each time I drug test if it's going to get me thrown in jail again.  I can control the abstinance from any drugs but what's up with this Creatine garbage.  Even when it's in her acceptable range, it's still only around 38.3 mg/dL and she considers that suspicious.  What's wrong with me?  I am worrying myself sick.   I'm under extreme stress about this, which plays havoc with my blood pressure.  Help!!!!\n\n",

    "title": "Mass Producing Kidney Stones",
    "content": "Please help!!!   I am 29 years old and have had diagnosed kidney stones since age 18 (1993).  My kidney stones have occurred approximately one episode per year until June 2003.  Last year I was diagnosed with a 3 cm x 3 cm kidney stone (the size of a hen's egg!!).  I underwent 10+ lithotripsies from June 2003 to November 2003.  I also had a right uretal stent placement in June 2003.  In July 2003, I was admitted to the hospital for stent obstruction, my right kidney shut down, and staph infection.  My urologist removed the stent and put in a nephrostomy tube, which I proceeded to have 3 more throughout the 2003 year.  I also had 3 uretoscopic surgeries for stone removal.  I finally passed all the fragments of this large stone in November but have proceeded to have multiple UTIs, including staph infection again in June 2004 and e.coli infection of the kidneys in November 2004 with a hospitalization.  I also had a PICC line in June with Vancomycin administered at home for a month after release from the hospital.  I have continued to mass produce kidney stones in both the left and right kidney, but more prominently in the right.  I have been ultimately bedridden for the last 18 months with severe chronic right flank pain, nausea, vomiting frequently, and steady UTIs every month for which I have been on every imagineable antibiotic for the last 18 months.  My thyroid has been checked, which has been normal, I have severe heat intolerance, and have chronically been on narcotics for 18 months for the right flank pain in my lower back and abdominal area.  I have been evaluated by a nephrologist who has offered no help.  He changed my diet, but I have still mass produced stones.   My stones are oxylate and calcium based and my stones have been sent off numerous times to the labs with no additional help offered.  I strain my urine on a daily basis and pass fragments of stones almost daily.  I require visits to the emergency room on a monthly basis for severe pain.  My urologist has just basically treated the symptoms but is at a standstill as to what is the underlying cause of my problems.  I am looking beyond treating just the symptoms and I want to find out why I am producing stones so much.  I am too young to be having so many problems with my right kidney.  I was a very active person in athletics and exercise until June of 2003 and have basically been disabled since.  I am unable to drive myself anywhere without severe pain and am limited to any physical activity such as house cleaning, working a regular 9 to 5 job, etc. due to weakness, nausea, and pain.  I can barely take a shower daily without having to lie down afterwards.  Please help me with suggestions of possibly a different type of doctor to evaluate me or tests that could be done to find the underlying cause.  Each time I have a urinalysis (which is usually on a bi-weekly basis), I have protein, nitrites, and blood in my urine without fail.  Any help you can offer would be greatly appreciated.  I have done in depth research on the internet for my symptoms but my symptoms are related to so many different disorders that I don't know where to begin making suggestions to my doctor.  I just want to get well!!!  I am currentlly diagnosed with mass nephrolithiasis, bilateral hydronephronsis, and recurrent urinary tract infections.  Thank you so much in advance for your medical expertise and suggestions. Angela\n\n",

    "content": "my sister has a niece with recurring kidney problems and her doctor told her to drink lemonade daily (fresh, of course). it's better than cranberry. she says it has helped alot. i used to make kidney stones quite regularly-i started at 12 and almost lost my kidney as a result. no one ever figured out why-but i do know this: after i eliminated most of the calcium from my diet-i stopped making stones. mine were mostly composed of uric acid and calcium from what the doctor told me. i didn't eliminate the calcium on purpose-just after i found out that  they were made from that (and i made 2 stones during my pregnancy with my son-all that calcium floating around, i thought), i just developed a distaste for milk. hope the lemonade helps-i know it won't hurt to try. good luck, i really hope you find the solution to your problems.\n\n",

    "content": "Try this. It got rid of my dad's stones completely and I just started to see results myself. He told me to get some Poly Citra syrup which causes the urine to go from acid to alkaline. This changes the chemistry which allows stones to form. I hardly ever take drugs, even aspirin, so I carefully checked out the side effects of this stuff which are real minimal, and rare. I asked the pharmacist if I could just take an antacid or something and she said this stuff was a lot stronger and more effective. My urologist and my family doctor had never heard of this stuff, because that brand name is the Canadian version. It has a different US name. I felt better just taking 3 teaspoons of this stuff, so I decided to check out my PH (acid vs alkaline) level. I bought some test paper at Whole Foods, and sure enough I tested on the highest end of the acid scale. I was producing a small stone every 3 days or so. I have had stone problems for twenty years. I even sleep better now.\n\n",

    "content": "A BUN/creatinine ratio can help your health professional predict which conditions, such as dehydration, may be causing abnormal BUN and creatinine levels and decreased kidney function.  As for the normal values it depends on the age. For infants younger than 1 year the BUN/creatinine ratio normally reaches up to 1:30. For anyone older than 12 months it is normal in the range from 1:10 up to 1:20.  High BUN/creatinine ratios occur with sudden (acute) kidney failure, which may be caused by conditions such as shock or severe dehydration. An obstruction in the urinary tract (such as from a kidney stone) can cause an elevated BUN/creatinine ratio. A very high BUN/creatinine ratio may be caused by bleeding in the digestive tract or respiratory tract. A low BUN/creatinine ratio may be associated with a diet low in protein, a severe muscle injury called rhabdomyolysis, pregnancy, cirrhosis, or syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). SIADH sometimes occurs with lung disease, cancer, diseases of the central nervous system, and the use of certain medications.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Doctors,  I am a 52 yr old boat repairer that got addicted to crack cocaine.  I succesfully completed a 28 day residential rehab.  I am in the local Drug Court program because of a possession charge.  I am randomly tested for drug use and have now twice been acused of \"dilluting\" or \"dillution\" ??  I have ceased using drugs (including legal drugs) since April.  I asked the lab tech that performs the urine analysis what is measured or what is the finding in my urine that is dilluted??  He said this.  \" There are a million things you can put in your body to mask your drug use.  I tested your urine 3 times and every test showed no creatinine.  Creatinine loss is the proof that you introduced some kind of masking product and that is what we call a dillution.  We know you are using and consider a test with no creatinine positive.\"  I asked if there are any foods I could be eating or drink that could lower my creatine to which he replied \"NO\"  I asked if there was an illness or physical condition that could lower my creatinine and again \"NO\".  I read an article that suggested that individuals creatine levels vary and a blood test or repeated blood tests are the only method to establish an individuals creatine and once ones natural levels are known, only then could drug testing measuring creatinine level against normal (for the individual) be valued as ??possible?? use.  I am being sanctioned severely for dilluted tests and don't known what to stop doing or start doing to stay out of trouble.  I take nothing to mask drug use that isn't occurring!!!!

Does anyone know what is wrong with him please? It kinda sound like prostate problems, but he is too young. He's only 15 yrs old....also, he lost like 8 lbs. in 3 weeks. He is 5'4\" and weighs 101 lbs. He's on alot of meds, ritalin, luvox, and zyprexa. Wondering maybe if the meds are causing this.

    "content": "Hi,  The levels you quote suggest that you are referring to Creatinine , and not Creatine kinase.  Creatinine is a protein produced by muscle and released into the blood.  The amount produced is relatively stable in a given person and the level in the serum is therefore determined by the rate it is being removed. It is an important marker of kidney function. Normal range for healthy adults is 0.4-1.2mg/dl.  The level of serum creatinine is usually elevated in acute and chronic renal failure.   If kidney function falls, the creatinine level rises. Very muscular persons, such as weight lifters may have a higher creatinine level, which is normal for them.  I hope this information is helpful.   Dr Anthony Solomon MB BS DTM&H DIP.VEN FRSM\n\n",

    "content": "My Grandfather is in his late 60's, which to me is still young.  His father will be 95 this year and is still alive, well, and living 100% on his own.    In 1982, my grandfather under went quadruple bypass surgery.  Everything was fine until late 2003, he went into the hospital with Heart Failure.    He has been told that he has Congestive Heart Failure, by early 2004 he was back in the hospital again.  Apparently this time, we almost lost him.  His blood pressure and blood oxygen both stayed extremely low.  Through medication and a 2 month stay in ICU, his vitals improved, his organs began to respond.  They gave him a pacemaker to help his heart.  I am not sure of all of the medications he is on, but I know that he goes to the hospital once a week for Infusion.  This trip to the hospital, they almost removed his Galbladder due to inflamation -- but as they were prepping him for surgery, they some how managed to figure out that it was his heart --   He made one more trip to the hospital in late 2004 for a couple of weeks, but I honestly don't know why they kept him that long.  He seemed to be doing well and all of his vitals were o.k..    Now we're in May of 2005, he went back to the hospital after several days of nausea and no appetite.  The doctors tell him that they are going to keep him for a week to observe him while making changes to his medication.    This afternoon my grandmother told me that his creatinine level is at a 3.8 -- apparently that is high and a strong indication that his kidney's are not performing properly.  But the kidney doctor also said that the high level could be due to a medication - lasics - (i hope that I spelled that right) that they are giving him to pull fluid retention from his body.  What are the odds of this being true?  Does it sound like he is degressing at a rapid rate or is there any real way of knowing.  I've spoken to doctors and looked around on the Internet, all that I get is conflicting information -- \"PLEASE HELP\" -- we really want to know how strong his chances of survival could be ----  Thanks,  Lucas\n\n",

    "content": "It is possible that you misunderstood the nephrologist (kidney specialist).  LASIX  (if that is what you intended to spell), is a diuretic with the generic name of furosemide. It does not cause an increased level of creatinine. Creatinine is one of the markers of kidney function, and elevations in level are usually as a result of acute or chronic renal failure.   There are various untoward effects of lasix but the common side-effects are lowered levels of potassium, sodium, magnesium and chloride; low blood pressure; elevations in the blood levels of uric acid, glucose and lipids; less commonly gastrointestinal disturbances.    In spite of its side-effects, it is a useful drug in left heart failure as well as in oliguria due to renal failure.   I cannot comment on the prognosis because there a lot of factors to take into account. At this stage, he should be under the care of a nephrologist and cardiologist.

I have not previously had any problems with this medication.  However, about a year ago, I began experiencing extreme fatigue, inflexibility in my muscles, constipation, feeling cold, etc.  I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism and prescribed Synthroid.  While I've had some relief, I still feel very tired (sleep at least 8 - 9 hours per night, and still fall asleep driving) and still have extreme tightness in my muscles, constipation, etc.  My thyroid levels are normal, but my potassium was just found to be slightly low.  That diagnosis makes sense, because I am fatigued, and my heart rate has been quite high (i.e. wore a heart rate monitor during a 1/2 marathon and AVERAGED 178 bpm).    The doctor wants to prescribe potassium supplements, but I'm wary.  I've read that taking potassium supplements while on a potassium-sparing diuretic can be dangerous.  You should also know that I am very active (run about 5 hours per week), and I eat a quite a lot of bananas and mandarin orange slices.  Do my symptoms seem indicative of low potassium?  Should I be concerned about taking potassium supplements with the Amiloride?\n\n",

These three amino's are used by the body to build proteins and have to be taken in with our diets because our bodies can't make them by itself. Has your daughter been sick lately or had some type of stress on her body? Ask her Doctor about MAPLE SYRUP URINE DISEASE, it affects babies but sometimes children can have mild symptoms that respond to large doses of thiamine. Your Doctor is probably right on top of what ever is causing this but don't be afraid to ask questions and make sure you understand the answers, this just came to my mind.\n\n",

    "content": "In the last 12 months my husband has had a few health issues. They first started with his high blood pressure and high cholestrol. When they did the blood test for Cholestrol they found that he had high levels of creatine (approximately 6 times the normal amount) so they made him do a urinary test over a couple of days and from which they discovered the creatine was about 12 times the normal amount. My husband also suffers from severe cramping which they thought this may be related to the high creatine, but however after going to a rhematologist and nephrologist and having more blood taken and also a biopsy done on his right arm and left leg they found nothing to explain the creatine or cramping. (During this time he had his sleeping pattern checked and we found out that he has mild narcalepsy, not sure if this is related to anything though). Anyway, since the doctors can not find anything and such a large amount of time has passed since the initial tests were completed as some doctors do they forget and don't take enough interest in the problems. Anyway to get to the point finally, my husband vomits fairly regularly at least 1 day a month he will vomit at any time and it can come on quite rapidly and sometimes he has vomiting, nausea over a couple of days. This is what he is going through at the moment, to which the doctor (not knowing any of his previous medical history) put it down to gastro. I would please like to know if very high levels of creatine can cause the vomiting and nausea and what a plan of action should we to go to our doctor with, we have just moved town and are looking for a permanent doctor at the moment, i am concerned that there is something more to all of his health issues however convincing the doctors that we have been to is a difficult task. If you can help in anyway at all it would be greatly appreciated. (sorry about the spelling mistakes).\n\n",

It seems to be nervous system related, as I get much tingling, burning, numbness, etc all over the place...among other problems like fatigue, eye troubles, frequent urinating...and even more.  Anyways, 3 MRI's have shown nothing, I seem to be otherwise fine.  I am sorta feeling better I guess, it seems to be terribly slow progress.  Anyways, my urine has been all over the place the whole time but most recently, last 2 months, it has been hardly yellow at all, if not at all.  Any thoughts on what could be going on to cause this?  Am I not properly flushing something like waste from my blood?  As for my liquid consumption, maybe slightly more than when I was healthy 7 months ago, can't see how that would be it.  My frequency isn't as bad as it used to be at the beginning, maybe 3-4 times a day now.  Thanks for your help.  Matt\n\n",

I give him a spot when he needs it, and likewise. Recently, in order to help his muscles build, he has been drinkin that supplementary creatin powder. He recommends it to me, and i must say, his results are amazing. He weighs 135 lbs. and can bench press almost 200 lbs. He is rather short for his age, being about 5' 8\". I am also 18, but i weigh about 175 lbs. and can bench about my weight. What I want to know is whether there are any side-effects or long-term side effects to taking this supplement. I have always used natural protein (i.e. fish, chicken, peanuts) and have never had any serious sickness. There was one time, when i was about 14, when I had low blood levels, but that was due to overdose of asprinin. Anyways, I've never had any serious problems with my body that might add to any possible side-effects that takin the \"natural supplement\" might have. Thank you!\n\n",

This has not been proven but possible conditions that are more likely during creatine use are muscle cramps, electrolyte imbalance etc. What I've personally observed in some people that use this supplement is after usage is discontinued, the amazing muscle mass that was apparent during use disappears.......something I would take into consideration. I would be more inclined to suggest eating healthy and genuinely building muscle mass. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Vicki, Hydronephrosis is defined as a dilation of the renal pelvis and calyces. This happens in response to the interruption of the flow of urine. That is, once something obstructs the flow of urine the backpressure causes the expansion of the ureter (hydroureter) and the kidneys (hydronephrosis).  Causes of this condition are many, basically anything that obstructs the outflow of urine either from inside such as kidney stones (common) and blood clots, tumors etc... or from outside such as lymph node enlargement or tumors or even pregnancy compressing the ureter from outside.  A search for a possible cause is mandatory. This would require other imaging modalities such as pyelography and or magnetic resonance imaging.  Prognosis and outcome depends on the cause and the delay in receiving proper therapy which may include surgical relief of obstruction. You must be referred to a urologist asap. Any delay can lead to irreversible loss of renal function.   Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Creatinine is a product of muscle metabolism produced at a relatively constant rate and excreted through the kidneys. With stable renal function, creatinine production and excretion are equal, therefore serum concentration remains within a normal range. This is usually 0.4 \u2013 1.2 mg/dl. Serum creatinine value is only a rough guide of renal function because fifty per cent loss of renal function is needed before the serum creatinine level rises above the normal range. Creatinine clearance is a more accurate assessment of renal function, and it is advisable to undergo this test.    A person\u2019s meat intake and muscle mass affect creatinine levels. Certain drugs also increase creatinine levels. These are known as nephrotoxic medications and your physician will ensure that they are not prescribed for you.   Poor cardiac function, vascular disease of the kidneys,  hypertension and diabetes are very important aetiological factors in kidney disease. Your profile suggests that you suffer from these conditions.  In order to prevent further deterioration in kidney function, diabetes and hypertension must be well controlled.   I note that your prescriptions also include \"Lipitor\" and \"Plavix\".  Lipitor is indicated for prevention of coronary artery disease by reducing total cholesterol level; Plavix  inhibits thrombosis. Both drugs are important after your double bypass surgery. Regular daily exercise, a healthy diet (prescribed by renal and diabetic dieticians), and a body mass index within the normal range are additional measures to prevent deterioration of kidney function.  I hope this information has been helpful. Thank you for contacting this website.   Dr Anthony Solomon MB BS DTM&H DIP.VEN FRSM Consultant Physician, Tropical & Genitourinary Medicine\n\n",

I have found tons of information on creatinine clearance tests which require a 24 hour urine sample.  My sample was a single, one-time \"donation\".  My blood was also tested for creatinine level and was reported as .9 ml/dl, within normal ranges.  I'd like to find out about the one-time urine test for creatinine levels, and the implications of a 402.7 mg/dl result.  Any response or referral to information source is greatly appreciated.  Thanks! Jon\n\n",

Upon examination by her physician,  muscle weakness of several muscles was detected. My aunt describes her muscles tingling, burning and numbness in her left hip and leg as well as occasional blurred vision. Her doctor sent her to the nearby medical center for further tests. An MRI revealed lesions on some of her nerves and a lumbar puncture indicated that there was protein in her CSF.  I am a pre-med student.  She told me to figure it out and refuses to talk about until I have done research.  I have looked and searched; i just can't figure it out. She told me there 3 posible clinical problems that could be the answer, but i have spend days and I cant find a list of symptoms that fit.  I know eventually I will have to figure this stuff out on my own, but i'm only in my first year....PLEASE HELP...\n\n",

Our responsibility lies with the patient, as you know from being a med student.  From the way you describe I suspect she knows (or has been told)  what is wrong, and I guess, so do some others of us in the forum I do not doubt.  In this case it would be wrong of us to discuss the matter on this forum.  If on the other hand she had some uncertainty about the diagnosis, and it her that needs the help then I can help.  For your research a search on the internet for \"csf\" \"protein\" \"weakness\" and this will will give you the diagnosis.  Regards  Saif\n\n",

I have had one episode of wetting the bad a couple of years back.  Mostly i am in alot of pain, it feels like my bladder hurts.  when i go back to the doctor they test my urine, and fro the past three years they have told me that there is a little blood and mucous in my urine.  also i heard the doctor say once that the specific gravity wasn't normal.  I am tired of struggling with this.  i have the constant need to urinate, it is hard and embarrassing to have to get up in the middle of class 3 times in one hour.  also if i do not go within 10 minutes of the initial urge i start to feel like i will pass out if i do not go right that instant,  this usually occurs when my last void was 20 to 15 minutes before.  i also was recently told by my doc that i have irritable bowel with constipation.  please help me , i feel stupid when i go to the doctor.  i am in pain. thank you, charlotte bunyar\n\n",

    "title": "kidney cyst",
    "content": "I was just told by a doctor at a health center that they found a 7 cm kidney cyst in me while doing ultrasound to check my liver this month (October 2004). I'm a 41 y/o male, work out regularly for 7.5 years and a health nuts.  I've always been very proud of my good health and a much younger looks than my real age that I've been able to maintain through a healthy lifestyle.  So when hearing this news, I was not just shocked but also angry and worried. I felt angry because the doctor who told me this ultrasound result said a 7 cm  kidney cyst is very large. About 5 years ago when I was taking my physical exam, I told the doctor that I urinate VERY frequently and the urine looked yellow. The doctor said it's normal without any hesitation and reservation. Since then I did another two physicals. During both exams, I brought up the same issue and both doctors responded exactly the same way as the first one. I don't understand why. If the doctor 5 years ago had ordered an ultrasound for my kidney, maybe the cyst wouldn't have grown to such a large one. And I could have dealt with it much earlier. So can any doctors here please advise me why all those 3 doctors would respond to me that way? Is it really normal to urinate very frequently ?   Can I hold them responsible for anything?  Another question is I really didn't know anything about kidney cyst when  the doctor at the health center told me about this result. And he didn't really explained much about it to me either except scare the hell out of me, emphasizing 7 cm kidney cyst is very large (he's a very young-looking doctor and so is the way he talks.)  I then search in the Interent and found some basic information about kidney cyst. He ordered a CT scan for me and it'll be done in November. While waiting for the CT scan, I'm still very worried about two things. One - if  a 7 cm kidney cyst is considered very large, will it be more likely to be a tumor or even cancer? Two - I don't have insurance, which is why I'd have gone to the city health center for physical exam.  If this cyst is only a cyst with water inside, for a 7 cm size cyst, will it be a costly procedure to remove it? Do I have to have my abdomen cut open?  What kind of treatment will I receive?  Thank you very much for reading.  Tony\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Tony, I cannot comment on your previous clinical experiences as the clinical situation is a complex one which involves a lot of factors. I am not with or against your doctors. What do you define as urinary frequency?  You should note that most renal cysts do not present with any symptoms whatsoever. Cystic diseases of the kidney are grouped into congenital and aquired cysts. This is resolved with the patient's history.  Aquired renal cystic disease is either associated with a systemic disease (such as Tuberous sclerosis and Von Hippel-Lindau Syndrome). If not associated with a systemic disease then there are several hypotheses for the cause of these cysts. Some say they are secondary to obstruction of the tubules by fibrosis or oxalate crystals. Another hypothesis is that, with nephron loss, compensatory hypertrophy of the relatively normal nephrons occurs leading to cyst formation.  Once cysts are observed sonographically, further evaluation with contrast-enhanced CT scan is indicated to rule out carcinoma. Contrast-enhanced helical CT scanning has 96% sensitivity and 95% specificity in detecting carcinoma.  Treatment of simple cysts rarely requires surgery. Surgery may be indicated in the case of complications such as obstruction, pain or infection. Treatment options are many and include aspiration, open resection, sclerosis, endoscopy, percutaneous resection, and laparoscopy.  For your particular case, I would say you get the CT done as soon as possible. Your ultrasound should give you an idea however, whether the threat of cancer is probable.  Sonographic features supporting the diagnosis of simple cyst are an anechoic round mass with a smooth and sharply demarcated wall and through-transmission with strong posterior wall echo. A large size and a slow progression are with the diagnosis of a simple cyst rather than against it.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "title": "Kidney pain",
    "content": "I am a 28 year old female. Four years ago while pregnant I had a kidney infection in my right kidney and was admitted to the hospital for 6 days. About a year after that I continued having dull pain in my right flank area. Sometimes the pain would be sharp and actually take my breath away. I went to my Dr. and he did blood work which came back negative. From there he ordered and IVP but everything was normal.  My problem now is. I was diagnosed with a UTI by my GYN on Sept. 15th after 3 days of symptoms. I went becasue I could see blood in my urine. (I only ever had one UTI and that happened after a stay in the hospital with a catheter in place.) I also had back pain and nausea, and buring after urination that lasted for awhile after urinating. They took a urine sample through a catherter and put me on Cipro. That Friday the 17th, I had a physical with my family Dr. and told him that I had been diagnosed with a UTI, but I had not recieved the results back yet, and I was NOT feeling better, actually my back was killing me even more. I still could see blood in my urine and still had buring more AFTER I urinated. He pulled up the results and told me I definitly had a UTI but the bacteria I had was Staph and the Cipro wouln't take it away. He put me on Augmentin. In the mean time my right flank pain is slowing progressing. Monday the 20th my GYN Dr. calls back and asks how I am feeling. Not any better. I told her of my appointment with my Family Dr. and how he changed my med. She said he only got the piliminary results and I needed to go on Bactrim. This was my 3rd antibiotic. I took the Bactrim for 2 days and got really sick. I was allergic to the Bactrim. I got itchy and slept for the two days I was on it. My family Dr. told me to stop it and to come in the next day for an appointment. He was booked I needed to see another Dr. in the practice. Although the burning was gone, no more \"seen\" blood  in urine, I still have this flank pain. This Dr. looked at the urine results again. He said the Bactrim would get rid of the UTI symptoms but there was something on the test I didn't understand. Something came up and I can't remember the exact name but all I can refer to was \"Rod\" and he said the test didn't specify what it was. But whatever that was the Bactrim wouldn't get rid of it and I can't take it anyway. So he put me on Levaquin 750 mgs. for 5 days. Today is my last dose. But since yetserday the flank pain got worse. I can't bend, breathing hurts, just sitting down feels like I'm shoving my kidney under my ribs. The pain goes all the way around to the front under my rib cage. It's very painful. And makes me short of breath.  I get some relief from sitting with my heating pad, but otherwise Tylenol, or Alleve doesn't alleviate the pain. I have to get another urine sample on Oct. 2nd. He said if that comes back postive then they will start looking into other things. But in the mean time should I be concerned?\n\n",

    "content": "Okay, quite a long story but I'll try my best to lighten it up. I'm writing this becasue this may be some use to someone.  I had gotten a CT done w/contrast. Screw up on my Family Drs. part. Big lesson. If your Dr. is looking for stones DO NOT drink contrast. On CT's stones show up white, contast is white. Not hard to figure out.  They went through with the CT anyway. Those results didn't show any stones but did show a dilated R ureter tube. I ended up at the ER getting pain meds and also was sent home with some. They didn't help! I was referred to a urologist,incidently the same one I had seen 4 years previous while in the hospital with my \"kidney infection.\" Come to find out they weren't actually sure if it was an infection or a stone! LOL  Between all of this I kept informing every nurse and Dr. I encountered that I had recieved barium 3 days previous and have not expelled it yet.  I thought this may obsure any further testing they may have to do. The ER DR. had done blood work which wasn't done on me yet and an ultrasound.   The next day I fell ill. Between the narcotics which constipates you and the barium that seemmed to make it worse I had blown up like I was five months pregnant. Back to the ER at 1 am. I was x-rayed which showed I did still ahve the barium in me. They diagnosed me with gastristis.  The following day I finally had my appointment with the urologist. Knowing this was my last and final attempt in  having anyone listen to me. I was ready. I was in pain. The pain meds were not working. But I couldn't take them anyway because my stomach was ripped apart. I lost 3 pounds from the beginning of this. I was tired and wanted to be told what was wrong! The urologist didn't even read my fial which the nurse carefully prepared by finding every test I had done so far. He walks in the room asks me why I was there (I love when they do that, after 2 times of you telling them BEFORE your appointment!) So I ebgin telling him arrive that I was referred becasue they found a dialated ureter tube. He says, they didn't find anything. I said \"This is what the ER Dr. told me.\" I said,\"I have the paper right here!\" He leaves the room. The nurse comes in \" I know you just gave us a urine sample, but do you think you can give us another. Or I'm going to have to catheterize you.\" HUH? \"Okay I'll try.\" \"Is two drops enough?\" Sure. The Dr. calls me over to his area and starts asking questions. I tell him in order for him to fully undertsand I had to start from the beginning. He say \"I'm all ears.\" I start by telling him it began with a UTI that I believe was caused by a stone because in all of my 28 years alive I have never had a UTI. Through the whole UTI I had flank pain that just got worse. 4 diffrent antibiotics finally took it away. In the meantime the back pain started radiating to under my right rib and down into my groin. That was were the CT came in. Then I explained the Barium and what the Tech told me about stones and barium. The Drs. eyes light up and the nurses all knew too. The CT w/contrast would NOT detect any stones. So he finally decided to look at my chart. Read the results of the CT and did see they found a dilated ureter tube on my R side. HE LISTENED! I was crying!  He decided to first clean the barium out. They gave me two enemas. YAAAY! What fun. But it helped. And redo the CT two days wo/contrast! I have been feeling a lot better! Still have some pain but manageble and I am eating again.  I got the results of the CT today. Well, the ureter is not dilated anymore. He belives it may hvae been dilated becasue the stone was stuck at some point. They do believe is was a stone. The CT can not see far down enough where they think this stone maybe. The only option would be to scope me. But we opted against that becasue I am feeling better. Why make things worse. Let the stone, if there is one, pass. They believe it is small enough to pass since it has moved, but it could have gotten stuck again.  Now, since I have not seen the stone pass. I have been straining religiously! There could be one of three things going on. One, the stone passed and there was residual pain. Two I'm passing fragments, or three the stone is in the tube really low.   So it's wait and see right now. I'm not in PAIN like I was before. I'm not too worried. I just don't want it to happen again and am going to find out what I need to do to try to minimize my chances. I have cut out caffine, am drinking ALOT more water. I try to stay active through the whole thing to help this pass. I seen online that there may be supplmets that may help  stone forming.  These are magnisium and B12 I believe but I will talk this over with the Dr. before starting any suppliments. I hope my LOOOONG story has helped someone.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi!   I am 36 yrs old, female, mother of 3.  History of gestational diabetes with all pregnancies.  My last baby was born on Feb 6, 2004 at 29 weeks gestation.  Doing remarkably well!  The doctors brought her into the world early due to my severe pre-eclampsia (180/110).  My kidneys were excreting 3.5 grams of protein the last 2 days of my pregnancy).  I am chronic hypertensive.  I am currently taking several medications (Tenoretic 50/25), Lisinopril (Zestril 40 mg), Metformin (500 mg 2x daily).  My Nephrologist put me in Metformin in August because my fasting bs was 120.  My primary dr said that last year my fasting bs was 87.  I am overweight, 5' 1\", 165 lbs.  Anyway, I continued to show protein in my urine after giving birth.  They finally got the right medicines to control my bp (now is 110/70 to 104/60!)  My last 24 hr urine result came back at approximately 300 mg protein/24 hrs.  I was taking my Lisinopril incorrectly..originally she (dr) had me on 20 mg, then switched me to 40 mg (she didn't tell me to take 40 mg at the same time...I took 20 mg in the AM and 20 mg in the evening).  The pharmacy told me to take 40 mg only once now that I have the 40 mg single pill.  I don't know if that had any affect on the 24 hr test result for protein....I was taking it incorrectly when the last test was done.  However, since I have been taking the Lisinopril, the protein count has been going down....  Now, she wants to do a kidney biopsy on me.  She told me that my kidneys are working 100%...all bloodwork is normal.  My primary dr at my last visit (Aug 9) told me that the urine sample I gave him was negative of protein...my blood pressure was great (100/60) and that I was in great shape...lose weight and the problems will go away or greatly improve.  I'm trying.    I am scared to go back to the Nephrologist.  My primary says that she sounds aggressive and that 300 mg or so protein in 24 hrs in micro and is not a cause for alarm.  He advised me against the kidney biopsy.  I really don't want one....it has a lot of risks...is painful and requires an overnight stay in the hospital (which I can't afford to do...I've got 3 little girls and only my husband to help me)...no family lives in GA.    Based on what I have described above, would you recommend that I have the biopsy?  The Nephrologist was afraid that I had diabetes for years and was undetected and now fears that this is causing the protein in my urine.  My primary dr said that at last yrs annual chkup it was normal.  Any advise you can give me will be greatly appreciated!  Thank you so much for your time!  Sandee\n\n",

    "content": "Dear shorty1773,  I understand your nephrologist's concern. However, since your urinary protein level is declining, I would prefer to put you on follow up. It would be advisable to get a biopsy done as soon as the protein levels increase again without an obvious cause (such as pre-eclampsia). I strongly recommend that you have this discussion with your nephrologist and tell her that you would prefer to delay the biopsy for now.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "I am 48 yrs old and have microscopic hematuria and heavy proteinuria.  In Nov 2003 my protein expulsion was 1.4g; June 2004 it was 3.4g.  I have been taking Altace (5mg) since Jan 2004.  My Neprologist increased it to 7.5mg in July and wants to recheck the protein in October.  All the Kidney  blood and urine tests are normal as are the CT scans and Kidney ultrasound I took.  With the 3.4G protein loss I guess I would be considered borderline nephrotic syndrome but according to the doctor I am asymptomatic.  My question is the following:  Is this protocol of increased Altace and waiting a reasonable one?  I want to be sure there isn't anything else that should be considered rather than wait and get worse.  I am of healthy weight, normal BP (avg 115/75) and otherwise feel in good health.  Any info is appreciated.  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Dan,  i am not a nephrologist.  Altace is one of group of medications that has been proven to delay progress of kidney disease and decrease in proteinuria especially in diabetics.   He will be increasing the altace till the maximum dose or till the maximum tolerable dose.  What your nephrologist is doing is a good approach, i think the next thing to do is to have a kidney biopsy but since you are asymptomatic, i don't think that there is a need for the biopsy now.

(7.5mg daily)  He wrote up some lab forms and said I could follow up with my own physician if I chose too or I could have them do the follow up.  I am comfortable with my current physician but question why he wouldn't have ordered these tests as well.  Also, how do I approach him with this info?

    "content": "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------  I started noticing a rash on my legs about 6 weeks ago. I tried over the counter meds which didn't work. Then about 3 weeks ago I started bruising in the same area as the rash, but the rash had started spreading to my arms and torso areas and they also started bruising. And I have been exhausted lately and have had 3 episodes in the last 2 months where I feel like I am blacking out, you know where your vision starts getting black and closing in on you. I have not passed out, but had to lay down quickly to get it to go away.  I finally got worried and went to the dermatologist who mildly treated the rash, but was concerned about the bruising and ordered some blood work. And I have been exhausted lately  They called me a few days later and said it had nothing to do with dermatology, that my lab work came back abnormal and that I needed to go to the ER no later than tomorrow to have everything checked by a doctor more experienced in these matters.  So the next day I went to the ER thinking the worst and they started by repeating the same blood test. The ER doc walked back in the room and said...well, everything is fine...everything was normal and sent me home with different, stronger meds than the dermatologist. I finally got out of a nurse what the results were and this is all I know (of the first abnormal results)  platelet count was high  AST was high  ALP was high  RDW was high   Should I be concerned about the different results?  Should I get another blood test retaken?  Should I be concerned abouth the first results and what do they indicate?   Please let me know so I can go from here.   Thank You\n\n",

I'll probably get a \"duh\" on this one,but should I be worried? What can I do to stop this thing cold? Please,I need someones help on this one.Thank you in advance on behalf of me and my sanity !!!!!!!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi KnightWolf,  Pain related to kidney stones is referred to the groin and upper thigh as you pointed out. So there is nothing peculiar about that type of pain. I think the more general pain that you are experiencing is probably a result of your arthritis coupled with a decreased tolerance to pain in general. The symptoms are too nonspecific for any diagnosis. If new symptoms should arise or your symptoms don't resolve shortly then you should bring this to medical attention.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Becky,   Having an elevation in methylmalonic acid means that you have a degree of vitamin b12 deficiency.  Increased homocysteine is associated with increased risk of arterial thrombosis, but i don't think that your level is that high.  Severe zinc deficiency can cause inflammation of skin, delayed wound healing and diarrhea.   Chromium deficiency leads to glucose intolerance amongst other things like abnormal lipid (cholesterol) profile and neurological abnormalities. If a person is healthy and does not have any symptoms, it is debatable whether or not, chromium supplementation is benefitial.   Zinc and chromium are known as trace elements. The blood tests used to detect their levels are disputed by some not to reveal the real status of those elements and dispute their value if the patient is not symptomatic.  But, i think that you are already taking a multivitamin with all those supplements. If not, i think you should talk to your doctor about it.

He has to be admitted to the hospital if not already there. He has to be seen by a surgeon and he has to have a ct scan of the abdomen if available. The findings of ct scan of the abdomen will decide whether he might need a surgery or not.  There is controversy on indications and when to operate in patients with pancreatitis and is usually related to the general condition of the patients and if they can tolerate surgery.  Your father might not even have pancreatitis. He has to be seen by a surgeon and examined to decide the reason behind the abdominal pain.

    "content": "Dear Dinobub,  i think that you have a strong argument against having a kidney biopsy now after 25 years and still your kidney functions are normal.  The causes of proteinuria are various and some of them are not benign but like i said it is difficult to argue with 25 years of non-progression of your kidney disease.  You did not mention whether at this time your pcp is an internist or a nephrologist. If your pcp is an internist, he will of course refer you to a nephrologist for the kidney biopsy and the nephrologist will discuss with you all the pros and cons of having a kidney biopsy at this time. If you are not seeing a nephrologist at this time, it is time to.  One group of medications is particularly useful in cases of proteinuria and has been proven to decrease proteinuria of any cause but particularly very useful in diabetics and this is the ace inhibitor group of medication and unless you are allergic to them or developped complications to them, you should be on them, examples to them include captopril, enalapril, ramipril and lisinopril.

    "title": "blood in urine but no pain (pregnant)",
    "content": "For over 5 weeks now, I've experienced persistent blood in my urine (gross hematuria). It looks like a lot of blood to me, though I realize even a drop of blood can look like a lot in your urine. I have no pain whatsoever. I am now 19 weeks pregnant.  The urine was examined for bacteria several times.  None were found. Conclusion = no infection.  The cells in the urine were tested to see if they indicated tumors.  No such indication.  An ultrasound of the renal system was performed to look for masses or blockages or inflammation. No masses, blockages, or inflammation were detected on the bladder or either kidneys. The right kidney showed up with \"echogenic\" areas, which are supposedly harmless shadows, tissue, etc.  An incidental and seemingly unrelated finding of the ultrasound was that there seem to be lesions or hemangioma on my liver. Since it's unsafe to use contrasts, dyes, CTscans, MRIs, etc. for further exploration during pregnancy, we'll do another ultrasound in three months to check back on the state of the liver.  A blood test showed my blood count is 32 (while 36 is the low end of the normal range for pregnant females in my age group), presumably because of the blood being lost via the urine. I'm now taking iron supplements (2 Slow-FE tablets daily) to avoid becoming more anemic. The blood test indicated normal kidney function. It also indicated low potassium so I'm eating bananas daily.  A cystoscopy on the bladder (i.e. look via camera) was done to examine the health of the bladder walls and the emptying of the kidneys into the bladder. The bladder walls appeared completely healthy. The expulsion of fluid from the right kidney was a normal yellow urine color while the fluid expelled from the left kidney showed up as a red cloud of blood. So the left kidney or left ureter appear to be the source of the problem.  The latest theory is that there could be an AV malformation (arteriovenous malformation) at the left kidney or left ureter, irritated and now exposed to us by the pregnancy.  Perhaps the growing uterus is applying pressue, causing weaker blood vessels to break. An AV malformation is defined as a tangle of abnormal vessels that forms an abnormal communication between the arterial and venous systems. Generally this is congenital. This condition happens to be very uncommon so I'm sort of skeptical that I may have managed to get unlucky enough to have it.  But the only other theories offered are (a) that there are small tumors in the left kidney, too small to be detected by the ultrasound or (b) that there are small stones in the left kidney, too small to be detected by the ultrasound. But (a) seems unlikely given that the kidney shows no inflammation and the kidney function came out normal on the blood test and I'm just not in the demographic for developing such conditions and (b) seems unlikely given that I have had no pain whatsoever yet expel a surprisingly significant amount of blood in the urine.  Without more invasive testing (scope of ureter and/or kidney) or the use of contrasts, dyes, CTscan, MRI, etc., all of which are not without risk during pregnancy, we can't determine whether or not there exists an AV malformation that is truly the cause, and we can't stop the bleeding.  Since there are no indications the bleeding is harming myself or the baby right now, the current plan is to just wait and see what happens.  Hopefully, the condition won't worsen and we can wait until next year, after the baby is delivered, to investigate further.  This is all pretty scary to me, but it doesn't appear there's anything the doctors or I can do about it.  We're out of ideas.  Any thoughts or advice?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Fruitie,  To have all this on top of the stress of pregnancy, that's a lot. But, i think you are holding up pretty well.  i think your doctors did and are still doing a great job.   i think the way to go after pregnancy is an angiogram during which an a-v malformation can also be coiled or embolized using different materials in the same procedure.  i think that the danger of getting fetal malformation from a ct scan now is low. Still the danger of exposing the fetus to radiation exists, this might lead to some childhood cancers. That's why it is not recommended to have a ct scan unless absolutely necessary.  i wish you good luck and a healthy outcome.

    "content": "Dear Jesse,   It looks like you have been through a lot. Wish you all the best.  Edema can be caused by: 1. Heart failure. 2. Liver failure. 3. Kidney failure. 4. Vasodilatation of the blood vessels in your feet which can be caused by a drug. 5. Increased pressure in the big veins of the abdomen and pelvis.  6. Lung failure.  7. Very bad nutritional status.  8. Standing on one's feet for several hours a day continuously.  1. Heart failure: i am not sure about your heart status.  2. Liver failure: nash stands for Non-Alcoholic SteatoHepatitis which can lead to liver cirrhosis and liver failure but a ct scan of the abdomen should have picked up cirrhosis if it was there.  3. Renal failure: Being a diabetic, you are at risk and i assume that your doctor is following that very closely by checking either a microalbumin level or a urine analysis to check for protein in the urine on regular basis. i noticed that you are not taking a medication that you should be getting for protection of you kidneys. This group is called ace inhibitors like lisinopril and the like.  4. Vasodilatation of the blood vessels in your feet: This can be caused by a drug. A new drug can cause that. i searched the side effects of protonix, valtrex and amitriptyline (guessed that these are the 3 new additions to your medications cabinet) and i could not find that any of them can cause fluid retention. However you are taking a medication that is well known to cause weight gain and that is depo-provera.  5. Increased pressure in the big veins of the abdomen and pelvis:  This can be caused by either blood clots in them or something compressing them like an enlarged uterus or an abdominal/pelvic tumour. i think for the work up to be complete (and if it was not already done). A pelvic ultrasound and/or ct scan would be very useful. Also, duplex of the venous system to rule out blood clots in the veins. But also, this should not lead to weight gain.  6. Lung failure: If you have severe asthma that was complicated by lung failure this can lead to water retention and weight gain.  7. Very bad nutritional status:  This leads to low proteins in the blood and edema of the legs but not weight gain.  8. Standing on one's feet for several hours a day continuously: But this should not lead to weight gain.  From where i stand i am not sure what caused this fast weight gain in such a short period of time and it has to be investigated more than that in my opinion.  Where to go from here, i guess to try to find out what caused the weight gain and once the cause is known, treatment can be started if a treatable cause is identified.    Weight loss is going to make every thing easier for you starting from blood sugar control to blood pressure, lipid control, etc...

Hence blood is diverted away from the brain and other organs to supply the muscles. If that happens too suddenly or too much then oxygen supply to the brain decreases leading to black outs. Please advise your friend to take it easy there is no benefit at all in working out aggressively.\n\n",

You have not mentined whether your friend has any chronic diseases, whether he is taking any medications.  If your friend had previous creatinine levels, then it would have been easy to find out whether this is acute or chronic renal failure. If the results were previously normal, then this is acute renal failure. If they were previously abnormal, then this is chronic. This is the most accurate way.  Other ways of finding out  1. Doing an ultrasound of the kidneys, of the kidneys are smaller than normal then this is chronic for sure, if they are not, it means it could be both. 2. Doing a urine analysis which in cases of chronic renal failure can have specific type of casts called broad waxy casts. Also, although non-specific the specific gravity of   These levels of bun and creatinine with your friend history indicate that your friend is most probably dehydrated. If your friend was vomiting for 5 days straight without being able to keep anything down and these were his bun and creatinine levels and in between the 2 tests, he had not had any oral or iv fluids, then this could be acute renal failure that has not resolved because he is still dehydrated.  But needless to say, it is not that easy as chronic renal failure at high bun levels like your friend has can induce vomiting as well.  The 24 hours urine test that your friend's doctor has done is most probably to check kidney function and this test is called creatinine clearance to see how well the kidneys are functioning, but usually this test is done in cases of chronic renal failure as it is believed by many kidney specialists to be of very little value in cases of acute renal failure.  i think it is going to be a wait and see policy, meaning that your friend has to have good hydration and then repeat his bun and creatinine to see if they are improving.  Once more, thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "I am 22 years old, history of type 1 diabetes for 6 yrs. At diagnosis, my electrolytes (magnesium and potassium) were low (was in DKA so it figures) Prior to that, never visited the doc so I don\u2019t know if they have been low my entire life or what. But anyway, in Sep.2003 had a very symptomatic electrolyte reaction (M:1.1, K: 2.3) tachycardia, muscle twitching, spasms, shaking, weakness. My physician did blood tests- blood calcium, sodium were normal, M&K low. Said it was just due to good o\u2019le diabetes. (although well controlled) Took M&K supplements, for 5 months( reaching 1,700 mg/day Mag,200 mg/day K) and potassium reached normal but the mag.still ranges 1.1-1.5) So he did a 24 hr urine mag. test, which was very high and he said I have a renal leak. I have no kidney disease(protein), what specifically does it mean to have a renal leak of mag.?(and K, but mainly mag.) Is it common to have a renal leak of these elements? My physician(an endocrinologist, by the way) says it is, but I feel like the crud when blood levels get too low. (this, in spite of taking doses large enough to put normal people in dierrea for a week)Right now, levels are 1.3.(mag) ocassionally, I'll get hypokalemic but that is not as much a problem if I take supplementation.  I am concerned about Gitelman\u2019s syndrome but feel maybe I am overreacting to the situation. Would you recommend further testing for that, or is it no use much anyway(since, no matter how much I take it will never get normal) or are there any other kidney diseases that can cause this? Another question- are any renal leaks of this nature actually caused by diabetes?( or made worse) Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Gitelman's Syndrome is a kidney disorder that results in loss of salt and potassium, and metabolic alkalosis. They also complain of hypotension and hypomagnesemia. Insulin is known to cause shifts of potassium in the cell. However, these are usually self limited and are caused by acute insulin therapy for hyperglycemia. How well is your diabetes controlled. It says in your profile that you have had two cataract operations which has me worried about the level of diabetes control, given your age.  I suggest you get your urine potassium measured. This test is of vital importance in the diagnosis of hypokalemia because it establishes the pathophysiologic mechanism and thus helps formulate the differential diagnosis. A spot urine potassium measurement is the easiest and most commonly obtained test. Low urine potassium (<20 mEq/L) suggests poor intake, a shift into the intracellular space, or gastrointestinal loss. High urine potassium (>40 mEq/L) suggests renal loss (e.g. Gitelman's). It would be advisable to also check if you have alkalosis (blood pH) and to measure your serum electrolytes, BUN, and creatinine. Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "I am fairly well controlled, not perfect (highs no doubt contribute to the problem) but range mid 7 hemoglobin a1c\u2019s. Have been in that range for the past 4 yrs. You ask if the cataract surgeries were due to bad control, the answer is no. Six months after being diagnosed with diabetes, I awoke one morning with Acute Corneal Diabetic Cataracts, within 3 days totally blind. Had no eye problems prior to that. Needless to say, at 17, I didn\u2019t even fit the profile( older age, type 2 diabetes of great duration, and rather bad control) of even this very rare syndrome, but I had diabetes, and that was enough to qualify me. After arguing over this for awhile, (and being shut up by the senior doc who informed them they were all wrong, since he\u2019d actually seen 2 cases of this and they had not) they (residents) told me they really didn\u2019t have an idea why I even got it, but they were going to do surgeries and hope that improved the situation. It did, to my relief and their pride, and have had no further eye problems since that time. Thanks for answering my question- and if, in the future I have any more I\u2019ll be back. Thanks again.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 54 yr. old female and on methadone, 120 mg. daily, on 4 of urine screens I have been told by my counselor that my creatin levels were low!  She said that the urine screen showed my urine to be light in color.  To a methadone clinic this often means you are not taking your medication or trying to get over!  I've been on methadone for 27 years now with all clean urine screens so believe me I'm not trying to get over on them in any way.  I receive medication monthly & to get to that point you must be compliant with all clinic policies and they are strict.  My Dr. has changed my blood pressure meds, I do drink allot of coffee        in the morning prior to going to my clinic and I also drink allot of water throughout the day.  My levels were low for July, Oct., Nov., & Dec.  My BP meds were changed in June 2003 and again in Jan. 2004 - would this have an effect on my levels.  As I mentioned before the clinic only does screens so I have no numbers when they say low!!!  What would cause this to happen?  My counselor tells me not to worry about it but I do as I do not want to lose my monthly priviledge after all these years in compliance. I live 1-1/2 hour one-way to my clinic and that is another reason as winter weather can be very bad here in Mid Coast Maine.  Looking for answers and thank you.    Jan P.\n\n",

I feel it would be best to consult with your counselor at your methadone clinic for clarification of your doubts.  As you have pointed out yourself, the clinic is of the opinion that the low creatinine levels found in your urine is not something to be worried about.   A low creatinine level could indicate tampering with sample. So, it would be best to be forthright and convince them of your compliance. You may also consult with your medical doctor regarding the same to find out the cause behind thins. Indeed, Maine is no place to find what winter is all about.

I had a 2cm(very large) stone removed in march 2000 that was accidently found by Cat scan that was done because of chronic hematuria.I have never had severe pain but have had chronic mild lower back discomfort just a nagging pain,I have never taken anything for this discomfort but it always seems to be present. I still have hematuria 2 years later and recently had another ct scan.My docter told me that I now have  a 2mm stone in my kidney.The other thing that my docter told me was that my lymph nodes around my kidney were enlarged. I was concerned about lymph nodes but he told me it was nothing to worry about.He instead told me that I should have Ct scans every 3 months now to note the progression of my stone. Since the stone is only 2mm I really doubt that he cares about the stone,I am concerned that with my history of hematuria,low back pain perhaps I have something else.He passed it off stating that I probably was scratched by a cat and it enlarged my lymph nodes.I have not been scratched by a cat..should I request a biopsy? I am in a quandy because I don't think I have a true picture of what my docter could be looking for and he really won't say.Any ideas?\n\n",

    "content": "My 14yr old daughter (not sexually active, not started her period) is now on her 5th UTI within 4 months. The first couple of infections were found to be the bacteria Staph. saprophyticus ot E.Coli.  She was given Trimethoprin. For this initial UTI she was hospitalised as she was suffering from severe lower back pain on one side, vomiting, headache and generally unwell - even pins and needles occurring. Within a couple of weeks she had a recurring infection and again given antibiotics. Each time she was given antibiotics. For the latest episode, no sooner had she finished the course of antibiotics than she complained of slight burning sensation on urination and frequency of urination. Within 2 weeks of this infection she is now suffering from severe pain in her lower left back, headache, general unwellness and minor symptoms of cystitis. She drinks plenty, including Cranberry juice, does not use intimate sprays, only wears cotton underwear, takes care on cleaning herself after using the bathroom etc etc.  I have started to give her a herbal tincture of Uva Ursi (bearberry) to help strengthen her urinary system, but am at a loss as to what else I can do - especially as the usual reaction is to dose her with yet another course of antibiotics - which doesn't seem to solve the problem either.  Has anyone any ideas on how and why she keeps getting these recurring infections, especially as it has been the Staph. bacteria and suggestions on treatment short and long term. I do not want her to be on antibiotics continually but also do not want to risk damage to her kidneys.\n\n",

    "content": "Jeanie, Recurrent infections of the urinary tract should be classified as same-strain or different-strain and as early (occurring within 2 weeks of the end of therapy) or late. After therapy, early recurrences due to the same strain may result from an unresolved upper tract focus of infection but often (especially after short-course therapy for cystitis) result from persistent vaginal colonization. Recurrences>2 weeks after the cessation of therapy nearly always represent reinfection with a new strain or with the previously infecting strain that has persisted in the vaginal and rectal flora. In acute uncomplicated cystitis, more than 90 to 95% of infections are due to one of two organisms: E. coli or S. saprophyticus. Although resistance patterns vary geographically and resistance has increased in many areas, most strains are sensitive to many antibiotics. In most parts of the United States, more than one-quarter of E. coli strains causing acute cystitis are resistant to amoxicillin, sulfa drugs, and cephalexin, and resistance to trimethoprim (TMP) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) is now approaching these levels as well. A 3-day course of therapy withTMP-SMZ,TMP, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, or ofloxacin appears to preserve the low rate of side effects of single-dose therapy while improving efficacy; thus 3-day regimens are currently preferred for acute cystitis.  Evaluation by cystoscopy or intravenous pyelography is usually not warranted in all cases.\n\n",

    "content": "Well marina...by peeing out blood i assume you mean blood in urine as opposed to blood from the vagina....     anyway we will consider the causes in both cases...  If its blood in urine..then the cause must be in urinary tract....that means anywhere either in : kidney ureters urinary bladder or  urethra    some drugs might also cause hematuria...   though sex as such is not directly related to hematuria , urinary tract infection during sex because of unprotected intercourse can cause it.  You should tell how long you have been suffering from this...is it for the first time? have you had it in the past too.....blood is at the beginning of urination or at the end of urination or is it uniformly mixed in urine.....are there any other compliants like fever,flank pain, oedema etc....   Actually don't get bothered by all this..all this might sound complicated..that was just to give u some idea what it could be.....all you have to do is get the checkup done for genitourinary system.....it includes clinical examination, blood examination, urine examination, KUB, USG....that should give a cause. you said you'll be seeing your doctor in February...but if you could do it earlier, that would just be better!   Now if the blood is not in urine and its just through the vagina..then the cause might entirely be different...it could be related to the reproductive system..that is : uterus , cervix ,vagina in that case a gynaecological checkup is recomemded...  take care  a_medico\n\n",

    "content": "Renal cysts are abnormal dilatations of the kidneys, which result in the formation of fluid-filled sacs which are visible on ultrasound or CT scan. Renal cystic disease encompasses a broad category of kidney diseases. Some of these conditions are genetic, and may results in chronic renal failure. However, most cysts are benign growths that do not need to be treated.   Simple cysts are found in at least 50 percent of adults over the age of 50 and are a benign condition. The reason for their development is unknown, but it is likely a degenerative process related to aging. These cysts are usually asymptomatic and are found upon imaging of the kidneys for an unrelated complaint. It is usually easy to differentiate between a simple cyst and a renal cancer based upon their appearance on ultrasound or CT scan. Sometimes, this differentiation is less clear and may require additional imaging studies or other procedures.   You should ask him about the seriousness of the situation.\n\n",

    "title": "Sister on her second transplant",
    "content": "Dear Tami,   Your sister's problem seems interesting. First let's address the question about increased blood pressure in a transplant recipient. As a kidney fails, blood pressure can rise, however, there are two scenarios which I am usually very concerned about. The first is of course assuming that your sister takes a calcineurin inhibitor (cyclosporine or tacrolimus) that the level might be high and this would be the cause of her hypertension. The second is the possibility of renal artery stenosis of the transplanted kidney. To rule this out we could look at the resistive indices of the transplanted renal artery or if there is enough suspicion go directly for a CO2 angiogram. There are some other possibilities but these are the ones I would focus on.   The second part of your concern as to the increasing creatinine is a more complicated manner but I would divide this into chronic or acute. The possibilities for acute are plenty. The possibilities for chronic are less. I would like to know the following details: When was the kidney put in, how many matches or mismatches, in what part of the world do you live, what is her immunosuppressive regimen, was the kidney cadaveric or not, where there any post or perioperative complications including delay in the function on the kidney, is she followed by a transplant nephrologist. In addition I would like to know her creatinine immediately after the transplant and every three months after that, her creatinine now as compared to three months ago and her urine analysis results.   Please follow up if you can, I have some ideas to share.   Mark.\n\n",

    "content": "Well a 3 or 4 antigen match is a fairly good match. You mention that your sister had \"done well for 5 years\" after the transplant. This period of time worries me and I would like you to tell me the exact creatinine level in during this five year period and more recently.   The fact that a nephrologist took her off of cyclosporine because it was \"damaging the kidney\" is also interesting. I would like to know what medicine replaced cyclosporine and this could not be prednisone since prednisone is not a substitute for cyclosporine. This statement implies that either your sister had cyclosporine nephrotoxicity and was take off calcineurin inhibitors and she is inadequately supressed or that cyclosporine could have caused elevated blood pressure. Again this raises the specter of acure or chronic rejection. Finally, I continue to be concerned with transplant renal artery stenosis as a possible diagnosis, particularly if your sisters blood pressure is very difficult to control on adequate doses of medication and if the onset was abrupt. I would order a doppler of the transplanted renal artery. Unfortunately, the last message posted gives me little or no additional information with which to work. My general recommendation at this point is to take her back to a transplant center, possibly in Utah where she had it done and let her be evaluated by a transplant nephrologist. In addition I would perform a renal artery doppler or a carbon dioxide angiogram of the transplanted renal artery.\n\n",

    "content": "good day to you! no one can really give an accurate assessment on the disease you have. In the first place, you cannot say it is a cysts not unless an ultrasound or any other diagnostic procedure was made already. Mere pain in the flank does not really suggest renal cysts- it may be pyelonephritis, or kidney stones. If you are a female patient, have an OB-GYN clearance, who knows you might be having Pelvic inflammatory disease already.  Swelling all over may mean \"anasarca\" or generalized edema. Nephrotic syndrome usually causes this. Consult a doctor and have urinalysis - check for proteinuria or proteins in the urine which is generally an abnormal finding.  Do you have high blood pressure? Does is vary? You might be having pheochromocytoma if this is the case.  Then again, it is best that you consult your doctor. If you are sure that it is really renal in origin, better consult a nephrologists.  Get well my friend\n\n",

I am circumsized, and am not sexually active, nor have i been in the past. i've been on antibiotics such as cipro for other infections during the time i have  had these symptoms and they have not resolved.  i was wondering if i could possibly have some sort of inflamation of the glands of littre due to a viral or fungal cause # however there is no redness, discharge, edema, etc... around the meatus or glans. everything looks normal.  i also have a spermatocole, but i can't imagine that it has anything to do with the burning.  back in high school i had similar symptoms and visited the urologist. he checked for a stricture (and i assume found nothing)and told me that if it didn't get worse i probably shouldn't worry about it. now that it (or something similar) is happening again i was wondering if you had any idea of what it could be or any suggestions.  thanks for your time and expertise.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Rhondal,  Thank you very much for using our website.  What you are complaining from could be symptoms of having kidney problems, liver problems, gall bladder problems, colon problems, lung problems, bones or muscles problems or abnormal collection of fluid like an abscess or something.  These are the organs present in the right flank.  But since you had bladder infections nearly all your life then i would go with kidney problems till proven otherwise. You did not mention what type of kidney tests did you have that came back normal. Did you have a urine analysis which the one that shows the presence or absence of an infection in the urine. You could also develop a kidney stone.   One of the most challenging symptom that any physician could encounter in his/her practice could be abdominal discomfort or pain. It usually is directed by the accompanying symptoms that the patient has in addition to other characterisitics like the place of the pain and whether it go any where else? Any special maneuvers that relief the pain? and so forth.  Gall bladder in females also can give symptoms similar to those of lots of other diseases.  My advice to you is to  1. Perfrom a urine analysis if you have not done. 2. Have an ultrasound of your gall bladder (if you still have it and was not removed surgically in the past). 3. Liver function tests. 4. Complete blood count to make sure that you do not have  an infection hidden somewhere because of the low grade fever that you have been having.

    "content": "i have had a very unusual smell to my urine for about 4 months.  I noticed when I was sick with the flu and I had diarrehea for a few days.  about that same time i began having this strange odor to my urine.  it almost has a sulfur-ish scent to it, it is very strong.  it has a cloudy apperance sometimes (this is not unusual for me).  most of the time my urine has a dark color to it with an almost orange tint.   It is strongest in the morning or when its has been a few hours since i've gone last.  I have no pain or change in frequency or urgency.  I have no insurance so i haven't been to a doctor, but its been like this for 4 months and I am worried that there is something seriously wrong with me.  I have tried to research myself what could be causing this and I think I may have metabolic acidosis.  would  this cause urine to have a abnormal odor? there is probably several other things that could be causing this I hope you can help me pinpoint what the problem is and what I need to do to treat it.  thanks for your time.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Goodpasture's syndrome",
    "content": "Dear Rebeca,   Thank you very much for using our website.   Goodpasture's syndrome is a disease that affects the kidneys and the lungs.   It is caused by the presence of antibodies directed against structures in the kidneys and the lungs causing destruction of these structures and subsequent rapidly progressive kidney failure and bleeding in the lungs. Why these antibodies develop, no body knows for sure.   Patients may have cough, shortness of breath, and couhing up blood which may vary from small amounts to life-threatening massive amounts. In almost three fourths of cases, lung hemorrhage precedes or is coincident with the kidney disease.   Some patients may have symptoms of weakness, fatigue, weight loss, chills, and fevers, whereas others may have skin rash, nausea and vomiting, and joint pain at onset. The patient may also present with hypertension, edema, blood in the urine and reduced kidney function. Kidney function is usually already reduced at presentation and may deteriorate from normal to levels requiring dialysis in a matter of days to weeks.

    "content": "Dear guest,   Thank you very much for using our website.   What you are describing could be related to a new urinart tract infection or due to you developing frank diabetes.   Best line of action is to check a urine analysis and if this is normal or if it shows the presence of sugar in the urine then it is best to check a blood sugar.   If every thing comes back normal then the best thing is to be checked by a urologist to make sure that the cause of incontinence is not related to a weak bladder muscle that needs surgical intervention.   If you had any other neurological symptoms this could be related to a nerve problem in the process of controlling your bladder so you might also need to see a neurologist.

Autosomal recessive, the second type, generally seen in neonates and children. It is rare and will definitely lead to end stage renal failure, which means, the patient, if still possible, can be dialized, or be advised to have kidney transplant.  The rule of thumb in treating patients with this type of disease is to slow down the rate of progression of the disease and minimize the symptoms. Immediately consult a nephrologist in your area.

    "content": "Dear Dom,   Thank you very much for using our website.   Based on the information you gave, your estimated creatinine clearance is 35 cc/minute (if you are a male) and 30 cc/minute (if you are a female).   You can check it yourself at this link in our website http://www.doctorslounge.com/calc/creatclear.htm   Since you are a diabetic and have chronic renal insufficiency, you must have had a 24 hours urine collection at some time to see how much proteins you have in the urine in addition to find out what's your actual creatinine clearance.   I am not sure whether you have any additional medical problems with diabetes like high blood pressure or not.   The best thing to do is to take a medication belonging to the group called ACE inhibitors which have been strongly proven to reduce the effect of diabetes on the kidneys but this has to be done under medical supervision because they have significant side effects including renal failure among others.   Another thing is to control your blood sugar the best you can in addition to very good control of your blood pressure and avoiding any medications that can harm your kidneys such as over the counter pain relievers like ibuprofen and the like.   And i am not sure why you are taking lasix but it does not make the creatinine levels go down.   i think it is time for you to see a specialist in kidney diseases to be followed up regularly.

    "content": "Dear guest,   Thank you very much for using our website.   Blood in the urine can be caused by many causes. These include:   - General problems. Meaning having a tendency to bleed from any where and urine is a place where you can bleed as any other place and it does not mean that you have any problems with the urinary system.   - Local problems in the urinary system and these are many. The most important ones are:   1. Kidney trauma.  2. Inflammation of the kidney.  3. Kidney stones.  4. Infection in the bladder or the kidney.  5. Tumours (whether benign or malignant) of the kideny or bladder.   According to the age, clinical situation and the symptoms that you might have in addition to having blood in the urine, the doctor chooses which way to go. But the standard is to obtain a kidney function test, an x-ray and/or an ultrasound of the kidney and if the doctor thinks it is necessary to go ahead and do other procedures such as a cystoscopy which going up the urinary system with a scope to take a look at the inside of your bladder and make sure that there is nothing there. All the above mentionned are not painful what so ever except for the poke for the blood draws and for the cystoscopy you will receive a sedative and a pain medicine which both will make you feel rel;ax and you will forget the whole procedure.

    "content": "In general (90 plus percent of the time) elevated creatinine means \"renal insufficiency\" or the lack of adequate cleaning of the blood. Creatinine is a marker for kidney function and is usually right but in few instances its not. I can think of a few tricky or exotic situations when the creatinine can be elevated but renal function is normal. As a final comment I would like to add that few people look at the creatinine alone, most will look at both the BUN and the creatinine.   The tricky situations I can think of are as follows:   If you become \"dehydrated\" or don't drink enough water your kidneys may not be able to clear creatinine, function might still be normal.   If you eat a large steak your level of creatinine might go up because you are eating the animal's creatinine stored in the muscle. Your kidneys still work fine.   If you are a body builder and you have too much muscle, your creatinine might be high but your kidney function normal.   A drug might interfere with the measurement of creatinine and cause it to be falsely high (known as Jaffee Reaction)   In a crush injury muscle may be crushed and release creatinine, its difficult to tell what the kidney function is.   Some other exotic conditions.   The real answer is 99% of the time yes, if your creatinine is high your kidneys are not working well.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Reitz,   First of all, you have all my sympathy, you are going through tough time right now.   I can not answer all your questions fully because the picture is missing some pieces. I do not know why your dad is on the ventilator right now?? Did he sustain any kind of heart or respiratory arrest?? Did his lung infection got so worse and his oxygen levels were so low that the doctors had to put him on the breathing machine??   About the coma, i want to know whether the doctors did any kind of test that prooves that your dad has brain death or not because it looks like they do not have much hope for recovery! What kind of treatment did they do for the brain abscess your dad had??   I also would like to know whether your dad is receiving any medicines through the IV to maintain his blood pressure (did his blood pressure go really down and they had to start him on what is known as vasopressors??)   You also mentionned that the EEG that they did was abnormal, what did they mean by that? Is it too much brain activity or no brian activity at all???   If your dad has brain death, this means that he will be dependant on the ventilator for the rest of his life and he will not be responsive, he will be in a coma for the rest of his life.   The prognosis of these patients (sorry to say that) is poor and no one can tell how long will they remain in coma or when they are going to pass away.   Coma, in your dad's case may be caused by lots of things actually, it is very complicated. Kidney failure may be the cause but this should be corrected by dialysis. The meningitis and the brain abcess may be the cause and according to the bug that caused this meningitis or the abscess your dad should receive antibiotics and the decision to evacuate the abcess is left to the discretion of the treating physician. But if the meningitis is complicated by encephalitis which is inflammation of the brain, the prognosis will be poor also. Abnormal over active brain wave (what is known as epilepsy) may be the cause EVEN IF YOUR DAD DOES NOT HAVE ANY SEIZURES, so it is crucial to know what kind of abnormal brain wave activity he has. Medications some times can cause coma in patients in your dad's age especially some of the newer antibiotics. Your dad might have other medical condition such as liver failure that i am not aware of, or he just might have sustained a stroke (although this should be evident on the brain scan)   Once more, i know that this is very difficult for you, i hope i answered enough of your questions that may be of help and once more if you could answer some of the questions i asked i will be able to help you more.   Good luck for your dad, yourself and all your family.\n\n",

    "content": "THANK YOU FOR MAKING THE TIME TO READ MY E-MAILS.   On the 27th of July I e-mailed a letter concerning my father. Today we got the following prognosis. Some of my father'brain cells (they said \"brein vate\" in Afrikaans)are dead and they cannot do anything for him anymore. They say that is the reason why he does not wake up. They have also taken away the sedation.   They also said his protein is 5mg. His uremia is 8 and creatinine is 300.   The reason why he is on a ventilator is because of his lungs. They are gradily taking him off the ventilator because they say he can almost breath on his own. My father is definitely not brain dead they have confirmed that today.   His general condition is good.   They also confirmed that the reason for my dad being in a coma is because of the meningitis he had. They did another LP and said that it shows that the meningitis is gone and there is no further signs of the meningitis.   They also did tests that showed that my father did not/or does not suffer from epilepsy.   PLEASE HELP ME ALL I WANT TO KNOW IS IF THERE IS ANY TREATMENT/HOPE OR ANYONE WHO CAN OR KNOW OF SOMEONE WHO CAN HELP MY FATHER.   PLEASE CONTACT VANESSA ON (012) 332-0268 OR CELL: 0828232064 OR E-MAIL reitzp@mweb.co.za.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Reitz,   Sorry for being late,   First of all, let me tell you that i will not be able to tell you anything about your dad's prognosis.   Second, the doctors saying that part of his brain cells are dead means (in my opinion) that he had a stroke, because there is no other explanation. And according to the area of the brain affected, your dad may or may not regain consciousness. And unfortunately there is no treatment for dead brain cells and unfortunately they do not regenerate.   i want to ask how many times did your dad have dialysis because a BUN of 300 is very high and this means that his may need more dialysis because increase in the BUN at such high levels may cause disturbance in the level of consciousness. If there is no nephrologist (kidney specialist) who is helping in the management of your dad's case, i would encourage you to get a nephrologist involved.   Regarding to him being in a coma secondary to meningitis complications is something that can happen and is not uncommon especially if the inflammation reached the brain surface and in the condition of your dad because he has renal failure, his immunity is low (because most of renal failure patients have low body immunity). And once more, since the most important thing is the conscious level of your dad and whether he will remain in coma and for how long, i would encourage to you, if not already the case, to involve a neurologist (brain and nervous system specialist) in the management of your dad.   To me, it looks like your dad is doing very slow headway and improvement. Trying to get him off of the ventilator means that his lungs are improving even if this improvement is slow.   Last, thank you for putting trust in us and sorry for not being of much help because hearing is not like being involved in the direct care of a patient.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Colleagues,   Let me introduce myself briefly. My name is Mark A. LaGatta and I am a young nephrologist who started private practice recently. My interests are many and varied and I hope to share, exchange and receive medical opinions from other nephrologist.   I would like to start by saying that in the last reply dated February 2001 to the case of the Afrikaans man with meningoencephalitis, that the second letter on the part of the family stated that the creatinine was 300 and the BUN was merely 8. The creatinine was expressed in units other than mg/dL (probably mmol) and is in the normal range, the BUN is slightly depressed. The clinical case seems to suggest the patient arose from a comatose state without the need for supportive dialytic therapy which leads me to believe the renal failure was acute or acute superimposed on chronic.   Warmest Regards,   Mark A. LaGatta\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Kmuschel,   You haven't introduce yourself to us. Like are you a medical student? resident?   We just added a kidney function calculator to the website that you are welcome to use all the time.   The formula for estimating creatinine clearnce for practical purposes of course (like adjusting medications dosages) is based upon the fact that creatinine is formed in the body by the enzyme creatinine kinase which is present in the muscles so if you have a big body habitus then it will not be surprising that you will a relatively elevated creatinine but this does not mean that your kidneys are bad, also, if the patient's body habitus is \"petit\" a normal creatinine may be deceiving. Second due to the fact that with age, there is a normal decline in creatinine over time, the age should be put into consideration as well. Last but not least, since there is a difference between the males and the females in regarding the total body muscle mass, this factor is considered as well.   The formula is:   [140-Age(yrs)] X weight(Kg)X 0.85(female)  ##############  serum creatinine(mg/dl) X 72   Hope this was not boring.   Anyway, welcome to our community and hope to hear from you soon once more with more questions that i hope i will have answers for!!!!!!!  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",
