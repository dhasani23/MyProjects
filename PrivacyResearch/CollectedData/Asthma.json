    "content": "There are times where I feel like my lungs are tight or have some mucous in them, but when I use my peak flow meter I'm 85%-100% of my personal best. Does it mean I'm really not having asthma symptoms and should not use my inhaler (although it feels like I should)? Or maybe there's an aspect of my asthma that is not being addressed? Sometimes when I take my inhaler in these situations my peak flows remain in my personal green zone, but the chest feelings don't go away, which causes me some anxiety in that I think maybe I am having an attack but my rescue meds are not helping. I am 42 years old, normal weight and have been on Advair 500/50 for about 3 years. Xopenex is my rescue inhaler.   Thanks\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Good Peak Flow with Chest Discomfort",
    "content": "Hi, You must be well aware that the peak flow meters have their own share of falsely high or falsely low recorded readings.  Factors that may result in a falsely high reading include, - using an incorrect mouthpiece: Some manufacturers high and low range models (for different flow rate ranges). The diameter of the mouthpieces for these models vary. The high range model may have a larger diameter mouthpiece. If a small diameter mouthpiece is used mistakenly in place of a large diameter mouthpiece, it may produce falsely high readings. - coughing or spitting during the procedure may also result in falsely high readings. - protruding the tongue into the mouthpiece also can produce falsely high readings.  The PEFR readings should not be relied upon in isolation to decide on the management in clinical situations. These readings should be used in conjunction with the patient's symptoms and the frequency of need for rescue medications. If there is any doubt that the peak flow meter is returning falsely high readings despite being symptomatic, then the patient should be promptly re-assessed by the doctor to look for evidence of unrelieved bronchospasm.  Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "One of my good friends has been diagnosed with Cystic Fibrosis since he was born. Having problems gaining weight when he was a child his mother asked his physician if he could ingest marijuana as a way to increase his appetite, but the doctor said he could NOT have any marijuana in any way, shape or form. My guess is because he was young and it could of effected his growth and because it is illegal to possess in Texas. I'm asking this question from a completely medical view and asking the reader not to add laws into the equation, there are two alternatives to smoking marijuana that many medical marijuana patients use to get their medicine. One is vaporizing, If vaporized at the correct temperature only the THC in the marijuana will become vapor. This means that there is no potentially harmful substances being inhaled except for THC. The second is oral consumption which again involves no carcinogens or dangerous compounds.  My question is would alternately ingesting marijuana (ie. Vaporizing or Edibles not SMOKING) affect a patients with CF in anyway that it wouldn't affect a human without CF, and if it does what part of the body would it effect and why?  Thank you for taking time to answer.\n\n",

They took a lot of blood, all clear. They sent me home with a prescription of Albuterol Inhaler, which I don't think helps. As soon as I walked outside to my car, I was totally out of breathe by the time I got there. I still have this issue. Everyday, anytime I do anything I get out of breathe. When I arrive home I have to stop every flight of stairs and sit down and catch my breathe. I don't know where to turn. I just want to feel better.

I had to do a Pulmonary Function Test to find out if I had any signs of asthma.

The medical doc took a look at my results and requested a Methacholine Challenge Test to be given to me because he was worried about the FEF25-75% score of 73% predicted value. He claimed it could mean that I have \"Restrictive Airway Disease\".  My Question: Since I have a low FEF25-75% score, does that automatically mean I am going to fail the Methacholine Challenge Test? If I can pass the MCT still, should I be worried about the low FEF25-75% score?\n\n",

This latter, in particular, is of interest and is the main reason I suggest you report this to the authorities so it can be evaluated and included in their data base, as if enough instances of this turn up it could be investigated, always a worthwhile thing.  That being said, since it is statistically unlikely this is related to the vaccine, I would definitely suggest you both bring this problem to the attention of a physician, as something certainly is not right.   Good luck with this. Please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

Steroids merely suppress the immune system, which is all the more reason to be vaccinated, but only with the injectable (killed virus) vaccine. If your daughter received the nasal spray version and is still feeling fine she's already passed the test and this should confer the expected protection from H1N1 despite having had prednisone recently.

    "content": "hi! My Mom passed out several times in the course of one week. One day, she passed out twice and we rushed her to the hospital. At the hospital, she had those episodes when she can't breathe, passes out, then turns blue at the lips and also at the feet. At one time (the first time this episodes started), she experienced a sudden severe chest pain. Sometimes, in the middle of a conversation, she stares then just fades into unconsciousness. My Mom is 73 yrs old, was diagnosed years back with asthma, is not diabetic, a little bit overweight, does not smoke nor drink. The doctor treated it as a heart case saying that there's a clog in the heart vein and that they will have to perform an angioplasty. An angiogram showed that there were no blocks. The doctors discharged her without diagnosis even if the episodes continued. We brought her home but returned her in the middle of the night because of the same symptoms. This time the cardiologist who handled her previously, now co-managed by a pulmo doctor, said she had pneumonia (hospital-acquired) and bronchial asthma. They treated her pneumonia first. Then when she was strong enough, they performed a lung angiogram. The results were also clear. But during the procedure, she had the episode again. Later that night, she had another episode. It is very difficult for her to breathe especially if she's lying flat on the back or if there is some increase in movement. She's been in the hospital for 2 weeks now and still no diagnosis. They ruled out the heart, then the lungs. If it's asthma, why did this happen only now when she has had asthma for several years? We don't know what's wrong with her. Whatever help you can give will be greatly appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to help and for sharing your knowledge and experience.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: difficutly breathing and blue lips",
    "content": "Hi there -- Since heart disease seems to have been ruled out, and because blueness (cyanosis) of the lips and extremities is more often related to pulmonary problems, it seems likely this is something involving the lungs. However, lung problems that come on suddenly and episodically like this are fairly unusual. This could be the result of some sort of reactive and sudden asthma, since she has been diagnosed with asthma, but if this is the case there must be something setting off these abrupt spells ending in fainting. It is very strange and disturbing. The fact she's already had \"regular\" asthma for a few years doesn't mean it can't change or react to a new allergen that's turned up, of course. It also sounds like in some ways as though it is a seizure with respiratory distress, and I'm wondering if maybe this might not be the case. The sudden onset, the loss of consciousness, and especially the cyanosis, suggest she may be having partial seizures which are somehow compromising her airway. This is only a guess, but since no one has figured out the whole thing (and pneumonia does not explain the sudden episodes at all), perhaps she should have a neurological exam with an eye toward ruling out seizure activity. The fact is, a few people die every year during the course of seizures (very low number) but the point is when they do it's almost always due to airway obstruction. Your mom may be having anoxic seizures even (anoxic seizures are the result of too little oxygen in the blood) and with asthma and pneumonia it's possible her oxygen saturation drops too low just long enough to trigger a seizure or partial/focal seizure and the dominoes just start to fall. Again, it's a guess, but something has to be causing this, and it's one area I'll bet has been overlooked so far,since it would be very unusual. It's certainly worth a rule-out, though, and if it helps solve the mystery, all the better.  Hope this is helpful to you. Good luck to you and to your mom. I hope someone gets to the bottom of this soon. Please keep us updated.\n\n",

So the doctor's called my asthma \"environmental asthma.\" I also have allergies to pollen, but none to animals, perfumes, or smoke. I smoked maybe 3 times a week from age 17 to age 20.

I can't even stand the smell. The winds kicked up 3 weeks ago. I was sneezing, stuffed nose, itchy, water eyes, so I took benadryl to cope. I used my Albuterol inhaler for a couple of days. It has been 3 weeks now, the winds are gone, but I continue to take benadryl, use my albuterol inhaler 2 puffs every 4 hours, and I still can't breathe! I have NO cough, NO fever, NO chills or body aches, nothing. I'm also dying of thirst! I drink about 4 cold water bottles an hour. I have checked my blood sugar, thinking its high and that's why I'm thirsty, but my blood sugar is staying within range. I went to the doctor for breathing treatment, but it did not help. I have not gone outside the house for 4 days, I have the AC on because the cold air makes it easier for me to breathe, I have to sleep propped up, and I have cut out all salty, creamy, and milky foods. This is frustrating! Before this happened, I was going to the gym everyday, walking on the treadmill for 1 hour, walking the dog to the park, dancing, ect. Why can't I breathe??\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -- First, let's get clear on something: It appears you actually can breathe -- otherwise you probably wouldn't have been able to post this question. You apparently are having some trouble or discomfort associated with breathing, and that may well be due to environmental asthma (I'm personally familiar with the way the Santa Anas will affect asthma-prone people, and it's pretty nasty). One thing you may be doing to hinder your cause is use Benadryl, which is a very powerful drying agent and so can actually make asthma associated with dry air all the worse. You might ask your doctor if you could have a sample or trial prescription of/for Singulair, which is a unique antihistimine-like medication specifically aimed at airborne allergies and the management of asthma. It doesn't have the profoundly drying effects of Benadryl, so may be a lot more help and less hindrance. Also, you might try adding Mucinex or a generic equivalent (guaifenesin) which is an expectorant that helps liquify bronchial secretions and make it easier to breathe. Since the breathing treatment didn't help you may ultimately need to take a six-day course of oral steroids, but trying Singulair and Mucinex together first may do the trick. You'll also become, as a result of this business, more aware of your breathing, which invariably results in one feeling as though one cannot draw an adequate breath even though in reality breathing is adequate. A good test of this is to try walking (inside the house is fine) and talking. If you can speak out loud in whole sentences while walking at a brisk pace you're doing fine. Your doctor also should povide you with an AsthmaCheck device to blow into in order to check just how well you are actually breathing. It's a really cheap and handy way to measure vital capacity. Ask for one. They're generally given away by most practices.  I hope this is helpful. Please follow up with us here as needed. Good luck to you.\n\n",

Now it has started to be all the time that I'm constantly having a hard time breathing.  Today I went to a water park because it was the first day that I felt decent enough to go out.  I honestly think this was the best thing for me because I hadn't been out of the house in the fresh air in a week, and it got rid of all my symptoms for the most part.  I went on this one ride, that was a straight drop where you lay on your back...I got off and had horrible pain because I was trying to breathe.  I sat down for a few minutes and was okay but I was very afraid because I couldn't breathe.  I'm 19 years old, and I haven't had asthma symptoms since I was a year old.  It was very scary.  Whenever I take a deep breath, its like shaky.   I want to go to the doctors, but its $25 for me every time, so I'm not too fond of going.  I also don't know if in order to diagnose me if they would have to use an MRI or x-ray, or if that would cost more...so I decided to ask here first.  Thanks!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Asthma Symptoms After having the flu?",
    "content": "Hi there -- Asthma is often triggered for the first time by a respiratory infection like the flu, so this part isn't surprising. You may have had very mild asthma prior to this and not realized it, also.   The simplest way to diagnose many asthmas is by use, in the doctor's office, of a stethascope and an AthsmaCheck device, a little plastic device one blows into as hard as possible, to see what the rough vital capacity is. If you get it up to 350-400 you probably don't have asthma or at least are not in the midst of an episode. No imaging (X-ray, CT, MRI) should be necessary, and you get to keep the AsthmaCheck gizmo to take home and play with or check to see if you may be having actual breathing problems (the symptoms often can be tricky, and the discomfort and trouble breathing don't always match up with your actual ability to breathe effectively).   This shouldn't cost more than your straight office visit, and most doctors can diagnose this without too much extra testing. If there's any strong suggestion of a problem there's an actual pulmonary function test that's uncomplicated that can also be done in the office to help confirm the diagnosis. Rescue inhalers are inexpensive and very useful if you are diagnosed as asthmatic. There are also sample medications available you could try. This doesn't have to be terribly expensive in every case. In any case it does need attention, with a rule-in or rule-out, and appropriate care if you do have some degree of asthma. It sounds like you probably do, by the way.   I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck and  please follow up here with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 39 year-old male. I've been experiencing severe throat tightness, throbbing above the roof of my mouth, and burning/pressure in my back upon inspiration for about six months. Spirometry values were normal, but a methacholine challenge, according to the respiratory therapist, indicates I have asthma (follow-up with pulmonologist next week).  My question - is there any significance to the fact that my reaction to the challenge occurred on the final, most concentrated level of the methacholine? Function decreased by -23% at that point, and I understand that -20 is the guideline for asthma diagnosis. I'm just wondering if this might be GERD-related or seasonally induced because I've never actually had an attack. I've been on QVar for 2 months, prior to the spirometry, and it has done nothing for me.  Thanks.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Methacholine Challenge Interpretation",
    "content": "Hello -- You've been accurately diagnosed with asthma, the only question remaining being: What exactly is the underlying cause? Many cases of asthma are either seasonal (airborne allergens) or due to GERD, and in these cases the underlying cause must be treated as well as the symptom itself. The threshold for decreased function is largely arbitrary and the fact you didn't cross that threshold til the peak level of the challenge is splitting hairs. You've been symptomatic for six months, but as with many people, the absence of an acute episode with wheezing leaves you assuming you haven't been affected by asthma per se. The symptoms speak for themselves, and the duration strongly suggests GERD as the underlying cause. The needs to be explored independent of the pulmonary inflammation, which also needs to be treated on a regular, therapeutic basis at least until the underlying cause has been managed. If the symptoms disappear then, most likely all you'd need is to carry a rescue inhaler in case of a random severe episode.   Hope this is helpful. Good luck to you and please do follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

This is the third time in the past 4 months with the same symptoms. Flu like symptoms with a cough and a feeling of being short of breath. I had a pulmonary function test and it has come back fine.   I went back to my family doctor who prescribed a steroid inhaler, he feels I have cough asthma. I wonder if this will be effective since the masking at the hospital did nothing. I also have a great deal of anxiety when it comes to taking new medications since I tend to react badly to them.  I am presently feeling short of breath and have a lot phlegm that I can't seem to cough up very easily.  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there --  First, by \"masking\" I am going to assume you mean nebulzier breathing treatment via face mask. Is that correct?   Although the ER diagnosis was bronchitis, perhaps pneumonia, this is a very vague diagnosis and I am wondering what tests were performed to arrive at it. It does sound as though you have asthma, which will predispose to bronchitis in some people, and a steroid inhaler may well help control this. A \"rescue\" inhaler of albuteral should also be prescribed with this, in case of breakthrough symptoms.   Your O2 saturation level of 98 was very good, but one can have asthma a long time and not be compromised in that way til later or during a severe episode, so it by no means rules out asthma. You mention having phlegm that's hard to bring up. A good way to help this along is by use of guaifenesin (Mucinex brand name) which will help liquify and loosen the gunk if it's there. The steroid inhaler will help reduce the inflammation that causes the whole problem. There is also an oral antihistimine, Singulair, which works especially well for many people with this sort of problem. You might ask your doctor about it.   Since this has flared up four three times in four months it could be a broncial infection perhaps facilitated by asthma. \"Cough asthma\" is simply a manifestation of asthma where cough is the early and predominate symptom instead of wheezing and chest tightness. It is often mistaken for a chest cold. Again, the meds discussed above should help with this.   I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck and please do follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

I have taken medications other than the rescue meds (salbutamol, called albuterol here in the u.s.) on and off as prescribed by my doctor. Most of these give me an irritated throat and make me extremely jittery. The albuterol has had no side effects. Yet my doctor still says that using albuterol more than 2-3 times a week \"isn't under control\" I usually use one puff a night, sometimes I don't use it in a day, and sometimes I use it once during a workout, but it averages about one puff a day. Can this be bad for me? Are there long term side effects to albuterol? I feel I'd be better off just taking that since the preventatives have side effects and the salbutamol/albuterol hasn't.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Can salbutamol/albuterol be bad for you?",
    "content": "Hello --  This is a somewhat controversial subject you raise. There was a time when it was considered rather dangerous to use the rescue drugs more than a few times weekly, but time and experience has shown us that albuterol, at least, isn't nearly as rough on most people as previously thought, although repeated uses in succession  can definitely get you wired and even be dangerous. There are other asthma medications, intended for regular use, which contain both bronchodilators/vasoconstrictors and steroids, and these actually have a greater potential for harm, although they work wonderfully for the vast majority of people. The real problem with occasional use of albuterol instead of the preventive meds is that it doesn't subdue the underlying condition the way the other meds do. However, it is a difficult call, and if you're only having to do this two or three times per week, while it technically is not \"controlled\" asthma, that's not too bad, especially if you don't suffer the annoying side effects some people do. In order to explore more options as to how to treat this, you may need to get either a second opinion or perhaps a consult with a pulmonologist. The latter plan probably wouldn't bother your doctor as much, but really the point is to make your life as healthy and enjoyable as possible, not keep your doctor happy. I hope this helps. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Why would a doctor prescribe vitamins to an asthma patient?",
    "content": "Hello --  Forceval is a run-of-the-mill multivitamin/mineral supplement which doesn't contain enough of any single component to make too much of a difference, and certainly not in asthma. Your doctor may have felt this would just help improve your overall health, and it certainly shouldn't do any harm, but is an odd thing to prescribe. I have no idea what the point of doing that was, unless it will cost you less via insurance than it would over the counter.  Loratadine (Claritin) makes sense because it is a mild, non-drowsy antihistimine, and asthma is often managed in part with an antihisitmine. The problem with this, if there is one, is that it can sometimes thicken  the secretions associated with asthma. On the other hand, it often helps disarm the allergens responsible for the asthma. It's not dangerous, but it sometimes can make the secretions more difficult to cough up. There is a better choice, Singulair, which seems to work better with asthma, but is prescription only, so may be more expense than you're willing to take on. If you choose to go with loratadine (which can help as well as aggravate the problem), probably you should add Mucinex (plain) or a generic gauifenesin to help keep the secretions free while the loratadine does its primary job, which is to prevent the problem up front. This would seem to be an ideal approach, especially if you can find the generic for Mucinex. Again,  I don't know what the Forceval is  for except perhaps to just give your overall health a little boost. No harm, at least, but could have been suggested instead of prescribed.  Hope this is helpful. Good luck to you and please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  \"The weather\" doesn't really explain much of anything. The cats may or may not be responsible. Has your son spent time with them before? If so, was there any respiratory distress or even cold symptoms? While the cats are certainly suspect, asthma can (and usually does) appear suddenly, but there is also usually a cause, something new introduced into the environment. However, many times a new airborne allergy can cause it, and it doesn't necessarily have to be the cats. The cats are, however, more suspect than \"the weather.\" The only weather condition that might aggravate new asthma would be a sudden, very cold snap, with extremely dry air. I  haven't been following the weather in N.O., but seriously doubt it's turned frigid there recently.   Your son should be tested for cat dander and the whole spectrum of usual suspect allergens by an allergist, and if he comes up positive for cat dander then the obvious would be confirmed. If it's something else, you can work on eliminating whatever it may be.  I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you -- and your son.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm writing for my partner, who has had coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, and lack of energy for about eight months now. It was first diagnosed as bronchitis, and then eventually asthmatic bronchitis (once it reached the 3rd or 4th month of requiring albuterol, nebulizer treatments, and the 5th ER visit).  During this time, there have been at least two rounds of antibiotics (yes, we know bronchitis is rarely caused by bacteria and won't respond to antibiotics, but this is what the doctors wanted to do), two rounds of oral steroids (one srip of prednisone and one of something else), a shot of steroids, a couple steroid inhalers, continuous use of albuterol rescue inhalers, ER trips with breathing treatments, eventually a nebulizer was sent home with two different medications. She's also had acupuncture, used aromatherapy, and has begun taking some herbs prescribed by a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner.   Her doctors (general practitioner and pulmonologist) have done multiple x-rays, a CT scan, various blood tests, and a bronchioscopy in their attempts to rule out a number of other illnesses.   During all this time, she's gone back and forth from feeling horrible with no energy, lots of breathing trouble, and frequent coughing spells, to feeling fairly well and almost \"normal\", not to mention every stage in between.  After all this time, we're understandably quite frustrated every time her health takes another down turn, and would greatly appreciate any further advice or information you might be able to offer us. Does asthmatic bronchitis usually take this long to recover from? Is there anything else we can do? Is there anything else we should ask her doctors to do? (She's unemployed at the moment, largely because of this, and receives her medical care from the local Veteran's Administration.)   Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  I can certainly understand your frustration (and your partner's as well, of course). This problem can be infuriating, because it  tends to be self-perpetuating, and unless the underlying cause can be determined. While the primary cause is often something relatively simple, like a deep sinus infection, it can also be some environmental contaminant (mold? excessive dust?) and the approach the doctors have taken in treating the symptoms of  the obstructive symptoms actually makes sense and  is  consistent with what's normally done. The realy challenge is finding what triggers this, and that may require some detective work beyond the capability of the current medical help.   You might try taking  note of what's  going on  or is in the environment when the problem flares up, and try to correlate these  (if any are evident) with those times that the problem worsens. I realize this  places an inordinate amount of responsibilithy on the patient (or the both of you), but this is typically a difficult problem to manage until and unless the cause can be found.   I hope this is at least somewhat helpful. Best of luck to you both, and please  follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: I have pectus Excavatum (mild), get checked for Asthma?",
    "content": "Hello -  While  pectus excavatum can predispose to some breathing limitation in selected individuals, the symptoms you describe sound more like  classic response to cold air and,  yes, possibly asthma. All the symptoms are classic for sensitivity to cold, dry air, which can aggravate asthma if there is a predisposition. However, a lot of people without any of the above may also respond this way. The inability to breathe through your nose may be due to something obstructive in that area, however, such as a deviated septum or nasal polyps. This is easy enough to check, but for the vital capacity questions, a simple  pulmonary function test at your doctor's office should be sufficient to determine whether you need further study for asthma (or other pulmonary problems) or not. If  you can get one of the little plastic asthma meter gizmos often used for preliminary testing and take it with you on one of your jogs and blow into it after having exercised in cold air, you may be  able to provide this extra bit  of provocative testing that may be difficult to duplicate in the office. If you can blow at least a 300 under those conditions you probably have no real problems. However,  the doctor's office is still the gold standard for figuring this out,  so that's my suggestion. If you wind up keeping the  asthma checker (assuming your doctor uses these  very handy little give-away things) you could also try the cold air experiment.  Hope this is helpful to you. Best of luck, and please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

Of course, i could not sleep for long. already flushed my nose several times. my throat still seems sore, although i didnt cough. and the entite nasal passage seems sore with a kinda dry and slight burning feeling. today, the condition is little ok, with a slight pain in the forehead and right nose(i sneezed a lot), but i feel uncomfortable at that soreness. as soon as the nose is jammed, it starts watering and this is extremely irritating at the school.  any instant aid? dust is unavoidable here at roads and bare fields.  also, i have heard of \"dust mite allergy\", but never of \"dust allergy\". are there so many mites in roadside dust?  what am i suffering from?\n\n",

    "content": "If indeed this is an allergic reaction to dust (i.e. a histamine reaction), then an antihistamine medication would suffice.  Also, this time of the year, head colds are prevalent in which case symptoms like headace, stuffy nose, sore throat, fever, chills and cough are typical.   I would treat a runny stuffy nose with gentle nasal saline spray and an over the counter antihistamine.  Ibuprofen or acetaminophen and salt water gargles for sore throat.  If the nose becomes more dry with the antihistamine then stop it for a day or two.   Among other remedies, homemade chicken noodle soup is good for head colds. If in doubt about what to do, call or see your family physician...and of course consult Mom or Dad.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi -  This is often caused by a muscle  pull or muscle irritation. It can also be due to an irritated nerve or, in some instances, pleurisy. In each case the initial treatment would  be the same, which is pretty simple: it should respond,  in any of these cases, to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofin (Advil) or naproxyn (Aleve).   If this approach doesn't resolve the problem and it's really disruptive, then by all means have it checked by a physician. However, it's a pretty common complaint and most often will respond to one of those over-the-counter meds.  Hope this helps!\n\n",

I have recently been diagnosed with Narcolepsy and I take Provigil to help that.  Other than that I am normal, I have no allergies(that I know of), a little bit of anemia that it was suggested I take a multivitamin for and I do everyday, and thats about all.  I just want an explanation for always being out of breath on the court even though usually I'm the guy thats in the best shape out there.  If there is a real problem, what kind of doctor should I see?  Thanks, Greg\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Short of Breath While playing basketball.  24 y/o male",
    "content": "Hello -  While your guess at asthma is a good one, I'd want to eliminate any cardiac-related causes first, such as some sort of structural abnormality. While this seems relatively unlikely, especially since you've had the problem since you were 10, it would make sense to have this ruled out first -- unless that's already been done.   So let's assume you've ruled out (or will rule out) any sort of congenital structural abnormality of the heart. That would likely leave exertionally-induced asthma as the likely culprit. This usually (but not always) occurs secondary to gastroesophgeal reflux disease (GERD), and exercise seems to cause a flowover of gastric juices, which are aspirated (it also happens at night quite often, during sleep), irritating the bronchi and resulting in shortness of breath after brief exertion. Basketball would be good for that for sure.   But first I'd try and have an echocardiogram done, just to be certain there's not something (it would most likely be a malfunctioning valve) going on with your heart. Quite possibly, given the right primary caregiver, you could get this all done at once.   I hope this is helpful to you and that you'll follow up with us if you have any further information, antything new comes up, or when you have an exam to determine what may be causing this problem. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, People like you who are very sensitive to cats will react to the clothing worn by cat owners in their homes and carried into yours.  It may be necessary for you to change his clothing and bag everything once he is at your home.  Laundering the items will probably take care of it for you.  This can be very inconvenient but worth it.  Perhaps he could wear his pajamas to your home and change into clothes there - you bag the P.J.'s and after a few days wash several of them together carefully with as little exposure as possible (Pour out of the plastic bag into the washer - try not to handle them and wash your hands well once you start the washer).  Maybe his mother could actually dress him at your house in the clothing you have kept away from any contact with their house and this would just be part of his \"normal\" routine.  You don't want him to feel badly about the situation so if you can be matter-of-fact about the way you do things, it will help.  Of course you will need to wash and replace the clothing periodically.    It's a lot of work but I have seen some strong reactions to just clothing items that have been in a home with cats - even a very clean and tidy home.  This should not prevent you from being able to enjoy your nephew and care for him.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I will say though the the likelyhood of the inhaler causing his death if it was a common albuterol or Xopenex inhaler is very low.  These inhaled medicines are commonly used by all age groups as prescribed by their pediatrician or family doctor.  BUT!!!!! As with ALL medicines it is always best to keep them safely away from children but if they were to manage a spray (it takes some coordination and depends on the age of the child) it probably won't hurt them.

    "content": "Hello,  I am a 45 year old female, and a very recently reformed smoker.  I have a family and personal history of bronchitis, but also a family history (10 or more relatives) of life long smoking with no cancer, or pulminary or breathing problems, including both parents and their siblings.  (Most are in their 60's now)  Five years ago, I started to have short bouts of shortness of breath.  Sometimes they are seasonal (worse in the spring or the fall) or caused by pollution or being around fumes like dryer sheets.  Sometimes the bouts come about for no reason I am aware of and usually last for no more than a day.  Then my breathing returns entirely to normal.  I walk one to two miles a few times a week and have no problem with exertion.  Occassionally, the cold air will hurt my lungs, or during one of these one day bouts, I may feel my heart beating strongly on the way up the stairs.  But this resolves.  However, in the past three days, I have had constant chest pain upon inhalation, extreme shortness of breath and fatigue.  I went to the emergency room and my oxygen level was 97, and then 100 percent after oxygen.  My chest xray was completely normal. My lungs, upon listening, were entirely clear and without sound or wheezing.  I blew into some sort of instrument (not a spirometer) and I exhaled at 350, with 400 being normal for my age and height, according to the nurse.  The doctor tended to think it wasn't COPD because it was intermittent, my lungs sounded good, my oxygen was fine.  I know that COPD sometimes doesn't show any signs in the early stages.  My breathing is better this afternoon.  I am no longer smoking.  Please keep in mind that I also have reflux and what feels like constant post nasal drip.  I am not coughing, although when I clear my throat, I almost always bring up a little phlegm.  Could I be experiencing a bout of COPD?  The doctor felt I had Hyperactive Airways Disease and he sent me home.  Please give me you thoughts.  Thank you,\n\n",

Your symptoms may be due to reactive airway disease (asthma) or possibly due to a viral infection causing worsening cold symptoms.

It may also be helpful to try using a dose of albuterol during one of these episodes to see if it helps some.  Your doctor can help decide if this would be warranted.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  It sounds like an asthma is the cause of your symptoms.  Asthma is due to an inflammatory process in the respiratory airway a disease r which esults in spasm of the muscles of the bronchial way and narrowing of the respiratory tract and decreased airflow.  Personal and/or family history of allergies are present in most patients with asthma.  Symptoms are usually periodic and vary in duration, may last from few minutes up to few days.  Wheezing and shortness of breath are the most common presenting symptoms for asthma. The condition usually  pericipiates by exposure to certain allergens such as, as moist air, molds, dust mites, pollens and molds.  Symptoms are also exacerbated with exercise. Wheezing usually resolves either spontaneously.  Other patients presents with cough with or without sputum (phlegm), Chronic shortness of breath that is aggravated with exercises and mandate the us of accessory respiratory muscles.   Diagnosis is made by careful history and examination. Auscultation of the chest during the episode shows the very characteristic wheezing sounds. In between attacks the chest is normal on examination  People with mild asthma (infrequent attacks) may use relief medication as needed. Those with persistent asthma should take control medications on a regular basis to prevent symptoms from occurring.   I advise you to follow up with your doctor for proper management.  Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello - I have to concur with (and defer to) DeL Wolcott on this, because studies have shown that Singulair does, in fact, act selectively on the specialized tissues of the airway, including bronchial tree. While it is an antihistimine and logically it should interfere with the skin  reactions, it is unique and peculiar in this respect. It's possible your doctor felt you were likely to have a significant allergic reaction to one or more of the skin test agents and decided to avoid that. I'd be very curious to know what might have happened without the usual meds on board, but your doctor knows best.\n\n",

    "content": "For iceyblueeys38:  The practice of rinsing the mouth after using an Advair inhaler is that often there is left in the mouth a residual amount of the two active ingredients, which not only can cause annoying sensations of dryness and after-taste, but can, due to the steroid's masking effect and lowering of natural immunity locally, allow the develpment of candida albicans in the mouth and pharynx. To avoid this happening, a brisk rinse after use is recommended by the manufacturer and has been borne out by studies as effective.  Hope this answers your question.\n\n",

And for some reason it seems I can only slow the breathing down by covering my mouth with my hand. One night while sleeping I woke up choking. I could inhale but could not breathe out. Well I went to the doctor's and the doctor told me I have chronic allergies and a hyperreactive airway. So II decided to do some research online about the hyperreactive airway and kept coming up with asthma. But the doctor told something that my hypereactive airway disease could trigger asthma. So now I am confused is the hyperreactive airway disease just another name for asthma? And if not what are the differences between the two?  Thanks for your time\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  Inhaling but having difficulting exhaling is pretty much the technical definition of the mechanism of asthma, as the  upper airway and bronchial tree become narrowed due to either irritation, allergy or autoimmune response (usually linked to emotions). You pretty well describe asthma, and your doctor has apparently tried to avoid a definitive diagnosis by suggesting hyperactive upper airway, which simply means your airway is  hypersensitive -- and you have episodes of asthma. The \"hypersensitive\" part is really redundant. While it's not precisely another name for asthma, the result is the same, and some doctors prefer to break down the diagnosis to this extreme. The end result is the same, the  treatment is the same, and when you cannot exhale easily it is because you are experiencing asthma. Due to what is open to question, but the treatment of the acute problem still remains the same. There is really no functional difference between  the two.  Hope this is helpful. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Allergies are basically an overreaction to substances called allergens (could be food, pollen, animal dander, etc.).  The reaction in the body is a release of histamine when the body tries to rid itself of what it perceives as an offender.  Usually this is a termporary condition as long as the allergen is present and the host is exposed.  Asthma is an actual blockage of the airways, which results in breathing difficulties.  It can be brought on by allergies or by exercise, weather extremes, air pollution, etc.  It is considered a chronic health condition, though it can be controlled with medication, therapy, biofeedback, etc.     As far as treatment goes, the best thing to be done with allergens is to avoid the irritant, but allergy shots are also given to try to accustom the body gradually to the offending substance so it will not continue to be perceived as foreign.  Asthma treatment focuses on restoring breathing through dilation of the bronchial tubes, allowing better air exchange.  Other medications also relieve symptoms and of course offending substances that trigger asthma should also be avoided.  I hope this helps you to differentiate between the two.\n\n",

If it's caused by something else, it is considered to be secondary to whatever the cause may be. In your case it would seem to be allergy-mediated.  As to your second question, while  250 is a big drop in general, if it is down from 750, someone was blowing some really big air volume. At 500 you are doing very well. It  is hard to imagine someone blowing a 750. Still, a drop of 250 is big, yes.\n\n",

Sometimes, however, the doctor will want to do it with the medication on board to see if it is  working. Apparently yours wasn't doing the trick. Then again, cromalyn sodium is usually prescribed for nasal allergies and isn't as effective for asthma in most cases.   I hope the asthma is now managed well. Good luck to you.\n\n",

Over the last few years I have developed hayfever and quite severe allergies to fur etc.  I noticed about a year ago that when I stayed at a friends who had a cat I was wheezing and coughing and had to go home.  I went to see my GP who took a peak flow reading etc and advised me to take an antihistamine every day to prevent this but he believed it to be my allergies.  Since Saturday however (5 days ago) I did not come into contact with any animals but suddenly started coughing which led to wheezing.  I have been taking antihistamines every day but it has not been helping.  Could it be that I just have a cough and it is going to my chest or do I have asthma?  I am now wheezing constantly and have been solidly for 2 or 3 days, especially at night.  If I go to the GP what tests can I expect before a diagnosis is made? Will I have to go to hospital?  Thanks for your help.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Asthma or allergies?",
    "content": "Hello misty222 -  You seem to have already proven you have both seasonal (airborn) and also environmental allergies, so the fact that you'd begun to experience asthma along with allergic rhinitis (hay fever) makes it unsurprising that you'd eventually begin to have spontaneous episodes of asthma as well. While asthma can be caused by other than allergic responses too (such as gastric reflux and post-nasal drip -- which can, in turn of course be cause by hay fever), it seems likely your attack was due to some airborne allergen. A firm diagnosis shouldn't require a hospital visit. The diagnosis is usually made by observation, listening to the lungs, and discussion of the circumstances with the patient. It's usually not too hard to diagnose asthma. The peak flow meter may not reveal much in a young, otherwise healthy person unless it is used during an episode. There is another, similar but more sophisticated in-office test called a pulmonary funtion test (PFT) which isn't much more difficult (though it is more complicated) than using a peak flow meter, but this isn't always needed.   You may benefit from certain types of antihisitimine therapy now (although some are too drying to be of much help, such as benadryl and certain others), and some sort of antihisimine will probably play a role in helping to prevent recurrences, a long-term inhaled steroid-based medication will probably be necessary as well, for maintainance, and you should be prescribed an albuterol inhaler (\"puffer\") as well, as a \"rescue\" measure for when things get out of hand (as they already seem to have on at least the one occasion). The albuterol inhaler woguaifenesinuld give you immediate relief and the other things would work on reducing the long-term likelihood of another attack.  While it is entirely possible you have somehow contracted bronchitis during all this, the same treatment would apply and I suspect very strongly you have asthma secondary to an airborne allergy and it may have been made worse by the drying effect of whatever antihistimine you've been using (there are now some types designed specifically for people with asthma). It might also help to try using, on occasion, an over-the-counter medication called guaifenesin, which also comes in a long-acting form under the brand-name Mucinex. There are also now generic forms  of this long acting guaifenesin available at most drugstore chains.   Good luck to you with this and I hope by now the problem is well under control, but please do follow up with us.\n\n",

    "title": "Asthma, sleeping and panicking",
    "content": "I was diagnosed with asthma about 10 years ago when I lived in Denver.  It was being triggered by the cold weather, hay, pollen, and grasses.  I moved to Southern California five years ago and haven't had any problems at all...until recently.  A little over a week ago, I started noticing that I was getting short of breath doing the simplest things and that I had started wheezing sometimes.  My dad suggested that it might be a result of the fires we had northeast of here, as he'd noticed some ash on the cars.  Then we had several days of very hot weather, followed by several days of cooler weather (yay!)  If it was the smoke and ash from the fire, it should have stopped by now, as we've had cool breezes and even rain the other night, which should have blown it all eastward.  My breathing has gotten worse.  I'm scheduled to see my doctor in a couple of weeks, and I hope I won't have to go in sooner.  My main problem is that sometimes when I'm trying to go to sleep, I feel as if I can't breathe.  I've tried to sleep partially lying down and also sitting up.  Sitting up works better for me, but still sometimes just as I start to fall asleep, I'm suddenly awake and trying to get air.    I do have sleep apnea, but it's never affected me like this before, and it shouldn't affect me when I'm sitting up anyway.  When I wake myself up gasping for air, I start to panic, which makes it worse, and it takes awhile for me to relax again.  And yet there are times when I sleep with no problems for several hours at a time, so I am getting some rest.  I'm on disability and rarely go out, but I do leave my window open all day and evening, so it's possible some allergens are coming in that way, although I've never triggered off anything here before.  After a couple of years of living here in Southern California and not having any asthma symptoms, I stopped getting the albuterol inhalers from the doctor.  I guess I need to start that up again.  My main concern is the panicky feeling I'm getting when I'm trying to sleep.\n\n",

Yesterday I became very short of breathe while this pain was happening so I used my 17g albuterol inhaler (i have had asthma my whole life but haven't needed to use my inhaler since i had pneumonia 15 months ago). The pain slowly subsided and was gone 15 minutes later. I used the inhaler again today when the pain came back and it worked again. My question is this: can my asthma be returning (i haven't needed to use an inhaler regularly for 10 years), and if so, is this what could be causing these pains?  If the pains are not being caused by my asthma, what else could it be?  thanks! anthony\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Anthonyboston,  Chest issues such as asthma attacks can cause abdominal pain.  In fact, more than one person has been taken to the operating room for appendicitis only to find that they actually had pneumonia.  If the albuterol is helping it is very likely that there is at least a component of asthma contributing to your symptoms.  If you are needing to use your inhaler more than about twice a week or so I would recommend you see your doctor to discuss using a controller medicine to keep your asthma better controlled.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I have athsma, diagnosed with exercise induced athsma when I was in high school (1988) and have been using albuterol since then. Two years ago my athsma became worse where I was wheezing quite a bit especially at night when I tried to go to bed. During the day my athsma is not an issue. I do not have severe athsma attacks, just spells of wheezing and some difficulty breathing normally. Exercise exacerbates this. I also have seasonal allergies, which seem to have become milder over time. I do not currently take a prescription allergy med, but have taken them in past years. I have had an allergy test, where it was found I was allergic to 1)dust mites 2)cats 3)horses in that order, but mildly allergic to all. I do live with a cat. It is not allowed where I sleep. I keep the bed and sheets washed and the room vacuumed.   I went to the doc who prescribed Advair (150/50). For the last two years I have been on it, and it has worked well. The last year I could even take one dose out of the daily two and be fine. Once in a while I would use the albuterol, very infrequently.  I am concerned with taking an oral steroid for the rest of my life due to the complications associated with that. I have bad eyesight (nearsighted) and I feel that it may have changed a little since being on the advair. I have stopped taking the advair a few weeks ago, and feel fine, but use my albuterol again more than I think is necessary, (sometimes not at all, somtimes 3 times a day).  Is a small amount of inhaled steroid considered to be the magic bullet for athsma, or do the long term side effects outweigh the benefits? Maybe the studies have not been around long enough to conclude this.  My question is: Is there an alternative to Advair that will give close to the same results but is not a inhaled corticosteriod? I have used a nebulizer and am not interested in that regiment.   Thanks for any insights / advice. I will go see my doc again (there is an athsma specialist here), but would like to be informed first.  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Laukki,  Asthma is an airways disorder. It causes the bronchus to go for spasm on exposure to inhaled allergen or to exercise. This is also associated with inflammation of the inner lining of the airway causing secretion of excess mucus and this plugging of airspace thus causing more obstruction.  To treat this we doctors have a two pronged strategy. One is to give you meds such as Salmeterol which relaxes the muscle of the bronchi causing it to relax and let more air pass. Two is to give you steroids which cuts down on inflammation which reduces the mucus secretion and prevents plugging of the airspace.   Salmeterol like medicines have side effects like fast pulse, skip beats, hand tremors, insomnia. Though none of these is too serious.  Steroids, [fluticasone in your case] have side effects like weight gain, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, weakening of bones, delayed wound healing, propensity to catch infection, changes in refraction [eye glasses] etc. Side effects of steroids are more serious.   Though needed in acute cases one does try as far as possible to avoid giving steroids. Another strategy is to give them through inhalers . Inhaled steroid have the advantage that being delivered at the site of  the disease, the dose becomes minuscule compared to oral steroids and side effects are minimal or absent.   Since you have hypertension, you must especially try to avoid orals as far as possible.    Apurva\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Pflawless,  Medications can induce these types of delirium attacks.  Unfortunately it can be difficult to figure out which one.  Steroids can cause some changes in personality/mood so it is possible that the steroid medication was the one that caused this.  However, unfortunately, it is difficult to confirm this and it may very easily have been a combination of things including the medications, the infection and even the alcohol.  I would recommend you follow up with your doctor if anything like this occurs again.  Also, you should let your doctors know about this reaction so appropriate caution can be taken in the future if needed.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Kellysmum2002,  Peak flows are used to estimate lung function related to asthma as you are describing.  When asthma symptoms increase, peak flow amounts go down.  What you are likely seeing when your peak flow drops is an increase in lung bronchospasm causing your lung function to decrease some.  Some fluctuation in the peak flow is a normal.  If your peak flow drops more consistently it may be a warning of an impending asthma flare.  If they drop for one or two readings then go back to normal it may simply be some intermittent spasming that is not predictive of impending flares unless the decreased episodes are occurring frequently.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "My son was born on 9-11 of this year and he was so healthy until he was about 2 months. One day he started vomiting a lot and I knew it was more than just a stomach virus. I took him to the er and they diagnosed him with vomiting and didn't do anything. Well he kept doing it and I decided I would take him to the hospital in another town. Well he was diagnosed him with pneumonia and they gave him a shot of an antibiotic and he went home. Well a couple of weeks later I took him back to the hospital for the same symptoms and they diagnosed with bronchitis and put him on antibiotics. A few days later I took him to his pediatrician and they tested him for rsv but he wasn't too severe. The next day I went back because he was getting worse so they put him on breathing treatments. Well he kept going back to the dr to make sure he was getting better and he was and the dr told me when to take him off the treatment. Well about a day after I took him off the treatments he started getting worse. So I put him back on the treatments and he finally got better after a few days. I took him off the treatments again to see what would happen and today he starts acting really bad again. I can tell he is having trouble breathing even though he has been put back on treatments. I was just wondering if you thought maybe this was actually asthma. I am just so concerned about him and I don't know what to do. I just want my baby to be healthy and for the past month and a half he has been so sick. I don't even take him out of the house unless it is absolutely necessary. I'm so worried that he will be hospitalized so please give me any info you can. Thanks.\n\n",

I would encourage you to talk to your pediatrician about this.  In the meantime keep notes to share with the doctor regarding his behavior, what was going on when the attack occurred, any possible environmental triggers, if he had cold symptoms, fever, etc.  Your doctor should be able to evaluate him for this so express your concern as you have here, specifically telling the doctor you would like to find out if the baby might have asthma.

    "content": "Hi, all.  Here's my history; I'll try to be brief.  I need some input and advice.  When I was 10 years old, I began experiencing allergy and asthma problems.  Allergy tests showed I was allergic to everything, dogs, cats, grass, pollen, etc.  I was put on antihistamines and that was it.  My parents did not get rid of their dogs; in fact, I have been raised with multiple dogs all my life (I am now 43).    When I was 27, I stayed with a friend who had a cat and had a severe asthma attack.  I went to the ER and was put on an Albuterol inhaler, and I never had a problem again, until two weeks ago.  My husband brought home a horrible chest cold, and I got it.  It seemed like I was getting better, but then I started experiencing shortness of breath, wheezing, coughing, chest tightness-all the hallmarks of asthma.  My family doc put me on Advair 500/50, a nebulizer with Duoneb and Albuterol, prednisone, and a fast-acting inhaler.  My asthma is worst in the mornings and evenings, and it seems I'm always full of phlegm that I can't cough out.  I am physically exhausted from the effort to breathe all day, and I've worked myself up into a panic over the idea that I might have to part with my beloved dogs if this is allergy-induced asthma.  My family doc says it's highly unlikely that the dogs suddenly caused asthma for me, but I am still scared.  We are in the process of cleaning the house from top to bottom and have installed air filters in every room of the house.  I am scheduled to see a pulmonologist on January 7th.  I have had a chest x-ray and it was normal.  So, please, some advice-could a chest cold have really exacerbated my asthma to this extent?  Or is it something allergic?  Any input is appreciated, and thank you.\n\n",

Many things can trigger an asthma attack.  Having a chest cold is one of these \"triggers\"  any time the airway is affected it can trigger an asthma exacerbation.  The cold may go away, but until the asthma is treated ie; with prednisone, albuterol and other medications.  The asthma may get worse, it sounds like your doctor started you on these medications.    I hope you are feeling better!    Sandy RN\n\n",

My asthma is very unstable and all though I am on many maintenance drugs I become sick every few weeks and have suffered numerous hospitalizations over the last year.  The doctors suspect that my severe allergies are the cause of this, but since I am on a beta blocker for unexplained tachycardia I am unable to receive the suggested allergy shots.  My pulmonoligist and allergist have suggested another injection medicine known as Xolair which is a fairly new drug used for asthmatics.  Although it is not recommended to be given to those on beta blockers because of the risk of allergic reaction the risks are lower than of allergy shots, and the doctors are suggesting I look into it.  Since this is a newer medication I can find hardly anything about this?  Is this considered a safe drug and good option for a severe asthmatic?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Dacubster,  This is really a difficult question.  Xolair is fairly new and not a lot of information is known about it's interactions with other medicines.  Be sure you discuss very closely with your doctor the risk of anaphylaxis with this medicine.  It has been reported in patients receiving the medicine for the first time and in those who have been on the medicine for months or even over a year.  Basically, the reaction can occur with any of the injections of the medicine.  I would certainly recommend you not use this medicine unless recommended by a pulmonologist.  Also, if you are on a beta-blocker, medicines like albuterol will not work as well.  If possible, I would recommend you talk with your cardiologist about changing to a different medicine (non beta-blocker class) to control your tachycardia.  This will almost certainly help your asthma.  If you are not using singulair you may want to try this also.  This medicine is an allergy/asthma medicine that works at a different point in the pathway for allergies and can dramatically improve asthma.  It is safe to use with beta-blockers.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Supreme,  Your shortness of breath may very well be from asthma, particularly if the albuterol (Ventolin) helps.  Asthma causes constriction of the airways thereby functionally decreasing the amount of air in the lungs and making it easier to run out of breath.    If you notice you are needing to use your albuterol more than once a week or so I would recommend you see your doctor to discuss whether you may benefit from a controlling type medication rather than just the quick relief albuterol.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Kamkam2006,  It is very possible that your daughter has asthma.  Often, young children are diagnosed with bronchitis due to wheezing and treated with azithromycin (the z-pack).  This antibiotic is aimed at a bug called mycoplasma.    It is actually very uncommon for children to get classic bronchitis.  There are several reasons for this, in particular it is uncommon for children under the age of five to be infected with mycoplasma.  Most of the time it is actually an early presentation of asthma.  Many doctors, however, are reluctant to diagnose asthma based on one or two episodes of wheezing since it may be caused by a viral infection.  If a pattern of wheezing is seen it is much easier to say confidently the issue is asthma.  Follow up with your doctor is important to help sort all this out.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Commonly nothing shows up on blood work looking for infections.  Partially this is because many of these infections are due to viruses that don't have specific tests for them.  Also, as I have previously mentioned some pediatricians, including myself, don't believe that children get bronchitis like adults do.  Almost always, the \"bronchitis\" is actually asthma that is being misdiagnosed.  Asthma and allergies are in the same category of disease.  It is thought that asthma is, at least partially, caused by an allergic reaction in the lungs.  This category of illness is called atopic illnesses and includes asthma, allergies and eczema.  Seeing the allergist will be helpful to optimize the treatment for her allergies.  Best wishes.  I'm glad to hear your daughter is doing a little better.\n\n",

    "content": "I am wondering if the symptoms I am experiencing could be asthma or something else? Im a 22yo healthy female and have experienced a tight feeling when breathing out several times in the past--mostly with cold weather.  Last fall, i began experiencing this tightness more often even when it was not cold out and my dr gave me albuterol and said it was bronchospasms probably due to some allergies although the diagnosis of allergies has not been confirmed.  Since last year  have gone through 2-3 periods of a few weeks where I will have this tightness several times a day and I have been using albuterol  to help that.  When the last episode began a few days ago, he told me to come in so he could hear me breathe but when I went it, he said that I am not wheezing at all so he cant say that it is asthma.  He just put me on a steriod inhaler to try to decrease daily episodes of needing albuterol.  For the past few months I have also been experiencing post nasal drip with tons of mucus in my throat (which I notice especially with eating).  Does this all sound like asthma, even if I don't have wheezing at all?   Thanks for your response!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Nesha,  This certainly could be consistent with asthma.  If the shortness of breath is severe sometimes no wheezing is heard because not enough air is moving through the lungs. Otherwise, it is nice to be able to hear wheezing when diagnosing asthma.    If the albuterol helps then you almost certainly have at least a component of bronchospasm which is the hallmark of asthma.  I would recommend you follow up with your doctor when you feel these tightness episodes occuring so you can be evaluated.  Using the inhaled steroid is a good idea as it is a central treatment for asthma.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I am currently taking Singulair for allergies, two inhalers (QVar...I think and another one), an NSAID and a muscle relaxer.   I've been healthy most of my life and never went to a Dr or clinic. Started a new job working outside, and crazy stuff has happened since. I soon developed nosebleeds during the summer that usually followed blowing my nose, and they never seemed to want to stop or slow down.(only from one nostril at a time, usually my right one).  I developed sciatica and suffered with the pain down the back of my left leg for a long time before I finally went to the clinic (my insurance isn't so good). They prescribed pain meds (which I only took maybe 3 or 4 of) and steroids. It finally went away.  This year, starting soon after the sciatica was over, I started getting cramps in my back from twisting to get tools from my toolbelt. Felt like a charlie horse. Started out not so bad.....a little stretching and rubbing and it was gone. NOW, I get those 'catches' in my back, but they pale in comparison to the new ones I get just inside the bottom of my rib cage. They get INTENSE at times. Stretching does nothing, but bending over forward seems to releive it some. Lately they've been coming a lot.  Sorry so long............I went to a clinic like 2 weeks ago because of a bad night-cough that was keeping my wife awake and waking me up at crazy hours. The Doc listened to my chest and said I have asthma (which I don't think I do......but he's the doc). He prescribed inhalers, singulair, etc...........but I still get the cough.  My rib pains were there before the cough. I went to the clinic the other day because my ribs would 'catch' so bad while working (usually on right side). A different doc prescribed muscle relaxer to take at night, and NSAID to take during day. I've been using everything as told to, but I STILL get these charlie horses in my ribs and back (usually from twisting a certain way). Also, when I wake in the morning after sleeping off the muscle relaxer, I'm sore and weak all over until I move around for a while.  I just wonder why the pains? Would asthma do this? I drink plenty of water because I work regardless of weather, and it seems to peak in Summer, but I'm desperately trying to find someone with the same pain as I have. ANY help at all would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Nighthawk5556,  Asthma can certainly cause a severe cough, particularly at nighttime.  It would be a little unusual for it to suddenly present at age 31 but not impossible.  I would be somewhat suspicious that you may have an infection called an atypical pneumonia.  This can cause some inflammation of the lungs and the lining of the lungs (termed pleurisy).  Pleurisy can cause the catching feeling you are experiencing.  Treatment for this pneumonia is generally with an antibiotic called azithromycin.  If your cough is not getting better I would recommend you see your doctor again.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello All,  My son when he was 1 and half year old started having coughing issues. The Pediatrician initially told us to give cough medicine. They later asked us to give Albeturol(Nebulizer). When we gave nebulizer, he was OK. Then again(when we stopped) he would cough(as if something is stuck in his chest).   We went to a pulmonary specialist and he could NOT find anything. The Pediatrician asked us to give Singulair(4 mg powder) a try for a month and see how he does. We gave him Singular every day in his food and he did NOT cough for a month. After a month, when we stopped, around after 4-5 days he started coughing again(This was during summer, so I think there would be no allergies/flu/cold season). We again started Singulair and he is doing fine  Also, when we were NOT giving Singulair or Albeterol(and were NOT sure about Asthama), giving him bath before he slept was a good option(he did NOT cough those days). We live in an apartment and have carpet(so may be due to that we have an issue)  Last month when we went on a vacation with Singulair in his regular medicine, he had some issues with coughing after catching cold (This may be due to he riding a horse, being in water for long and getting a little cold or could be dust mites in the place we were). We had to give Pulmocort and Albeterol and that helped  When we ask the doctor, he says It MIGHT be Asthama... I don't understand why he would say It MIGHT be?? Can he NOT say it is or it isn't?  I know, you guys would NOT say for sure.. but has anyone seen similar behaviour of their child's asthama like this. He was fine until he was 1 and half years.. so I am NOT sure if it is Asthama(although - seeing that Singulair helps, it seems it is)  Will he have to take medicine all his life? I do NOT want to give medicine to my child forever and would also like to know alternative medicine (if any).   Thoughts?\n\n",

    "content": "There is a condition called \"hidden asthma\" that can be difficult even for a physician to detect with an examination and stethoscope.  You didn't mention what kind of tests the pulmonologist did for your son.  It is possible that more extensive testing might reveal this condition.    Allergies can trigger asthma so he may be dealing with this (perhaps to some of the things you suggested) and you might also benefit from a consultation with an allergist.  If you get the allergies under control, the asthmatic symptoms may not occur as often at least.  If you identify the substances your son is sensitive to, you can do much to reduce the exposure, thus reducing the asthma attacks.  Asthma cannot be cured but it can be controlled and your son may need lifelong medications, at least he may need to have them available when needed, which is not to say he would have to have them every day by any means.  There is a wide array of medications used to treat this condition so your doctor will need to work with you to achieve the safest medication at the lowest dose possible that is still effective in controlling the asthma.  I cannot say what will work best for your child but it sounds like you are on the right track with the success you have achieved so far.    Singulair is not intended for immediate relief during an asthma attack so the alternative inhalers are also important.  It does appear to be a safe treatment for children.  Good luck.  I think you are a very responsible and alert parent who will be able to help your child to stay healthy.\n\n",

The vocal cords are located at the top of the wind pipe (trachea) and are not affected with asthma.  Similarly vocal cord spasms do not cause constriction of the airways within the lungs.  Vocal cord spasms are essentially when the vocal cords close (occluding the airway some) due to a muscle spasm.  Often this condition can be treated quite successfully with some training exercises to teach the affected person how to relax these muscles (through biofeedback training, etc.)  Best wishes.\n\n",

I was pescribed a steroid nasal spray (Nasonex). The doctor also prescribed an oral steroid, Prednesolone, and my peak air flow increased from 350 to 510. Its now been at about 500 for the last two weeks, occassionally dropping to 450, but this made no difference to my breathing problems on exertion. Because of cramp problems with Serevent I was put on Symbicot 200/6 two puffs twice a day. This was increased by the asthma nurse to 4 times a day for a week, however this has had no effect at all on my breathing problems. Even using Salbuterol reliever has had no effect. So, what's going on? Could my breathing difficulties be due to some other cause ?  I was also put on a weeks course of Amoxicillin in case my nasal problems were bacterial as I was also having feverish bouts. There has been an improvement in the amount of thick mucus, but no effect on asthma symptoms.    Family history: Father had severe asthma\n\n",

    "title": "Asthma - Usage of Ventolin Inhaler",
    "content": "Hi there.  BACKGROUND: I have been asthmatic since a very, very young age. I am 20 now.  I am of Asian origin but I have been in Australia for 3 years for educational purposes (thought this might be of relevance when it comes to what triggers asthma attacks).  Before I go to bed at night, I'll feel difficulty in breathing. I felt the same thing when I was back in Malaysia for my 3 months holiday. I am not sure how long I have been experiencing this but i think it has gone on for about a year. I had been asthma-attack-free for quite a good number of years before it started bugging me again. When i came to Australia 3 years ago, symptoms of asthma started to set in. Difficulty in breathing at night only became consistent bout a year ago.  QUESTION: Before bed, due to difficulty in breathing, I'll use the Ventolin Inhaler (puffer). Directly after that, my breathing will suddenly become more difficult, and I'll feel a sudden dizziness, which goes away in 2 secs. Can you please explain to me why is that?  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: I am 167cm tall. I was 83kg. I joined the gym a year ago, and had since been doing consistent cardio and weight training. I do badminton, squash, cycling etc. I am now a 69kg. I have been eating healthy, so I have not been sacrificing nutrition to get slim fast.  Thanks and I really hope to hear from you soon.  From, veryworried.\n\n",

    "content": "Many group practices allow this because they understand it is important to find a good \"fit\" and they know that people respond better to someone they can relate to comfortably.  Other groups do not allow this kind of change, so the first thing to do is inquire of the staff if changing within the group is acceptable there.  Most doctors understand this concept and welcome this flexibility.  Secondly, you could have restrictions inflicted by your health plan.  If you have an HMO or a plan that requires a primary care provider, provisions are generally in place to change when things aren't working for you.  But, you would need to check with their customer service department to find out for sure.  Other than these two factors, I know of no reason why you shouldn't switch to a doctor you are more comfortable with.  The advantage to staying within the group is that you records are already there so it is easy for the new doctor to view the history.\n\n",

She has broken 3 bones in 3 years in just minor kid accidents that should have just been a bruise. At some point, the issue of an increase in broken bones due to Advair and inhaled steroids was raised, but it appears that a couple of other studies ruled that out.  I'm not so sure that's not the case. A side affect of Advair is bone loss, but they only relate this to older adults.  I'm very concerned and looking for resources, researchers, etc. to get more information. Has anyone else experienced this, heard anything about this, or can refer any resources I could appeal to?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Sandiedog,  This is a bit of a tough thing to determine.  It seems that the vast majority of people on Advair do not really absorb enough of the steroid to get significant systemic effects.  Adult studies in this area are really difficult to extrapolate to children because children have active bone turnover and growth going on.  There are a few studies in children that have shown no significant impact on increased fracture rate or decrease bone mineralization when using long term inhaled steroid medicines.  Here is a good reference if you are able to look it up: Pedersen, S., \"Clinical safety of inhaled corticosteroids for asthma in children: an update of long-term trials.\" Drug Safety 29(7):599-612, 2006.  As I'm sure you know, but for the benefit of our other readers, Advair is a combination medication for asthma that contains fluticasone (an inhaled corticosteroid) and salmeterol (a long acting beta-agonist).  Best wishes.\n\n",

Many places have local community health agencies that can see you for a sliding scale fee - one based on each client/patient's income level. If that is not an option in your area, I strongly advise that you \"do the math\".  The symptoms you describe are potentially serious enough that you would be wise to consider which is the more prudent gamble:  making arrangements for payments at a hospital emergency room to find out if you have some medical situation occurring that can be treated now, vs a false alarm that would eventually perhaps clear on its own. OR:  to save the dollars now and end up with a potentially serious situation that if left unattended might even become critical, perhaps even life-threatening.  Sometimes, choices aren't between good and bad, they are between bad and worse.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello.   Breathing nearly stops from exposure.  When I go near some specific things my chest tightens up, air way closes almost completely sounding like a laugh from \"revenge of the nerds\" movie or a donkey, throat gets really sore. Some things do it instantly and others slowly shut my breathing down. The only thing I can do is move away or out of that area. After I move away I return to normal after I get a few clean breaths in. Most of these things I am allergic to, flowers, my bird I had to give away because of this, even oil paint fumes and people smoking. I am other wise healthy. I take antihistamine which helps but only in some cases, not all. It is a huge problem when I am in traffic with exhaust fumes from trucks and road dust.  I was able to get a doctor to give me an albuterol inhaler and was referred to an allergist. When I use this inhaler I can breathe like never before and these exposures make my lower throat feel really strange but breathing is better than perfect for hours after use.  I took my doctors advise and went to an allergist. The allergist found allergies but said they shouldn't cause breathing problems. The allergist did not know where to send me.  Excessive exercise isn't a problem either so I kinda self ruled out asthma. Might it be asthma? Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Yellowwheel, Breathing problems are the department of a specialty called Pulmonology, and the specialists are called Pulmonologists.  From what you describe you do have serious breathing reactions to certain environmental allergens.  These allergens can indeed cause something called anaphylaxis which is a life threatening reaction to a substance you come into contact with. I appreciate that you followed the referral to an allergen, and respect what may have occurred during that visit.  At the same time, what you are describing in terms of \"inhaled\" allergens - dust, exhaust, certain other smells - even perfume or flowers can set it off!- is a very very serious reaction.  Bronchospasms (your airway closing to the point you sound like a \"donkey\" when you breathe) especially to the degree you describe is potentially life threatening. The tiny alveoli in your lungs can also be rendered helplessly ineffective in exchanging oxygen in your lungs.The inhaler may buy you time, but you need to have a specialist evaluate you for the severity of your symptoms and put you on an ongoing regimen of medications, lifestyle management, and self-rescue techniques.  I would suggest you ask your primary MD today for a referral to such a specialist!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear yellowwheel, For the sake of general education, yes I can answer, at least to a degree. 1.  Albuterol MDI (metered dose inhaler) is a powerful medication useful to an asthmatic to help restore breathing.  At the same time, its chemical method of action can cause multiple side effects such as tachycardia (fast heart rate) , nervousness, palpitations sleeplessness, tremors, headache, flushing, irritability, even chest discomfort.  Sometimes frequent use of the medication can build up in the body and cause other discomforts including nausea and difficulty urinating.   2.  Medications are dosed according to how fast they affect the system, how long the effect lasts, and the safe time between doses.  It is never intended to store up medications that are not used today to double or triple up tomorrow.  That would be \"overdosing\", and can have very bad end results.    The best thing is for you to ask the pulmonologist to order you the right medication - or combination of medications best suited to your need and lifestyle.\n\n",

    "content": "25 yr old female I have been dianosed with astma 5 months ago after a battle with bronnchitits its proving difficulit for me, i also suffer from svt which i don't take meds for anymore, i am on flovent 110 mcg 2 times daily and albuterol rescue inhailer as need which i need  like 3 times a day and also a nebulizer that i take as need that i need like one a week my asthma is not under control becuse its new still and im learning how to control it. No one in my family has asthma and the pulomonologist says that it must be a combination of adult onset astma the weather. They don't actually know why i have it just that i do and my pulmonary lung function test look good i test at mainly 91 percent but had air trapping and and evidence of tiny air sacs dying. Im not convinced of anything anymore becuase on min its only in one section of my lung then in my upper airway and the dr even heard a palpable thril in my left lung that you could hear across the room. So this has all been difficult. Well i had another asthma attack this time was different it started so i took my resue inhailer the albuterol and it didnt get better i got dizzy and my hands went tinggily, so my work called and the ambulance came and began taking me to the hospital while in the ambulance they gave me a nebulizer treatment and i got really sleepy at that point i could breath but my hands were still numb so i looked down and my hands were rock hard and stiff and i couldnt move them my face was mumb and my feet were also, they tried getting a line in but couldnt the paramedic asked me if i ever had a stoke becuase of this, he got nervous and rushed me to the er, the doctor came in an told me that i hyperventalated and thats why it happened i don't remember doing that, he never ran any test and sent me home with just telling me to control my astma better. Is this what really happened my hands and my face often swell and im not convinced i hyperventilated. Is there any other reason for this.\n\n",

    "content": "There may actually be a link between the asthma and hyperventilation in your case.  It may be that your severe asthma was flaring causing you to become agitated and hyperventilate.  Your asthma appears to be in the category of severe persistent asthma, given that you are needing to use albuterol multiple times per day (essentially continuous symptoms).  As such, it is appropriate for you to be using a medication called advair which is a combination of fluticasone (found in flovent) and salmeterol (a long-acting beta-agonist, a longer acting cousin of albeterol).  Also, I would recommend that you see an allergist to see if you may have some allergic trigger to your asthma.  You may also benefit from a leukotriene inhibitor (such as singulair).  Asthma can be life threatening in severe cases so it is important to get this under control.  Control means that you are using your albuterol no more than 1-2 X per week (with a better goal of 1-2 times per month).  Best wishes.  Follow up with your pulmonologist is important.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi -- I've been on Nasacort AQ, Singulair, and Advair Diskus for two-three months.  I had an episode of throat thrush from the Advair after about two weeks and it was quickly resolved with a pill.  For about 3 weeks I seem to have trouble breathing through my nose; it feels dry to me, but sounds sort of congested.  I find myself holding one nostril closed in order to breathe in comfortably at times.  It's also sort of embarrassing.  Do you thinks it's from inflammation, maybe caused by the Advair?  That's the only thing I can guess at.  I'm a 64-yr. old female recently diagnosed with \"reversible airway disease\" which I guess is really asthma, and also probable COPD.  I'm not very comfortable with the diagnosis but that's another issue.  Thanks for any thoughts.\n\n",

    "content": "It would seem a little unusual for advair or your allergy medicines to cause nasal congestion.  Theoretically they should help reduce inflammation and congestion, especially the nasal spray.  It may be related to drier air than normal or a viral infection.  You may want to try using a nasal moisturizer (such as saline spray or gel).  These are essentially water so there is no danger of drug interactions, etc. and they are same to use as often as needed.  Don't use it within an hour or so of using the allergy nasal spray or it may wash the allergy medicine out of the nose.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I have a hard time running because when I try to run I have difficulty breathing. Just the other day, for example, I ran 2 blocks to catch the train and by the time I had ran 1/4 of a block I was already out of breath; I had a hard time recovering my breath once I got inside the train. I estimate it took me about 15 minutes to achieve a normal breathing rhythm. I am overweight, so this might be the cause of the problem. I don't know. I find that I run out of breath faster than I run out of energy, however.  In a somewhat unrelated note, I have also noticed that I have a hard time breathing even when I am not exercising because my nose almost always seems congested. It doesn't matter if I blow my nose or take anti-allergy medications. My nostrils rarely feel \"clean.\" I have noticed that sometimes sudden changes in temperature help open up my nostrils. For example, if I have this problem during the winter when the temperature is cold, I find that going outside the house for a few seconds helps me open up my nostrils. It's a great sensation but it doesn't last too long.  How likely is it that either or both of these two symptoms is an indicative of asthma?\n\n",

One could also use an injectable lidocaine that may help numb the artery a little but I suspect this part will still hurt.  Numbing the skin will help some, though.  Feel free to request this the next time you need a blood gas.  If your asthma is bad enough to need blood gasses it sounds like you have pretty severe asthma.  I would recommend you see a pulmonologist if you are not already.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you Doc for the information.  I have always done the right thing when it comes to controlling my asthma.  I follow the new medical research very closely, and believe me, I don\u2019t slack on this.  For example, I have recently changed from the \u201cold fashioned\u201d Albuterol inhalers to the Xopenex inhalers, which are fantastic.  And the Singulair and Advair are just doing wonders.  Also, and I should have done this a long time ago\u2026I purchased a very good nebulizer, and I have the new Xopenex for that as well.  I\u2019m a very active guy\u2026I build pipe organs for a living, I play basketball, and I go to the gym and work out hard, and am in pretty good shape.  The problem arises because I seem to contract bacterial bronchitis frequently, and as you know, this can be potentially fatal when combined with asthma.  Now, with the nebulizer and Xopenex, if and when I have a serious problem, I can at least use the nebulizer to prevent a trip to the ER, and get solumedrol or prednisone the next day.. thus, have duplicated the exact (and all too familiar) trips and procedures in the hospital (without those annoying blood gasses as well).  But again, thank you for the info.  I really appreciate it.  If the situation arises, I will request exactly what you have stated.\n\n",

    "title": "Asthma Getting Worse/Changing?",
    "content": "I am a 38 yo male, non-smoker. I was diagnosed with asthma around age 18 and for the most part it's been mild - occasional tightness/wheezing relieved by albuterol. A few yrs ago my GP added Flovent 2x daily because on the occasional attack the albuterol didn't seem to work quite as well, plus I was using a few times per week. I didn't take the Flovent consistently but began so early this year. About a month later, it seemed by voice sounded more hoarse and my chest felt \"dry\". In addition, I began having some pains which felt like I had a chest cold (sharp, stabbing), especially if I was exerting myself outside (February in MN). But, I didn't have a fever and no cough. In the past, my GP said this was probably pleurisy. We also brought home a new dog and I visited my sister who has numerous animals. For 7-10 days following the visit to my sister, I had to use the albuterol every 4-6 hrs and even then it didn't give the full relief as in the past.  I decided to see an Asthma and Allergy specialist. He took me off Flovent and added Singulair 10mg 1x per day. An allergy test showed strong reaction to both dogs and cats. He gave the standard advice for avoiding allergy-induced asthma from cats/dogs, though the new dog doesn't \"seem\" to bother me. I visited my sister again a month later and although I did experience some tightness, etc., it cleared up in a few days rather than 10.  This summer I again began to experience pain in my left chest primarily, although the right side gets involved sometime. Talking seems to make it worse too. I have noticed that after taking albuterol, not only does my chest loosen, but I have to cough a bit to remove what feels like small amounts of mucous. This has never been a part of my asthma in the past. I followed-up with the asthma doc and he put me on Qvar for a month. He also ordered a chest x-ray which came back normal. Qvar seemed to help as I don't recall having much in the way of chest pain or having to use albuterol much, but I do need to take before I exercise.  Within the past few weeks I have been having more severe and constant chest pain, again mostly on the left. The shoulder feels sore too but I can do pushups, etc without shoulder pain so it seems the discomfort is originating from somewhere else. After doing a fast walk on the treadmill, my left side was in considerable discomfort for several hrs. I saw my GP a few days later, he did an EKG and said the heart was not involved and this was likely musco-skeletal. Getting on the treadmill a week later, I again experienced discomfort on my left side but not as bad. Over this time I have a number of small episodes of sharp, chest-cold type pains on both sides of my chest. The usually only last a few seconds each time. Last night however, I began to feel a tight squeezing in the middle of my chest, then more sharp pains on both sides of the chest. Sometimes a deep breath would cause an additional twinge of pain, but not always. And talking above a whisper made it worse. Even though my chest really didn't feel tight, I took the albuterol. It seemed to help and I again had to clear some small amounts of mucous from my lungs. During this time, I have also awoken from sleeping feeling quite hot, but it goes away rather quickly.  Are these symptoms consistent with asthma? I am confused because up until the past 6 months asthma to me meant chest tightening only, not pain, discomfort and mucous. If this is asthma, does this mean it's getting worse? I also am on omeprazole 20mg 2x for reflux.  Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "I decided to see a pulmonologist to se if my sysmptoms were asthma or something else. My main symptom lately has been an irritation in my left lung when talking for an extended period of time. It feels a little \"heavy\" but my peak flows are the same and I don't feel the need to use albuterol. It also seems I have a little phlegm as I am clearing my throat when this irritaion occurs. The only way I seem to get relief is to quite talking and after an hour or so it feles better. The pulmonologist put me on Advair 500/50 2x daily for a month and although I have not had to use my albuterol during that time and I have had no strong burning sensation like before (both of which are good!), he wants me to continue the Advair and add Singulair. I'm not too excited to continue with the Advair due to the high cost but if it works and maybe eventually clears up this irritaton I'll certainly be happy.  Has any one else experienced these types of symptoms? Just wondering if this may get better... thanks Rob\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there,  I am a 23 year old female, average to slight overweight.  I have had asthma since I was a young child, although the asthma was always well controlled, and I only had an attack every few years.  My parents both had asthma as children but grew out of it, and my sister does not have it.  Last year my asthma spiraled out of control and I ended up in the hospital.  I was given heavy doses of steriods and antibiotics, and it took a few weeks to clear it up.    Since that point I seem to be getting the same type of illness every 3-4 weeks (ironically almost the same amount of time between them).  I first get a really sore throat and terrible ear pain.  Then my head hurts really bad (so bad it is hard to see) and my nose starts running.  After a day or so of this it starts dripping into my throat and I start experiencing shortness of breath.  It gets progressively within a day or so, and even with all breathing medications, prednisone, and nebulizer it does not improve.   I end up at the doctor each time, and have to get an antibiotic (usually augmentin) for it to start clearing it up.  The few times I have tried to fight through it I have ended up in the ER and have been hospitalized for significant lengths of time.  Anyways my primary care doctor, pulmonologist, ENT, and allergist are stumped.  I have been on every preventive and fast acting medication, and while they work well when I am healthy, the minute I catch any kind of cold I get terribly sick.  I have been officially diagnosed as having chronic asthma, chronic bronchitis, allergies (cats, smoke, dust, etc), a deviated septum (to be operated on in the summer), graves disease, and IST.  I am quite frustrated that I tend to get this sick this often and it drains me for weeks and then returns again.  Currently to treat my problems I take pulmicort, singulair, allegra, albuteral (inhaler and neb.), plus prednisone (as needed).  I also take Toprol and PTU.  I am allergic (have severe reactions) to Zithromax and Advair.  My question is that I worry about the constant use of antibiotics.  While I definetely feel better when I am on them, I wonder about the resistance I could build up to them?  Is this a risk with monthly use?  Are there any other treatments I could try without resorting to the antibiotics?  Also when my breathing gets really bad I have to use the prednisone.  However, it has raised my ACTH significantly and I tend to react badly to it (my heart rate which is abnormally fast, drops very low and makes me pass out.)  In the hospital and when I am having significant problems the doctors make me take this.  Although I am willing to take it make me breath better, I am wondering if there is something else that will help me without the bad side effects I have experienced.  Sorry for the long post, and thank you very much.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you doctor.   I am being tested this week after finally getting my pulmonologist to write a referral for it.  I have taken Zithromax during past hospitalizations but the last time I was in the ER I was administered it through the IV and felt like I was being stabbed.  My heart rate doubled and I lost all feeling on my right side so they decided I must be allergic to it.  Advair I had bad reactions to years ago.  Thanks for the reply though, I hope the testing and the septoplasty will stop this from reoccuring.\n\n",

    "content": "Peak flows are not always the best measure of asthma but can be helpful in tracking symptoms.  Initially my thought is that you are likely not experiencing significant asthma problems due to the fact that you still have a good peak flow and the xopenex did not help.  However, you may still having some intermittent bronchoconstriction.  The other possibility is that you are experiencing severe enough symptoms that the two puffs of xopenex were not enough.  This is unlikely as generally you would feel much more like an asthma attack if it was this severe (not always but mostly).  Is your Xopenex old?  If it were empty or old it may not work well.    I would suggest that you use your xopenex 4-6 times per day for the next few days.  If you are not getting better or if your symptoms get ANY worse you should see a doctor.   Asthma really is not a disease to mess around with.  Unfortunately the death rate is on the rise from asthma.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I only carried aroud my emergancy inhaler just in case. My doctor would always reperscribe my meds.   About seven years ago in middle school I got a weird feeling in my heart when I started weasing. I could feel my heart beating really hard, really slowly. It hurt a little but feels more odd then actually hurting. After it had passed I noticed that my weasing had stopped and I could breath much easier. I don't know why my heart does it but sense then it was my own little asthma fighter. i do have to stop whatever I'm doing when it comes on because I loose concentration thinking of only that and I can't breath if I'm running or something and it happens. It's been acting up more, sometimes when I'm not even weasing which just makes it weirder. It always last aa couple seconds, then goes away taking my weazing and shortness of breath with it.\n\n",

    "title": "acute asthmatic bronchitis - Recovery time",
    "content": "Four years ago my family doctor told me I needed to quit smoking when he diagnosed me with astmatic bronchitis. I did not. I have since then wised up and have quit smoking. I have now been smoke free for 25 days and I am never going back. I quit ironically on New Years day. I layed in bed all day on January the 2nd wheezing, even going to the bathroom would make me breathe like I was running a marathon. That day it was either talk or breathe and every breath had a wheeze with it. I went to the ER on that day.  I was diagnosed with acute asthmatic bronchitis and an upper respiratory infection. When I went to the ER they gave me three breathing treatments, a shot of rocephin, zithromax antibiotic, prednisone, and some mucinex-d I got sent home with a prescription for an inhaler, prednisone, xithromax and the mucinex-d.  I took all of my antibiotics and finished all my medications except the inhaler and I still use that alot.  Here is my problem .  Just how long does it take to heal. I remember the last time that I had asthmatic bronchitis I coughed alot ( remember I never quit smoking (dumb me)) and I would cough up nasty drainage that smelled and well I will stop with the description there. That time that I had it it ended up lasting for several months. I should of quit smoking then. I have not coughed up anything with this bout and whenever I exert (ie. vacumning the living room, getting the kids loaded in the car) myself doing anything I breathe like I just got done running the NYC marathon. It is a dry sounding breath and every now and then there is a wheeze with it. How long should I wait before I call the Dr and schedule an appt? I know that two things are counting against my healing right now , that is the Asthma and the fact that I did smoke for 13 years. I would really like to start an exercise program to counteract the weight gain from the smoking cessation and I cannot do it because I cannot breathe.  Also the doctor told me that from now on the air that I breathe needs to be as clean as possible.  no smoke, no candle burning, no incense (i never burned that stuff) not even burning my fireplace (sorry cannot give that one up, its saved mucho money and is well ventilated.)  I am a 32 year old female and I really appreciate your help on this. I promise that I have quit and I will never start that VILE habit again.\n\n",

    "content": "First off, CONGRATULATIONS on stopping smoking.  No matter when you \"should\" have quit, you've quit now and that is a huge accomplishment.    Regarding your asthma, if you are still needing your inhaler more than 2-3 times per day after completing the prednisone you should see your doctor again.  It is possible that you may benefit from an inhaled corticosteroid (such as fluticasone or budesonide) to help control your asthma symptoms.  Albuterol is an excellent medication for asthma but it really is only a symptom treater not an asthma controller.  If you are needing to use your albuterol any more frequently than about twice a week you will probably get some benefit from the inhaled corticosteroid.  The inhaled steroid treats the inflammation of the airways that is contributing to their spasming (which the albuterol helps).  And, if your asthma gets worse and you begin to feel as if you are having a worsening time breathing you should be evaluated right away.  Best wishes, and congratulations once again.  Smoking cessation is one of the best choices you could have made for your health!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, My 3 year old daughter currently had outbreaks of eczema as a baby.  She hasn't had one since she was about 12 months old.  Her pediatrician told me that if she doesn't have an outbreak after the age of 2 then she likely won't ever have one again.  My son, who is 11 months old just got his first outbreak of eczema as well and has had it for about 2 weeks.  I have heard that there is an increased risk for asthma in children who have eczema.  I was wondering if this risk goes away if the child grows out of the eczema or does the risk continue even though the child no longer has eczema?   Thank you for your time, Kate\n\n",

    "content": "You are absolutely correct that asthma and eczema do run together, along with seasonal allergies.  While it hasn't been completely proven yet, we believe that all three are really an allergic type reaction.  Generally if there is a family history of any of these things, there is an increased chance of having the others as well.  Children may or may not grow out of their asthma or eczema.  Very frequently the asthma improves with age and the eczema may or may not improve.    I'm not familiar with the age 2 \"cut off\" in particular; however, if your child hasn't had any problems with eczema it is possible that the eczema will remain mild.  Asthma can present at any age.  Often it presents when the children are infants or toddlers to young children.  It is less common to present in older children-but this is still frequently seen.  Adolescent children who have not had any problems with asthma are quite a bit less likely to develop asthma (in medicine we never say never).  If your children do develop any symptoms of breathing problems, cough at night, or wheezing the possibility of asthma should be explored.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I'm a 23 year old female, and I'm concerned about the possibility of asthma. I used to work for an MD and she thought I had asthma or reactive airway disease, but I never had any follow up testing done. Basically, I get SOB upon mild exertion, with a cough, and occasionally some mild wheezing (usually only audible by stethoscope). It usually goes away on it's own, but occasionally requires an albuterol tx. It's exacerbated by perfume and smoke. I also get colds frequently, and they tend to last for a month or so. I'm a paramedic, and I'm pretty reluctant to be seen by a doctor unless it's absolutely medically necessary. My only current medical conditons are chronic excema and ectodermal dysplasia (I'm fortunate enough to be able to sweat!), and the only meds I take are birth control pills. My family hx is positive for asthma, ectodermal dysplasia, MI, cancer, and HTN. My SOB isn't enough to really interfere with my life too much, but when I get out on a call and it requires lifting the patient down some stairs, I will have some respiratory issues, and that's really annoying :( Anyways, any advice is greatly appreciated! Thanks so much for your time!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,   It sounds like an asthma is the cause of your symptoms.   Asthma is due to an inflammatory process in the respiratory airway a disease r which esults in spasm of the muscles of the bronchial way and narrowing of the respiratory tract and decreased airflow.   Personal and/or family history of allergies are present in most patients with asthma.   Symptoms are usually periodic and vary in duration, may last from few minutes up to few days.   Wheezing and shortness of breath are the most common presenting symptoms for asthma. The condition usually pericipiates by exposure to certain allergens such as, as moist air, molds, dust mites, pollens and molds.  Symptoms are also exacerbated with exercise. Wheezing usually resolves either spontaneously.   Other patients presents with cough with or without sputum (phlegm), Chronic shortness of breath that is aggravated with exercises and mandate the us of accessory respiratory muscles.   Diagnosis is made by careful history and examination. Auscultation of the chest during the episode shows the very characteristic wheezing sounds. In between attacks the chest is normal on examination.  In between attacks the chest is normal on examination and some Tests may help in the diagnosis: \u2022Lung function tests  \u2022Peak flow measurements  \u2022Chest x-ray  \u2022Allergy skin or blood tests  \u2022Arterial blood gas  \u2022Eosinophil count (a type of white blood cell)   People with mild asthma (infrequent attacks) may use relief medication as needed. Those with persistent asthma should take control medications on a regular basis to prevent symptoms from occurring.   - Cardiac causes should be excluded too.  I advise you to follow up with your doctor for proper management.   Best regards.\n\n",

Im an uninsured college kid, so I try whatever I can before handing over a weeks pay at the doctors office. My symtoms included a horrible cough that kept me up 2 nights in a row, a sore throat, congestion, and drainage. I tried gargling cayenne pepper-water for my sore throat, and drinking applecider vinegar. Fear of strep sent me to the doctor. He diagnosed me with a bacterial sinus infection, gave me enough free samples to ward it off and sent me on my way. Im taking 10 days of 750mg levaquin, staying on my albuterol,  and 12 hr alegra. my sore throat is gone, my congestion is loosening up, but I have this feeling like there is a lump on the back of my tongue, or maybe in my throat.

    "content": "Just to add a bit more information, it is common for doctors to prescribe both medications at the same time.  The Advair discus will help control asthma, and the nasal spray will help with allergic rhinitis.  The steroids in both are relatively low doses (meaning much lower than a steroid burst you would take orally).  Very little of the steroid is absorbed into the blood stream.  As such, the steroid in each medication acts only where it contacts the linings of your nose and lungs.    The Rhinocort nasal spray will stay in your nose and do very little for your asthma, with the exception of helping control the allergies which can exacerbate asthma.  The Advair, for the most part, will not come into contact with the nasal mucosa and will do very little to  help allergic rhinitis.  So, even though they are both steroids they have different \"jobs\" to do.  I agree with Dr. Mahmoud.  If you have concerns, please talk with your doctor.  Happy New Year.\n\n",

    "content": "ok so I have had a cough for several months, followed by newer symptoms of shortness of breath, frequent urination, cant sleep laying flat or i cough, my heart races at times etc. I was dignosed several yrs ago with seasonal asthma, so I started using an extra  preventil inhaler that my son had for the last 2 weeks since i figured it had come back and that was the inhaler i udes to use (i hadnt had any symtoms the last few yrs). Ok so my family dr sends me to another dr for some tests, i had a ct of the chest and throat (thinks my thyrois might be enlarged too) a PFT , and an echocardiograph. Well the PFT was normal , the dr was surprised as I have been smoking for 22 yrs (tryign to quit now) but said my breathing and lungs are great given the smoking issue...however he suggested I take advair since he feels that my brochi may be sensitive and i just need some extra hekp from the steroid to open my lungs so i don't constantly cough and have shortness of breath....is this a good thing??? can i take this medication if i don't really have asthma? one more thing lastnight i ended up in the ER due to some abdominal pain...turns out after doing a ct of the pelvic and abdominal area that i have kidney stones..now they said the pain i was having was NOT from the stones as there is no evidence i was passing one...just wanted to note that though.   Basically my question is if my breathing test was normal....but i do have cough and shortness of breath frequently, is advair ok to keep taking under his direction?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear missy1220,  You mentioned  that you have been diagnosed years ago with seasonal asthma. Have you been exposed in the last period to any irritant or chest infection? Asthma in sensitive people, is usually initiated or aggravated by exposure to certain allergens such as, as moist cold air r, dust mites, pollens and molds. It is also exacerbated by chest infections. Wheezing  which is the commonest complaint in patients with asthma, usually resolves either spontaneously, or by the use of antibiotics to treat bronchitis s and any other type of chest infection.  Asthma patients can present with only cough with or without sputum (phlegm)  and shortness of breath.  People with mild asthma (infrequent attacks) may use relief medication as needed. Those with persistent asthma should take control medications on a regular basis to prevent symptoms from occurring. you have mentioned that your symptoms are persistent for few month which means that you need to receive treatment as your physician advised. However, Before using the drug Advair which is composed of (fluticasone and salmeterol), inform your doctor if you have any type of infection as you may not be allowed to start treatment, since the drug can decrease your immune defense.  all of the following conditions also should be checked before starting this drug, Cardiac disorders and hypertension Allergy to certain foods Diabetes Thyroid and liver disease and any other medical problem which might prevent you from taking the medicine.

    "content": "Hi, I'm a 19yr old male who competes at a high level in athletics events over 1500m in distance.  I  originally suffered a chest infection during a holiday last July but trained through it after taking a couple of weeks rest to get over the worst of it, as i had a European Championship fixture in late September. Having completed the competition, I decided to take a break from training, during which time my cough became progressively worse.  A course of ampicillin didn't seem to work at all and it was only after taking a course of a second antibiotic (cefaclor i think?) that I seemed to recover from the chest infection.  I rested for a couple of weeks after taking this second course, to be sure the infection was out of my system and made an attempt to return to training.   This was around November time of 2004 and up until a recent visit to my GP i was suffering discomfort and tightness at the base of my chest and through to my back during deep breathing and exercise, even when taking a bricanyl turbohaler (terbutaline sulphate, which i had been prescribed many years ago to treat a mild form of exercise induced asthma).  The doctor diagnosed exercise induced asthma, for which he prescribed an airomir autohaler (salbutamol sulphate), after discovering that my peak flow reading was above average and that I had no signs of wheeziness.  One week later and I'm back with a cough (not productive) and can't train again.  Just wondering if anyone has any thoughts on the cause of the restrictiveness in my chest and the coughing that has followed because as a student in Physiology I'm interested to know what the cause could be!  In addition, the condition worsens at lower temperatures, the cold air apparently irritating the problem.  Many thanks, mrmanac.\n\n",

    "content": "Bronchial Asthma, Exercise Induced Asthma  and Bronchial Reactive Airways Disease are all synonymous.  Asthma is a condition that results from an inflammatory process in the respiratory airway a disease. The inflammation results in spasm of the muscles of the bronchial way with swollen cells in the airway lining, as a sequence narrowing of the respiratory tract and decreased airflow. The history you have described is very common in asthmatic patients.  In asthmatic patients, wheezing is the most common presenting symptom. It usually begins suddenly, worsens at night or in early morning, aggravated by exposure to certain allergens such as, as moist cold air. It is also exacerbated with exercise and chest infections as in your case. Wheezing usually resolves either spontaneously, or by the use of antibiotics to treat bronchitis s and any other type of chest infection. Sometimes asthma patients present with cough with or without sputum (phlegm). Chronic shortness of breath mandate the us of accessory respiratory muscles which lead to the sensation of chest pain or chest tightness.  Being asthmatic itself is a predisposing factor for repeated chest infection which in turn aggravate the asthma. This means that prevention is very important in controlling exacerbations of asthma. This can be achieved by identifying the allergens and respiratory irritants and to avoid them. In addition, Common allergens like dust mites, cockroach allergens, molds, and pollens and Common respiratory irritants include: tobacco smoke, pollution, and fumes from burning wood or gas should be avoided. People with mild asthma (infrequent attacks) may use relief medication as needed. Those with persistent asthma should take control medications on a regular basis to prevent symptoms from occurring.  Try to get an appointment with your doctor, to be examined carefully and checked for your respiratory functions. Good luck,\n\n",

Peak flow of values 50-80% means a moderate asthma attack, while values below 50% means a severe attack. This means that peak flow of 555 which is your normal value, indicate moderate degree of asthma, keeping in mind that you are also under treatment. In another word your airway is not completely patent and the problem is more evident while exhalation, hence you feel a Resistance. however, this does not mean that you forget about your complaint, I advise you to carefully observe if with time you feel more resistence while you exhale, this means that your air way is becoming more and more narrow due to spasm in th wall which should be investigated to identify the possible cause and to avoid any coming severe attack.

    "content": "Dear MaysMommy, you have got cold that precipitate an asthmatic attack. Asthma is a condition in which there is shortness of breath, wheezing, or cough, in turn, Overexertion of the chest wall muscles or their inflammation resulting in chest pain. Chest infection including viral infection,  and Inflammation of the pleura covering the lung (pleurisy) is another possible cause for your chest pain. In all of these conditions the chest pain is usually aggravated by taking deep breath and cough.  Irritation of the pleura that covers the lung results in cough .  proper physical examination and chest X-rays can help in the diagnosis of the cause of this chest pain. My concern is if the cough, is it productive and is related to posture? If the answer is yes, and your sputum is not clear, this means your chest infection may be not covered enough with the antibiotic you have received and you need culture and sensitivity for the sputum to receive the specific antibiotic treatment. if the cough is dry then probably it is a viral infection that needs symptomatic treatment and rest. you better visit your consultant and see what would he recommend according to the physical examination he will do. Thank you,\n\n",

In the last two years I have suffered from quite a few viruses, pluerisy, viral meningitis laryingitis and vertigo, all of it has been in the same area that I am suffering from now, but again even my immune system showed up that it was ok, I also have raynauds, any advice or ideas would be a huge help to me right now thanks now in march, I have a third and fourth lump growing on the right side. Drs that I see now would rather say that its another virus or that its all in my head as they can find nothing to explain why, they have given me an inhaler ventolin which has given me a cough and a sore throat, please advise me. what are possible causes of all of this. A few days ago I had an episode of hyperventilating, first time this had happened to me.\n\n",

However, sometimes streroid based inhalers cause secondary infections (fungal) in which there will be white patches in the mouth and throat and typically makes your mouth and throat sore. If this is present notify your physician for treatment. Also, If you were not instructed to rinse your mouth and drink some water after use you should be doing so. Now for the lymph node enlargement, if these areas are continuing to enlarge (nodal enlargement on serial examinations is significant) and have been treated unsuccessfully with antibiotic therapy, further diagnostics should be completed by, ie, ultrasound or CT Scan and I would encourage you to discuss this with your physician.

But he doesn't belief that the earache I have been suffering with is related to the swollen salivery gland! i know that he knows what he's doing as he has trained for many years to be where he is today, but I just keeping feeling that I know my own body and there is something wrong with it, it is causes me to feel very low, and emotional which then makes me cry alot when talking to drs as they get me all het up, at this point they end up saying about taking amitriptyline to help, which I feel is only being prescribed because of me getting emotional not because of the pain which is what they try to say its for I have been like this for 6 months in total its only in the last two months that they have tried to prescribed anti depressents and thats because that is when the second lump came up and when the local dr told me it was yet another virus I cried so he put in my notes that i had psychological problems. Sorry you only asked if It was ENT i was seeing.  k\n\n",

    "content": "Iam a female 24 yrs old. For the past year I have had some medical issues going on that have not gone away. I had recurring tonsilitis so I got my tonsils removed in April 2005. I had a lot of trouble breathing in my nose and chest so they sent me for allergy testing and I had a lot of allergies to grass, mold, weeds,dogs,etc. Well they put me on clarinex and astelin spray. The symptoms kept getting worse to the point that i now have a pain in my chest area and trouble breathing a lot. I notice that the pain is always on my right side sometimes higher then lower by my rib cage area. I'm really concerned I don't know what this is and every diagnosis they have had seems inconclusive.their final disgnosis was that i have asthma and gave me an inhaler. I could use any help i can get. I also during alll this time have had a huge lump behind my ear a swollen lymph node. Please help im young and very frightnened by all of this...\n\n",

I don't know if the swollen lymph node is making you think cancer or something but that would also be ruled out by the chest x-ray. Your lymph could be swollen for any number of reasons. If you're really concerned then i would say go back to the doctors and go back and go back and go back until you feel satified with what they tell you. I believe a person knows themselves best and if you feel scared or unsure or worried about something then it should be addressed. Make them take care of you!\n\n",

    "content": "You cannot diagnose asthma with a peak flow meter - you need to get a pulmonary function test.  When THAT test show asthma, you can use the peak flow numbers to follow the asthma severity.  Once you are diagnoses with asthma, and you have your symptoms of allergic rhinitis or other nasal symtpoms, you need a steroid nasal inhaler (like flonase).  Clarinex alone won't do much.  For your asthma, a steroid inhaler (like Advair) would be necessary until the asthma is under control.  The tests and meds mentioned above re very standard - if you don't have this, I would suggest seeing a pulmonologist so the PFT's and correct medications can be done.\n\n",

In the last two years I have suffered from quite a few viruses, pluerisy, viral meningitis laryingitis and vertigo, all of it has been in the same area that I am suffering from now, but again even myimmune system showed up that it was ok, I also have raynauds, any advice or ideas would be a huge help to me right now thanks\n\n",

I have taken all kinds of inhalers like Azmacort and oral meds like Accolate and nothing made a difference but I continued to use them anyway, as well as try new things because I had no choice until Singulair came out!  My doctors were amazed at the results.  But now in the last 2-3 months Singulair (10 mg a day), it is no longer working and I do not want to go back on steroids.

    "content": "Here is a breif discription of my situation, I am a former soldier was in the army for 2 years i was an airborne infantryman with the 82nd airborne division. I was removed from service because i was diagnosed with asthma when i was 8 years old. Back in 2000 it was a disqualifing factor but now it is not if you have not had since the age of 13. I am trying to re enlist because of a promise i made to my friend who was killed in iraq in 2003. As i said before i was in the army and completed many schools I have been deploied overseas once I was healthy enough for the army to let me jump out of planes!!! with no problems i have never had an asthma attack in my life. I am very active and am a land surveyor here in virginia i survey the blue ridge mountains again no problems up and down the mountains evry day. I have never really had exceptional lung function but i also have never had any asthma problems either. To my question....Unless i pass the Methacholine challenge test i will not be able to get back into the millitary and fufill the promise i made to my friend  I know this is not the best test to preform and it is old and outdated but the army seems to like the old methods of testing i guess. I am one step away from getting back in as i have already passed the physical and i have checked out great acording to the army I am to go to a infantry unit which will be deploing to afghanistan in early 2006 but only if i pass this test. I am fearfull i will not pass this test because of what i said before. I have looked everywhere for an answer how to do well on this test or in other words cheat the test to produce good results. If you could understand how pationate i am about this you would understand my perdiciment I want to finish what i started and get back into the army to protect our great nation in this time of terror it is very important to me so much i am willing to sacrifice my life so if there is anyone out there who can help me please don't hesitate i would be glad to hear any sugestions. thank you for reading,\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Im very sorry no one else has answered you. I will do my best to help, although this is not exactly my area of expertise.   A Methacholine challenge is a test to determine if you have asthma.  It is performed by inhaling a medication (methacholine) in increasing doses in an attempt to produce a change in your pulmonary function test results.   The test will continue until you reach at least a 20% drop in your FEVI (the amount of air you exhale in the first second) or you finish all the dosages of the medication.   After the testing is completed, you may be given a nebulizer treatment that will reverse the action of the methacholine, if it has caused your results to change.   After each dose and after the breathing (nebulizer) treatment, you will be asked to perform several breathing tests.   The testing time varies and may take up to 2 hours, depending on how you do.   You may have some mild shortness of breath from taking the medication.  True asthma attacks are very rare and generally respond promptly to treatment.  Prior to coming in for testing, you will be asked not to take some of your morning medications:  The following medications need to be avoided 48 hours prior to testing.   Oral bronchodilators--Slobid, Theodur, Uniphyll, Unidur, Theophylline   Antihistamines--Claritin (regular and D), Allegra (regular and D), Benadryl, Bromfed, Atrohist, and over-the counter cold, cough and sinus medications.  The following medications need to be avoided 24 hours prior to testing.   Oral steroids--Prednisone, Medrol, Methylpredisolone   Oral bronchodilators--Proventil Repetabs  The following medications need to be avoided 12 hours prior to testing:   Bronchodilators--Albuterol, Ventoline, Proventil, Maxair, Brethaire, Serevent, Atrovent, Combivent  Avoid all caffeine 6 hours prior to testing.  NORMAL DIET - no fasting is necessary  Basically, in order to pass this test, you need to be able to take all the doses without having an athsma attack.  Im not sure what I can offer to help you with this, as I said, this is an area I know much about.   I think you should get in touch with a respiratory therapist, and ask them if there is anythign you can do.  Im very sorry I cannot be of more help, and I wish you the best of luck, please keep me updated.\n\n",

The test is to check your pulmonary function to see how bad athsma is, and if you take any type of inhaler, then the test will not be accurate. I would assume the doctor would ask you or test to see if you have taken anything that would make the test incorrect. As I said before, check with a respiratory therapist about this, or hopefully one will answer this post, because Im sure they can offer much more insight on this matter than I can.  Take care, Gracie\n\n",

Even if it's not asthma he could give you an albuterol inhaler to just have around and use as needed. It opens up the passage ways in the lungs to help air move through. It will increase your heart rate though right afterward so don't get scared if you feel that happen. It'll go away in a few. But go to the Doctor.\n\n",

    "content": "I hope you can help.  I do have a complicated history, so here goes.  I am a 37yr. female.  I have sick sinus syndrome for which I have a pacemaker.  I have atrial fibrillation, and other arrythmias.  I take coumadin, digoxin, flecanide, cardizem, advair and albuterol.   Around the time I was diagonsed with heart problems, I was also diagnosed with asthma. That was 10 yrs. ago. Over the last several weeks my heart rate has been not controlled well.  Slightly prior to this my asthma was kicking in in a bad way.   The inhalers are not doing a thing.  I truly feel that I am suffocating and get extremely weak and dizzy.  My symptoms are more discomfort right over my lungs rather than wheezing.  Sometimes the pain is sharp.  I should also mention that up until I saw my cardio. last week I had been on amiodarone for 5 yrs. I was told to stop taking it immediately as it has a high incidence of pulmonary toxicity.   He also ordered pulmonary functions tests and a referal to a pulmonologist.   I have yet to see the pulmonologist, but I have had the pulmonary functions tests.  I can't tell you the exact numbers, but I was told that it showed obstruction in the peripheral airways, with an identical result before and after bronchodialator treatment.  She said that may mean the problem is not asthma.  Could it describe toxicity, or what else what give this result? I am desperate and can hardly function due to breathlessness.   My cardio. does not want me on advair anymore due to cardiac arrythmias. Please help,  I am slightly desperate. Thanks so much!\n\n",

    "content": "hi  based on what you have described, it could be not asthma, but rather, what is known as :Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) , which is a group of long-term (chronic) lung diseases that makes it hard to breathe. In COPD, airflow through the airways leading to and within the lungs (bronchial tubes) is partially blocked, resulting in difficulty breathing. As the disease gets worse, breathing becomes more difficult, and it may become hard to carry out everyday activities. Although COPD can be managed, it cannot be cured at this time.  the most common cause of this is smoking, but there are for sure some other symptoms.  COPD symptoms depend on whether your disease is mainly chronic bronchitis or mainly emphysema.   If you primarily have chronic bronchitis, you usually will first notice a cough that brings up mucus. If you primarily have emphysema, you may not have much of a cough and may not recognize any symptoms until shortness of breath occurs.   As COPD progresses, your lung function gets worse. You begin to have more shortness of breath during activity. Later, you may be out of breath with little or no activity and find it difficult to do everyday activities. At times, shortness of breath may suddenly get much worse (a COPD exacerbation). A COPD exacerbation can be mild to life-threatening.    Treatment may include medications to make it easier to breathe and reduce inflammation, machines to help you breathe (ventilators), oxygen therapy, and antibiotics to cure infections.  Now, amiodarone causing pulmonary toxicity is also prone or can happen, remember that albuterol which is used to treat asthma, could have caused you to feel increased heart rates, or to feel some of the irregularities on them.  flecanide and digoxin can have pro arrhythmic side effects, meaning that they may precipitate some arrhythmias, however they remain very great drugs for treating arrhythmias.  this is why it is very important that you continue seeing your doctor to check on your overall health.  i hope my explanation offered some help, nothing of course will replace the doctor's decision, the doctor who EXAMINES you, and i wish you always the best....  i thank you very much.\n\n",

    "content": "In December I was on a plane and the man behind me was very sick.  He was coughing, and was  extremely congested.  Shortly after that I became ill with similar symptoms.  Three weeks I went to the doctor and was placed on antibiotics, alupent, and a decongestant.  I had a chest xray that was clear but did show a compression deformity of one of the vertebrae. About two weeks later I went back to the doctor because I thought I had cracked a rib from severe coughing.  At that time I still had nasal congestion, asthma like symptoms, and was still bringing up clear mucous.  The doctor said that he could prescribe a steroid and I said I preferred not to take it.  I wound up with more of the same medications minus the antibiotics.   Here I am three months later and now have the following symptoms: During the day I am mostly ok, except that I occasionally get fatigued and have general malaise.  Have occasional heartburn.   I now cough mostly when wheezing in the evening/night.  Get congested at night and occasionally produce clear mucous.   The symptoms occur mostly when lying down. I am now taking over the counter medications that seem to help along with drinking coffee.   I thought I might have allergies but allegra hasn\u2019t helped.\n\n",

Most times I feel \"normal.\"  However, I do know that if i'm going to be exposed to prolonged exercise or sub 35 degree temperatures, I will experience mild-moderate SOB and mild wheezing.  So, as a preventative measure, I make sure I use the flovent on those days and again I never have any symptoms.  I feel like I have this asthma(?) under control.  Occasionally I will \"test\" cold temps and exercise and sometimes I will have the recurring symptoms.  My question... is flovent used solely for asthma?  Do I indeed have asthma?  If so, should I just consider myself fortunate that it's a mild form of astham and easily controlled?  My MD never gives a straight answer...not sure he knows exactly what to call what I experience.  He seems content that whatever I have is easily controlled & not to worry what to call it.  Just curious...or should I be more concerned?\n\n",

It will not stop an asthma attack that has already started. From what you state, your symptoms (wheezing, and shortness of breath) are essentially nonexistent when this medication is used on a regular basis which coincides with symptoms of asthma. I would suggest since you are relatively well controlled with your current treatment that you continue doing so, of course under your doctors supervision. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

In brief I am a 38yr old woman however, in childhood I had milk allergy and was actually taken from my mother due to suspicion of neglect. I was also diagnosed with hypoglycemia, hay fever, dust, pollen; animal allergies. I also suffered severe migraine headaches took prescribed darvocete. I suffered constant severe nosebleeds that were like turning on a faucet. I underwent surgery to burn the ends to stop the bleeds. Had tubes placed in my ears had to take speech. I do not remember exactly why but my mother would make me stay in the house with the a/c running. I also experienced ear infections, pneumonia, bronchitis and sinuses problems. Every time I have been to an ENT I am told I have a hole inside my nose. I have noticed that for approx. the last 10 yrs I have experienced adult pneumonia, bronchitis and at minimum experienced getting cold like symptoms and loss of voice, ear infection, tmj etc. Never really thought much about it. However, within the last 4 months things got worse. I have had two upper respiratory infections sinuses congestion, ear infection and loss of voice. My voice has been basically gone for the last 4 months. I have noticed an increase of general fatigue, shortness of breath, out of breath easily upon activity, chest tightness, heartburn, consistent cough, difficulty sleeping, sneezing, runny/stuffy nose, crusty nose coughing, postnasal drip, itchy nose and throat, puffyness under the eyes, watery and itchy eyes, dry mouth waking up, dry/tickle in throat etc.   Could it be just allergies or could it be adult onset of asthma or something completely diffrent?   Thank you for your time. Any information would be helpful.\n\n",

    "title": "Asthma - Usage of Ventolin Inhaler",
    "content": "Hi there.  BACKGROUND: I have been asthmatic since a very, very young age. I am 20 now.  I am of Asian origin but I have been in Australia for 3 years for educational purposes (thought this might be of relevance when it comes to what triggers asthma attacks).  Before I go to bed at night, I'll feel difficulty in breathing. I felt the same thing when I was back in Malaysia for my 3 months holiday. I am not sure how long I have been experiencing this but i think it has gone on for about a year. I had been asthma-attack-free for quite a good number of years before it started bugging me again. When i came to Australia 3 years ago, symptoms of asthma started to set in. Difficulty in breathing at night only became consistent bout a year ago.  QUESTION: Before bed, due to difficulty in breathing, I'll use the Ventolin Inhaler (puffer). Directly after that, my breathing will suddenly become more difficult, and I'll feel a sudden dizziness, which goes away in 2 secs. Can you please explain to me why is that?  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: I am 167cm tall. I was 83kg. I joined the gym a year ago, and had since been doing consistent cardio and weight training. I do badminton, squash, cycling etc. I am now a 69kg. I have been eating healthy, so I have not been sacrificing nutrition to get slim fast.  Thanks and I really hope to hear from you soon.  From, veryworried.\n\n",

    "title": "No idea what to think about this",
    "content": "I am a 20y/o female and i am having some type or respitory problem i think, and i am not sure what to think of it, i do not currently have insurance so going to doctor is unfortunatly a lot of money that i don't have, so i really want some input as to if it is something i should just wait out a little longer or just suck up the bill and go.  okay.. im gonna so a brief history to current to help discribe the probelem that i feel has probably been building for years.. I would say it all started when i was 17 after i had started smoking (about half a pack a day) for a few months, and i started getting broncitis freqently, 4 times in a 8 month span, during that time i also quit smoking, somewhat settled after i quit smoking, but not completely for the next 2 years i still got bronchitis 5 more times. so that bring me to about sept 04, where i started smoking again (probably the stupidest thing i could have ever done), anyway i didn't have any problems until the end of november when i came down with what i thought was just a common cold, however from there is just progressively worsened for the next month or so, i kept having coughing fits that ended in me gasping for breath, unable to catch it for minutes, and then had to sit and recover for a good 10 minutes, these \"episodes\" started happening quite frequently 3-4 times a day, so the first thing i did was quit smoking (still not smoking too), however that did nothing to stop the fits.. the 22nd of december i finally just broke down and went to a walk in, and was diagnosed with bronchitis (big surpise)...  the doctor then prescribed me the normal antibiotics (not sure which one), a cough suppresant, and an albuterol inhaler, he said i was having symptoms with asthma but said that is probably would subside.  Okay so all being said i went on my way, however 6 days later i was no better, even possibly worse, so not taking any chances went back to a walk in.  the doctor there said that my tonsils and phanynx were swollen and ran some tests (mono, strep ect.) but all came back normal, he, like the other doctor said it was most likely bronchitis and he gave me a different antibiotic and told me to continue with the cough syrup and inhaler, as he said i was still weezing.   I was also missing a lot of work due to all this... Luckily that antibiotic cleared up the infection and i was feeling better after a few days.. However not all the symptoms have cleared... i still end up having little episodes, not a severe but i really have to concentrate on breathing or i just end up gasping, and at night in bed i can sometimes hear myself weezing, i am still taking the inhaler  (its my last refil and almost gone) but it doens't seem to do much, except right after i take it.   sometimes when i have the little fits i also get chest pain with it, which i am not sure is related at all, as i do have an anxiety disorder and could be related to that, but don't want to rule out another possibility. My friend says its probably all just still the asthma thing, but to be it doesn't seem right, not the way i have felt it all building for years, but then again i'm no doctor... any insight or suggestions are greatly appreciated thankyou in advance Ashlee\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Ashlee Asthma is a disease in which the airways become blocked or narrowed. These effects are usually temporary, but they cause shortness of breath, breathing trouble, and other symptoms. If an asthma episode is severe, a person may need emergency treatment to restore normal breathing.  Allergic (extrinsic) asthma (asthma symptoms triggered by an allergic reaction): Characterized by airway obstruction and inflammation that is at least partially reversible with medication and is always associated with allergy. Allergic asthma is the most common form of asthma. Many of the symptoms of allergic and non-allergic asthma are the same (coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath or rapid breathing, and chest tightness). However, allergic asthma is triggered by inhaling allergens such as dust mites, pet dander, pollens, mold, etc. Through a complex reaction, these allergens cause the passages in the airways of the lungs to become inflamed and swollen. This results in coughing, wheezing and other asthma symptoms.  Non-Allergic (intrinsic) asthma (asthma symptoms triggered by factors not related to allergies): Like allergic asthma, non-allergic asthma is characterized by airway obstruction and inflammation that is at least partially reversible with medication, however symptoms in this type of asthma are NOT associated with an allergic reaction. Many of the symptoms of allergic and non-allergic asthma are the same (coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath or rapid breathing, and chest tightness), but non-allergic asthma is triggered by other factors such as anxiety, stress, exercise, cold air, dry air, hyperventilation, smoke viruses or other irritants.  In non-allergic asthma, the immune system is not involved in the reaction, as with allergic reaction.   With allergic and non-allergic asthma, it is primarily a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways. This means that people with asthma have inflamed airways which causes two secondary symptoms: (1) The bronchi, the airway branches leading to the lungs, become overly reactive and more sensitive to all kinds of  asthma triggers such as allergens, cold and dry air, smoke and viruses. Also, (2) the lungs have difficulty moving air in and out, which is called airflow obstruction.  Together, these symptoms cause the tertiary symptoms the coughing, wheezing, tight chest and worse.  Asthma doesn't have to put major limits on your life. There are many things that you can do to take control of your asthma and minimize its impact on your activities. Because each case of asthma is different, treatment needs to be tailored for each person. One general rule that does apply, though, is removing the things in your environment that you know are factors that make your asthma worse. When these measures are not enough, it may be time to try one of the many medications that are available to control symptoms.  Asthma medications may be either inhaled or in pill form and are divided into two types\u2014quick-relief and long-term control. Quick-relief medicines are used to control the immediate symptoms of an asthma episode. In contrast, long-term control medicines do not provide relief right away, but rather help to lessen the frequency and severity of episodes over time.  Like all medications, asthma treatments often have side effects. These are usually mild and go away on their own. Be sure to ask your doctor about the side effects of the medications you are prescribed and what warning signs should prompt you to contact him or her I hope this helps. Please see your physician as soon as possible.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Ashlee,  Asthma is a chronic disease but can be managed. Only your physician can diagnosis you. For people with asthma, having an \u201casthma management plan\u201d is the best strategy to prevent symptoms.  An asthma management plan is something developed by you and your doctor to help you control your asthma, instead of your asthma controlling you what you have.  Identify and minimize contact with your asthma triggers.  Avoiding your triggers is the best way to reduce your need for medication and to prevent asthma episodes.  But first, you have to learn what those triggers are.  Any time you have an asthma episode, think about where you were and what you were doing in the past day or so. Answer questions like these in a diary or on your calendar:  Was I making a bed or vacuuming?  Was I near an animal? Cigarette smoke?  Did I have a cold or other infection?  Was I running, playing or exercising?  Was I upset, excited or tired?   Discuss your notes with your doctor to look for trends. As you identify your triggers, talk about which ones can be avoided, and how to best avoid them. For instance, if you are allergic to dust mites you should put an airtight cover around your pillow and mattress.  You may also want to discuss with your physician how immunotherapy might help to prevent allergy symptoms.  2.   Take your medications as prescribed. Asthma medicines are usually inhaled through a machine called a nebulizer, through a small device called a metered dose inhaler (also called an inhaler, puffer, or MDI) or through a dry powder inhaler (DPI).  For inhalers to work well, you must use them correctly. But over half of all people who use inhalers don't use them properly. Ask your doctor or nurse to watch you and check your technique. If it is still difficult to use, you have two choices. Ask them to recommend a spacer or holding chamber. This device attaches to the inhaler to make it easier to use and to help more medicine reach the lungs. Or, ask about using a \u201cbreath-actuated\u201d inhaler, which automatically releases medicine when you inhale.  Unless your asthma is very mild, chances are you have prescriptions for at least two different medicines. That can be confusing. The more you understand about what those medicines do and why they help, the more likely you are to use them correctly.  Although there are some potential adverse effects from taking asthma medications, the benefit of successfully controlling your asthma outweigh this risk. It is important to discuss each of your asthma medications with your physician to learn more about their effects.  3.  Monitor your asthma and recognize early signs that it may be worsening. Asthma episodes almost never occur without warning. Some people feel early symptoms, including: coughing, chest tightness, feeling very tired.  But because airways to the lungs narrow slowly, you may not feel symptoms until your airways are badly blocked. The key to controlling your asthma is taking your medicine at the earliest possible sign of worsening. In a mild attack inhalation of steam may help along with pursed lip breathing, this is when you pucker your lips(like a fish) and concentrate on breathing in and out. You want to focus on the exhale part of the breath and try to prolong this like you are trying to slowly blow out a candle across a room. Along with your inhaler your physician may prescribe meds to prevent or lessen future attacks. Of course as you have found out colds exacerbate the condition. Use good handwashing and stay away from persons with a cold\\flu. Symtpoms can range from mild to severe requiring hospitalization.\n\n",

As for pleurisy, some of the symptoms are:recent or present respiratory illness with its symptoms ,cough ,fever ,malaise ,localized chest pain on the chest wall, pain with each breath worsened by coughing and worsened by deep breathing. This can cause considerable amount of pain. I certainly hope that besides the blood work, that you have had some other testing, for example, a chest xray, pulmonary function studies, etc. Since your current treatment doesn't seem to be working, please discuss this with your physician for additional options.

    "content": "Dear Cocai,  We have to be really careful with the medications that we give to our children, reason being that some of them have the potential of causing serious side effects.  All prescription medications given to children have to be under medical supervision.  Systemic steroids have potential severe side effects both in children and adults.  Inhaled steroids on the other hand were thought not to have minimal systemic effects.   In children several studies were conducted on the effect of one of the inhaled steroids on growth in asthmatic children. These children were maintained on steroids for prolonged periods of time, so we are talking about long term use not every now and then, and the results were that inhaled steroids were found to cause growth delay. i think the thought that children pick up if the steroids are stopped, but i am not aware of any studies that confirm this putting in mind that i am not a pediatrician.  i don't think that there is anything to worry about for the time being.  Please, consult with your son's pediatrician before giving him any medications.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "In EMT class, I learned that normal rate of breathing per minute is 12-20x, and like all good students we have to practice on each other. Well, I never thought much about how many times per minute that I breathe until we did this (although I have occasional mild ashma, rarely use an inhaler, do take daily loratidine for allergies,I am 23) most of the time I breathe just fine, I don't ever hyperventilate- my breaths tend to be long, deep, slightly noisy, and either even on the exhale/outhale or slightly longer on the exhale, between 6-10 per minute.(and my pulse rate is always high, BP normal) Are too few breaths per minute a sign of uncontrolled asthma? Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Ally,  As you mentioned advair use has been infact associated with musculo-skeletal complications in 2-4% of patients. These complications range from arthralgia to muscle cramps. Although these drugs are inhaled they are absorbed minimally into the systemic circulation. This problem is not considered one of its life threatening adverse reactions. However, it can be very disabling. If your symptoms are not controlled by common analgesics such as panadol (not to be used for long periods) until it subsides, you may have to discontinue the use of Advair. Just because you have experienced this type of reaction with Advair doesn't necessarily mean that you will experience the same with alternative medication (even if their prescription says that you may). So an alternative drug is another option.\n\n",

It may be advisable to do so if indicated by your physician because your asthma may suddenly become worse without it. If on the other hand you gradually decrease the dose you can quickly increase it again if you feel you are getting worse.  You should not stop it without your doctors advice. Even if you feel better.  Regards.\n\n",

I took it for about 45 days then stopped.  It has been almost 1 month since I stopped and still my joint have pain is there it has not advanced or gotten worse.  My doctor tested me for ruematod athritis negative.  He is not sure what it is I have never had any thing like this pain before it is like they stiffen up once I work them a little the pain mostly goes away. Could the advair have damaged my joints or the cartalidge or maybe the lubracation for the cartalidge and it will take my body time to recover?  Or could this be some kind of withdrwl from the steriod?  The pain is not severe but it is there and do not want to keep paying for tests but do not want to damage my self further.\n\n",

    "content": "Your joint symptoms point to an inflammatory type of arthritis and its a good thing your doctor excluded rheumatoid arthritis. However, there are other types that need to be excluded just the same. You are probably better going to a rheumatologist.  Your question regarding the asthma - GERD connection is a good one. There remains contraversy regarding whether a connection exists and what that connection may be. From the studies performed, especially a study published by Johns Hopkins University, it looks more likely that there is a connection. Interesting findings are: *GERD is reportedly seen in more than 75% of all asthma patients *The base of the esophagus and the bronchial tree have a common nerve ending source.  When the area is aggravated, both the esophagus and the bronchial tree react. If GERD flares up, asthma flares up also and vice versa. *Patients experience chest tightening when there is acid in the esophagus.  *Microaspiration of acid can occur during a GERD episode, causing decreased lung function. It could turn out that GERD is an exacerbating factor for asthma just like exercise for example.  If you think GERD may be causing respiratory problems, you should determine whether the reflux symptoms appeared before your asthma, whether your breathing becomes more difficult after meals, when lying down, or after exercise, and if your asthma is worse at night. These could all be signs of GERD induced asthma.  As for your question regarding prevacid, nexium and prilosec they all belong to the same pharmacological category of drugs known as proton pump inhibitors. Any one of them may be sufficient to control your symptoms. Needless to say, your doctor of course needs to be informed which one you are taking.  Regards,\n\n",

There is a 10% chance that if a person is allergic to penicillin, he/she will be allergic to cephalosporins as well and if the original allergic reaction to penicillin was in the form of anaphylaxis, most doctors usually don't take the chance of giving a cephalosporin.   If you develop an allergy to any medication. Don't take it, that's the treatment.  Don't take an antibiotic unless absolutely necessary and you have to tell your doctor about your allergies so that he avoids giving those antibiotics or any one belonging to the same family.

    "content": "Significant elevations of serum IgE concentrations are seen in patients with allergic disease, parasitism and bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, extrinsic asthma, urticaria and atopic eczema, IgE myeloma and hyperimmunoglobulin E Staph abscess syndrome (Buckley, Job syndromes). The reference levels for IgE are less than 100 IU/mL. Atopic disease is likely if more than 375 IU/mL. Extreme elevations of 800-25000 IU/mL are associated with severe atopic dermatitis, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis among other things.  Allergen specific IgE Antibody levels tests the level of IgE in response to a certain specific antigen. In your case this is the aspergillus antigen. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis can be diagnosed by several criteria including elevated total serum IgE levels and the presence of allergen-specific IgE and IgG antibodies.  Your doctor has determined that you have aspergillosis and that it is the cause of your asthma. Best regards,\n\n",

    "title": "Drug toxicity with Advair",
    "content": "I have had a severe reaction to Advair. Side effects named by company are muscle and bone pain. Started a few days after starting drug. After much investigation on internet  I found many others that had same reaction. Difficulty walking(joint pain), muscle spasms, as thogh severe arthritis developed overnight. Some said it took 6 months to return to normal. All people mentioned that their doctors basically said there was no connection. My doc had no knowledge but I had brought the written proof. However, he had no answer so to suggest going to your doctor will not work. Is this causing an auto-immune arthritis or could it be adrenal suppression. Is there nothing to be done except wait until these symptoms subside? Doris Ashley RN\n\n",

    "title": "Advair and muskulo-skeletal pain",
    "content": "Dear Doris, Advair is a combination of fluticasone (corticosteroid) & salmeterol (Beta stimulant) used in the treatment of asthma. It should be used at regular intervals and not for treatment of acute bronchospasm. It has been infact associated with musculo-skeletal complications in 2-4% of patients. These complications range from arthralgia to muscle cramps. Although these drugs are inhaled they are absorbed minimally into the systemic circulation. This problem is not considered one of its life threatening adverse reactions. However, it can be very disabling. If your symptoms are not controlled by common analgesics such as panadol (not to be used for long periods) until it subsides, you may have to discontinue the use of Advair. Just because you have experienced this type of reaction with Advair doesn't necessarily mean that you will experience the same with alternative medication (even if their prescription says that you may). So an alternative drug is another option. I am not aware of what causes the arthralgia but the possibility of autoimmune or adrenal suppression is highly unlikely.\n\n",
