    "title": "ACL Surgery for new Surgical Technologist",
    "content": "I am a new surgical technologist in the military and am trying very hard to become more advanced with my skills in orthopedic surgery.  One common procedure we receive at my hospital is ACL surgery.  Our head ortho tech has been unable to educate anyone else how to prepare an autograft for this procedure once it has been removed from the patient.  I have been able to determine a very vague idea of what happens by watching out of the corner of my eye while working with him, but lack specifics.  I was wondering if anybody would happen to be able to inform me in detail the procedure for the surgical technologists role in preparing an autograft for use in an ACL surgery or if they would be aware of any material where I could find this.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I think the question becomes why isn't the ortho tech able to teach you how to prepare the ACL graft. As long as you scrub in and discuss it beforehand with him ...and may discuss with the ortho doc and other team members.  Then you would be prepared to participate more fully. Watch one. Do one. Teach one.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "-20 years had aching in both knees brought on by walking, standing, and no pain running -Orthotics made it worse -15 years ago discovered wearing flat shoes resolved issue -7 years ago left knee began hurting standing, walking, sleeping, but not running -Leg raises and deep massage helped -4 years ago began getting intense nighttime pain once every 1 or 2 weeks -Diagnoses showed medial condyles are touching -Suggested a knee brace, got the Don Joy $1000 ACL knee brace, wore it at night, and instantly resolved issue -For occasional medial condyle pain wore knee brace in the daytime -Last 6 months pain at night returned -I wore knee brace more often and pain would not go away. Once I took it off and pain went away. (Knee brace strap puts pressure on the iliotibial band that pulls over the patella.) -5 months ago had ultrasound but did not show suspected fat pad impingement -Had cortisone injection, no benefit -6 months ago I tried acupuncture in the iliotibial band along the femur and got instant relief for 2 months but pain then returned -3 months ago had occasional pain while playing hockey. -Continue to do direct deep massage of the iliotibial band, acupuncture, iliotibial band stretches, leg raises for medial strengthening (last \u00bc of the extension) -Tried taping, ice, heat to no avail -2 MRIs (independent of each other) within last 4 months -Results: 1/ \"Mild chondrosis of the patellar lateral facet. Small amount of synovitis affecting the lateral aspect of the knee joint.\" 2/ \"A small amount of fluid is noted within the knee joint. A tiny focus of cartilaginous edema and fissuring is noted within the cartilage overlying the proximal tibia laterally.\" Except for the Obers test, all tests by surgeons and sports specialists have turned up nothing.  My conclusion: The iliotibial band is always pulling my patella laterally. At night it rests against the fat pad that is highly sensitive to pain. I would like a surgeon to sever its connection to my patella. Stretching the iliotibial band is extremely challenging. I suspect that for most of my life I have had extremely tight iliotibial bands. Note I also get pain from my right iliotibial band at the hip and at the right 5th metatarsal that I cracked 15 years ago. The other option is to trim the fat pad.  I will ask my surgeon if the MRI shows my patella not tracking correctly. Dr. Resnik (see youtube, \u201clateral release\u201d) wrote me to look for the \u201cTT-TG difference\u201d. I see my surgeon this Thurday, operation booked for next Wednesday.\n\n",

    "content": "I injured my knee playing soccer a couple months ago.  The ER told me everything was ok originally.  Four weeks later, I went to an orthopedist who informed me I had an ACL tear and smashed meniscus.  The time In between doctor visits, I walked a little each day on the knee because it did not cause me pain.  I have since had surgery to repair the ACL and, unfortunately, remove 50% off the meniscus.  For my current peace of mind, I was just wondering, do you think I could have really torn up the meniscus much more after the injury just by a little walking?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Sharp pain in the shoulder after subacromial decompression surgery 4 weeks post - op requires an evaluation especially since the shoulder has done well post - op. Whether this is scar tissue stretching or a new problem/injury is to be determined.  The physician will assess your range of motion and strength; look at the incision site and ask a bunch of question about your activity level and the nature of the pain. A treatment plan will be formulated.  Most likely, you will need to back off the intensity of use of the shoulder for a couple weeks and in the interim see a physical therapist.   Take care.\n\n",

I have always been athletic but i am also overwieght for my height or at least now. im 5'7 and weigh 190. So, well getting to the point, i played two hours of basketball 10 days ago and the next day when i woke up my knee was locked (meaning i had a hard time straightening my leg). I did various streches but i had to go through a great deal of pain but after the thrid day my leg recovered and i was able to straighten it easily but whenever i sat down for a long period of time and then get up, my knee would be in great sharp pain. So i went to the college nurse/ doctor and she told my that i had some swelling in my knee (underder the meniscus and where the two ligaments are). i have rested for a week now and treated my knee with icing and ace brace etc...i have not been consistent with the icing but i will be waiting for a week. i think i have the symptoms of osteochondrosis but i do not know how to fix this problem...hoping that this not a long term because i really wanted to exercise/weightlift and to lose weight. My cracking has gotten worse over this week becuase i think i have been idle and that cause my knee and ankle to crack more vs to when i am constantly exercising everyday...  what should i do...i would consult a doctor but i have no insurance at this time because i get a private insurance when enrolled in my university. Since, i am doing summer school in a community college...i have no insurance and my parents' insurance does not support me.\n\n",

I am thinking about the knee cartilage and ligament health which can be assessed in the office and certainly with MRI.  First though, get some x-rays.

I had an accident that resulted in a bad knee sprain with lateral collateral and both cruciate ligaments being torn, torn knee capsule, torn biceps femoris tendon and partial temporary leg paralysis because the nerves were crushed. I had surgery to reattach the tendon, the lateral ligament and the capsule. However, following imperfect cast, the lateral ligament is now too long and will not hold the knee in place properly.  Now I need to have surgery to get the lateral and one or both cruciate ligaments re-attached.Right now I have 2 different medical opinions, one saying it will take 6 weeks in full leg cast while another says a maximum of 5 days in a knee brace set at 15dg. Normally, how long does the leg need to be immobilized after this type of surgery? Is it full leg cast (from the toes to the upper thigh) or just partial (just around the knee)?\n\n",

    "title": "3 ACL Reconstruction/Revision Issues",
    "content": "I'm a 23 year old male and have had three ACL reconstruction/revision surgeries.  A Hamstring graft surgery in 2007, a bone-patella-bone in 2008, and after no progress post-surgery, a cadaver Achilles Tendon \"double-bundle\" revision in December 2009.  I am still having severe pain within the knee, on the exterior of the front to inside (of leg) portion of my knee, my patella bone/tendon, high levels of instability in normal activities (walking, stairs, etc.), consistent popping in my left (injured) knee, left hip, and right (uninjured) knee, as well as pain where there are my two tunnels and incision points on my tibia.  Are there any other options, surgically or otherwise, that can get me back to my desired level of physical activity (sports, running, general all-around comfort), or have I essentially used up all options and cannot hope to regain my previous high level of physical activities?  Thank you in advance. Matt\n\n",

    "title": "Re: 3 ACL Reconstruction/Revision Issues",
    "content": "Matt,  Thanks for writing in. One of the main questions I like to have answered before an aggressive rehab program is What is the status of the repair?  Is there full healing?   Also, Is the knee structurally intact?    How much can we expect with both what has been repaired, the quality of repair and any residual deficits?  These are all questions for the orthopedic surgeon.  From a rehab standpoint, we start looking at range of motion, strength, pain levels, swelling and functional status.   Also, we look at response to treatment including response to exercise.  In essence, find a good sports PT and consult with the ortho doc to get both long term and short term expectations and goals.  Take care.\n\n",

She rides four hours a day and works out for three hours. She has knee pain in both knees and had physical therapy for two years! She aslo had cortisone injections and nothing has worked so far. We received a second opinion and this knee surgeon recommened a lateral release and tightening of a ligament although i cant remember the name. She has pain under her kneecap on the sides of her kneecap and her knee occasionally gives out on her. She has been diagnosed with patellar femoral syndrome and the surgeon says that the MRI shows that her kneecaps tilt at a 22 degree angle. He thinks that she would benefit from this surgery because conservative treatments have failed her. Is she too young to have two knee surgeries. She has had ankle surgery but this sounds more extreme. How will this effect her training schedual? Thanks\n\n",

    "title": "Will a hip replacement correct a leg length discrepancy ?",
    "content": "This is really a simple question, but it may be helpful to know the unfortunate background of my condition.  To summarize, I have a congenital birth defect that caused the left leg to be shorter than the right.   At age 3, in Poland, I had an unsuccessful ilizarov operation which caused many complications. Many surgeries (13) were performed surrounding this apparatus, including lengthening the tendons, adding additional pins, and extending the apparatus below the knee. I developed a bone infection and the apparatus was removed. I broke my leg while walking, in the weak fusion point and a metal plate was inserted to stabilize the femur.  At age 4 I came the the United States and had 2 more surgeries at kaiser. One was a hip reconstruction, and the other was to remove the metal plate from my bone. Also a 6 month course of anti biotics cleared up the staff infection.   At age 8 I was seen as a patient of Shiners who performed 2 operations to slow the growth of the right leg in order to minimize the 4 inch leg length discrepancy. I currently have only a 1 inch difference between the left and right leg which I see as a huge success and a small trade off for being short (5' 4'').   The last orthopedic surgeon I saw said that I will require a total hip replacement, due to the severe hip displasia,  before I am 30 (in the next 10 years).    I am wondering if this operation, will be able to correct this difference in leg length. It seems logical to me that it would, but would a special longer ball socket be needed? Any information on the topic would be helpful and I thank you for reading this!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello anesidora,  You certainly have gone through a lot, and I'm so sorry that you have more to face.  To respond to your question, the answer has to be a qualified \"maybe\".  It really depends on the condition of the bone into which the prosthesis will be inserted.  That is, if the healthy bone is long enough to allow the extra inch (or less), and whether it would result in further difficulty for you.  A longer prosthesis may be possible, again depending on your bone structure.  Gaining length is possible, but it depends on many factors, which your orthopedic surgeon should discuss with you when you are planning the surgery.  It would require careful measurement on the surgeon's part, before and during the surgery.  Once the prosthesis is cemented and set, the length will be permanent.    I admire your positive attitude!  Good luck to you.\n\n",

He didn't give me a reason for doing this even when I asked.  I didn't regain full motion of my knee, and sports of any kind cause extreme swelling in my repaired knee even with a knee brace.  The doctor tells me there is nothing he can do, and prescribes naproxen to try to control the swelling(which doesn't work too well).  A MRI shows the graft is in place though.

    "title": "Re: Knee swelling continues years post ACL repair",
    "content": "Hi, Most patients (close to 90%) will be expected to recover fully following surgery.Complications occur in about 10% of cases.  Some specific complications related to the ACL repairs are - persistent pain and swelling (synovitis/effusion), - anterior knee pain,    - restriction of range of motion, and  - residual ligament laxity due to graft failure.  Although general guidelines exist for Post-ACL rehab, it is very important that each person should progresses through their rehab as their knee allows(an individualized management). Therefore it is important to ensure that rehab occurs under supervision of a physical therapist and physician.  Despite successful surgery and meticulous rehab, in 10% of cases, symptoms may persist.One of the causes which needs special mention is when an associated meniscal injury escapes detection even in the best of hands(both on MRI & at surgery).Injuries to the posterior horn of the lateral meniscus are notorious for escaping detection.  As your pain is persisting, you must have yourself re-evaluated by your orthopedic surgeon.Best wishes!\n\n",

Can a partial or hemi arthroplasty be done or... arthroscopic surgery done?  Sometimes an MRI can specify the extent of damage and give a better idea if the defect are repairable.  It is true that younger age with THR will require revision at 15 years =/- 5 years.   Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Look into \"hip resurfacing.\"  I had it done at 29 years old due to a sports injury that never healed correctly leading to painful cysts and bone spurs in the hip joint.  Instead of running the rod down your leg (which can cause a lot of issues in itself), the rod is through the neck of the hip.  They shave down the femoral head and put a \"mushroom cap\" on as well as replace the socket (removing all pain).  Highly recommend the procedure if you are a candidate.\n\n",

Lastly, since you have arthrofibrosis, going well beyond your new normal limit of range of motion on the landing may have torn some tissue and/or caused a loose body to be floating in the knee.  Get an MRI and/or see your orthopedist or vice versa.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The pain in the knees sounds like tendonitis of the patella tendon.  This usu responds to ice, NSAIDS, and strengthening/stretching program.   The general joint stiffness and pain you report are in weight bearing joints (ankles, knees, and low back).  At 190 lbs and 5' 7'' shedding about 30 lbs may do wonders for these joints.  Along with weight loss, a strengthening program is vital to add good support to the joints.  Flexible strong muscles not only help us move better but they also provide stability and support to bones and joints.   Before going down the road of extensive testing for rheumatological disorders, I would recommend 3-6 months of gradual total body conditioning.  Consistency is the key. If any problems, see your family physician. Hope this helps.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Kayben,  Sorry to hear about your condition.  Rheumatoid arthritis is sadly quite debilitating conditions, and sounds like you have a had a bad time with it.  Your FBC results suggest 1) An elevate white count with netrophila, and 2) anaemia of chronic disease, both consistent with Rheumatoid arthritis but not diagnostic of it.  The test that diagnoses this condition is Rheumatoid factor, which I presume you would have had done sometime ago.  In any case this condition is a systemic disease which needs systemic treatments.  Mild cases respond to anti-inflammatories and painkillers.  Severe varieties need disease modifying drugs and steroids.  Both require the attention of a rheumatologist, and a lot of these treatments are \"suck it and see\" what helps....  Surgery is resorted when joint destruction occurs, but essentially Rheumatoid arthritis is a condition affecting the lining of the joint, not the joint itself, and despite the fluid and swelling that occurs in the joint, initial treatment is almost always pharmacological.  Best wishes  Saif\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Lateral Ligament Release Surgery",
    "content": "Hi, The structure of the knee is complex, and management of patello-femoral malalignment can be equally so.   Re-alignment of the structures of the knee joint including the patello-femoral joint involves realigning -  the forces within the joint and -  the forces outside the joint.     Perfect alignment throughout the arc of flexion and correct varus-valgus alignment in all positions of flexion is the hall-mark of a normal knee joint and this is what is aimed at while managing malalignment.  Reliable anatomical landmarks  are required for surgical re-alignment (both in flexion and extension). Highly reliable landmarks are the long axes of the femur and tibia and the AP (anterior-posterior) axis of the femur and provide the guidelines for establishing stable alignment of the joint surfaces by placing the tibia and patellar groove correctly in the median anterior-posterior plane throughout the entire arc of flexion.   Ligaments perform specific functions, and these functions differ in different positions of knee flexion. Knowing their function and testing their tension clinically provides the information needed to plan release only the ligaments that are excessively tight.   Ligament release is not believed to cause instability of the knee. Failure to align the knee and release the tight ligaments, however, does cause excessive wear and tear,instability,and unreliable function.  In your case, there seem to be multiple problems (a previously repaired medial meniscus, a recently torn lateral meniscus +  possible patellofemoral malalignment). Your orthopedic surgeon will be the best person to decide if non-operative means or surgery is the best option for you. Best wishes!\n\n",

If you strongly feel that your symptoms very closely resemble the symptoms during the first episode, recurrent tear of the repaired medial meniscus certainly needs to be excluded.

I'm having the survery to remove some of the bone and to shave some of the already frayed tendon (not torn yet). Before I saw my doctor, I did a regimen of aleve/ibuprofen.

I've had surgeries on my knee and ankle, but neither were open.

Most people are painfree and fully functioning as soon as 1-3 months post procedure certainly at the 12 month mark.  Many people report painfree symptoms 1-7 days after procedure but sometimes pain can linger. It would be good to call your physician's office and ask about expecting duration of pain and if you should be seen sooner than your scheduled follow up.   As long as there is no new swelling and redness around the joint and no fever, this pain probably will subsided with time and ability to bear some weight on the leg.   Did the physician order no weight at all on the leg or are you following the weight bearing precautions strickly.  Let us know how the your condition turns out.\n\n",

It was doctors orders to stay off of the leg for six weeks and I intend to do that and longer if needed.  I have only a few times accidently put weight on the leg for seconds if that.  Is there any way to tell what the pain is?  Or do I need to just wait and see what happens?  Also, are there any signs I should watch that would indicate a complication?

    "content": "So back in the beginning of Sept I was dismounting my horse and my left knee popped and I fell to the ground. Ambulance ride, xrays, mri, and doc visits, I tore my acl. 9/30 I had my cad. graft... things were going great, I was making great progress, and this monday i returned to work without a brace or crutches. Under orders to be careful, move around but do not under any circumstances over do it. Anyway. Monday came and went with very little swelling or pain.. I was tired of course.. but that was to be expected. Tuesday came and by mid afternoon my calf, foot and ankle where 3 or 4x the size and hard.. and most likely warm.. but you know how it is when you feel yourself for being hot/warm... anyway, my pants were skin tight on me, and I was afraid my sneakers were going to the audible POP when I took it off.. so I iced, elevated and the swelling went down over night.. not all the way mind you but it did go down considerably. So I called my doc this morning when I got into the office and left a VM for the nurse... she called me back and told me to go and get a ultra sound done to r/o blood clots. The results came back neg... for the clot which is great.. but then again, I have no idea why I am still swollen, hard and warm... I have an apt on Friday.. but being inpatient, I want to know what is going on.. not be in pain anymore and get back to being normal.   Please can someone help? Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The swelling in the lower leg could be from a couple of things. 1. The knee can be the source and the swelling has moved downward from the knee.  I would expect however the knee itself to swell too and increase in soreness. 2.  The ankle or calf area has an inflammatory condition - too much activity for tissue that has been underworked for several months. 3.  Deep vein thrombosis: ultrasound is negative however.  In any case, your physician will evaluate the limb and get a clearer idea of the cause. Easy does it until then.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "I have been having pain in my left foot for three months. Eventually I noticed the popping and can see the peroneal tendon going back and forth across my ankle. I went to the student health clinic (I am a grad student, it's my only option half the time) and they didn't even look at it, just gave me a referral to a podiatrist.   My podiatrist appt is Nov 2nd and I'm stressing about it. I don't go to the doctor often because I don't get sick often. I am a biology graduate student so usually I can realize it's a problem that my immune system will take care of and nothing to worry about. I don't know what to expect the first visit so I'm asking advice. Will they put me in a brace? Will they do an MRI? Will I have to stay off of it? Will I be able to drive my stick shift car home from the doctor (It's my clutch foot!).   Anything I can do to ease the pain and discomfort until my podiatrist appt? I'm frustrated that the health clinic didn't even suggest an OTC brace to buy and all I have been doing is upping the concentration of Icy Hot (I try to avoid taking pills due to a sensitive stomach).   Many thanks!\n\n",

According to MRI: 1) Abnormal signal of labrum fromm 7:00 to 1:00 position. 2) Hill-Sachs deformity of anterior humeral head. 3) Tendinopathy and low grade intrasubstance and bursal-sided partial tear of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus tendons. No full thickness tendon tear seen. 4) Mild osteoarthrosis of the acromioclavicular joint and mild lateral downsloping of a type I acromion.  Of course no clue what these findings mean, the doctor I went to see couldn't explain much. Would the above findings be the reason for me feeling a \"burning\" sensation and sharp pain in my shoulder joint, it feels at times like someone is pinching or pressing down on the top of my shoulder from the neck to the joint, can't sleep on my shoulder anymore and when I lay on my back if I move my arm to my left side and back to the right it makes a clicking sound and it feels like my shoulder \"double\" clutches to move back.\n\n",

Occurs from a dislocation. 3) Partial rotator cuff tear in the shoulder. 4) AC joint arthritis with mild separation.  Arthroscopic surgery may be needed to repair the labrum but since the rotator cuff was not completely torn conservative treatment with physical therapy should be given a trial.

    "content": "Hi,  Last Sept. I had my 2nd talar OCD sx.   First one failed secondary to manufactured plug not taking.  2nd sx. had autograft placement from my knee along w/ peroneal tendon transfer, calcaneal translational osteotomy, and plantar release.  I recently had an MRI due to continued pain in ankle and \"popping\" of my peroneal tendon.  MRI showed edema at tibiotalar joint and around peroneal tendon.  This is the synopsis from radiology, \"An osteochondral graft is redemonstrated in the talar dome.  There has been interval increase in fatty marrow signal at the caudal aspect of the graft, consistent with interval partial integration.  Stable T2 hyperintensity in the overlying cartilage is compatible with softening.Evidence of intervening peroneal tendon surgery with mild hyperintensity of the peroneus brevis tendon, consistent with tendinitis.\"  Most of the above I don't understand, but primarily I am looking for a 2nd opinion to verify that my tendon popping is JUST tendonitis and not subluxing.   Doc. felt my ankle and I was able to make it pop by pulling my toes up and out.  I am concerned that the popping is being overlooked.  My doc. gave me a topical anti-inflammatory ointment and told me to brace my foot.  Can peroneal tendonitis really cause the popping which is audible, and painful?  Is the tendonitis a result from a dislocating tendon?  Can the two tendons, brevis and longus, rub together and cause popping???  I have been dealing w/ this ankle for 3 years and do not want to risk further damage!  Is it worth a second opinion?  Thank you in advance for your help and for addressing my questions!!!!\n\n",

My parents noticed it when I was a kid, but they thought it was nothing abnormal since I had been an active athlete and never had any complaints from it.  Now I'm 23, and I've been suffering from vague foot pain/tingling for 2 years. It's evident when I walk and even when I'm sitting down. I got a custom-made orthoses, good sturdy shoes, but I still feel this pain and tingling when I'm sitting. I've had EMGs and Nerve conduction studies, and they were all normal. The orthopedic doctor who examined me said I had a 'severe' valgus deformity of my hind foot.  So my question is, would surgery be a good choice for me at this age? I'm just starting my career, and this problem is extremely distracting and annoying.  I'd appreciate your help. Thank you.\n\n",

    "title": "Carticel procedure",
    "content": "I have been suffering from ongoing pain in my right knee now for a year.  I am currently 25 and very active (running 25-30 miles a week).  Back in 1/09 I was diagnosed with a stress fracture of the medial tibial plateau after my first MRI.  A second MRI in 4/09 showed that the stress fracture was healed.  Due to ongoing pain, catching and popping my orthopod finally agreed to do arthroscopy on 9/3/09.  Much to his surprise (but not mine) he found a tear in the articular cartilage on the medial femoral condoyle.  The lesion was grade 3/4 and measured 16mm x 20mm.  He woke me up during the procedure to ask me if I would prefer he do a microfracture procedure or the Carticel procedure.  Knowing nothing about either, I left the decision up to him and he decided that he thought Carticel would be the better choice.  I have done my research about the procedure, and am currently waiting on insurance pre-approval, but would like to hear any input from others who have had experience with this procedure, either patients or doctors.  Successes, failures, difficulties, recovery?  Is it possible to make a full recovery?  Also, I can't seem to get a straight answer about whether or not it is safe to run on my knee in the meantime.  It is healing from the arthroscopy (four weeks out) quite well with just a little swelling remaining and less pain than before the procedure.  I don't want to cause further damage, but if it is possible to get some running in before the Carticel procedure, I would like to get some variety rather than biking every day.  Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "I have had 2 shoulder replacement surgeries in the last 2 1/2 years.  Because of being a brittle diabetic, I form severe adhesions in the shoulder.  I had 3 months of physical therapy but still have pretty much no range of motion.  The pt folks kind of gave up on me as the pt was causing me more pain.  I went back to the doctor who performed the revision and he told me, unfortunately, he could cut the adhesions out but they would more than likely just grow back.  I am now going to a pain management clinic.  They have me on Opana ER 40 mg, with Magnacet for breakthrough pain.  The meds do not touch my pain.  They only make me want to close my eyes.   I am at my wits end.  This pain is causing me to be on temporary light duty at my job, where I am a cashier.  I work the self-checkouts at a grocery store.  I am considering applying for disability, but I really don't want to.  I just can barely get going.  I have difficulty showering, dressing, etc.  I do everything with one hand only.  When driving, I cannot even reach up to turn on my turn signal and opening and closing my door is all done with the right hand reaching over.  I need to know if anyone else has been like this and if they were treated and how?  My life is really depressing right now and I am getting where I just want to give up.  I hope there is some solution out there for me.  I am willing to try just about anything for some relief from this  pain. Thank you. Joyce Robertson\n\n",

    "content": "Joyce,  Sorry about the delayed response.  Adhesions in the shoulder are difficult to treat.  They seem to have a life of their own.  Often the shoulder will go through a freeze and thaw cycle regardless of treatment.  The shoulder replacements complicate matters as range of motion is difficult to regain after this procedure.  You are on strong narcotics for pain refief.   Despite these obstacles do not give up.   It may be worthwhile to see a massage therapist who can work on the muscles surrounding the shoulder joint.  Since the joint itself is disabled and painful; message may release some tension and contributing pain in the surrounding structures. A home remedy I often recommend is menthol (e.g. Icy hot) and salcylate (Aspercreme) - a dab of each and massage into the tissue...then apply a moist heat pack for 20 min.  This often works well in chronic tendonitis and may help the shoulder.   Also, the orthopedic doc (or family doc) may prescribe an NSAID patch to apply directly on the shoulder (granted heart and kidney function are ok). Grace be with you.\n\n",

I am getting ready to see another doctor about getting perhaps a nerve block.  I have cut myself back at work to just 3 days per week.  Right now, my financial situation will not allow for the cost of massages.  I have been using a product called Freeze It roll on for a long time.  I usually sleep with a heating pad on low.  If the nerve block does not work we are going to try accupuncture.  I just don't know how long I can handle this pain.  Right now, it is shooting down my arm into my elbow into my wrist and center of the back of  my hand.  I can only thank God that it is my left arm and not  my right.  A lot of times I can just cry cuz it hurts so bad.  It truly is ruining my life.  We never realize how we take our body parts for granted until they don't work anymore.

I have severe nerve damage and pain in my right hand for which I take lyrica, magnacet, and ultram er. I also take a sleepping pill to help me sleep.

I wake up some mornings and wonder if life is worth it, but then my two and four year old boys come jump in bed with me and say they love me. they are my only reasonfor sticking around. I was a retail manager working my way up the line going for a corporate position and now I am a stay at home,bored out of my mind,stay at home dad. I am about to start suboxone to see if that will help the pain. It is meant to treat drug addiction but my doctor says it will help the pain and is 40% stronger than magnacet without some of the mental side affects. well sorry i am so long winded but I have no one to talk to.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 50 year old male, active.  5'7\" 170lbs.  I regularly exercise (free weights, calisthenic, bike, row).  Ski in winter, golf and bike in summer (20+ miles once a week, in good weather, 15 mph+). I'm am, fortunately, free of daily aches and pain.  I'm not a runner.  Last week while away I went for a jog, flat, about 1.5 - 2 miles.  Within a couple of hours, my left knee felt stiff / full.  Not achy.  No swelling or discoloration, no noise.    Riding home in the car (8 hours, the next day), it felt as if it swelled up, and the general region above and below the knee felt weak.  Still no swelling or discoloration.  Patella is stable.  It has eased back, but is still stiff, and either actually weak or I'm perceiveing a weakness.  Exercising yesterday didn't aggravate it (deep knee bends / squats with dumbells).  But getting on and off the floor for pushups or crunches is difficult.  I'm going to make an appointment, and I'm assuming that an MRI is in order.  But I'm very concerned and curious - does this sound like something that can abate on its own?  Do you thing it's a ligament or do I have a bursa sac or fluid issue internally, or what?  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Thank you for the well described condition.  This knee stiffness and ache may resolve on its own without MRI or any intervention.  You may need to back off a bit on your regular exercise intensity for a few weeks then restart gradually.  And also take some NSAIDS and ice or heat packs.  Probably what happened is the surfaces of the knee (articular cartilage) did not like the pounding of the running but only let you know that after the run.  It is fairly common occurrence.  Running probably is not for you.  And since you already have a consistent and good routine, I would not fiddle with running.  Take care.\n\n",

Some pain meds are narcotics while others are not.  A few days of narcotic pain meds followed by OTC analgesics works well for most folks in your situation.  But discuss with the surgeon what works best for you over the next two weeks.   Also, if your surgeon allows you to use ice packs, then do so.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "back i the end of Oct 2008 I suffered a level 3 AC seperation to my right arm from direct impact with the ground. This injury has been left alone without any physical therapy and has healed with the clavical still seperated and at an angel of about 20 degrees. looking at recent x-rays it still looks like a level 3 separation. I am currently on deployment to Iraq and recently I have been feeling tingling down to my elbow, sharp and dull pains in the shoulder and up the right side of my neck as well as a burning sensation throughout my shoulder and my arm goes a little numb. The symptoms seem to vary depending on movement, and some days i am symptom free minus the dull pain. I have full range of motion, minus the pain that goes with it and quite a large deformaty (lump) in my shoulder. I am able to lift weights although again the pain comes later, I can endure having weight put on the shoulder as well with pain afterwards. My question is: almost a year has past without physical therapy, the symtpoms seems to be unpredictable from activity to activity. Surgery has been mentioned but PT has not been ruled out. I do not want to just put a bandaid on my injury until i get back to the states if it can be fixed or relatively fixed back home with surgery? any questions I should be asking the doctors here or anything i should be aware of as I move forward to get myself taken care of would be greatly appreciated\n\n",

Arguably, I start with the following assessment:   Injury without clavicle fracture and/or no need to use the shoulder in heavy work favor conservative treatment(P.T.)   Clavicle fracture and/or need to do heavy work with the shoulder favors the surgical repair.  Other consideration like risk of infection and effects of anesthesia come into play as well.  Certainly, discussing all the options with an orthopedist would be in your best interest.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Medial knee pain after run/walk a half marathon is the report.  Pain is stabbing or sharp and has not resolved almost 2 weeks post run.   A thorough physical exam would include testing the medial meniscus.  The best way to do this is to stand on the affected leg only with knee flexion 30 degrees then twist left and right on the knee.  If pain increases then meniscus is likely involved.   It is also important to palpate the knee to see if external structure are the source of pain.  If the pain is lower than the knee joint line, this may be pes anserinus bursitis or tendonitis.  Another consideration is bone bruise or fracture due to repetitive trauma.  This and medial meniscus problems should show up on MRI.   So I may suggest having either MRI or seeing an orthopedist who will check internal and external structure and try to differentiate what is causing the pain.   Bone bruise and stress fractures need time to heal.  Medical meniscus problems usu need a scope.  And tendonitis/bursitis responds to rest, NSAIDS, and physical therapy. Let us know how it goes.\n\n",

    "title": "Post Ulnar release surgery still having same pains.. WORRIED",
    "content": "Hello,  I have a long story but I'll just touch on the key points and try to keep it as short as possible. I am a 33 y/o amatuer bowler. On no medications, no allergies, very active.  April of 2008- During bowling my shoulder was sore so I ask a friend to hold my hand as I lightly lean back to stretch my shoulder. Being the jokester that he is, he violently yanked my arm straight down with full force. From my elbow to my fingers was numb for a couple of mintues but went away. No pain, or loss of mobility. Continued to bowl. Over the next few weeks I noticed a little discomfort in my elbow. No pain just a little sore but it got progressively worse. The season ended in June and by then I had to take 800mg of Ibuprofen to bowl 3 games. The discomfort turned into a sharp pain.  So I took 2 months off from bowling to let it recoop.   September 2008- Tried to bowl again. This time the pain was unbearable. The pain was only in my elbow. It did not shoot down my arm to my fingers. It would only hurt when I went full extension at a fast rate with weight in my hand (bowling ball). I buprofen didn't work. I knew something was wrong. Went to a orthapedic surgeon who requested an MRI.  MRI results came back.... a inflammed ulnar nerve with a bone spur present.  My ROM was fine, my strength was fine. No tingling in my forearm or hand. Just pain in the inside of my elbow.   October 08-December 08- The surgeon recommened PT. Did 6 weeks. Ultra sounds and light weights. Bowling was strictly prohibited. After 6 weeks the pain was still there. Doc referred me to a neurologist and they did a nerve conduction test. Results were that the signal was slowing down in the inner part of my elbow where the pain was coming from.  So I opt'd for surgery.   12/17/08- Surgery done. 45 min outpatient surgery. I have a 5\" scar on the inner part of my elbow. Doc said when he went in, that the spur wasn't causing any issues but it was just soft tissue. So he removed tissue,  released the nerve, but left the spur. Why he left it there I don't know.   April 09- After 7 weeks of PT post-op I still have the same pain. The intensity is the same. I still have my full range of motion and strength. The doc says now that he believes that my elbow is hyperextending cause the pain. So he gave me a brace to limit my ROM (mainly extension). While this does stop me from going full extension, without the brace I'm still at square one.  I'm starting to believe that the surgery may have not been the right thing to do and that I might be stuck with this pain for the rest of my life.   So I'm wanting a second opinion on what I should do/try. I've even contimplated acupuncture. Should I get another MRI done?  Could it be that they may have overlooked a torn ligament or cartiledge? I'm worried that I won't be able to bowl with my 14 month old son when he bowls for the first time or play catch with him.   Thanks for any help.    -Mark\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Sometimes cubital tunnel (tunnel at the medial elbow where the ulnar nerve travels into the lower arm) release or decompression fails. It would good to know the neurological status of the ulnar nerve at this point... another nerve conduction test. The question at this point is whether the pain is due to nerve inflamation or continued entrapment or is it from other elbow problems.  Sometimes the release of the ulnar nerve fails and surgeon may need to relocate the ulnar nerve - another surgery.  This would be worthwhile getting a second opinion and discussing your treatment options.  Take care and let us know how it goes.\n\n",

Although during his examination I couldn't replacate the pain but he said being there is no pain/tingling in my fingers during flexon that its not the nerve but more my tricep. He believes that during extension its rubbing over the menial head. Does this make sense?   Appreciate your replies. Thanks.   -Mark\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 31 yo female with severe trauma-induced OA in my RK. In 2003 I was involved in an MVC which resulted in the knee injury. In 2004 my ortho did athroscopy to attempt to reduce pain and better evaluate the OA, he told me it was grade 3-grade 4 at that time. In 2006 he did a bone graft and a tuberosal elevation to relieve pressure on the patella. Both surgeries provided a small amount of relief for a very short period of time. Over-all though, the pain in my knee has been getting worse and worse. The pain is very sharp and \"hot\", it used to be only in the joint itself, but now it radiates up my femur to about mid-shaft. My right foot often goes numb or has \"pins and needles\" while the mid-lower leg is swollen (as is the knee joint and from about mid thigh down) and sore. My knee regularily grinds, pops, cracks and makes other such noises (kinda sounds like a bowl of rice crispies). The knee often \"locks\" or \"collapses\" without warning, this has even happened while I was carrying my 3 yo daughter. I have often fallen, stumbled and collapsed in pain. I was told that I am not a good candidate for a TKR as I am still young and they don't last long (Alberta Healthcare only covers 1 in a lifetime) and my doctor is unsure my bone would accept the TKR (don't know why). I have lost my career (former paramedic) due to this and am in constant pain. I can rarely walk more than a block or two, pain killers have not helped at all (nor has PT or bracing) and I have been slipping into a depression. I used to be very active and athletic and am now unable. I have gained weight as it is very difficult to excersise (I am being careful about my eating habits though) and I cannot keep up with my children. Are there any treatment options for me? Other than a wheelchair? I moved last year and cannot get into a new ortho for about a year more, but I don't know if I can continue to wait. I'm really sick and tired of the pain.\n\n",

    "content": "Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee is not a rare condition for old people.  It is very difficult living with pain, it decrease social life quality, and patients admitted to antiinflamatuar drugs. but knee arthroplasty is agood choise for them. Arthroplasty relieves pain, increase range of motion. but it has got some disadvantages; infection and revision. for elder patients without infection postoperatively, they do not need to much revision surgeries. because their sedentary life style do not hurt, wear prosthesis. and they live with one prothesis to end of their life.  But for young people we try to follow this algorithm; [*]Nonsteroidal aniinflamatuar medication [*]Arthroscopic debridment, rehabilitation [*]Viscosuplementation and rehabilitation [*]Osteotomies, if there is an malalignment of extremity [*]Unicondylar knee arthroplasty [*]Total knee arthroplasty  And also there have been some new techniques like moziplasty and chondral transplantation.  Degeneration size in the effected knee and its grades  are important factors.  And we choose one treatment option according to patient complaints, range of motion, x-ray, MRI or arthroscopy if necessary.  You are 31 years old. Your doctor performed an arthroscopy and said that your degeneration was grade 3-4. You suffer pain that stops you walking not more than one block as i understand.  [*]Are you using NSA\u0130 and protective drugs for your stomach? [*]Did your doctor recommend you any viscosuplementation therapy? [*]At the trauma were there any bone fractured (femur or tibia)? [*]Your grade 3-4 chondral lesion was at the medial side, lateral side or both of them? [*]Have you ever get any rehabilitation program? (muscle atrophy increase pain at the groin and thight)  If you give answers for these questions, i will be more helpful.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  It may be helpful for sake of exercise to find a pool for aerobic fitness.  The buoyancy of the pool will take weight off the knee.  Besides regular lap swimming for general fitness, you may find benefit to resistive leg exercise probably keeping the knee locked in extension during leg movement.  The symptom of pins and needles in the foot is of concern.  I would be suspicious of a lumbar vertebrae source of this symptom.    Regarding the knee itself, I agree that a viscosupplement may be of benefit.   Your family physician can help evaluate your back and if trained, do the viscosupplement injections.    Let us know how it goes.\n\n",

    "content": "My back has been checked many times and there is no concern. My surgeon feels he may have \"caught a nerve\" during my last surgery (I forgot to mention he also did a lateral release). The degeneration is \"the whole\" knee according to my ortho, he said I am equally affected both medialy and laterally. I was also told the distal head of my femur is \"in pretty rough shape\". I have not been able to get much clarification on this. To the best of my knowledge nothing was fractured in my knee at the time of initial injury, although no radiographs were done untill three months later (I was in an MVC and they were more concerned about my wrist and spine than my knee, altyhough it was my knee that caused the greatest discomfort from the beginning - it was trapped by the dash wrapped around it). Lately the pain has changed, it is no longer the dull, constant, throbby ache it was before. Now it is sharp, hot and searing. It radiates up my femur (sorry, but it really doesn't feel like muscle pain, it feels like bone pain) and the heat and swelling in my knee and thigh are getting insane. I wear a lose-leg jean so that my OA brace will fit underneath, but the sweeling has been so bad that I cannot get my brace on at all the past two weeks and the leg of my jeans is tight. The swelling is fairly localized, from about mid-thigh down to mid-shin/calf. The knee joint itself is somewhat red and the top of the joint (around the distal end of the femur) is very hot. The pain has been so bad that I break out into a cold sweat and am very nauseas. My doctor has never suggested any sort of injections. I once asked him about cortisone as I had heard it can make a big difference in OA, but he said he didn't feel I would garner any benefit from it. He said it would be better for me if I still had more cartilage left, but I hardly have any (according to our meeting) and he also told me that the constant crepitus I feel and hear in my knee is a sign that I am continuing to lose what is left. I am at the end of my rope and am begining to think I will be in a wheelchair before I'm 33 at this rate. I have had two years of weekly PT and have not been able to increase my ROM more than 3 degrees in that time. My therapist said there is nothing more he can do and sent me back to my doctor. My doctor had no further suggestions for me and now I am 6 hrs away from him with a 2 year wait to see a new one. I don't think I will be able to walk in a year, never mind two years if something isn't done soon, which is why I'm on here instead of waiting.\n\n",

    "content": "I just got out of hospital after several weeks (I was in from Jan. 24 until Feb. 26). My new surgeon said that my arthritis has progressed to Septic Arthritis (I had both a joint infection and a bone infection in the femur). I had two scopes to wash out the joint (the second due to a recurrence of the infection) and have been told to expect more infections now that they have started. I am on IV Ancef, oral Flagyl and oral Cipro until March 18 as well as oral Dilaudid (4mg) for pain and Stematil (sp?) for the nausea caused by the antibiotics. Needless to say, I'm not having much fun, lol. Over the past five years (since the MVC that caused the original injury to my knee) I have been unable to do all the things I enjoy most such as snowboarding, hiking, bike riding, rollerblading/ice skating, skiing, I can't even walk more than a block. I feel that my quality of life has greatly diminished and depression has set in. I have done alot of thinking over the past two to three years in particular and now comes my new question...how do I convince my new surgeon to amputate? Before you think I'm crazy hear me out! I can't do any of the things I used to do all the time with my three older kids (eldest is 12) and can't keep up with my youngest (3 1/2), I can't even walk her to the park to play with her as I can't walk more than a block, shopping takes hours as I have to keep sitting down, I am in constant pain, etc. With a prosthetic I would be able to regain most of my mobility (not dumb enough to think it would happen overnight) and take control of my life again. I truly believe it would be in the best interests of both me and my children. Any suggestions how I can get my ortho to see it through my eyes???\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Before you consider doing an amputation - it would be an above the knee amputation - give the antibiotics some time to heal the bone.  I would suggest waiting 6 months before making this decision.  Obviously, once an amputaion is done ...it's done.   I have seen another young man who was involved in a MVA and shattered his lower leg and been suffering for two years and now battling osteomylelitis.  I have thought too that amputation would have been a better option for him but he continues to battle.  It is a personal decision and in some cases walking with a prosthesis is better than with a chronically infected and inflamed bone and joint.   But give this some more time and certainly discuss this with the orthopedist now so he knows what you are thinking. Take care and keep in contact.\n\n",

    "content": "My orthotosist is fully supportive (he is an amputee as well - left foot) and he agrees that amputation may very well be in my best interests. My orthopedic surgeon, however, disagrees. I have now been in hospital three times since January (Jan. 24 - 2.5 wks, Feb. 19 - 2 wks, and April 19, 1.5 wks). The infection has not gone away, or even improved, even after me being on IV Ancef, Cipro and Flagyl since Jan 24. The antibiotics make me sick to my stomache, exhausted, etc and now my hair is falling out by the handful. I still cannot weightbear at all and my ortho says he doesn't think I will ever walk independantly on this leg again. They are now talking about more bracing, one that will include foot through hip to take ALL weight off my knee...why are we bothering? I was told that with this special brace I will be able to walk, but not without crutches or a walker. I am only 31 years old and am a single mum to four young children and am really feeling the need to regain mobility so that I don't miss out on any more of my children's childhoods. I am at a loss, everyone says I won't walk on this leg again without crutches and the meds the pain specialist wants me to take make getting out of bed a challenge, nevermind caring for my children. I feel like my life is spinning out of control and I am not permitted any say in my care. I don't know what to do. This last time I was in hospital they did yet another surgery and sent samples of my tibia, patella, and femur to the lab, all three bone samples grew cultures (three different bugs, all three bugs in each sample). The latest MRI and bone scan show the infection has spread further up my femur and also invaded the previously clean tibia. Any suggestions are welcome at this point. My ortho will not even consider amputation as he says an above-knee amputation makes walking REALLY difficult and he says I'm \"too young to even think about that\". I need something to change fast, as it is I have missed out on going back to school in the fall and my doctors (the whole team) have referred me to AISH (Assured Income for the Severely Handicapped), a government program that helps provide financial support (like wealfare). I really don't want the future they are steering me towards and I feel that no one is taking me seriously, they all think I am depressed and are sending me to a psychiatrist. PLEASE HELP ME, I am at the end of my rope and WILL go crazy soon if we can't figure SOMETHING out!!!!\n\n",

AKA is more difficult than BKA however but depends on how high up the amputation.  The closer to the knee the better.  If amputation is a definite option and with the infection working up proximally, it is important for your team to seriously discuss your options.    Your may consult a physiatrist who specializes in rehab medicine and include him in the discussions.   Take care.\n\n",

The whole process of going through the amputation and rehabilitation will be a team effort including nurses, doctors, therapists, friends and family. Include as many people as possible for support.  Just some general things: after surgery, make sure to maintain good knee extension and good stump shape.  This will make wearing the prosthesis and learning to walk with it a lot easier.   Do not give up on the prosthesis.  It will take quite some time and effort to get the stump in good shape for routine walking with a prosthesis but well worth the effort.  Lastly, talk to other amputees.  Take care.\n\n",

    "title": "Hemi hip arthroplasty vs. THR ?",
    "content": "My unfortunate story started on November 24, 2008 getting Christmas decorations down from storage in the garage using a 6 foot step ladder. I ended up falling from the ladder onto the concrete slab and landed on my right hip, displacing the head of the femur. I'm 61 yr. old, and have an above average activity level. Also FYI, I'm a fairly muscular guy from the waist down.   The next day (Nov. 25, 2008), a hemi-arthroplasty was performed on my hip, using a  bipolar prosthesis. Physical therapy was started mid-January '09 and ended March 1, 2009 and I felt I was on the road to a successful recovery,which I had worked very hard at. However, from March '09 on, I had relapsed progressively into discomfort in the hip and thigh. When I complained to the original surgeon, she ordered xrays of my lower spine to assess if there was any evidence of disc problems. The xrays led her to believe that an MRI of the lower back would disclose any problems. The MRI did show some disc compression, but I've always had lower back pain. The xrays and MRI were done in April '09. Soooo, we went the route of epidurals in the lower back on 2 occasions to see if the hip/thigh pain could be helped. I thought I had 2 chances for relief from the epidurals.....slim and none. As it turned out, it was none. Frankly, I had trouble \"connecting the dots\" with nerve problems in my back deciding to inflict pain in the area where I just had major hip surgery.   Then in May '09, I was transitioned to the specialist revision surgeon in the same very large Orthopedic practice in our area.  Around June '09, he ordered bloodwork to rule out infection (which was negative), a bone scan (which was negative), and a CT scan which disclosed little or no cartilage was left in the acetabulum, thus the need for a THR.  What happened to my cartilage from the November '08 hemi surgery to June '09 ??  I do have alot of confidence in this surgeon.  I know what I've gone through the first time, and my question is like most of you may me asking is \"How come I didn't receive a THR in the first place based upon my age, and muscular build of my lower torso which would indicate an above-average activity level ?. All of the research I've found on the net points to the fact that I should have had a THR, not a hemi.  My THR is scheduled for August 7, 2009, and I'd appreciate any thoughts/comments.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It would be easy enough to look at the x-ray film before the initial surgery back in 08 to get some idea of what the acetabulum looked like.  Also, intraoperatively, the surgeon would have look at the area and noted it's integrity.  So can cartilage wear away so quickly in 6 months time? You would not think so.   If this is very concerning, you could talk to the surgeon who did the hemi-arthroplasty and ask a few questions about the acetabulum's initial status (as noted above).   In the end, you have a THR and given your motivation and previous fitness level should do very well.    Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Well here's the thing.  I tore my ACL and do not have insurance.  My credit is screwed from the bills and I cannot afford the surgery.  Some times I'm in so much pain that I can't even walk.  If I put weight on it wrong, sleep on it wrong, or get up wrong it pops out of place and then I'm pretty much immobile for most of the day.  I have been getting pills like vicodin and oxycotin from my grandmother who just went through the same surgery I need.  They work great and I can fully function.  Is there any way to get surgery with no insurance in Sacramento, California or at least is there anyway I could get these meds without paying insane fees from hospitals or doctors?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, ACL injuries do not always need to be repaired.  If you can decrease the swelling and pain and give it some time (causing no further trauma which may include wearing a brace), then you can start strengthening the quads and hamstrings which will act as an active stabilizers of the knee.  Prescription medicine especially narcotics should never be shared with others.  Possession of narcotics without a prescription is against the law.  This is said with boldness as a general statement because there is a big problem with prescription narcotic abuse (including sales and sharing).    For pain relief, use NSAIDs, ice, Ace wrap to control swelling and stiffness.  If you need prescription pain meds, see your physician.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a very active 18 year old female.  I have played competive soccer for 14 years.  I have had pain in my right knee for 6 years and recently had surgery to correct it. On December 23, 2008 I had a lateral release of my lateral retinaculum and the removal of a medial plica.  I went through PT for approximately 8 weeks without a problem.  For no apparent reason, I began experiencing pain with activities I had been doing pain free for several weeks as well as significant instability in my knee.  My PTs removed me from all open chain activites and I began the PT process all over again for another 6 or so weeks with some improvement.  I became frusturated with my degression and lack of improvement and stopped going to PT.  I still have excessive amounts of pain during activities such as running, squating, weight training, etc.  I am actually experiencing more intense and much more frequent pain now than I did before my surgery.    I do not know what I should do.  My Ortho suggested more surgery, but feels that it will be too invasive.  My PT suggested more physical therapy.  Do I continue with PT, have another surgery, or get a second opinion from another doctor?  I plan on returning to play this fall, whether I am pain free or not, but I would definitely prefer pain free.    Thanks\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Post Lateral Release Pain need advice",
    "content": "Hello, The treatment plan: surgery vs therapy depends on the cause of the pain and dysfunction. If this is a patella femoral joint problem then I tend to go more conservative (vs operative) whereas if there is internal damage then arthroscopy may be best.  So, I would get an MRI of the knee to see what is going on inside the knee then determine the next step.  I have seen this type of scenario (persistent knee pain following lateral release and plica removal) drag out and it can get frustrating to everyone because despite the pain and dysfunction nothing shows up on MRI and the knee just doesn't respond to therapy.  This would be worse case scenario.  It may turn out that decreasing the activity level for some time and building strength and flexibility and proprioception is the best.  Then gradually return to activity.    Take care.\n\n",

So my question is, is there any ingredient in these supplements, which can decompose my implant?

    "content": "Last night I was playing badminton in my yard, when I jumped and landed on my knee, which was fully extended at the moment of impact.  I do not remember hearing any pop or anything.  I did collapse to the ground and screamed harder than I can ever remember. A few minutes after it happened, I could walk almost normal.  For the remainder of that day and all day today, my knee has been popping and giving out on me without warning.  It seems that whenever I put weight on it and fully extend and lock it, is when it gives out on me.  It seems very weak to me, and I am tentative walking and moving about now.  The reason it bothers me, is because I am a former baseball catcher and football lineman who has never had issues with my knees.  But I last participated in these sports about a year ago. Should I be worried about this? Or is my knee just hyper extended? Once again, I don't really have too much pain, just weakness and slight discomfort.  Please let me know what you think this could be.  Thanks, Joe\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a college baseball player who pitches. I'm a senior Right-Handed Pitcher and I've been pitching since my Junior year in High School. I've never had a ligament tear in my elbow, and I don't have a torn UCL. The problem is that I can't straighten my elbow anymore and my tricep tendons get inflamed and my bursae keeps getting inflamed. I am very interested in getting Arthroscopic surgery, because I know that my elbow needs to get cleaned up. The only things that I can think that probably need to be done (to answer why my elbow won't straighten all the way) is: (1) I have a lot of scar tissue from throwing a baseball that needs to be removed, (2) I have bone chips that need to be removed, (3) my bones have enlarged and need to be shaved down to the room for my elbow to move, (4) I have an injured bursae sac that needs to either be removed or repaired. All of these may apply, but in your opinion what is the most likely cause of the impingement in my elbow joint. Nothing structural is damaged, but something is not right. Something needs to be done, and I'm going to continue my baseball career in Professional Baseball, and this can be done over this off-season. What do you think?\n\n",

    "content": "25 years ago I suffered a Grade III ACL rupture, which was simply repaired (sutured back together). It has been fairly good up until recently, I am now having posterior pain walking downhill, pain medially and laterally at or around the kneecap (at the points where the ACL connects to the tibia/femur), pain even at rest, mild swelling and increased pain after activity, and have had a positive Lachman's test showing laxity at 30 and 15 degrees particularly. I experience spontaneous hyperextensions, but have not yet had it 'give way' forward. I am scheduled for an MRI. X-rays show nothing unusual.  There was no significant trauma that brought on this recent pain/laxity, it seems to have gradually become worse over the years, particularly over the last 6-8 months. I am very active physically (Golf, curling, running)  My question is: does the ACL when repaired such as mine was, gradually degrade/stretch/tear over time and eventually fail, or is a tear always a result of a trauma? How likely is it that the ACL is either partially or completely torn? If there is a partial tear, will that be evident on the MRI?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The ACL should hold up pretty well under normal stress and strain of daily activities including sports.   The duration of tautness may depend on the graft itself (autograft vs allograft) and the level and demand on the knee.  Most athletes however do well for years with ACL reconstruction without appreciable laxity.    Since the ACL in your case was not replaced but repaired it may tend to stretch or fail sooner than if a new graft was sutured in.  A partial tear may be evident on MRI depending on its thickness and swelling.  Clinical signs of laxity are just as helpful.    Hope this helps.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "i guess i will start with my left shoulder both injuries are from concerts (mosh pits) maybe i should stop.  back in 2007 warped tour i managed to pull or rip something in my shoulder, i couldnt lift my arm for a few hours without imense pain, for a while i couldnt lift it past about 120 degrees or so without imense pain, and from then on my shoulder has bothered me from time to time, all last year it never messed with me though. i started hapkido( a form of martial arts) and along with working out for 2 years on and off, as much as possible without injury it seemed to mess with my shoulder, and im thinking its from all the punching.  i couldnt lift my shoulder for awhile, but or have full mobility in it, i really havent sense the initial injury. after letting it rest for a week or two no working out or anything, it seems to get better and i get most mobility back without pain until i lift alot of weight or start throwing punches in martial arts class. Because of this lizfranc surgery ive just gotten done (april 27 2009) ive had to rest and cant really do martial arts or work out. I've gotten an MRI done on my shoulder and they said i might have tear in the back near the shoulder blade, my the pain is coming from my deltoid/rotary cuff. im not sure exactly where, on the side of my left shoulder.   If there is any ideas on how to fix this problem or help it id appriciate it. Also i was doing some recovery before the surgery, i havent worked out on it hard for about 6 weeks, and i was doing PT exercises to help strengthen it (bungie thing)  the lizfranc initial injury happened on augest 13 2008, i was in a moshpit bare foot when some heavy guys landed on my foot, i thought for sure it was broken, my brother carried me out, i made it too the hospital after 2 hours or so. they did x rays, said i had sprained my ankle/foot and needed to stay off of it for awhile, they wrapped it, put a boot thing on it and sent me home. after a month of alot of pain still in my foot, i had went to the docter, my arch wasent right, and i had a lump on the inside of my foot were the lizfranc joint is. He xrayed it again and they found nothing.  after another 2 weeks i was able to walk on it, and at the end of october i started martial arts, still having a bad limp from pain in begginning. towards november i was able to walk full speed again, and ive always been a slow walker.  in november i got an mri on my foot because i was still having pain and i couldnt really run or jump on it.  and the mri never got back to us until march when i got mri on my shoulder.  in january i was able to lift weight run jump everything on my foot, just pe killed me, jump ropes running and jumping jacks really hurt my foot, at that time i knew something was wrong. mid march my shoulder was hurting so bad from weights/pe class/ martial arts, i went in for an mri, and thats when they decided to send the results from the foot. and of course i had an abnormality in the lizfranc region (don't know medical name off the top of my head) so i went to an ortho asap and got weight bearing x-rays, the whole nine yards. he told me i needed surgery asap. i refused to miss prom april 4, and after that only able time was the 27th of april.  the nerve block i don't think worked, and it hurt like hell, i thought i was going to rip the railing off the bed. to fix it they had to put a screw or to in my foot, im not sure how many, where the cut is, etc., i will find out tuesday when i get this wrap taken off and get a check up on it.  i believe its on the top of my foot, thats what it  feels like,  i was wondering if my toes should be bruised colored? they are warm so im guessing the wrap isent too tight, and i can move them with a good ammount of pain, so i don't think its ok to do that, i can put my foot down without pain, just to balance. weight hurts on it.  how long will i be out? is there a could chance of full recovery after waiting so long before surgery? im 17 and the surgeon said i had youth and health on my side,  will i be ok to walk before augest?  i think the stitching hurts now, not the screws. should it hurt this long?    how much longer can i expect to be out, my toes on the inside feel raw,\n\n",

Your orthopedist will assess the healing and over time allow more weight.  Do not put more weight on the foot than the surgeon allows as this would delay healing.

If meniscus damage coincides with ACL tear (in this case a reinjury), surgery option is more likely.

    "content": "I have since been to my orthopedic dr... he didn't hardly examine it at all. He touched the front of it and had me lay on my back and he moved it around a little and that was it. I was really disappointed in the lack of thoroughness. He recommended that I go to physical therapy for a month and then recheck it. My physical therapist has been great. He believes that I dislocated my shoulder and when it came out of socket it popped up and hit my collar bone and separated my shoulder. I for sure dislocated and separated it. I have torn cartilage. And I have severe scapular winging. One of the worst my pt has seen. It's been 6 weeks since the injury and I've been going to therapy for 2 weeks but the winging isn't getting any better at all. He believes it might be due to nerve damage. I also still can't hardly lift my shoulder without getting sharp severe pain in the front of my shoulder. It also slips out when I'm doing my passive excercises. I'm getting really discouraged with it and just want it to be fixed already. I wish somebody could give me some insight on what to expect with this type of injury.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It sounds from the MRI and the mechanism that you tore the superior labrum (aka SLAP lesion).  Sometimes the biceps tendon is torn with this injury which may account for the anterior shoulder pain.  The best clinical test for a SLAP lesion is the resisted supination and external rotation test.    Arthroscopic surgery can repair this lesion.  The serratus anterior which holds the scapula is place is innervated by the long thoracic nerve which may have been damaged by the trauma.  It may take up to 6 months for the nerve and muscle to be restored to normal function.  Hope this information helps you make the best decision regarding your shoulder.   Take care.\n\n",

It really makes me sore when I do PT. Which I do three times a week. Dr told me to apply for disability because  he thought I would not be able to do any long term physical work. He said this surgery is last resort. Said normally this surgery is done on people sixty-five years or older. Just wonder if I will ever be close to normal again?

    "title": "Re: Shoulder Replacement Surgery",
    "content": "Hello, Yes, shoulder replacement surgery is a last resort and normally is done on older folks.  I understand the \"reversal\" as the hardware was removed.    One of the problems may be that the joint is degenerated so much that the subcondral (below the cartilage) bone is exposed and causing great pain.    Lacking a rotator cuff muscular attachment will affect how you lift your arm and will reduce your lifting and overall physical use capacity.  If PT is causing more pain, it may be time to back down on the intensity.  Pain can be difficult to manage therefore adding pain management consultation is wise.    Operative treatment is limited to another shoulder replacement or fusion.  The goal would be to decrease the pain but you will sacrifice motion and function with these fixes.   Take care and let us know how it goes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, In general, operative repair for fractures should be done earlier than later.  Waiting can cost days and weeks of pain and makes repair more difficult especially if the fracture site heals in an abnormally angulated position that causes pain and dysfunction.  To repair, the bone needs to be \"broken\" and reset.   With that being said, it may not be too late for surgery.  Xray will be needed to judge the extent of damage and risks and benefits of surgery.  Take care and let us know how it goes.\n\n",

    "title": "Rotator Cuff Tear",
    "content": "Last July, after a period extensive heavy lifting of 50 lb concrete blocks, i noticed a sharp pain in my right dominant shoulder when i moved it in certain ways, and a loss of strength.  I had just accepted a teaching position at a Christian school in Nigeria, so I went ahead with the move without seeing a doctor, primarily as a result of the job not offering health insurance and my insurance lapsing the month before.  Note: i had never once filed a health insurance claim in my adult life, so I took a chance of not having it [dumb].  During the following months, the shoulder improved in strength and agility, but never completely recovering [I could do pull-ups but not chin ups, for example].  However in December, I reinjured the shoulder in a quick moment of reaching out to catch my balance.  Since that event I have lost a range of motion, barely able to touch the top of my head, unable to shift my car into reverse [out and down], can lift outwards/upwards from a relaxed position [abduction] about 45 degrees and no higher.  If there is a sudden movement or jarring of the shoulder, as in a sympathetic response to pain, it severly hurts for about 30 seconds.  If I sleep with any pressure on it, it wakes me up.    In the middle of June I will return to the U.S. [for approximately one month, but could be extended] with some money in the bank but no health insurance.  I am ready to bargain, sign a no-lawsuit clause, get price quotes, whatever it takes, but i do not want government assistance and i cannot afford a huge bill.  I may have to go to Mumbai [where doctors advertise online] if I can't get a bill price within my range, which i don't want to do.   What can you tell me or recommend?  Thank you for your time and God bless you and what you do.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Rotator Cuff Tear",
    "content": "Hello, Thanks for writing in.  From your description, there are a few areas in the shoulder which may be causing the pain, loss of motion and strength. The first area is the rotator cuff (RC). The second is the acromioclavicular joint.  The third s the shoulder joint itself i.e. labral tear. The rotator cuff muscle can be assessed clinically with certain movements and strength testing.    Often MRI is the test of choice for suspected RC tears.  We sometimes wait until we are considering surgery before doing MRI. Full thickness RC tears require surgery.  Partial tear can be treated conservatively initially and then operative care if no change or worsening.  The main motion to avoid with RC injury is reaching outward and back (as if to put your hand in the coatsleeve).  This places lots of stress on the shoulder. Range of Motion should be restored as soon as possible to prevent frozen shoulder.  Straight plane motions are the best and start with flexion in supine - may use a cane or stick with hands overtop and raise arms overhead with the goal being full flexion overhead without pain.  Once this is achieved, ditch the cane and use a light handweight and progress gradually.  If painfree for one week then start external rotation strengthening with an elastic band or pulley system.  Elbow is bent 90 degrees and held near the thorax.  Grab a band or pulley robe and move the hand outward rotating the shoulder while maintaining the elbow position.  This is a basic rotator cuff strengthening exercise.   Ice after every exercise session. Moist heat before every exercise session. NSAIDS as needed.  Lastly, sometimes subacromial bursitis may cause this.  The same basic rehab principles apply however a corticosteroid injection may be helpful. Without insurance, avoiding the cost of surgery is important so focussed attention to rehab is vital. If at anytime the shoulder worsens from exercise, stop.  Restart in a few days after the pain subsides.  Any questions should be fielded by a physician or physical therapist.  Take care and may the Lord's grace be with you.\n\n",

Keep looking for a Dr.  You have the right to not be in pain and when you need a knee you need one regardless of age or size. Try your primary doctor first he/she may be able to recommend someone willing to work with someone of your age. Then try large cities near you, you will find a qualified Surgeon/Dr. to assist you in your quest for a better knee.\n\n",

I am curious about the need to replace the entire knee when the problem is the patella femoral joint.   There are cartilage replacement fluids that can be injected into the knee.   I would try conservative approaches before doing a radical knee replacement.  20 y.o. is too young for a total knee replacement. There is patella taping and bracing techniques to keep the patella aligned. You would need a trained physical therapist to help with this.  Also, aquatic therapy may be the best medium for exercise for you.  All the best to you.  Let us know how it goes.\n\n",

    "content": "At the time of my TKA in December 2006, I was 54 years old woman and otherwise in excellent health.  OS recommended TKA after review of x-ray showing bone on bone condition in my right knee (I did not have and had not experienced pain with this problem, but an inability to transfer weight, esp. when climbing/descending stairs).     The TKA resulted in several problems.  The immediate problem was ROM on the operated knee -- a -15 measurement of right knee extension. Due to risk factors, I  declined the MUA.  I used the recommended Dyna-splint for approx. 6 weeks, but there was no improvement with the extension deficiency.  At this time, I also had severe and persistent swelling on the operated knee, which persists now, two years post TKA.  The prescribed NSAID did not alleviate this problem, even after two months of use.  The extension deficiency leaves me with a limp.     In August, 2008, I suffered a \"give way\" when suddenly I collapsed when the knee buckled after I started to walk after being seated for about 20 minutes.  Now, the  buclkling happens frequently, and when I arise after sitting I must stop and permit the  prosthesis to fully engage before I can initiate ambulation.  I must use a cane for stability to walk properly.  My OS does not believe there is instablity in the prosthesis and has recommeded correction via surgery through the posterior capsule with consequent high risk of nerve damage.     How can the -15 degrees of extension be corrected? Does this extension problem cause the buckling?  If not,  what is the cause and how is it corrected?  Any other pertinent medical advice would be appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, This is a tough case because the most important rehabilitative element post op knee replacement is achieving full extension. It is number one priority.   Without meeting this goal, you run into problems with pain, stiffness, poor gait patterns, weakness. The giving way of the knee may be from weak quadricep muscles.  Two years post op is too long to expect full extension unless the knee is surgically manipulated back into extension. As far as the integrity of the knee and the prosthesis, I do not know.   A thorough exam and xrays should help the orthopedist determine treatment options and discuss them with you.  All the best to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The plucking or cracking sounds of the knee with deep squats without pain is not too concerning.   Joint popping and crackling without pain is often normal. However, the kneecap should be assessed for mal-aligned.  Grinding of the patella femoral joint following surgical knee repair may lead to degeneration of the cartilage or tendonitis.  Also, have the integrity of the knee evaluated by a physician just to make sure the knee is not getting \"sloppy\" from laxity of ligaments.  Thanks for writing in and take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Pain on the inside of the shin bone about mid way down sounds like inflammation of the posterior tibialis muscle attachment to the tibia.  This sometimes is known as shin splints.   Sometime people with extraordinarily high or low arches develop this problem.  Also, it is important to check the leg lengths both total leg length and below the knee.  With joint replacement leg length is important to check.  Unequal leg length can lead to leg pain. Treatment involves correcting the underlying problem and treating the inflammation with ice, NSAIDS, and wrapping (ACE or Coban). Take care and let us know how it goes.\n\n",

It only went a way when my legs were up and then it was mainly the anterior muscle of my lower leg that got tight.  At first they thought it was compartment syndrome, but after that test was negative (amnd my leg was in pain) - he noticed that my proximal tibia fibula joint (side of knee) was lax.  I was diagnosed with Proximal Tibia-Fibula Joint Laxity (basically they shot kenalog into that joint to see if it would help my anterior leg muscle and it went away).  Now it is returning...After 9 mos it slowly came back on and off but not that bad.  For the past few days, it is back when I am standing (the worse) or walking).  I don't understand how having a lax joint (that doesn't hurt) makes that muscle ahrd and tight? Also, he said the surgery might help it (fuse it together) and he wants to also release the fascia of that muscle to ensure it will get better.  ANy thoughts??  I am in need of any answers.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Hp1023,  Joint laxity can cause pain in the muscles because the muscles have to work harder to keep the joint stable.  This causes the muscles to hurt basically due to over use.  You may want to consider seeing a sports medicine specialist for further evaluation and recommendations about treatment options.  An orthopedic surgeon is another option (which I suspect that you have already seen based on the surgery recommendation) but you may get other nonsurgical treatment options from a sports medicine specialist.  I am not familiar enough with this type of condition to know if surgery is or is not indicated.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks.  I went back because the tibia fibula muscle is starting to get bigger and tense up alot.  It is on and off.  The ortho said I can get another kenalog/lidocaine shot since it has been over a year.  He said if I get a shot once a year ot more than it shouldn't damage the joint but once it stops working I need to consider surgery - only right now no onein my network does it.  He can refer to a surgeon I spoke with beofre he left and see if it helps.  HE said they an fuse together the joint and also the surgeon wants to release the fascia in the tibia fibula muscle - he feels that it would benefit me to do both at the same time.  Bu there are no guarantees that it would fix my problem.  He said the injury is rare in the fac that it doesn't respond to what 99% of the people do  (wear the strap under that joint). The specialist he would refer me to has done the most and that is only 6 total I believe...so you can see why I prefer to do the shot once more.  Will doing the shot every year hurt the joint?  It makes me nervous to have a surgery that is so rare with no real guarantee (he told me he has never seen a patient with my injury have my symptoms)...\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I think there is still a question about the exact cause of your symptoms.  The patella dislocation is a separate problem from the chondral defect (unless we are talking chondral defect of the patella but... probably it was a defect on the surface of the distal femur).  In any case, an MRI may help clarify what is going on in the knee prior to having surgery.  I would be curious about the chondral defect repair in addition to the patella problem.  Since the injections were to treat cartilage problems, I would be thinking more knee cartilage arthroscopic repair rather than tibial plateau osteotomy.  You will need to get some clarification from the ortho doc about the nature of the pain and subsequent repair.  Treating the patella problem or the chondral defect? Keep us posted.\n\n",

    "content": "Long story short, I was in a car accident and the knee slammed the dashboard.  It caused a bit of cartilage damage so they did arthroscopy on me with chondroplasty in the femoral groove if I remember properly.  There was a small \"flap\" of cartilage that was standing up and rubbing the back of my patella, and in essence was what caused all of the irritation and pain.  I'm one month post-op and in therapy strengthening my leg and regaining my flexibility and ROM.  I am planning on joining the military after I graduate this may (or after my leg is properly rehabbed, whichever comes first I suppose).  I asked the doctor if running would be an issue for me and he said I shouldn't have any problem with it considering my damage was either a grade 1 or grade 2, and not severe at all.  Sometimes I worry they aren't giving me straight answers though, and would just like to get some reassurance.  I do understand that I have less cartilage now than I used to because they shaved off a little bit of the rough edges.  Can I expect to return to running like I was able to before the knee surgery?  Officer school for the marines involves atleast 15 miles of running, per week!  And of course there is the necessity to stay in shape after your basic training etc. due to physical requirements.  Is this realistically something I can do as a career and not have to worry about causing my self big knee problems? I understand that no one here will be able to see exactly the symptoms and pictures of my knee, but just going off of the grade 1-grade 2 information, I was hoping I could get a few opinions.  Also, what would the \"standard\" time period after my surgery be for beginning running again.  Thanks in advance!\n\n",

I experienced no pain, but the swelling and tightness is still a little noticable.  I'm only 1.25 months post-op so I think I'm healing pretty well, so far.  I also managed to comfortably push out a few 15 rep sets of 200lbs on leg presses as well as a few comfortable 15 rep sets of 110lbs one leg presses on just my injured leg.  I don't know if that seems to be overkill this fresh after surgery, but I've always had strong legs as a basketball player.  I think the remaining swelling is due to my lack of icing it as I should.  My strength feels great, and today for the first time my range of motion during stretching was actually able to match that of my good leg.  I just want my muscle mass back!!! My quad/hammy and calf are still looking a touch smaller!\n\n",

The mechanism of injury would likely not cause a fracture.  The proturbance of the knee cap during knee extension could have been from swelling or mal aligned patella.   Knee extension exercises with an acute patella injury are always contraindicated.   Let us know how it turns out.\n\n",

    "title": "Thumbs became dislocated gradually on their own",
    "content": "My mom thumbs became dislocated gradually on their own last year. We thought they were just callus at first on her joints, but after they didn\u2019t go away for a month, we visited a hand surgeon who took x-rays and determined that they were dislocated completely from the joints. My mom has had lupus since 1995 and has been treated for it for about 10 years. Since 2005 she felt fine and healthy, displayed none of her prior symptoms. This was the first thing in nearly 4 years to indicate that her lupus is still present. After learning about my mom\u2019s history of having lupus, he sent us to a rheumatologist to check it out before he performs any surgery. The rheumatologist concluded that the lupus most likely caused the dislocation and obviously no medication can put them back into place. He could treat my mom from a medical standpoint but not surgically, he said it was ok for my mom to get the surgery but there\u2019s no telling if the same thing might happen again.   My mom works at home and needs the use of her thumbs, the state they are in now interferes with her daily tasks and there is pain associated at the dislocated joints. She would like to get the surgery done, but before we do anything, we wanted some input on this condition. We would like to know what\u2019s involved in having this type hand surgery done, the risks and complications. What will be the typical procedure? Will this surgery be a minor surgery with a quick recovery, or something major? Is it better to have it performed in a hand surgeon\u2019s clinic, or at the hospital? The hand surgeon we initially visited does not accept my mom\u2019s medical insurance, and before we move on to other hand surgeons, we would like to know what options will lay ahead of us, and how to plan this out. Or is it just better to leave the thumbs how they are, and learn to live with them like that? Thank you for any help and advice at all, it will be greatly appreciated.

    "title": "Re: Thumbs became dislocated gradually on their own",
    "content": "Hello, Thanks for writing in.  You have described your mom's history of dislocated thumbs (DIP joint) secondary to lupus.  And want information on surgical options.  Lupus can cause inflammed tendons and joint hypermobility in the thumb which lead to deformity.  In your mom's case, lupus caused a dislocation.  Since the lupus causes a hypermobile joint, even if the thumb joint is reduced, it will be prone to dislocate again.  So one of the pros for sugery will be to lower risk of dislocation.  Splinting may be needed post op to protect the joint.  Goal of surgery will be to reduce the dislocation and prevent further dislocation.  For specific procedures, I will defer to the hand surgeon to explain treatment options.  In general, risks of surgery will include infection, pain, recurrent thumb dislocation, and poor tolerance to anesthesia.  Whether the surgeon replaces the joint, fuses it, or snugs up the joint capsule, he may be able to perform the procedure with local or regional anesthesia and light sedation.    Rehabilitating the thumb through occupational therapy post op will be important and she may need to wear a brace on a daily basis.    So, I think it would be a good idea to seek a hand surgeon's opinion because without surgery, the thumb will probably dislocate again.  Take care and keep us posted.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Thank you for writing in.  You have reported your son broke his patella on Jan 22nd.  The leg is purple and cold.  What does this mean?  A cold limb following a fracture is concerning because we want to make sure there is good blood flow to the limb.  Swelling can compromise blood vessel flow so it is important to see a physician who can check pulses, and examine the leg.    A fractured patella itself should not cut off circulation so along with checking for good pulses, it will be prudent to xray other parts of the leg for damage - femur, tibia/fibula, etc.   The purple color may be from bruising which is an expected finding from trauma to superficial blood vessels.  The purple may be due to pooling blood due to decreased mobility and poor circulation.    In essence, see a physician to re evaluate the leg.  Take care and keep us posted.\n\n",

The only thing that sticks out in my mind as a possible clue is that the severe pain comes only after I have been in one position for an extended period of time.  Then when I start moving around, the pain is released.  I also have pain in my muscles between these areas which could be a separate issue.  I will sometimes get a throbbing pulsating sensation in my toe joints.    The pain will wake me up at night so I have to move to relieve the pain but it is unbearable and returns after a few minutes in one position. The other clue is that in the morning when I first get out of bed, I can barely walk.  I look like an 80 year old, then after a few minutes I am fine.  Also the level of pain is getting increasingly worse and I am worried I might end up in a wheelchair.  I am told that it is just arthritis and fibromyalgia but these symptoms are strange and the pain is worse than anyone I know with arthritis.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Thank you for writing in to Doctors Lounge.  You have reported hip, knee and ankle/foot pain which is worse in the morning and after stationary positions.  Activity improves the pain. Also, the muscles between the joints hurt. You are taking morphine for pain and have been diagnosed with arthritis.  You are wondering if the pain can be from something else.  History also includes osteopenia.  From what you have described, it sure sounds like arthritis.  Different types of arthritis include osteoarthritis (OA), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis, gout, arthritis assoc with inflammatory bowel disease, infectious arthritis (usually only one joint).   OA affects the knees, hips, back and hands whereas RA affects smaller joints of the hands and feet.  Because the treatment for RA and OA are different, it would be important to screen for RA.  Labs would includes CBC, rheumatoid factor, anti-CCP, sed rate, CRP and xray of painfull joints (feet).   Xray's of the hips and knees would also help define osteoarthritis.  A referral to the rheumatologist may help as he may differentiate the type of arthritis and consider other treatment options (disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs aka DMARDS ...for RA; NSAIDS or acetaminophen; exercise).  Keep us posted and take care.\n\n",

    "title": "Partial Knee Replacement, failed, had TKR, many problems",
    "content": "I am a 50 year old female that has had a partial knee replacement in March 2007, and then a TKR in November 2007.  The partial failed as a result of the glue coming loose, bone wearing away and micro fractures of the tibia.  There is speculation that it all happened within the first month.  The pain was pretty bad throughout the whole ordeal, but I was told that was part of the healing process.  In August 2007, my doc said all looked good and he would see me in six months.  In Oct. 2007, pain at night would wake me up from sleeping.  Called doc, he ordered a bone scan, and it showed the damage.  Scheduled total knee replacement for Nov, 2007.  I reminded doc about allergies to metal.  (I always have reactions to 'cheap' jewelry and cannot wear SS or gold overnight)  Doc chose the knee made from oxinium, which is supposed to be for folks who have metal allergies.  Surgery went ok...took forever to do spinal.  I had no feeling in my leg from my knee sown for 3 days.  Thought to be from spinal.  Had to have blood tansfusion.  There was alot of bleeding.  Doc had me on some major antibioctics.  He said that there appeared to be an 'icky' spot and he wanted to be sure that no infection would grow.  Nothing grew in the lab, either.  So, I go home.  Jane. 2008 had to have manipulation.  Doc put me out, did manipulation, tore quad muscle.Ithought my leg was broken.  It took four weeks for that to feel somewhat better which in turn put me behind on PT.  Feb. 14, 2008, had another manipulation under anesthesia.  I had a brace type thing that was made that you can adjust to bring your leg back to create more range of motion.  Did that for 8 weeks.  In the meantime, a rash would appear on my knee.  And no where else.  It would start as a few bumps, and itch like the dickens.  The more that I scratched it, the worse it would get.  Only on my knee.  It would not spread anywhere else.    I still get the rash.  About May 2008, my calf would get really swollen, to the point it would look like it was going to explode.  Checked for blood clots.  Nothing.  At the end of May, doc sent me for MRI of lower leg.  MRI showed \"mild central marrow edema\" (which, by the way, my doc never mentioned this to me...is it something that I should be concerned about?)  Part of the report reads, \"Mild central marrow signal changes of the tibia, which is thought to be postsurgical or related to the marrow conversion.\"  What does that mean?  (My doc never shared this info at the time of the MRI.  It was mailed to me last week.)  So, life goes on.  I have seen this same doc eleven times in the past twelve months.  He keeps me supplied with vicodin.  In Nov. 2008, doc sent me for blood work.  (he did this earlier in the year, also)  The results from Nov. were also sent to me last week.  My next question would be...How abnormal do blood test results have to be to be brought to someones attention?  There are two things pertaining to the red blood cells that are flagged as high, not within the normal range.  And there were two things pertaining to white cells that came back low, again not within the stated noraml range.  But all of the tests pertaining to the white count were on the low normal side.   The doc also told me that the tendon connecting the knee cap to the shin bone is shortening and that he could not do another manipulation.  My range of motion is maybe  60 degrees.  I cannot do steps normally, can't kneel, can't get down on the floor.  Doc also said that there is no fluid around the knee cap.  My knee cap doesn't move.  I have made an appointment with another doc at a very well known hospital.  I don't know what to do...Please, any insight to this whole process is welcomed and thoughts are graciously accepted.    CG\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Partial Knee Replacement, failed, had TKR, many problems",
    "content": "Hello, I am sorry to hear that you have had so much trouble with this knee.    Regarding the marrow edema and conversion, the marrow edema can be caused by either inflammation or infection.  The conversion: with trauma, the characteristics of the marrow may change from fatty marrow to hematopoietic marrow which basically means that the marrow is not resting anymore, it is producing cells to heal the traumatized part.   So the question is whether the knee or leg bones are infected.  Your orthopedist can order other nuclear medicine test which can tag WBC and see if the marrow takes it up - an indication of infection.    Without seeing the CBC numbers, it is hard to tell the meaning.  Another question is: Are you allergic to the metal in the knee?  Since your other metal allergies appear on your skin, you may test a sample of the knee replacement material and \"wear it\" on the skin for several days to see if there's a reaction. You would need to contact the manufacturer for a sample of course.   Hope this helps some.  Keep us posted and take care.\n\n",

    "title": "Failed Medial Plica Knee Surgery",
    "content": "I am a competitive cyclist and have been involved in the sport for years.  I train 15-20 hours per week.  I havel also stretched and lifted weights regularly for 12 years, and have never been injured.  In Feb of 2008, after taking several months off completely, I ramped my training back up.  After 2 months symptom-free, I quickly developed medial knee pain in my left knee.  I should note that the only thing that was different this year was that I moved my saddle forward to experiment shortly before the pain began, but then moved it back after.  I also learned to snowboard in January and spent about 3 hours falling on my knees (no obvious injury, just a bit sore).  This may have initiated the inflammation.   After months of RICE, PT, chiro, NSAIDs, and several orthos, I was diagnosed with a plica.  Arthroscopic surgery confirmed and removed the plica, which was rubbing a groove in the femoral condyle.  All other aspects of the knee were pristine I am told.  Within 2 months I was getting back into training with no pain, when the pain developed in my right knee this time.  Same diagnoses was made, and confirmed by arthroscopy.   It has been about 5 months post surgery (left knee) and 2 months post surgery (right  knee).  I was just getting back into full training when the pain again developed in the left knee.  This time I can very easily feel a band where the plica was removed snap over the FC when I squat or cycle.  The surgeon informed me that she removed the fold down to the base of the synovial lining (common practice and she is a very well-known surgeon with 35 years experience in the knee).   My theory is that the base itself was not excised.  Basically, the tree was cut down, but the stump was left.  I have read literature that suggests that removal of the retinacular band at the base of the fold greatly improves the success rate.  This makes sense to me, but it seems that all of the orthos I have spoken with do not really want to talk about that.   I would greatly appreciate any advice you have to give regarding this.  I am almost at the end of my rope.    Thank you. Andrew\n\n",

    "content": "Andrew, Thanks for the post. Is there any catching or locking of the knee?   It seems as if the base of the plica were not removed and now inflamed, it may catch or pinch in the knee.    If the tenderness is rather superficial and not intraarticular, you may get along with conservative treatment and making sure the quads have balanced strength and hamstrings are properly lengthening thus decreasing anterior knee forces.   Some runners with chronic tendonitis use a mix of salicylate and menthol ointment topped with a heating pad for 20 minutes 1-2 x a day for a week.     Let us know how it goes.\n\n",

    "content": "Sorry it took so long to reply, I did not receive a notice that anyone had replied.  No, there is no locking of the knee per se (no loose bodies or internal locking).  The catching is 100% superficial to the joint.  It is plainly obvious what it is, as the band is clearly palpable and I can feel it snap over the medial femoral condyle with my finger at flexion.  Also, the pain is localized to the band and only appears when I flex enough for the snapping to occur.  Weird thing is, I do not remember it being this obvious before the surgery although the pain was worse (this could be because the fold was removed but not the base).  At any rate, no amount of PT, RICE, etc will work...I have tried it all.  Further, my muscles are very strong and balanced as I have consistently done gym work for over 10 years along with riding.  For legs, I do 8-10 sets of squats with varying stances, 7 sets of hamstring curls, several sets of calf raises, and a few hip flexor and groin exercises.  I do this twice a week with good form and not alot of weight (max is maybe 180 lbs for squats).  I also stretch almost daily and am very flexible. So it's not a condromalacia, meniscus, tendon, etc issue.  I have also seen the pictures of the surgery and my cartiledge looks great. You say it sounds like the base was not removed.  I agree with this, but why would the base not be removed?  The way she described it, she \"bit\" out the fold down as close as possible to the base as she felt comfortable with.  I have read that you want to avoid going so far that you insult the synovial lining, but how else would you remove the underlying base/band? I have an appointment with Dr. Martin Boublik at the Steadman-Hawkins clinic in Denver next week, but I want to get as much info as possible before my appointment.  Also, I would like to know opinions of the clinic, if there are any out there.  Thanks alot.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, To treat acute inflammation in a tendon, use ice packs or ice massage and NSAIDS...and perhaps some compression (ACE wrap, neoprene sleeve).  Ice is done after the exercise.   Remember the basics of warming the tissue and stretching before exercise and stretching after exercise.    An effective linament is a 50%/50% mix of salicylate cream and menthol ointment or cream (both can be found over the counter at the pharmacy).  Rub this into the tendon and apply a heating pad for 20 minutes 1-2 x a day.    All the best to you.\n\n",

    "content": "I tore my ACL for the second time last week while playing in a soccer game, which was confirmed per an MRI also acquired last week. At this point I do not have a surgery scheduled because my soccer coach (college) is trying to convince me to play in the playoffs with a brace, and hold off on surgery until after the season is over being that this is my last college season. Is this insanity? What are the risks associated with trying to play with a torn ACL? I watched the quaterback of the University of Oregon play in a playoff game with a torn ACL and a brace...he didn't last long until he tore it completely and was OUT. I am not asking someone to make a decision for me, I just would appreciate some frank no BS advice. Thank you for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Playing contact sports without ACl have great risk for meniscal tears.  alot of published study showed that playing with ACL more three months have great risk especially medial meniscus.   Because ACL prevents anterior translation and gives rotational stability of the knee and if you continue to play with ACL deficient knee, meniscal komponents will take place for transational stability. After little time later tears will be shown especially at the posterior horn of the medial meniscus.  Lateral meniscal tears are more than the medial for acute ACL rupture, but medial meniscal tears are more than lateral for chronic ACL rupture. Chronic rupture means more than 3 months after injury.  I recommend you that if you want to play more than one season go to your doctor. If you want to finish this season without surgery, only play realy important games not all.  Save your knee, you need it more.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 54 year old male. I had a total left knee replacement on July 12 of this year. Immediately after surgery I had sever pain and pins and needles and numbness along the outside of my left knee. This ran from my knee to my buttocks. I told my doctor about it right away. While in the hospital I was unable to do a straight leg raise because was so sever it that area. The pain was also severe when I was put on the flex machine. The outside of my leg snapped when when I walked or bent it. I also had severe pain when I would lay on either side, but the pain was more intense when I would lay on my right side. The pain was concentrated on the outside of the knee and ran along the outside of my thigh.  I started P/T in August. The best flex I was able to obtain was 105 degrees. Last week my flex was 95 degrees. I would writhe on the mat in pain when my therapist would attempt to flex my leg. After 45 visits I still had the same problems. The numbness and pins and needles decreased from above mid thigh to my buttocks. It is always more intense at bedtime.  I had a nerve test done and it was alright. I also had an MRI done on my left thigh and lower back. In February I had an L5 herniated disk, but after P/T it felt much better. My doctor though that the muscle and nerve problem could be associated with the disk problem. The MRI stilled a slight herniatrd disk. I was unable to more than 25 straight leg raises without any weight only a handful of times. The pain along the outside of my leg was always to intense.  Two weeks ago I told my doctor that I had not gotten any better and the P/T was not helping me at all. He suggested I see one of his partners. I had written everything down that was wrong with me and gave it to him the next day. He said that I had a lot of scar tissue and that I needed a laterial release to take care of the problem on the outside of my leg.   I was scoped this past Monday. In the recovery room he told me that he had flexed my knee to 155 degrees during surgery. I was told to start P/T and do my exercises at home. The first of P/T my knee was flexed to 98 degrees.The pain, numbness and pins needles are still in my thigh. The pain on the outside of my knee is still intense when I lay on my right side. My knee still snaps.     I was reading an article about  compartment syndrome and tourniquet palsy. It sounded similar to some of my symptoms. I am at wits end and very depressed. I am tired of takin pain medication all of the time and would just like to find out what is goin on.  I have also dicided to go to another practice for a new evaluation.  thanks\n\n",

ER doc said it was grade 3, all ligments torn, gave him a sling and sent him home saying to his knowledge, nothing can be done. Besides the obvious pain, my husband is really concerned about the golf-ball size lump and what permanent limitations he will have. He's always been active, skiing, rock climbing, scuba diving, weight lifting, also has been a contractor for years lifting heavy object above his head, hammering, etc. His two biggest concerns about the bone sticking up is, well cosmetic, and also being able to wear his scuba gear (the straps cross right over that spot, and it's really heavy)   Can anything be done about this? Are there special braces that can be worn to help push the bone down while healing? Is there surgery? I've found a few references on the internet stating that surgery doesn't help, and doesn't get rid of the bump, but also some that say there are surgeries to wire the bones back together.   Our biggest road bump is that we don't have insurance for another 2-3wks. Should we try and see an ortho doctor now out of pocket, or is this an injury that can wait until we have insurance?\n\n",

The management of type III AC dislocation is still controversial, although the majority of current reports support nonoperative treatment. Looking at the age of your husband and the type of lifestyle he is involved in a surgical repair will be more suitable for him. As far as the timing of the surgery is concerned, there are various factors involved and a consultation with an orthopedic surgeon will help in answering that for you. So consult an orthopedic surgeon as soon as possible and hopefully all will be well.  Thanks to Dr. Shyam for taking this question and to kek19, I hope this is helpful to your husband and to you. Please keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I am having trouble with the medical establishment in dealing with my lax joints.  I currently have a wrist, ankle, hip and two shoulders that are loose enough to cause dysfunction, specific symptoms vary.  The problem is that I can never get a doctor to look at the whole problem.  I am seeing a PT for the hip and ankle, but she only will look at one at a time, and a different pt for the wrist because it put me out of work (massage therapist).  They keep telling me that there is nothing i can do about it, that its normal, that strengthening the muscles is all I can do.  However, I had knee surgery, orthoscopic and it helped that knee.  Also, in every range of motion I am stronger than 90% of women in any age group, and my range of motion draws surprised gasps from every doctor I see.  Since I have been getting PT, the problems are getting worse because there is no way to strenthen muscles perfectly evenly, and muscles do, after all, move.   I am an athlete and I cannot perform when I cant even walk!  Is there anything at all I can do?  I have talked to other people with BHJS who have had success with ankle and shoulder surgery, and near-miraculous recovery with prolotherapy, but my doctors (Ive seen over 20 about this in the last several years) all say it doesnt really exist unless a patient has morfans syndrom or Ehlers.   What can I do?  What are my options?  Im very frustrated and in a lot of pain, and want to fix the cause of it rather than kill my brain with drugs.  Thanks!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: surgery for hypermobile joints? multiple dislocations/dysfun",
    "content": "With hypermobility of peripheral joints, I think the issue of strength is interesting.  Excellent strength through the entire range of motion is one thing while stabilizing strength of the joint is another.  What I mean by this is that when a limb moves in a single plane (eg extending the knee), one set of muscles (the knee extensors) work.  Fine.  However, there are more than one set of muscles which act upon the knee.  We have adductors, abductors, flexors and extensors.  These muscles certainly move the limb but are also important in stabilizing the joint.  This dual muscle function of mobility and stability is important throughout the body - in the knee, shoulder, fingers, spine, etc.  Stability is important when a load is applied to a joint.  eg. in the ankle, knee, and hip during standing, walking, and running.  It provides leverage for the body to move; in other words without stability movement is difficult.  When a joint is unstable (in this case hypermobility), the joint is susceptible to abnormal wear; this is caused by shearing forces on the joint - leading to arthritis, cartiledge damage, or ligament damage.  Also the synovium is at risk of inflamation.   These conditions in turn cause problems with mobility and strength.   So I think it is important to understand the principles of joint mobility and stability in order to find a solution for joint hypermobility.  The risk of injury (and pain) is not during the mobility phases of function but during the stability phases of function.  This is the main point and rehab must focus on the stabilizing phases of the joint or body part.    It's also important that muscles and joints are innervated with nerves and have intricate associations with the central nervous system.  So joints and muscles need training - neuromuscular training.  This is one main principle behind plyometric training for athletes.    Certainly, prolotherapy looks promising for a few ligaments or tendons that are overstretched e.g. chronic ankle sprains but for general hypermobility I would think that there are too many and too much non contractile tissues (ligament and joint capsule) to treat.\n\n",

    "content": "Possible problems are bone bruise. Subchondral (below the cartiledge) may be bruised.  This would cause pain with weight bearing - including flexion beyond 90 degrees.  The buckling may be from the pain rather than structurally unstable joint.  If the structures of the knee internally and externally are sound then rehab should be effective.    Bone bruises take a long time to heal.    Also synovitis which is inflamation of the inside lining of the joint is a possibility.  This would have been noticed during the scope.  A bone bruise would not respond to intraarticular (inside the joint) steroid injection whereas synovitis may.    Second opionion is your choice.\n\n",

    "content": "I am athletic, have relatively good muscle tone, do aerobics regularly, enjoy walking, hiking,etc.  About 3 weeks ago while mowing the lawn, I noticed my rt. knee went out sideways.  I felt a funny sensation in it, but not pain.  Later, I noticed the knee was swollen a bit, i.e., swelling was not obvious to me by looking at it, but was noticeable when comparing to the left knee.  Since there was no pain and I was able to walk normally (abeit with a \"strange\" sensation in the knee), I took a wait-and-see approach.  A week later I went on a long-awaited vacation that entailed some daily  optional walking, but nothing strenuous.  This past week there was still some swelling, so I used an ace-bandage.  Still no pain, but I notice a little stiffness when using stairs and feel an occasional clicking.  Also, noticed some bruising in the kneecap area.   Now I recalled that about a month ago, while pushing a piano, I had wedged my knee against it for that \"final\" push. (Dumb, I know).    Most info that I have found on internet, etc., point to possible tears in ligaments or meniscus, damaged patella, with horrible consequences for those who do not have it checked out by an MD and surgically corrected.    I tend to think --- if no pain and basically functional, although I no longer run up the stairs, I can still give it some time to heal.  If so, what exercises need I avoid?  Can I swim?  Can I do careful aerobics?  I've been avoiding the gym  till this gets fully resolved.  Thanks for your input, Knee-damaged-lady\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  I think you've pretty thoroughly researched your problem and have learned what the likely causes of the sensation might be. The problem is that while  pain is useful in motivating us toward care, this  sort of injury (especially if it involves rupture or displacement of a ligament, which seems likely) is not always appropriately painful, and it's only when the knee does something really bizarre that people tend to find it necessary to seek medical intervention. Trust me, you're better off avoiding that step in the process. While self-treatment could work, these things do not usually get better on their own, and while surgery may not be required at this point, if you continue to walk on it (and maybe do other things to keep it from healing) it could well wind up requiring increasingly more involved surgical repair. While these can often be accomplished through minimally invasive arthroscopic surgery,  the  longer one waits, the more likley an open procedure may become necessary. Again, right now you may well be within the scope of working with a brace and anti-inflammatories. It's certainly worth heading off as early as possible.   I hope this is helpful. Please do stay in touch with us here and let us know how things work out.\n\n",

    "title": "Patellar Dislocation After ACLR",
    "content": "Hello!  I had my ACL reconstructed close to 17 years ago, a bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft.  Over the years I have had virtually no problems with my knee.  Unfortunately starting about 2 years ago my kneecap began to dislocate to the side.  Since this is relatively common in people who have the type of graft I do my orthopedic gave me a brace to stop my kneecap from sliding around so much.  Fantastic!  But now all of the sudden my kneecap is sliding straight up my leg and sliding right back down into place.  I have acute pain (obviously) when it happens but it goes away pretty quickly and then my quads are just really sore for the next couple of days.  Is it worth going to see a doctor for this?  Unfortunately my doctor is retired so I would have to find a new one and I'd hate to waste their time and mine for something in which not much can be done and/or it's not really damaging anything.  Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello AlliP,  My knowledge of this problem is a little limited so I can't tell you exactly what this may be due to.  I do think it is worthwhile having an orthopedist evaluate your knee to see if anything else needs to be done to help this.    If there is a chronic dislocation problem it may begin to cause other problems such as pain due to the muscles constantly tensing up trying to hold the patella in place.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Hip Surgery Revision due to infection",
    "content": "Hi Judy,  There is normally a small amount of fluid in the hip joint to help lubricate the joint.  It is called synovial fluid.  It should be clear not cloudy.  Cloudy fluid often indicates infection, as in your first case.  I am less familiar with infections of hip replacements regarding the longterm treatment; however, infection of foreign body is difficult to clear because the bacteria are able to grab on to the hardware well.  Your surgeon may be considering the longterm antibiotic as a preventative method to help prevent an infection from developing.    You may want to see an infectious disease specialist to see if there is anything else you can do to help prevent further infections from occurring.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "My boyfriend is a 19 year old college baseball pitcher. This past July, he had surgery on his pitching arm: labrum slap tear and a torn rotator cuff. He goes to physical therapy regularly, and due to his quick rehabilitation, was given the okay to start throwing again. He has been throwing for a couple of weeks now, and the past few days, he has been experiencing a lot of pain. He is out of town and cannot get to his original doctor/surgeon until next week.   If he did tear something again, is it possible to fix it; or will he be unable to play baseball for awhile..or ever? (I know that he does not know for sure if he did tear it, but he said the pain is in the same place and hurts very badly).\n\n",

It could be a reinjury and may require additional physical therapy or if he has done some serious damage, it could require surgery to correct.  Only the doctor treating him who has access to his complete history, records and exams could give a prognosis for future activity restriction.  Even then, the doctor will not be able to predict exactly how he will heal.    At any rate, he needs to see his surgeon or other doctor again to assess the damage and decide on the next course of action.    Best to both of you.\n\n",

He is on the fence that immobilization will correct this issue as it stands right now I am currently in a short leg cast for 4 weeks I'm not totaly sold on the fact that this is the correct treatment. if this does correct the issue and surgery is needed what kind of healing time is needed and am I wasteing my time right now? This was found from an MRI. The doctor seemed a bit clueless when he was looking at the films he was just going on what the report said. If surgery were needed to fix this would it have to me immobile after as well? what is a realistic time frame for this type of injury?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Hurtankle,  The answer to this question really depends on how much of the ligament has been torn.  I would recommend you see an orthopedic surgeon to have this evaluated.    If the tear is minor immobilization may be sufficient.  If it is more severe surgery may be needed.  Recovery time after surgery is often long.  A cast will likely be placed for eight weeks or so then slowly weight bearing will be returned.  The times may vary a bit depending on your case.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 60-year-old woman, overweight but mostly healthy. I take medication for moderate hypertension and for asthma. I have osteoarthritis like every other aging person in my family, but have had no medical treatment for it so far.  I have an appointment scheduled for a few weeks at my HMO, but my experience is that they are reluctant to make referrals or do much about orthopedic stuff.   The current problem probably started when I injured my left hip in a fall four years ago. The pain from this was severe at the time, but it was never X-rayed or treated in any way. It got better, but since then has always been stiff and sore--ever since then I take stairs one at a time, for instance. In the past few months, it has become extremely painful, bad enough so that sleeping has become a big problem. The hip and lower back hurt, but the most severe pain is charley-horse type cramps down the outside of my left leg, down to the ankle, and recurrent cramping pain very deep in my groin. I have been talking to a co-worker who recently had a hip replacement after similar problems. My questions--a) is it likely that all the pain involved originates with the hip problem, or should I be concerned about something else going on in my abdomen? b) what are the various possible approaches to the problem if it *is* just the hip having lost all its cartiledge? I hate the idea of surgery, and I'll bet anything I will have to fight the HMO for it. At the same time, I'm still working full time (as a teacher) and have no plans to retire soon, and this pain situation is getting impossible. (My current regime is just soaking in the tub and taking a lot of aspirin, which seems to help as much as anything.)\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I understand your frustration, especially if you have difficulty getting referrals.  This is one I would suggest you fight for because you could likely benefit from either an orthopedic doctor or a rheumatologist.  The latter would be most helpful if this is osteoarthritis or something of that nature.  It certainly sounds suspicious for that and often it settles in places of past injury.    This is not to say it couldn't be something else - it could even originate in your back, but either way, you need to have this examined by a doctor.  There are effective treatments but of course you need to be sure you have the proper diagnosis first.    Good luck as you work toward this goal.\n\n",

(mostly this happens at work)  I am in the military (navy) a 31 yr old female, and this has been happening for as long as I can remember.  Often we are required to carry things on board up and down stairs, and across gangways that are on inclines etc.  Today we were offloading all of the food we had on board after a long trip.  This involved carrying heavy bags of frozen meat etc over and over again.  Shortly after we started, I noticed my knees both were painful, and it was hard to get up and down on the steps.    The pain is in the front of my knees, just below my kneecaps and from center towards the outside.  It hurts to step and and down and sometimes even just to bend it while sitting down.    I always thought maybe it had something to do with the fact that my legs are kind of misaligned like if I stand with my feet together, my knees point inward (knock kneed?)  Everytime this happens, it usually goes away on its own after a few days but I am worried that some time I will not be able to hide it at work.  What could be happening?  And how can I prevent it from happening again?  I do not want to mention it at work because it could affect my career.  Thanks\n\n",

There are people with many diverse impairments who are having sexually satisfying relationships.  Your doctor, and your husband's doctor are the best ones to answer the question you pose, since they are better acquainted with both of your general health concerns as well as any specific health issues.  Hip replacements have come a long way since their development.  Each person's recovery will be unique to their individual ability to recover, their will to recover, and the nature of the specific replacement technique deemed most appropriate.  Your/his team of specialists can best advise you.  Please consider that hip replacement may offer a better quality of life not only in your special times together,but the rest of the non-sexual day.  It seems to me that the potential to have a stronger independence overall is a strong selling point to having the surgery done - regardless of whether you may have to delay your sexual relationships or change your techniques.\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for reading this:  The first time that my shoulder came off is once i stumble when snowboarding,  i used my two hands to support  my body, i can barely hear the crack sound that came from my right shoulder.  Before that, i was not noticed that my shoulder is already loosed until  in a basketball game,  my shoulder came off when i put my arm backward in a powerful position.    The latest case is that when i woke up in a morning, i used my right arm to push me up to stand, and my arm is at a backward position and it came off, that was the longest time (about 10 seconds) that I used to push it back to the original position.  My shoulder has been dislocated for 6 times, so I went for two doctors to see what happen to my shoulder, and he told me to do a x-ray first on my shoulder, but it showed my shoulder is in a good condition, but after my shoulder came off about the 6th time (the woke up one ), i phoned to the first doctor, and he suggest me to do a  surgery to fix it on the phone and without seeing my shoulder condition.  But you know, as a patient, we would want to get the best suggestion, so i went for another doctor,  i explained my shoulder condition to him, he moved my arm in 360 degrees and asked me if there was any pain that you felt when i moved your arm, then i said no, cause i really feeling nothing as usual.  Afterward, he said there is no need for you to do a surgery, cause the problem is about the membrance between the bone, is tore,  and he suggest me to protect my shoulder,and stop any exercise like basketball, football, which will cause your shoulder come off again.  Now, i am just struggling by these two different advises from my two doctors, one is take a open surgery, the other is to protect my shoulder for 1 year from coming off and doing some exercise to strengthen the muscle that cover the joint which will make it more stable.  If any person or doctor or any one who experienced from this,  give me  some advises for dislocation.  Actually, i know my shoulder is not as bad as some people who come off easily.  Cause my second doctor said the membrane is not easily recover around your shoulder, but should i listen to my second doctor to rest my shoulder for a year or more and do some exercises to strength the muscle around the shoulder  PLEASE GIVE ME SOME SOLUTION OR TREATMENT ABOUT MY SITUATION,---------Your suggestion will make a difference\n\n",

    "content": "In general, I recommend against surgery if other treatment is possible.  It is reasonable to try the physical therapy and limitations in activity to give your shoulder a chance to heal.  If these do not work, or you later decide you would like to pursue surgery, you can discuss surgical treatments with your orthopedic surgeon.  There are some cases such as yours that do not improve with physical therapy but it is difficult to say which ones will not get better.  As such, giving PT a try is a reasonable strategy.  Keep in mind that I am not an orthopedic surgeon so your surgeon may have information/knowledge about your injury that I do not.  So, if your surgeon is recommending surgery you should discuss the reasoning for this to allow you to make the best informed decision.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

What you need in an elbow is enough bend to get the hand to the mouth and to be able to turn your hand so the palm points upwards and anything else is a bonus! The problem with the elbow is it hates being operated on and hates rehab/physio and has a great inbuilt tendancy to stiffen up. So you could end up with the same range of movement but in a different part of the arc (nb arm out strainght is called 180 degrees, the rightangle is 90 degrees and any bend is less than 90).   Its a difficult decision to make to try and release an elbow and afterwards you will need to be splinted in a hinged brace for 6 weeks or longer.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "title": "Diagnosis for shoulder pain",
    "content": "Hello,  I am a 25 year old female who, about a year and a half ago, fell onto outstretched arms and damaged my left shoulder.  Pain results from any overhead force, weight on outstreched arms, or the arm simply being in a position above the level of the shoulder, even if it is otherwise supported.  I was initially sent to PT and did painfull exercises for about four weeks.  After that, I was refered to an othopedic speciallist who commissioned x-rays and an MRI.  The MRI showed a very small protusion on the acromion, but the ortho did not think this was the cause of the pain.  I was basically told to wait a year, avoid motions that cause pain, and see if it improved.  Now, with new insurance, I have had to start over with a new general practitioner.  He initially estimated a seperated shoulder and sent me off with anti-inflamitories, drawing the alphabet and circles in the air with my hand.  He commissioned an x-ray to look for seperation and this came back clean.  He wrote a script to a physical therapist, but I still have no diagnosis.  Do any of you have any thoughts on the possible cause?  Can PT do harm when the cause is unknown?  Thank you!\n\n",

Their are two main nerves and have different areas they control.When my arthritis flares up the ulna nerve causes numbness in the two small fingers. I am unsure what the other nerve feels like when it is irritated.  I fractured  my elbow at the age of 7 and now at 48 am looking at joint replacement. It is a serious step. I will never be able to lift more than 10 lbs with that arm again.  Arthroplasty is an option if bone chips or scar tissue is causing the pain. Surgical reconstruction of the joint is also possible. I had the ulna bone cap removed about 10 years ago and it provided great pain relief.\n\n",

You did mention arthritis, have you tried anti-inflammatory medication and/or physical therapy? If you have a torn cartilage, arthroscopic surgery may be of benefit. If it turns out that you need knee replacement surgery, make sure and ask about laparoscopic procedures which are less invasive and require a shorter recovery period. There is  also a relatively new procedure called unicondylar knee surgery for those who are candidates (this is a unilateral or one-sided knee surgery).\n\n",

    "content": "Dear bgio,  I am sorry to hear about your dad.  However Hip arthroplasty is generally a successful operation and quite effective in improving the mobility of the VAST majority of people who have the surgery.  Timescale The timescale is variable...but generally for a single joint replacement the duration of stay for conventionally is around 5 days to a week, depending on preoperative physical condition.  It is usually around 6 weeks before being able to completely mobilise un aided. \"Minimal access\" surgeons claim that the time to discharge from hospital is quicker, and the time to mobility is also greater.  In the UK of course the wait to get to the top of the list for surgery is quite long (around 9 months to a year) that the time to recovery is not too bad.  However in the US presumably things are quicker and provided everything goes ok I should imaginethe only thingdetermining his recovery is his preoperative physical state(If he is still playing golf then I would imagine his general condition is otherwise quite good).   Having both hips done together may take longer to recover from but possibly overall (combined) time for recovery may be less.     Bilateral Hip Replacements Hip arthroplasty  is major surgery, with potential for significant morbidity( blood loss, clots, chest problems, fracture, nerve injuries etc). Most surgeons in the UK do not recommend doing both in one sitting, although some may allow the operations to be separated by a week, and both operations are done on the same visit to the hospital.  It takes a while to get over the trauma and the anaesthetic, and potentially one may be doubling these causes of morbidity in attempting to do a second operation before allowing recovery form the first.  It is matter of surgeon's choice and while  I myself do not do bilateral hip arthroplasties simultaneously, I have colleagues who would do so in selected cases.  The complications of hip arthroplasty are rare, and occur on avergae in around 3-5%   some I have already alluded to.  The choice as to the timetable for surgery is a matter for discussion with the surgeon and the patient concerned, I guess and there really is no right or wrong answer.  Usually the disease is more advanced in one hip than the other.  If this is the case, then doing the worst hip first may give a sufficient boost to his mobility to allow a decent slow step with your sister, and the other could be done later...perhaps.   It is difficult to recommend one method over the other, without knowing the current mobility state, response to conservative measures such as anti-inflamatories, and also his own anxieties over the subject.    As for which surgeons to recommend.... most accredited surgeons can handle hip arthroplatsies, it is bread and butter for us. Personally, being based in the UK, I don't know any specialist across the pond as it were...over here one could recommend Sarah Muirhead-Allwood at the Royal National Orthopaedic...she did the Queen Mother's hips...  Hope this helps  Saif\n\n",

However, once she has had the surgery she will most likely be able to walk around much better and with a great deal less pain.  Normally after a surgery of this kind, someone of her age is sent to an assisted rehab facility until they are able to function on their own.  When she finishes rehab there is a very good chance that she would walk better than she has walked in a long time, and without the pain.  The risks that she would run are throwing a blood clot or gaining an infection at the surgical site.  These risks are minimal but they can happen.\n\n",

Knee replacement surgery has been done very successfully under a nerve block anesthesia  -one Dr I worked with said he preferred this to general anesthesia.  This does not mean that there are not big risks - blood clots can be fatal and are a common risk factor of joint replacement surgery.  This brings me to the next consideration: current mobility.  If your grandmother is not currently very mobile and has not been for some time either due to knee pain, weight issues or other issues, it may be beneficial to look into other treatments first.  Finally, I will mention the aspect of rehab - following a joint surgery rehab is very important.  The more effort put forth at rehab will lead to more use, and a quicker recovery.  Conversely, if a patient is unmotivated or simply cannot tolerate the level of activity needed for rehab, the recovery will take much longer and the overall outcome of the surgery may be less than hoped for.  Please consider these factors and how they can influence one another.  Good luck to you and Grandma!\n\n",

    "title": "Problems with my hip are affecting my knee. no one knows why",
    "content": "A couple years back now I was diagnosed with OCD (osteochondritis Dissecans) in my left ankle see my story http://www.tc.umn.edu/~mada0021.  I have had two surgeries on this matter and beleive I am finally getting better from it.  If you are not up to speed on this condition it is basically a lesion (fragment) of bone/cartilage in the ankle which causes grinding or lack of motion in the ankle or any joint in the body for that matter.  To my recent problem.  I beleive it is because of my favoring of my ankle that has led to my most recent problem.  For some reason my right knee (opposite of the OCD ankle) is always getting sore.  About a half a year ago (before my second ankle surgery) I was running and almost collapsed because of the pain I had encountered in my right knee lateraly.  It seemed to be coming from the IT band (streatch of tissue which runs along the lateral side of the leg).  This went away eventually and other problems began to develope.  Most of the pain is now located on the medial portion of my knee, close to where the sartorius connects to it.  When I do a strech similar to doing the splits, I can feel my knee or knee cap, something of the matter, pull toward the medial (inside) of my leg.  When I relax this streach I can feel it come back down almost like it were separated (this is what it feels like.  When I sit on the floor with my legs straddled outward my right leg will rotate inward and my right foot will almost touch the floor (My leg will rotate in an unnatural way such that my big toe will come very near touching the floor medialy.)  I have come to the terms that this is most likely caused by my right hip in some way.  I have seen 3 orthopedics on this matter and they have all said nothing is wrong with me even through X-rays of both my right knee and right hip and an MRI of my right knee.  My phisical therapist whom I am working with for my ankle at the moment from my previous surgery has also worked with me.  Everyone seems to be stumped.  I've tried physical therapy on it, streaching it out and strengthening my hip.  So far no luck.  Any Ideas would be much appreciated.  Thanks for reading through this long winded story.

So, If ya hear anything about your knee pain can ya let me know, maybe i will have something more to go on the next time she goes to the orthapedic doc.  I know there has to be something that can be done about this.  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "several years ago my grandmother had hip replacement due to severe arthritis.  Years later, as of today, she is in terrible pain and can hardly get function.  She has  seen her doctor and  he says everything  is  fine with the replacement however my concern is managing her pain.  She doesn't like to take  medication but isn't there something out there she can take when the pain is unbearable. She has done therapy and has taken all the anti inflammatory meds available and nothing has helped.  What  do you suggest? We are all trying so hard to help her and  it seems as though we are watching her condition worsen.  She is very independent and really at this point I feel she just needs to focus on managing the pain because as we all know there is no cure for arthritis.  She was told that arthritis sometimes gets in the muscle and when this happens hip replacement doesn't always rid you of pain... is this true? please help any advice would be much appreciated. thank you                                                                 sjperky\n\n",

Was her evaluation done by her orthopedic physician? Although arthritis does cause significant pain, if she has essentially been pain free until recently I would be inclined to consider a malfunction of the hip replacement or surrounding area and would seek a re-evaluation.

She still uses the crutches and is very nervous about falling which is making her life difficult.

    "content": "Hi Dan Gu, Did she receive any physical therapy after her hip replacement? A walker may be much more useful than crutches (which by the way crutches at that age may be relatively dangerous in itself). Is she experiencing pain when bearing weight? If she is then she needs re-evaluated to rule out any complications. Now if she isn't, activity and exercise must be done as a regular routine to regain the use and mobility of joints and muscles. As strengthening and mobility increases she should gradually increase the weight that she puts on her leg. Remove any throw rugs or clutter from traffic paths. Rearrange the most used areas to allow xtra room for easier accessibility. Doing these simple measures and using a walker verses crutches should decrease her fear of falling. Encourage her that by doing regular strengthening exercises it will enhance her recovery time. Generally speaking recovery time is 6-8 weeks. Again if she is experiencing any unusual pain, swelling, etc. call the physician so a re-evaluation can be completed. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

Is there a site/source where one can access physician information to see who is the best in thier field, has performed the procedure being done the most ,etc? I recently had hand surgery and went to several orthopods and one plastic surgeon and came to find out that only one orthopod was certified in hand surgery. I went to see this guy and I am grateful but I almost made the mistake of having someone do my surgery who has more experience with knees/ hips,etc. Any advice would be appreciated.

I have heard of the existence of such, but am unaware.   I think orthopedicians can generally do hand surgery, but one can opt for orthopedicians with higher experience in hand surgery or knee surgery, as the case may be. But that shouldn't lead one to imagine a surgeon for every bone in the human body.   Warm regards,  Bill\n\n",
