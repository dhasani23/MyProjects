    "content": "To Whom It May Concern  My Father is suffering from Hepatitis C disease since 1995. He is doing really well and regularly undergo checkups which include various blood tests and Endoscopy. His recent test of AFP revealed levels of 298.4, due to which the doctor advised us to undergo a CT SCAN.  The CT SCAN detailed that a HEPATOMA of 2 x 2 cm in the segment VI of the liver was diagnosed.   Our Gastro doctor advised us to undergo a surgery called RFA. We got admitted to the hospital which later discharged us on the report of the Radiologist that the Tumor could not be seen on the Ultrasound machine due to which the surgery can't be performed.  We were later advised to travel to Singapore for the procedure.  Just recently before attempting surgery in Singapore, we visited a well known Cancer Hospital and were advised to undergo a few tests as well as a MRI Scan with Contrast.  The MRI Report has got me really confused as it showed that there were no signs of HEPATOMA but a HEMANGIOMA. Gastro Doctors at the Cancer hospital termed my father out of danger and sent us back home.  Later on consulting our Gastro Doctor in my hometown, the doctor was of the opinion that there is a Hepatoma as the AFP shows.  Kindly help as we are really confused.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Hepatoma or Hemangioma?",
    "content": "Hi, To begin with, let me try to explain the reason for some of the difficulties experienced in interpreting  -Fetoprotein (AFP) levels.  In adults, levels over 500 nanograms/milliliter of AFP are seen in the following situations:  - Hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC),  - Germ cell tumors of ovary and testis, and  - liver metastasis due to primary malignancies elsewhere.  Not every person with increased AFP test results can be presumed to have cancer or will develop liver cancer. AFP concentrations can be elevated, and fluctuate, in individuals with chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis. When the AFP concentrations of individuals with chronic liver disease change from \u2018moderately\u2019 elevated to \u2018greatly\u2019 elevated, their risk of developing liver cancer increases. AFP levels can increase temporarily in conditions causing liver injury and regeneration, and moderate elevations can be seen with a variety of conditions including some other cancers (gastric, pancreatic and biliary tract cancers).  The \u201chigh dose hook effect\u201d is an artefact of tumor marker immunoassay kits, that results in reported value of a tumor marker to be falsely low, when the actual level is in fact, high. An undetected hook effect may cause delayed recognition of a tumor. A suspected hook effect can be confirmed by analyzing serial dilutions. If the hook effect is absent, then, reported quantities of tumor marker in a serial dilution should be proportional to the dilution.  Hereditary persistence of alpha-fetoprotein (HPAFP): an autosomal dominantly inherited condition, should be considered in both children and adults with unexplained and persistent elevation of AFP. This can be easily confirmed by analyzing AFP levels in the other members of the family.  Fibrolamellar variant of HCC: this is one variant which presents differently. It is more common in women and has a better prognosis. Less than 10% of patients with fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) have AFP levels > 200 ng/mL.  <10-20% of cases of FLC are associated with hepatitis B viral infection, and is rarely associated with hepatitis C viral infection.  The important of this condition (in the context of your father\u2019s case) lies in the fact that it has some imaging features in common with hemangiomas and focal nodular hyperplasia and at times may be difficult to diagnose based on imaging.  A relatively new test, called AFP-L3% (one of the AFP variants), is sometimes used  to compare the amount of total AFP to the amount of AFP-L3. The AFP-L3% test is not yet widely used in the U.S, but has gained wider acceptance in other countries such as Japan. The main use of this test is to help determine the risk of developing HCC, especially in those individuals with chronic liver disease. When total AFP and AFP-L3% are significantly elevated, then risk for such a person of having, or developing hepatocellular carcinoma in the next year or two is higher.    Thus, in your father\u2019s case, several possibilities must be entertained, such as - that he in fact has a hemangioma and has an elevated AFP level due to hepatitis C, - that he in fact has a hemangioma and has a raised AFP level due HPAFP,  - that  a firolamellar variant of HCC has been mistaken for a hemangioma (although it is more common in women and rarely associated with hepatitis C), or  - hypervascular metastasis from tumors such as neuroendocrine carcinoma, melanoma or renal cell carcinoma.  It is indeed an unfortunate situation to be in. What could be done next is hard to recommend.  One approach may be to have the AFP levels repeated after a few months. total AFP and AFP-L3% may be checked. MRI should also be repeated after a few months. RBC-tagged technetium-99m scintigraphy may be useful to confirm a hemangioma (sensitivity better for larger lesions).  Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, What you call as spots are perhaps what are known as 'focal' lesions in the liver.These are classified as  - (liquid)cystic or - solid. There are very many pathologies that can cause these 'focal' lesions.Some of these are benign and others malignant.Some of them, although benign are capable of causing serious or even life-threatning problems.  Examples of some of the focal liver lesions that usually tend to remain silent are - hemangiomas - focal nodular hyperplasia - simple cysts - focal fatty change.  Some of these start causing symptoms only when they grow to a large size. Best wishes!\n\n",

Thirdly, in my opinion, the fatty liver issue should be further investigated. There are many conditions that can cause a fatty liver.    Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I am sorry to hear about your friend's condition. Just to clarify things for everyone else - osteocarcinoma is a relatively obsolete term which refers to bone metastasis from a carcinoma, in this case hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).   To answer your question - late stage (stage IV) has a poor prognosis. Bone mets depending on their location can have serious implications due to encroachment on the spine or the possibility of a fracture.  Many things need to be taken into consideration when discussing prognosis of liver cancer, the functional status of the patient, the age, the state of the liver (liver function) as well as the type of pathology (eg, fibrolamellar carcinoma which appears in younger individuals and is of better prognosis).  Generally speaking metastatic HCC is treated with target therapy sorafenib. Other options may be appropriate depending on the details of his clinical assessment.  A lot can be done in terms of palliation such as radiation therapy for pain control of bone metastasis.   Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Hi. This is regarding my brother-in-law, a 59 year old male.  He was diagnosed with hepatitis C and liver cirrhosis years ago. He has been in and out of hospitals ever since. Location Cairo, Egypt.  Last week he threw up a large amount of blood and had a high AFP reading over 1,000. All this happen while in the hospital; he is still in hospital at this time.  My question is, based on his latest medical test below, what type of treatment, if any would be recommended at this point.  I think that his doctor is suggesting Radiofrequency Ablation. I say \"think\" based on the doctor telling the family that they want \"to go in and iron cells\u2026\". I am awaiting confirmation on the medical term of this \"ironing\" from his doctor.  Thank you for your time and for being available to us on this forum. I appreciate   your opinions and many thanks again.  MEDICAL REPORT  - Axial CT abdominal. CT scan was performed after bowel opacification and intra venous contrast injection. - The liver is moderate enlarged cirrhotic coarse pattern. The right lobe posterior segment is the seat of heterogeneous enhanced mass lesion measuring 11 x 12 x 9 cm. Extends to segment 6, 7 and to lesser extent 8 with visceral surface buldge. - Portal vein is homogeneously enhanced. - No intra hepcetic biliary rodicles dilation. - Spleen is moderate enlarged, homogeneous in attenuation with regular surface. - Multiple para esophageal collateral and varies. -Kidneys are average size, of homogeneous attenuation pattern and adequate excretory function. No focal mass lesion. - Pancreas, supra renal glands are average size, regular margins, with homogeneous attenuation pattern of the parenchyma. No focal mass lesion. - No para aortic or retro peritoneal lymphadenopathy or mass lesion. - No ascites or localized collection. - The scanned lung bases and pleural recess are clear.  CONCLUSION  - Hepatomegaly with right lobe (6-7 and 8) mass lesion likely neoplastic. - Splenomegaly and para esophageal collaterals and varices.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I do apologize for the late reply. I hope your brother in law is well.  The most important determinant for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the liver function status. Since the most important risk factor for this disease is cirrhosis and hepatitis C (which is endemic in Egypt), HCC usually presents with poor liver function.   Many oncologists use one of several prognostic classifications that assess liver function to determine the best therapeutic approach.   Surgery as you know would be the optimal treatment. Liver transplant is another option with excellent outcome but requires strict criteria which do not apply to your father. The presence of varicies that you mention is quite significant as it indicates the presence of portal hypertension which is usually a contraindication for curative approaches.  Radiofrequency ablation is a great option for local disease in which neither surgery nor transplant is possible. Best results are acquired when the tumor size is less than 4cm. This is due to two reasons 1, the applicator has a circumference of approximately 5cm and of course smaller tumors fair better than larger ones. In this setting the outcomes are comparable to surgery. However, there is no strict limitation on size and multiple sessions can be used to cover the area occupied by the tumor although less benefit is expected.  HCC is a very difficult disease to treat because of the aforementioned reasons. Localized HCC always challenges the oncologist to take a more active attempt at its control.  Please keep us updated and my apologies again for the late response.\n\n",

Prognosis and survival depends on the tumor extent and the general condition of the patient which permit surgical resection and or chemoradiotherapy.  When the tumor can be resected completely, patients may achieve long-term survival with a 5-year survival rate up to 40%. The median survival duration of 17-27.5 months can be reached.  A median survival duration of 7-17 mo can be achieved  when resection is done with no further chemo radiation.  The poorest prognosis is when patients have unresectable disease and can not tolerate chemotherapy or radiation therapy (tolerate only palliative stent placement).   Hope this information is useful.

She has wonderful medical support from the cancer center where she receives treatment and the VNA hospice team who visit her at home.   She had radiation and 5 FU as I mentioned. She has had several rounds of Gemzar and continues to have low dose treatments every other week as long as she can tolorate it, which she does pretty well.  She had several set backs along the way... a fractured pelvis due to a fall and GI Bleeds, which postponed treatment.   Initially, my mother was extremely ill and it was felt that she couldn't tolarate resection surgery. After radiation and 5 FU she consulted with a surgeon who felt surgery was not a good option for her as they don't know the extent of the tumors and fear that they are probably elsewhere besides the bile duct. She has a pacemaker so an MRI was not done so better pictures were not available.   She has been such a strong person through all of this. In spite of all she has gone through, she remains in good spirits thinking more about everyone else than herself.  We are grateful to have her with us still and cherish every day with her.

    "content": "I was wondering if I should be concerned...I was just on a two week regimen of diflucan (300mg in the morning and 300mg at night) because I have a yeast infection that won't go away. I believe it may be because of candida overgrowth.  For months now, I've been tired to the point where I don't get anything done, just want to sleep when I get home from work....My skin is itchy(no rashes though)...My mouth seems drier than usual, my lips are so dry that they feel like leather, and nothing I put on them helps, and my urine is very yellow. This all started happening when I started the diflucan, but I also at the same time changed my diet to no sugar...which means no soda, or bread, or every day food most people consume...so I just thought that maybe the diet change was more responsible for the dry mouth and really dry lips. I'm trying to drink more, which has helped with the dry mouth, but my lips are basically peeling...oh....and my eyes get super dried out at the end of the day (sometimes they feel a little dry during the day) but I put in saline at night, helps for only a little bit then they feel dry again, so I wind up going to sleep because I can't keep my eyes open.  The yellow urine started happening after the diflucan...I was going to wait 7 days till it was out of my system, then see the doctor, but I wanted to see if I could get any input before then, because maybe it needs more immediate attention. If anything is wrong, I don't seem to feel sick...just tired and skin is itching...but not to the point where I can't stand it. I think my urine output should be more than what it is. I can drink almost a liter of water, and start to fell the need to urinate before it's gone, but not an urgency, I can hold it for my 8hrs of work and then go if I choose to. It just seems that I should have more urgency than that..or maybe I am dehydrated and that's all it is.  Any input on this is welcomed. Thanks, Monica\n\n",

    "content": "the itchiness can probably be attributed to candida overgrowth, as well as possible parasitic infections (something overwhelmingly overlooked). Candidiasis can cause a myriad of problems, but one thing you have to realize is when you're fighting to kill it, you're going to go through a \"die off\", where the yeast dies - could last a week if your case is severe.  Your symptoms will temporarily get worse, but should get better soon.  If you have any stomach bloating, that should go away within a few days, unless you have latent food allergies that haven;t been identified, which is going to continue to cause havoc when trying to fight off candida.   I have been through very similar problems, monica, and I strongly suggest that you get checked out by a specialist before it gets worse.  I was 89lbs and extremely ill by the time they caught what was wrong with me (low thryoid, secondary adrenal insufficiency, intestinal permeability, candidiasis, 22 latent food allergies).  Had too many things going on at once, and most mainstream medical doctors don't consider half of my conditions valid medical conditions.  All stemmed from a problem early on - something attacked my immune system, and I wound up with infections, and on antibiotics all the time with no probiotics or antifungals.  Candida overgrowth and adrenal problems tend to go hand in hand, especially when one is left untreated.  I had many of the symptoms you're complaining of, but much worse.  Diflucan is NOT the answer, and many strains of yeast are resistant to it.  You should try nystatin.  nizoral is also good, but can cause serious liver damage - I would stay away from it.  I was on nystatin for 4 months with no problems, and then had to switch to capryllic acid bc I developed a sensitivity to nystatin (that happens when you have intestinal permeability).  Anyway, try flax seed oil - one with Omega 3's, 6's and 9's.  DO NOT use the capsules, they will not help that much.  You have to drink the stuff straight and it is nasty.  2 tspns a day - see if it doesn't help your itchy and dry skin, cracked lips, etc.  If you really hate it, try to eat things that are super high in the Omega's - fish, etc...  most importantly, see a specialist - an endocrinologist.  Get tested for low thyroid, low adrenals.  If they act like you're crazy, see another doctor.  If you're having trouble locating one, I know of several - email me.  I might be able to give you some good advice, as I had to learn this stuff all firsthand.   Good Luck to you. -  Jenn delvoria@darksphere.com\n\n",

We got the lab results back in the mail today.  His ALT level is 58 (normal is 0 - 45), his GGT level is 75 (0 - 51 is normal).  His cholesterol is 247!!! His LDL Cholesterol is 159 (0 -129 is normal).  His Triglycerides are 189 (0-150 is normal).  I am in shock!   He is 27 years old, 5'9\", 180 pounds.  He's gained a bit in the past couple months, so his cholesterol doesn't SHOCK me.  But his liver enzymes are all off kilter!  And we have no reason for it at all.  He drinks maybe 3 times a year, hasn't SERIOUSLY drank in at least a year.  He used to be a very athletic guy, was in the Army.  Never had any problems.  They tested him for Hepatits C, which was negative, but not for A or B.  We have no health insurance on him (as he always claimed he was \"the healthy one\"), so I'm not sure what steps to take from here.  Are these levels VERY high or just moderately high?  I know his cholesterol is WAY too high (considered high-risk category), but the liver stuff confuses me.  I guess liver disease is pretty rare in America.  At least that's what the research I've done tells me.  What could be wrong?  He's around a lot of cleaning agents at work.  Could that be it?\n\n",

His ALT and GGT are only slightly elevated.  As you say his AST is normal.  The albumin level of 4.8 is not concerning.  Low albumin levels are more concerning for liver failure.  The low bilirubin level means that his liver is working well.  I would recommend having his liver enzymes rechecked in a few months after some cholesterol modification steps.  Having no symptoms with an elevated cholesterol is almost always the case.  Thus it is known as a silent killer.  It can be elevated for many years leading to heart disease without any symptoms at all.  A healthy diet and exercise are key to cholesterol control.  If this is not sufficient there are medications that can help.  I hope this helps.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I'm a 54 yr. old female, never smoked, slightly overweight.  I have taken zocor for about 4 years, and 6 months ago had slightly elevated LFTs for the first time. My gastroenterologist did more bloodwork - still mildly elevated, though down some, and ordered a liver ultrasound. The ultrasound showed a slightly enlarged, fatty liver; no mention made of tumors or anything else.  We are awaiting pre-certification for a CT scan.  The latest round of bloodwork showed my LFTs back to normal, but my AFP at 7, apparently 1 point higher than normal.  The doctor said that my hepatitis panel indicated HBsAg negative, HBsAb positive, and HBcAb negative.  I have never had hepatitis to my knowledge and have none of the risk factors at all, and don't even remember having had a vaccination.  Today I had bloodwork done for what my doctor called \"total\" hepatitis, plus another AFP test.  I don't have symptoms, but am frankly terrified by that slightly elevated AFP (though I have seen somewhere else that less than 10 is \"normal.)  I am scared silly at the thought of liver cancer.  Wouldn't it have shown up on the ultrasound?  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "There are several causes of fatty liver.  Some medications, excess alcohol ingestion, some forms of malnutrition and obesity are common causes.  Your hepatitis B labs indicate immunity to virus.  This may be due to vaccination in the past, or possibly acute infection with the virus in the past that has since cleared.    There are many other viruses that can cause a hepatitis picture.  Fatty liver can also elevate LFT's.  Alpha fetoprotein is associated with liver cancer but an elevation only one above normal is much less likely to be due to cancer than a very large elevation.  I recommend that you continue to follow up with your GI doctor to find the cause of your fatty liver and optimize treatment for you.  Best wishes.\n\n",

The only medication I am taking right now is birth control.  I noticed about 3 months ago a lump on my back right side, about 2-3 inches right of my spine just underneath my rib cage. Up until recently it wasn't bothering me, but lately it's just been a dull ache.  I went to my primary doctor last week, who just looked at it real quickly and said it was a Lymphoma? a fatty lump. Which was wonderful to hear, but the fact that they were so quick to say what it was and that the doctor didn't poke around or really look at it makes me still feel very uneasy about it. Can anyone tell me if this sounds like something more serious? I asked if it could be associated with the liver and the doctor said no, that any issues with the liver would be in the front. However, I have found many sites that speak of issues with the liver associated with the back side and right shoulder blade. Any help?\n\n",

    "content": "From your description I would say that a diagnosis of a lipoma is quite possible.  A lipoma is essentially a collection of fat cells into a ball-basically a fat cell tumor.  They are benign and do not need to be removed but often will be removed if they are causing pain or are getting larger.  Lipomas generally are sort of rubbery feeling.  Liver issues can present with pain in the right upper abdomen area or back.  Generally with liver problems there are other indicators of liver dysfunction such as yellowing skin (jaundice), nausea/vomiting, etc.    The absolute way to tell would be to simply do an excision biopsy where they would remove the lump completely then look at it under the microscope to see what it is.  If you are worried this would be a very appropriate course of action.  There are also some blood tests that can help look at the liver.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

It is very difficult to differentiate between liver cirrhosis lesion from malignant ones by conventional US or CT scan. Major difficulties occur when the liver parenchyma is not homogeneous (cirrhosis ) and the lesions are smaller than 1 cm.  New techniques like the Triple-phase, high-resolution CT and contrast-enhanced MRI are now the primary imaging modalities in the diagnosis and to stage liver carcinoma HCC.    The prognosis of patients with HCC depends on a group of factors including the extent of the disease in the liver, liver condition and the general condition of the patients including an existing comorbid condition.  Improved survival is seen when curative resection is possible, small tumor size, well-differentiated tumors, and normal performance status.  The 5-year survival rate in patients undergo curative resection,  can reach 20%.  Keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

These disorders include: hepatitis,  obstructive jaundice,  gallstones,  cirrhosis,  liver cancer.  Your father has hepatomegaly and pain similar to that of hepatobiliary disease. I advise you to follow with his doctor and to do more investigations like:  - CBC, liver enzymes, hepatitis markers, billirubin level,  - Images like abdominal CT.  Best regards,\n\n",

We found out that he had end stage liver disease in July of 2004 when he started throwing up blood.Three month ago they did a CT scan and they told us he had a 2cm tumor now three months later they did an MRI and on Monday of this week they told us that the tumor is now 3 cm and the doctor has sceduled a procedure called TACE to be done on June 16th . His medications are Methadone 8mg, lactulose 15mg Zoloft 100mg, Potassium, Propranolol 10mg, Ciprofloxacin 250mg, Nexium 40mg, and Centrum. I wanted to know how safe TACE was and if he should stop taking Methadone before going into surgery. When the doctor told us that it was cancer my mind went blank and I could not think of anything.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi chochies, Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization of the liver (TACE) is essentially a nonsurgical intervention that may be performed when a surgical intervention (resection) isn't an appropriate form of treatment. This is a radiological procedure, typically done by gaining access to the hepatic artery by way of the femoral artery in the groin. The intention of this treatment is administration of chemotherapy and an embolizing agent directly into the tumor. Tumor necrosis (death of the tumor) is the hoped result. This type of therapy may be completed once or several times. Some of the side effects and toxicities associated with traditional forms of intravenous chemotherapy can be avoided by TACE. There are of course complications and risks associated with any procedure but you have to weigh the risks verses the outcome without having a procedure done at all. In my opinion, I would not recommend discontinuation of the medication methadone, but you of course should inquire with his treating physician about clarification prior to the procedure. Best wishes to you both. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

Both can be hepatoxic if taken in excess and time released Niacin is not recommended due to its high toxicity on the liver. Taking Niacinamide one time over the recommended amount probably didn\u2019t hurt your liver but if you had hepatic problems already it wouldn\u2019t have helped it.  A few other things that may be causing your stools to be light colored may be gallbladder disorders, pancreas disorders, excessive consumption of light colored food, and intestinal giardia which also causes diarrhea. A liver panel blood test would put your mind to rest, it could probably be done at any clinic in the country with a faxed order from your physician.\n\n",

My father was diagnosed with Gastric cancer in March this year, he had two courses of chemo, he was then told that the chemo was doing more harm than good and so they were not going to continue with it, when he was scanned prior to the chemo they found nodules in his liver which they are assuming to be secondary cancer but they cant be 100% sure. They did not scan him again after the chemo. They eventually did a stomach bypass operation (palilative surgery) due to the fact that he was being sick all the time then sent him home. the doctor that spoke to me while he was in hospital said (blatanlty!) that there is nothing more they can do for him as its in the liver, (even though it isnt certain that it is) they have basically given up on him, they told us in March that he obly had a few weeks left, its now 7 months later and he seems no worse than he was in March, is there anything that can be done for him, they don't even know if the chemo has made any difference, i'm at my wits end and just want to help him. Also, he keeps getting calls from companies claiming that they can cure his cancer through organic products which would cost him in exces of \u00a39000, dad would try anything if he though it would work, has anyone ever used these companies, do they work??

    "content": "first,let me express my empathy for your situation. There are many things that come into play when \"diagnosing\" cancer. The fact that they were unable to give you the diagnosis with 100% certainty must be very frustrating. This is something I can tell you.....In my experience I have not run across someone who had spots or nodules on the liver where it was NOT cancer. When you were all told it was cancer, the M.Ds were not basing this soley on the \"spots\". There are many things...lab values, signs and sypmtoms and so on. I can assure you that the M.D would not have told you it was cancer if he had ANY doubt about it. This is the thing about Chemo. Chemo is designed to \"kill\" cancer cells. In this process  it also \"kills\" the good cells. someone on chemo will become sick easier and will feel as if all their energy has been \"zapped\". Sometimes the best decision someone can make...is to stop chemo and treatments. Liver cancer is fast spreading and you will typically see it spread throughout the body. With the information you have given me regarding his diagnosis date of march I would be curious to find out what his current condition is. Activity? color? is his stomach distended? trouble swallowing? As far as the \"herbal\" treatments are concerned. I have not taken care of a patient where it has \"cured\" the cancer or prevented tumor growth. however, I have not researched this enough to speak about it.......good luck to you and your family!\n\n",

It is inconsistent though - the doctors usually request additional bloodwork, and those results show the levels have returned to normal. This last visit though, they found the elevated levels again, requested the additional bloodwork (still elevated), and then scheduled an ultrasound of his liver, but found nothing abnormal from the ultrasound.   He is a healthy 6'4\", 220 lb. 29 year old male, who never drank in his teens, and only has a beer or two every couple of weeks. He has never smoked or done drugs. He has been taking a natural liver balance supplement over the past few years - and he takes it pretty regularly.  I am concerned though, because his parents were both alcoholics (though they are no longer), and his mother drank and did drugs throughout her entire 9 month-pregnancy with him. This fact troubles me greatly.  Could that be attributing to this \"yo-yo\" liver enzyme count? Should I be pushing the doctors to do futher testing?\n\n",

I have not read any articles of a convincing nature or seen a scientific evidence published that has shown that sugar feeds cancer cells and makes the cancer cells grow.  I have not heard that fructose is bad or good for cancer patients.  If someone else has information of which I am not aware, then I would be interested in seeing it.  Anyway, I think that a healthy, well-balanced diet is good for everyone, including cancer patients.  Nutritional supplements are often recommended for cancer patients to help maintain their nutritional status, which can be depleted by the cancer.  In a patient with diabetes, one needs to watch out for sugar.  Perhaps talking with a Nutritionist or a Dietician would be helpful for your Father and you.  Jeffrey A. Gordon, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear ratrenkamp,  Considering your history of iv drug abuse, this could be hepatitis infection.  You have to be evaluated for hepatitis infection as soon as possible.  High liver enzymes don't necessarily mean that this is a case of liver cancer.  i think the insurance matter is not going to be relevant. Talk to your social worker and i think that there are going to be some clinics that will be able to do the work-up for free.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.  Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Cindy,  The most probable explanation for the increase in size in the hemangioma is bleeding within the hemangioma. If this is not a hemangioma and it is a cyst then, it is bleeding also that causes an increase in its size.  Did you have any new onset pain in your abdomen? Did they check a blood count and found that your blood count is low?  If this is a hemangioma, i think the best way of action is to see whether or not you can embolize the feeding vessel and this can be done by performing an angiogram and then embolizing the vessel.  If it is a cyst, then you should be evaluated for removal of the cyst if possible.  Regarding the cyst in your spleen, was it not seen on any of the previous imaging studies that you have or this is the first time that you ever looked at the spleen? Were your kidneys looked at too as a part of the imaging study that you had?  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.

If the liver numbers are listed as being within normal limits, then the liver could be O.k. or be damaged severlely (i.e.- cirrhosis from alcohol use) and cannot increase the liver function tests.  The elevation in the kidney tests raises a concern about how the kidney is functioning or that the kidney is seeing decreased blood flow due to fluid going to third spaces (i.e.- outside of the blood itslef).  It seems that more testing is in order.\n\n",

    "content": "I am not a liver expert., so I do not know specifically what the repeat tests are for.  They may be repeat tests to see if there are any changes with the liver and the kidneys.  Sometimes if a liver is so badly damaged, such as from cirrhosis, then the liver function tests may look normal because the liver cannot function properly and cause elevation in such tests.  Other times, normal liver tests do indeed show that a damaged liver is functioning O.K.  With regard to the kidney tests, sometimes the kidneys do not see enough blood flow and thus the kidneys can not function 100%, causing an elevation in the creatinine.  Other times the creatinien can be elevated due to an intrinsic problem with the kidneys.\n\n",

    "title": "Massive cancer thought to be primary but not...",
    "content": "Hi, My mother, who is 53, has been diagnosed with a massive liver cancer (about 1/2 - 2/3 or her liver) and the CT and MRI scans suggested this was the primary cancer. The MRI scan also showed that she had cancer in the lymph nodes associated with the liver. Other than that she appears to be perfectly healthy!  Anyway, she has just had the results of a liver biopsy and has been told that the lier cancer isn't the primary but the secondary. The primary is still undiscovered but she has been on HRT for ~15 years so ovarian cancer is the most likely suspect. The reckoning is that the primary cancer is very aggressive for the secondary liver cancer to get so big in such a short space of time.  She is starting chemo, whereby she has three types (don't know which) of which two are administered once every three weeks and the third is administered continually over the three wekks through a hickman line, which I guess is essentially a drip feed into the blood supply near the heart.  Thats the background. Some questions: a) How is it possible to determine whether its primary or secondary cancer from the biopsy? b) How can you get a timeline from a biopsy. i.e. how do they know the cancer hasn't been around long? c) If (say) ovarian cancer is the main cancer why can that not be removed and the liver cancer treated with chemo? She has been told this is not possible. d) Will the chemo not also kill the primary cancer as well?  The list of questions goes on, but that will do for now! Thanks  John\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for your post to The Doctor's Lounge.  My apologies for no reply sooner, but I have been away.  Many cancers can travel via the blood to the liver.  A cancer mass in the liver is more loikely to be from some place elese and to have traveled to the liver than to have arisen from the liver.  Many times a Pathologist can see and do tests to confirm, as best as possibe, that the tumor in the liver is not a parimary liver cancer (i.e.- hepatocellular carcinoma).  There are also tests that can be done to sometimes determine from where the cancer originated.  However, this is not always conclusive.  There is a situation called \"cancer of unknown origin\".  This is a well known entity and more common than people think.  Sometimes the original site of the tumor doesn't grow large enough to be detected, whereas the metastatic site(s) do become large.  You cannot determine necessarily how long a cancer has been around.  There are cancers that grow very rapidly, but most cancers are not fast growing and have been present for some years.  Most of that tie the cancer is microscopic, so cannot be seen.  There is usually no benefit to remove a spot of cancer that has spread, since there is liklely to be other sponts of cancer around.  Sometimes surgery can be done on the liver, but if too much of the liver is involved by the cancer, than surgery cannot be done.  Very few cancers can be treated by a directed treatment to the liver.  This is a form of treatment that can be considered if a colon cancer has spread to the liver, but even then this type of treatment is not possible for most such patients.  Yoour Mother's doctors can tell you more about her specific liver and cancer situations.  One hopes that chemotherapy will go all throughout the body and try to stabilize or shrink back the cancer that can be seen and the cancer elsewhere that cannot be seen.  Unfortunately, in a situation where a cancer has spread beyond its original site of growth, the cancer is technically not able to be completely eradicated.  If you have a list of questions, then make certain that the doctors caring for your Mother talk with you about.  It is always important to try to have your questions answered.  My best regards.  Jeffrey A. Gordon, M.D.\n\n",
