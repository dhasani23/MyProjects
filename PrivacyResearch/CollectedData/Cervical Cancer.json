    "content": "Dear Doctor, I am a patient of stage 2-b cervical carcinoma. Its been almost a year since my diagnosis and I subsequently have gone though chemo (5 cycles), radiation (25 sessions) and brechy (twice) therapies. However, since a few weeks back i developed this nasty cough (with slight fever) which induced me to go to a pulmonologist who thankfully allied my fears regarding pneumonia but alarmed me by noticing that I had lost about 10 kgs during the last 3 months or so. I feel fine albeit very lethargic and some times week and have recently developed a stiff shoulder however my appetite is more or less the same. Doctor, my cancer follow up is due in mid July, sholud i take an early appointment or simply stick to an enhanced protein/carb diet? Do I have Cachexia? I currently weigh 71 kg...down from 80 kgs in March. Please advice.  Regards,  Adila\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Adel, Involuntary loss of 10 kgs in 3 months is clinically significant weight loss, as your doctor alluded to. There are so many causes of weight loss and cancer is one of them especially with your past history and your age. However, there are several bits of good news in your post. First, you have a clear lung scan and second you don't have a loss of appetite which usually accompanies cancer.   There are so many causes for involuntary weight loss that it would be difficult to give you a clear recommendation without a thorough history and physical exam. Even that is sometimes not enough leaving the doctor clueless.   Several questions - are you still losing weight? Second, did you get a recent blood count check? Has it shown any abnormalities? What about kidney and liver function tests? These tests along with a physical exam / medical history would be a minimal screening panel for your complaint.   If these weren't done and if you continue to lose weight, I would try to get an earlier appointment and voice these concerns. Please remember your physician is in a much better situation than I am to decide on the best course of action, and you certainly seem to be in good hands.  Please let me know.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Dr.,   Thankyou for your prompt reply and for allying my fears a bit. Fortunately I have already had a recent blood picture done along with multiple kidney and liver tests. All the things seem within range except for my ESR which was recorded at 38 in my case. On my pulmonologist's advice I have started to have a 10-injection course of vitamin B-12 injections (Bevidox). The Doctor thinks that my pallor is due to significant vit. B-12 deficiency. Meanwhile I have also gone on an intensive eating diet (my goal is to up my weight till 75 kg). Thankfully I have had no problems doing any of the above mentioned things. The pulmonologist has also advised another blood picture test in a month's time. However, I still remain cluessless as to why I have lost so much weight in the first place. Please advise if my treatment is on the right track and if this is sufficient to lower my ESR?

    "title": "Re: Cervical cancer Stage III A",
    "content": "Hi,  Invasive cervical cancer accounts for about 6% of all cancers that afflict women in the United States. Stage IIIA (involves lower third of vagina but, not the pelvic side wall) by the criteria of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO), accounts for less than 2% of all cervical cancer cases.  Over 90% of cervical carcinomas are squamous cell carcinomas. About 5-9%  start in glandular tissue (adenocarcinoma). Adenocarcinomas are more difficult to diagnose, but the treatment is as for squamous cell carcinomas and the survival rates, stage for stage, are similar.   There are several types of adenocarcinoma. Approximately 60% are the endocervical cell type, 10% each are of endometrioid and clear cell carcinomas, and 20% are adenosquamous carcinomas.  There are two rare types of cervical carcinoma known as small cell carcinoma and cervical sarcoma. Both have a poor prognosis.I am not aware of which histologic type of tumor your mother suffers from.  Management of stage IIIA patients is by a combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy.The radiation therapy treatment program includes intracavitary and vaginal brachytherapy plus external beam radiation therapy, with a strong emphasis on individualized treatment.Your mother obviously,did not have chemotherapy.   As your mother now has low back pain,several possibilities ought to be considered before one can formulate a treatment plan, - re-staging to ascertain the current stage (if it has climbed to stageIIIB by involving the pelvic side wall or has distant mets).If indeed it has progressed, ureteric obstruction/hydronephrosis can occur and may help to explain the back pain- - tumors can involve the pelvic nerves & thus cause back pain. - secondaries in bone also need to be excluded (although infrequent).  The most frequent site of metastasis is the vertebral column, particularly the lumbar & thoracic spine, followed by the pelvic bones.Management of painful bony mets is usually by radiotherapy and chemotherapy.  Pain management would depend upon first finding out what is presumably causing her pain and generally a team approach is needed in management of cancer pain. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "I have a constant fear of doctors- and an even worse fear of cancer. Unfortunately, cervical cell abnormalities run in my family. I am 18 years old, sexually active (it has been 9 months since I first became active), and my mom has no idea. As you can suspect I don't want to tell her about my sexual activity, though it has been with only one man, and that man my boyfriend and possibly husband in the next few years (she doesn't think we should be together).  My periods are regular, though as I get older the bleeding increases- and if I have sex during my period the cycle seems to start all over. It usually lasts about 4 days and I have no spotting in between the cycles. My mother and aunt had abnormal cervical cells when they were in their twenties- my mother's faded away on their own but my aunt had to have pieces of her cervix removed. Nothing has caused me to fear I have cancer except for my paranoia about being sexually active and developing cancer and not knowing it.   I am afraid to ask my mom right now to help me schedule an appointment with an OB/GYN, since I do not have one at present I don't really know how to go about getting one without some assistance from my mom. Would it be ok to wait a year until I am comfortable doing this on my own before going to get a pap smear or should I do it ASAP.\n\n",

There are treatment options, both hormonal, minimally invasive such as D & C or ablation for the uterine lining (diagnostic and treatment) and surgery for the fibroids if they are large and causing problems -bleeding, pain, etc.  Sometimes hysterectomy is recommended but not necessarily.  I'm sure your doctor will explain your treatment possibilities along with risks and benefits so be prepared to ask lots of questions to make the right decision for you.  Best wishes.\n\n",

The syptoms were exatly like those last year when I suffered from Yersinia - bacterial infection from food poisioning. Doctor that treated me last year gave an extra prescipt for Cipro. Started that last Friday.  Seemed to be getting better. Still had pains, but were getting more bearable. Today pains were back - pains from the navel down to what would be like ovarian cramps. My lower back started feeling sore. My stomach is bloated a little. Low grade fever now - 99.2 (I usually am 98.0). Brief history: Hysterectomy 10 years ago due to severe endometriosis. He left both ovaries. Told me after surgery, couldn't get all of endemetriosis because there was some on my rectal tube. Two years ago, I was diagnosed with cysts on my ovary - nothing new I seem to always get them. The two weeks prior to this cramping in intestines, I could have sworn had another cyst because the pain was the same as always. So question....what's up with all of this stuff. Ready to get back to normal. Thanks\n\n",

Early cervical cancer usually produces no signs or symptoms.  Irregular bleeding is a sign of cervical cancer, but it also is a sign of other issues.  Since your period has always been irregular there may be a medical reason for this.  I encourage you to find an OBGYN that you are comfortable with so you can discuss these issues. There are alot of young people that are hesitant to get proper care because of fear or embarassment.  Do not let these issues stand in the way of taking care of yourself.  Good Luck and let us know if we can be of further assistance. Sandy RN\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Funnyfem33,  The initial cervical biopsy may have missed the effected area.  With two abnormal pap smears and the subsequent biopsy showing mild dysplasia it seems reasonable to be a little more agressive in treatment.  The problem is that with mild dysplasia no one can say if or when the dysplasia will progress.  The concern would be that it will ultimately progress to cervical cancer.  So, I suspect your doctors are wanting to treat this aggressively to try to prevent it from becoming cancer.  As to which procedure is appropriate, I am unable to recommend one over the other.  My specific knowledge of this issue is too limited to say with confidence.  Follow up with your gynecologist is important.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I am female; just turned 60. Had total hysterectomy (inc. ovaries) at age 41 because of cervical ca.,endometriosis,fibroid tumor & ovarian cysts) Nine wks ago, I was hospitalized for 6 wks-4 of them in cardiac intensive care unit w/ pericarditis that came out of nowhere (woke up & couldn't breathe). I also was in atrial fib (which I have had for 2 yrs but take cardizem& flecanide to control) My bp was 80/50; heart rate 185. Remained that way for 5 days. Heart naturally converted to sinus rhythm on its own right before drs. did cardioversion. I did not have a pericardial tap. The fluid eventually reabsorped-was given no antibiotics, just heart meds & heparin. Had numerous blood tests for bacterial infection-all neg. Rheumatoid arthrologist tested me for lupus, arthritis, immune diseases-all neg. I was discharged on oxygen (still had pulse ox of 82 w/out it) & came home. I had a fever while in hospital of 102 but before discharge it was 99.something every day. After 4 days at home, fever back to 101 & breathing very labored. I went to ER and was told I now had pleural effusions both lungs and atelectasis both lungs-readmitted to hospital. Kept another 2 1/2 wks. Lung fluid removed-neg for Ca cells or any bacterial infection-cloudy, straw fluid w/ high inflammatory, wbc count. My blood work came back very anemic(8.5), Ca125 of 126 and C reactive protein of 156. I was given iron IV and procrit and anemia went away. Once all fluid gone from rt lung and most gone from left-I was discharged. fever was gone. Still no diag. other than some virus probably??? Have been home 3 wks now and for last 5 days, fever is back but not constant. goes from 99.4-101, usually at night, not during the day (although sometimes daytime too, but some days, no fever at all) Feel much better on days I don't have fever but still have pleurisy pain only recently (in conjunction with the return of the fever), the pain is worse. It started left front (which was the worse lung) under breast and now is on right side worse than left. Hurts even on shallow inspiration. I had mammogram last wk that was neg-slightly enlged lymph node under rt arm pit.Slightly enlged mediastinal lymp nodes on chest x-rays.CT scans done in hospital showed nodules on thyroid, liver cyst, complex splenic cyst and slight splenomegaly, adrenal adenoma. I went to endocrinologist who feels nothing need be done about adrenal adenoma or thyroid. I am constipated and & have had bowel changes but could be due to hospitalization. I just don't feel good and don't know where to turn-afraid to even complain because I don't want to be back in hospital again.four days ago, had follow-up exam w/ internist who I did tell about fever and pain. She did EKG & compared it to copy of last hospital EKG-she said it was abnormal and thought maybe I was getting pericarditis again but ultrasound done that day showed no fluid. Any thoughts??\n\n",

You may want to see your rheumatologist again and be re-evaluated for this.  Sometimes the antibody tests do not become positive for a little while.  In reviewing the literature some I found that things such as pleural effusions can cause an elevated CA-125.  It may be that your level is elevated due to the pericarditis or pleural effusions.  With your history of gynecological issues it may still be a wise idea to talk with your oncologist and see if anything should be pursued from this standpoint.  Best wishes.\n\n",

With most vaccines it takes about 4-6 weeks to get a good immune response from the IgG antibodies that give lasting immunity.  I would not expect this vaccine to be different.  The Gardasil vaccine has been approved for girls aged 9-26.  The CDC has a good page summarizing all the available research and recommendations for the vaccine found here for those interested.  The vaccine is very effective.  In one study it was 100T effective at preventing cervical cancer.  I would recommend your daughter receive the vaccine; however, it is important that you are comfortable with it.  She is very unlikely to acquire HPV in the upcoming years and the vaccine can be given then if you choose.  Best wishes.\n\n",

My lower back is now starting to hurt/burn on and off.  Used to have diarhea and now constipated.  Saw Gastro doctor 2 weeks ago for pain and he advised to take 3 advil and use heating pad.  It worked for a while but now it is back.  I went to GYN today and had a pelvic ultrasound which they said all was normal.  I am not sure what is going on.  Feel like I am losing my mind.  Family history with diabetes.  Have had kidney stones in the past and had surgery but this doesn't feel the same\n\n",

    "content": "I think this posting would be better in a different forum because it is not likely cervical cancer.  The first thing that comes to my mind is irritable bowel syndrome.  This can cause symptoms you describe.  Of course many other conditions could as well.  I would advise you to continue to follow up with your doctor until you find a satisfactory answer.  It looks like you have done well getting the pelvic ultrasound to rule out related issues.  But, stay with it until you find relief.  Perhaps start with your gastroenterologist to inform him/her of your gynecological exam findings and to inform that the pain relief measures were only temporary.  Do you get any relief with anti-gas or acid relieving medication such as simethicone (Gas-X for example) or Mylanta liquid?  Good luck with this and please let us know what you learn.\n\n",

Be sure to use plenty of lubrication as this will decrease friction and should help with pain.  Also, anxiety contributes to muscle spasms so try to relax as much as you can.    If these things don't help I would recommend that you see your gynecologist for an examination to be sure there is nothing else that may be causing your pain.

    "title": "LSIL etc. Please advise",
    "content": "For nearly 2 years I have had pelvic pain during menstrual cycles and when not menstruating. I saw a gynecologist in early 2004 when I suddenly stopped menstruating (I am 30yrs old, have had reg. cycles since starting at age 9) for many months. I was given medication to being my cycle, then bled for 28 days and was given meds to stop my cycle. Some concern existed that my increasing weight (obese) could be causing hormone imbalances etc and affecting my cycle. In July 2004 I underwent gastric bypass surgery (Roux-n-y) and gall bladder removal. I had normal cycles from July 2004-January 2005 (while taking birth control pills). Still I had consistent pelvic pain even when no menstruating. In February 2005 when I once again missed a period I learned that I was pregnant. My new 1ounce stomache was not absorbing the birth control pill properly. I was in rapid weight loss stage and deep in a state of ketosis and it was deemed far too dangerous to carry on with the pregnancy and I had no ch oice but to terminate the pregnancy in February 2005. I had a normal cycle in March and April 2005, although the pelvic pain persisted. I also began getting vaginal discharge and spotting in between cycles. Discharge was often thick and mucousy (as with discharge during ovulation) however had a period of time where it was thick, sticky and black in appearance. By April 2005 I began bleeding heavily, huge clots (dozens daily), extended cycles (2-3 weeks), followed by mild spotting for a few days, perhaps a day or two of no blood and then back to the heavy bleeding/clots etc. I underwent a endoscopy/biopsy/d&c along with cervical cauterization (for severe erosion). I was told before surgery I had a \"nabothian cyst\" however on exam after surgery by another doctor, this \"lesion\" is still there. (I thought that since nabothian cysts were mucuos/puss filled that by cauterizing the area a nabothian cyst would rupture?). My endometrial biopsy showed no cancer. We have ruled out PCOS, I have no ovarian cysts or polyps etc. The lab reports suggest \"possible Anovulation\". (Is that not just a term given for problematic bleeding? Is it not usually secondary to something else which would be the main cause?). A few weeks after the surgery I also had a PAP come back with LSIL. I am still abnormally bleeding and unable to take birth control pills due to malabsorption. I cannot take Depo shots as I have negative side effects from it. So I am bleeding awfully and in pain the majority of the time. I am told I must wait 3 months for a repeat PAP test before anything else will be considered. I am questioning my doctors decision to go ahead and wait 3 months for further investigation. Based soley on one test result of LSIL I can see it is normal protocol. However throwing in the pain, abnormal bleeding (hormone levels testing fine btw), cervical erosion, and doubts (well MY doubts) that this \"nabothian cyst\" could perhaps indeed NOT be a nabothian cyst (thus my question about cauterization eliminating this type of cyst), would it not be more sensible to go ahead with a colposcopy or some such other test and bypass the 3 month wait for further PAP testing (which then takes 6-8 weeks for results)??? I should note that my mother has had several laser treatments for HSIL that persist in coming back. This was when she herself was in her 30's. Unfortunatly I have no way to know if those treatments were successful or if they came back and are cancerous now as she refuses anymore medical treatments and refuses even PAP tests.   Thank you in advance for any advice.\n\n",

    "title": "LSIL findings on PAP",
    "content": "Dear Mellycat- In your post, you indicated that you had underwent a endoscopy/biopsy/d&c along with cervical cauterization (for severe erosion). Do you know the PAP results that initiated your physician to perform this? There are two things that I would like for you to consider. First, having gone through gastric bypass surgery, it is possible that your body may not be receiving proper nutrients, and thinks it is in \"starvation mode, as evidenced be ketosis. This is one factor that may cause abnormal periods. Stress and illness may also play a a role.  Second, LSIL results on a PAP can sometimes be caused by the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV). This is the most common STD, and there are MANY strains, not all of which cause outward clinical symptoms (genital warts). Many individuals contract this virus and don't even know it! According to clinical studies, this is the cause in approximately 80-95% of abnormal PAP smears.  It is very important to continue the cycle of repeat PAP's every three months. Although at times LSIL will regress without treatment, at times it can also progress to HSIL (High Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion).  Cervical cancer is said to be one of the slowest growing cancers, but that is not always the case.  If by some chance you need to have a LEEP or LASER ssurgery again, the cervix will need time to heal before another PAP is performed, otherwise you may get abnormal results due to still being in the healing process.  I hope this helps, and good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I had my daughter 1 year ago and when I went in for my 6 week check my pap came back saying I had moderate dysplasia. I then went in for a colposcopy and it came back mild. Since then I had another colp. and the colp as well as the biopsy came back mild. I was suppose to go back in June but there so busy they couldn't get me in until late August. We had decided that we wanted to have another baby close together. My doctor said if we can wait until August but if not he said that this should not stop us. That I could be a woman that fluctuates with it not progressing. My concern is that I wanted to become pregnant so bad and now that I am 2months I am having doubts and am scared to death of this affecting my baby or me. Is this normal? Should i be worried? Please give me some advise that might make me calm down. Thanks Scared and concerned\n\n",

    "content": "i'll spare you all the details, but basically my obgyn called me today and told me that my pap smear was abnormal and that i was \"in stage 1\". i know that stage 1means stage 1 of cervical cancer because i had problems when i was 15 (i'm 33 now), but i didn't know that this could be determined from a pap smear alone. i had the pap smear in september 2005, and haven't been back to the dr since, so they haven't done any other examinations or a biopsy.  i'm going to go see another dr as soon as i can (not going back to this particular dr because it was very upsetting that she waited 5 months to tell me this!), but i was wondering if it can be determined that i'm at stage 1 of cervical cancer from a pap smear alone? and, if i have been in stage 1 since september, does this mean that i have progressed beyond that by now?  thanks for your time!\n\n",

I had an abnormal pap last year, and they called me in  first for a second pap to make sure the test was correct, then, they did a colposcopy to see how bad the cells were, then they scheduled the surgery to remove and biopsy the bad cells.  The colposcopy told the doctors how bad and how much of my cervix was affected. A pap test cannot tell them that, although, im not sure if a pap smear could tell the doctors how bad it is, or what stage, but I guess it is possible.\n\n",
