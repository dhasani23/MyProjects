    "title": "Odd sensation in my left calf?",
    "content": "I recently started getting these odd sensations in my left calf muscle (although I can't be certain it's IN the muscle). It started off feeling like a very mild charlie-horse that would come and go. Putting weight on it didn't seem to effect it much, if anything, it made it feel a little better. I was concerned about a blood clot, so I had an ultrasound done on it a week ago, and it came back clear - no blood clots present. Again, it's still coming and going, but now it's more of a weird burning/cold sensation, coming and going in waves with an odd pain every now and then, it's generally achy as well. I'm keeping an eye on it, no swelling, no discoloration, both legs look exactly the same,( my right leg is perfectly fine) both legs are the same temperature to the touch, no red or hot spots. I've heard that ultrasounds are extremely accurate with finding clots, so I'm probably just being paranoid, is this true?   Also, my history includes Paget-Schroetter Syndrome in 2005, but my Vascular doctor said that once the rib is taken out and the vein is decompressed (which was all done in 2005) I wouldn't have any more problems outside of that incident, I don't have any clotting or blood diseases.  Any idea what this could be? It's making me nervous. :(  Thanks so much, -Jen\n\n",

    "content": "Hi  Jen,  The thing you're describing seems to be reported more and more often lately, possibly because of the deserved attention focused on DVTs and their possible consequences. The other causes are far less threatening, but also often very difficult to diagnose. There are things that might be ruled out or in, though, which could help explain this problem, since it seems very unlikely you have a clot or clots in the leg. (However, ultrasound, while a very good diagnostic tool, isn't always the gold standard, but given the history you've presented I'm sure this finding is correct). This also should not have anything to do with  Paget-Schroetter, and if you've had the first or cervical rib removed and decompression successfully done, that separate issue should be fine now.   The question then remains what is going on? There seem to be three possibilities left: a mild compartment syndrome, something often overlooked except in athletes (generally a sports medicine issue); referred sciatica due to low back nerve compression; or possibly idiopathic deep vein varicosity (very unlikely, but your vascular surgeon could rule this in or out via another ultrasound).   This really doesn't sound much like DVT at this point, but the gold standard for diagnosis would be venogram of the affected leg, a rather invasive and potentially aggravating procedure. Since you already have a relationship with a competent vascular surgeon, perhaps he should perform an utrasound of the affected calf to rule out any vascular problem, although at this point it seems very unlikely anyway. You might want to see a sports medicine specialist of neurologist if the discomfort persists, to rule out sciatica and compartment syndrome, though.  I hope this is helpful. Please follow up with  us here as needed and especially if anything new develops. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi John!  Thank you so much for your reply. My number one concern was a clot, since they can be so dangerous, and because I really DO NOT want to go through what I did for the Paget- Schroetter. :) The vascular surgeon that treated me for that was in Delaware (I'm in MS now) and he's also retired. The other hurdle is that I'm currently unemployed and without medical insurance. The ultrasound I got was over 600 dollars and I'm still paying that off.  So right now, another ultrasound isn't an option. Since my original post my leg has gotten somewhat better, there isn't really any pain (the original pain was almost muted enough to call it discomfort and not really pain) and the tingly feeling is gone. Now all that's left is some odd pulsing in my leg every now and then, almost like a deeper muscle spasm. It happens quite frequently, and it painless like any other random muscle spasm or pulse. I weight train and practice martial arts 3-4 times a week, so it's possible that I did some sort of damage to the muscle by over using it. Heat seems to help, and I have some anti-inflammatory perscription from a pinched nerve I recently had in my arm. Would this be sufficient treatment for now until or unless my symptoms get worse? Again, thank you so much for your help, you're providing such a great service here and I want you to know how much it's appreciated. :)  -Jen\n\n",

    "content": "Hi again, John,  A quick update for whenever you get a chance to read this thread-  My leg hasn't really gotten better, it's pretty much stayed the same, if not gotten slightly worse. It's aching now, still spasming, too. I've been applying a heating pad to it several times a day along with massaging the calf muscle. There seems to be a tight spot in the middle of my calf, and it's sore there when I massage it, like a normal knot you would get in a muscle. There hasn't been any hot/cold sensations in awhile. Although the last time I said the symptoms were easing up they came back, so I don't want to say the hot/cold is gone for good, just hasn't happened in a while.  It seems to be mainly in the calf muscle, although other parts of my lower leg have been achey from this, including my ankle. There's also some spasming  and soreness in my hamstring now, and a little in the front upper leg, although not nearly as frequent as my calf. My lower back has been sore a few times, although I can't say it lasted very long, or that it was severe enough to be significant, so I don't know if that's relevant.  I'm really nervous because I can't seem to do anything to make it stop. I know someone with MS, so anything nerve related scares me. I don't think this sounds like MS, but I'm paranoid nonetheless.  Having read this new information do your original theories still stand? And should I be worried about MS or should I put that out of my mind? I haven't had any other symptoms of MS, no vocal problems, no speech problems, no eye pain, etc. I had a pinched nerve in my right arm about a month ago, but my doctor just told me it was a compressed Ulnar nerve, and it's completely resolved now. Thanks again for your time, I'm sorry if I'm being a pest.  -Jen\n\n",

No visible difference either.  And now when I fly on planes, my left leg is horrible for about two weeks post-flight!  Do you have problems when you fly now?  I did go in for a blood clot last summer and they saw that I had abnormal blood flow in my left groin/hip but didn't exactly find a clot.  They treated me for one though, and I'm still following up with the doc.  They did a bunch of scans and weren't concerned enough to do anything though.  Do you have veiny legs or bad circulation?  Do you ever have pain in your left arm or chest/back?  I'm still trying to find answers, and I'll et you know if I do...\n\n",

As you have not mentioned the exact location of the swelling, let me list some of the possibilities. - an organized clot (bleeding from a partially torn muscle). Initially painful, but persists after the pain is gone. - a muscle hernia (this happens when the deep fascia overlying a muscle gets torn and the muscle protrudes through the defect) - a soft tissue tumor. You should consult a doctor and obtain an opinion & refrain from ignoring it just because it is painless. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -- This is a very difficult thing to be going through. Severe head trauma often can take a long time to develop a clear clinical picture and prognosis. Often the patient will recover fully but it can take sometimes a very long time. Right now is probable that surgery is not opportune but when the time is right, if it's still necessary it may be doable. Then again it may not need to be done. Location of the hematoma is the likely problem, and when it can be drained or tapped or if it slowly dissipates on its own, all these things can play a role in the ultimate outcome, which is often quite difficult to predict and requires tremendous patience and endurance from family and friends. It's best, if possible, to arrange for everyone standing by to try and take turns. Your mother has responded to you, if only in a dull fashion so far, but this is a positive thing, a hopeful thing. A hematoma on the brain is usually just that, on the brain, not in it, causing pressure, and this pressure must be reduced, if not surgically then medically, usually with steroids. Again, this can take a lot of time. There is no \"average\" recovery period.  This will be very stressful for you and the others. Support each other even as you're supporting your mother. Stay positive and be prepared for anything -- but especially a long haul. Meanwhile please keep us updated and bring us any additional questions you may have. Good luck to you. We'll be holding good thoughts.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: pain in back of left leg",
    "content": "Hi, As you clearly indicate that the pain is at the back of the knee (and not the calf),it makes it less likely to be due to a deep venous thrombosis.   Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) sometimes occurs in the calf veins(the veins in the soleus muscle - the 'soleus venous plexus').This can present with pain and swelling in the calf.  The other condition that resembles DVT is 'cellulitis' of the lower limb (usually bacterial - 'streptococcal').Again, the pain may be diffuse and not localised to the back of the knee.  'Baker's cyst' (or popliteal cyst) is usually associated with arthritic conditions of the knee joint and can present with pain in the back of the knee.At times, it even communicates with the knee joint itself. It is known to rupture sometimes and then it may present with acute pain in the calf(resembling a DVT).  Ofcourse, the pain could have been a 'Strain' or a ''sprain'(which seems to be most likely in your case).  However, it may be wise to consult your doctor who, after examining you, would be in a bettter position to guide you. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Contraceptive pills as well as injectable contraceptives generally induce an 'hypercoagulable' state rather than to cause bleeding.  Therefore,one has to think of other possibilities.One can perhaps start with a suspicion of 'cystitis' or a UTI, both of which are fairly common in young women.  here is one entity that needs a special mention...   'Hemorrhagic cystitis', a condition mostly caused by certain interventions such as radiation, cancer chemotherapy, certain viruses and occasionally 'chemical induced'.  Certain chemicals and medications(including contraceptive suppositories) which are inserted intravaginally, may be misplaced into the urethra or manage to enter the urethra accidentally and cause this condition.  So, you perhaps need a routine urinalysis followed by a culture of your urine.These will help to prove or exclude a UTI. If in case you have any freshly raised suspicion of a 'Hemorrhagic cystitis', please address your concern to your doctor.  Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -- While this sounds more like a nerve compression problem than a potential clot (because of the numbness you describe), should it continue or if there is any pain or swelling or any sort of lump or knot palpable behind the knee -- or if you're simply not convinced or this doesn't go away shortly, you should be seen to rule out a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) via simple ultrasound, which only takes a few minutes. If this is ruled out and/or if the numbness and stiffness continue, something else is wrong and would require some sort of medical attention. It would likely be sciatica in that case, but that can be pretty painful or at least disabling. Main thing you want to do, though, is rule out DVT, even if it seems unlikely. If you should have the ultrasound done, by all means insist on a D-dimer blood test along with it, to cover all the bases and rule this out once and for all. It really doesn't sound like DVT at this point, but there's no point in not ruling it out.  Hope this helps. Good luck to you. Please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

Daily climbing is anywhere between 1200 to 4000 feet per day. I know excercise is not the issue. Both doctors implied it could be lack of protien and his body is getting beat up by over excercising. The last doctor told him to take a break from working or his body could possible shut down. He has been out of town for 3 weeks now and I expect him back tomorrow. I am not satisfied with what exactly he needs to do. I really just want advice on which type of doctor I should take him to here locally?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Blood Clot or Blood Pocket?",
    "content": "Hello -- The lesion you describe is consistent with the type of climbing your son does and with coming into rough contact with hard surfaces. This alone could cause a hematoma (significant bruise or \"blood pocket\") or even a superficial clot, since the area is one likely to be struck against surfaces while climbing. So long as the area affected does not enlarge nor discolor beyond the immediate area (which could indicate cellulitis, infection of a bruised area, usually in the leg) it will likely go away on its own. If it is extremely painful it needs attention and if it's a hematoma -- blood pocket -- in the compartment of the muscle near the knee, it may even need to be drained by needle aspiration, which could relieve discomfort. Any general practioner should be able to determine what this is and treat it or refer accordingly, it shouldn't be too complicated a problem. That two doctors have given vague diagnoses and not attempted to treat it either means there is nothing serious going on or perhaps your son hasn't had time, which his very busy schedule, to take off to follow up with a doctor?  As for the long hours and the potential for your son's body to \"shut down\", this all is very vague, since so long as he tolerates the exercise and work well, rests adequately, isn't losing weight nor having any other serious symptoms, he is probably fine. It is a remarkable schedule, but so long as he feels he has to do this (or enjoys it a great deal) and the discolored lump on his leg is his only complaint, he should be fine. Routine blood work should have been done by at least one of the doctors, which would show any signs of chronic systemic problems, but otherwise he sounds fit, healthy, is young and obviously strong, so unless there is something more to add, it seems like a fairly minimal problem.  I hope this helps. Good luck to you and to your son. Please follow up with us here as necessary.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: DVT after hemorrhagic stroke",
    "content": "Anticoagulants would be extremely dangerous, but often are not given for DVT anyway. The ideal would be to implant a filter to keep any moving clots from reaching the lungs. It's sometimes difficult to deal with a doctor who is close to the family or the patient, as they sometimes have difficulty separating personal feelings from what's best for the patient. It's a dilemma for sure, but perhaps he wouldn't mind having a vascular specialist in on a consult, which would be appropriate anyway. The filter is probably the only way to insure no clots will move from the affected leg up to the lungs, and is a fairly simple surgery to install. It can be removed later or left indefinitely in place.   Some doctors feel that beyond a certain age such therapies are not justified, but I would disagree quite vigorously on that point, at least using age alone as criterion for witholding potentially life-saving therapy. Prognosis without the filter would be about 50/50. With the filter your grandmother might well manage well for a good while. Much depends upon weighing the quality of her life. If she's otherwise comfortable and enjoying life and interaction with others then that should be sufficiently high quality to justify the simple filter.   I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you all with this difficult issue. Please stay in touch with us here.\n\n",

    "content": "For the past week, I've had shortness of breath.  2 weeks ago, my obgyn sent me for a doppler of my leg, it was negative.  I went to a walk in yesterday because of the shortness of breath, tightness in my chest and the feeling as though I had to cough something up... but, couldn't expel any mucus.  The doctor did a chest x-ray, dopper (both he said were fine) and blood work.  They couldn't get a vein on me (after 6 tries).  Finally, a pediatric nurse got a tiny vein in my arm with a tiny, butterfly.  They got 1 vile of blood and then the vein blew.  They only had enough to do the d dimer.  I am healthy, meaning I've had a complete physical and a stress test with echo.  Perfect according to my primary.  I am on birth control.  I am 33 (34 this month).  I am active.  5'5\", 121 lbs. Because of a family history of clotting, I was tested for hyper coagulation- negative.  Here are my questions...  1. They said the d dimer was slightly elevated 0.45 (normal being 0.1- 0.39). What causes slight elevation?  2.  Is a chest xray an accurate enough test in ruling out a PE?  3.  Can the trauma to my arm and the difficulty getting my blood really cause damage to the blood cells causing the slight elevation?  4.  The doctor said it sounds like I have inflammation in my lungs. according to the doctor, the Albuterol treatment they game me reduced he inflammation. How can you hear reduced inflammation?  Seems odd.    5.  Do you think I should go somewhere else for a second opinion?    6.  Can birth control cause an elevation in the d dimer?  If so, why and should I consider going off the pill due to this result?  I feel as though I got the blow off and that they didn't address my questions about the cause of a \"slightly elevated d dimer\" seriously.    I just want to make sure I'm safe.  I feel as though I got a complete blow off...  Thank you!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi elle827, A D-Dimer can become elevated in conditions such as trauma, fever, infection, surgery, blood clots and malignancies. So in answer to your first question many conditions may cause elevations in this lab study. This diagnostic study alone can't identify if there is a DVT or PE and is used in conjuction with other studies to identify anomolies. An ultrasound of the legs will identify a DVT in the area but the typical diagnostic studies used to identify a PE is with a CT scan or VQ scan. If these diagnostic studies have not been completed then I would suggest (particularly if you are still experiencing unusual symptoms) that you inquire about having them completed. I hope this has been somewhat helpful. Best wishes! Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

I went to the doctor earlier this week and she said that I might have a blood clot and I think she mentioned CST. I did some reading on CST and its symptoms. I've been having some big pimples lately and just a a couple weeks ago I had a fever. I was also spitting blood some days before having the fever. My vision seems normal.

    "content": "Hello --  While it doesn't sound as though you have any symptoms of acute CST, your doctor must have had some reason for mentioning it, although the mention may have been cautionary rather than suggestive. You would normally have a lot of problems around the eye on the affected side as well as numerous other problems, and it doesn't sound like that's going on.  That being said, yes, CST is quite serious, and the popping of zits is a potentially very dangerous practice, especially when the pimple is located within the \"deadly  triangle\", the area formed by drawing imaginary lines from the top of the bridge of your nose down each side to the corners of your mouth. The upper lip is considred the bottom line of the triangle. This is the area from which most blood and lymph is drained through the cavernous sinus. It is also an area which can lead to self-infection with meningitis if not CST, something else that has very clear symptomology. It doesn't sound like you've suffered either problem, but at least you've learned of the potential dangers association with pimple popping, allowing teeth to become abcessed, and, yes, even (and maybe especially) pulling out nostril hairs, something men are more likely to do. Any of these things can potentially lead to either meningitis or CST, but it is not a certain sequal to any of these, and most people do not actually suffer one of these life-threatening infections. Still, it's not worth the risk, either, so consider it a useful lesson. If your fever continues you should of course be cultured for bacterial infection and treated with antibiotics if needed, but coughing up blood is pretty common with deep sinus infections (not CST specifically, but the paranasal and ethmoid sinuses that give most people fits a at some time or another). Hopefully by now you're feeling better. If you still have any questions you probably should ask your doctor exactly what she meant. I suspect it was more a warning than a finding, as you'd be seriously ill by now.  Good luck to you. Please follow up with us here as necessary.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello. I am a 48 year old female, with CREST and thyroid disease, recently hospitalized for bilateral PEs and bilateral DVTs. My symptoms at the time were primarily shortness of breath, with some chest discomfort.  CT scan w/contrast confirmed PEs, and also indicated a mass in the lower left lung.  Bronchoscopy performed, and ruled out tumors or other malignancy. Will follow up in 2 months with CT.  I have been on Coumadin 5 mg. therapy since being released from hospital.   I had an episode this past week, with shortness of breath (not as significant as when hospitalized), dizziness, and sharp pain in my upper right chest area.  I went to ER, and had x-ray and CT w/contrast.  I was advised that no clots were evident in my lungs, heart not under any strain, and INR was 3.9. My INR was 6.0 the day before, when I went to coumadin clinic for first time. Was advised to stop coumadin for 2 days, then 1/2 tab for 2 days and will follow up tomorrow.   My concern now is that I am still having shortness of breath, with any kind of activity, even just getting up from sitting position.  This is worse than when I went to ER 3 days ago, but not the gasping type when I was initially hospitalized. I also have a feeling in my chest of ... chest swelling, best I can describe it.  Its not painful, but really uncomfortable, and my heart seems to beat harder when this is happening.   Is this normal as a result of prior PEs? or could I possibly be having an anxiety attack, which I've never had before, but I am really nervous about this whole thing? or is it possible thats its related to my auto-immune disease, with inflammation in the lining of blood vessels, which I've been advised can happen?    I don't know when to be concerned anymore, and I can't keep going to the ER on a daily basis.   I thank you in advance for any advice, insight, reassurance you can provide.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  Neither the chest x-ray nor CT are definitive for PE, and since you have remarkable history including bilat., as well as dyspnea as cardinal symptom, and are now having dyspnea on even mild exertion, I feel it imperative that you have a VQ lung scan performed to be certain there is no clot present. While it is, of course, possible your symptom is due to anxiety, it is unlikely (especially since it is brought on by any sort of exertion). To have a patient in a clinical setting who has a concrete history like yours, describing the symptoms you describe, a CT w/contrast may have been expedient, but the problem has not resolved, the history is undeniable, and the test was not definitive. I can't imagine sending you home without a firm diagnosis and rule out/rule in.   Something is causing your symptoms,  and I really don't believe it's anxiety, although you're probably feeling some of that right now anyway.

    "content": "Thank you, John, for your recommendation.  I will be seeing pulmonary doc next week and will discuss with him.  In the meantime, I thought I'd give you some updates.    In my last post, I failed to mention that I had recently been placed on blood pressure medication.  My bp's were borderline, and not consistently so, but PCP recommended I try medication.  I was started on Amlodipine 5 mg. and at the time of the ER visit, had been on it for about 2 weeks.  A few days later, I wondered if maybe there were side effects with that medication, and after some 'net searching, I did indeed find that side effects were pretty much like my symptoms...dizziness, shortness of breath, racing heart.  So I quit taking it, and I do feel much better.  My bp does not seem to be affected by this, and has been in the 120's over 70's range..pretty normal.    My ongoing issue is still the shortness of breath.  Today, I had an echocardiogram to rule out heart damage from the PEs and also a mammogram.  This was performed mostly because on the most recent CT, it was noted that \"occasional nodes are seen in the axilla bilaterally\" and my PCP was concerned about that statement.    Also, the mass that was present initially, is still present.  The final impression is \"Persistent mass in the right lower lobe similar to previous study with extensive right hilar and mediastinal adenopathy.  The possibility of a neoplastic process should be considered\".  That said, it was also noted that there was no significant change from the first finding three weeks prior.  This mass is 4.1 x 2.2 cm. with irregular contours and is pleural based.   This also has my PCP (and myself, I have to say!) quite concerned, and she suggested that I request tissue sampling, as she didn't think that bronchoscopy would be sufficient for a pleural based mass.  I will discuss this also with pulmonary doc.    So there you have it...basically, working on my deductible and trying to keep breathing while I'm at it!    I welcome any other suggestions, recommendations, insights you might have.    Thanks again.\n\n",

I'm glad you were able to discontinue it, feel better, and still maintain normal blood pressure. That's all good.  The CT finding, however, is obviously a concern. The nodes are, very likely, \"persistent\" because they are calcifying, possibly residue from the previous PEs. This often happens.   It's that pleural mass that's the most troubling thing right now (and of course the nodes could be related to that, as well, but I'm thinking that a chronological reading of events would make them more likely PE-related). It does need to be identified, and I'd concur that if it is a pleural mass a bronchoscopy (and, for that matter, a VQ scan) wouldn't yield much information, especially for the aggravation either would cause. A tissue sample of pleural space tissues might well be done via needle aspiration, which would be the least invasive and probably simplest approach, if the location is amenable. The fact that there is associated adenopathy (swollen lymph nodes) suggests nothing specific except that there's a process going on rather than this just being an inert lump. Could be neoplastic, could be cystic. That it hasn't grown is very encouraging.   There's a lot of history in your lungs, so this mass may well be some sort of oddball thing and I notice the careful choice of \"neoplasm\" instead of some more alarming word. This is good, because with a history of multiple PEs there's always the possibility of random odd things turning up that aren't malignant. Whatever it is, however, it's important to ID it soon as possible, especially since something is causing your shortness of breath. Now that the other symptoms have been resolved by elimination of a seemingly unneeded medication, the focus is much narrower, and the mass, whatever it is, has to be suspect. I'm thinking this could even be some sort of adhesion or undifferentiated tissue which, if pleural, could well impede normal breathing. It would need correction, but if this is the case it would be a lot less worrisome. The sooner you can know just what's going on down in there, the sooner you can relax -- regardless of what it is. It's the uncertainty that couses the greatest stress. Once we know what we're dealing with, our concentration is often remarkably concentrated and less scattered and anxious.  I'm of course hoping for a best-case scenario. I hope a tissue sample can be obtained ASAP, so you can know what to expect next.   Thanks for this update and the additional info regarding the BP med. Please keep us updated. Do your best to manage any anxiety over this (that will make breathing a little easier) and let us know what you find out.  Take care. My very best to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello John!    Hope all is well with you.  So I thought I would give you some additional updates, and once again, ask your advice, recommendations, insights.  I saw pulm. doc last week.  He was still not greatly concerned about the mass, thinking it more clot related, possibly an infarction, and thought in fact that it was getting smaller.  But he was concerned about the ongoing lymphadenopathy.  He referred me to a thoracic surgeon for consult re mediastinal biopsy.   I met with thoracic surgeon yesterday, and we reviewed my history.  As the story kept going, I could see that I really had his interest what with the initial episode, the CREST, the family history (sister with clots), the numerous long distance trips.  Its funny how quickly a person becomes 'complicated'. Anyway, he reviewed my scans and hospital records, and in the end, he agreed that a biopsy of the lymph nodes was appropriate.  He advised that he felt the lymph nodes would give a better picture than the mass, as they would be able to tell if there were infection, malignancy, or CREST related.  He thought that if the mass was indeed an infarction, it would not return with anything, and would probably still have to sample a lymph node.  So after some discussion, I have agreed to have this procedure done, and will have it performed on 11-March.   In the meantime, the shortness of breath has gotten much better on its own.  But now I am having issues with the DVTs in my legs!  I think I said in my first submission that I had bilat DVTs along with bilat PEs.  I began having pain and discomfort in my legs about 6 days ago.  I went to the ER 4 days ago, and the ER doc felt that indeed I was having DVTs.  I had red streaking and pain on one leg, and pain behind the calf on the other leg.  Both were swollen.  He scheduled me for a doppler US, which I had done 2 days ago.  I met with my PCP and she reviewed the report, and to no one's surprise, the DVTs are present.  She wasn't able to compare with the initial scan that was done when I was hospitalized, but the thoracic surgeon was able to do so.  He felt that these were the same DVTs as my initial episode and said they would take months to resolve most likely.  They are below the knee, and in posterior tibial veins bilat, with additional finding of one in the l. saph. vein in the right leg. All fine and dandy.  Except for the pain!    My left leg especially is bothering me.  I have burning/itching type of pain along my left ankle, and its really red in that spot.  I have redness and tenderness further up along my left calf.  And both feet are really tender and painful to walk on.  My left ankle is nice and swollen.  I have been advised by all docs that its ok to be up and about, just 'gentle movement' and tylenol for pain.  But how long will this last?  And I forgot to ask docs, why would my legs bother me now...two months after the initial episode?  And did I do something to bring this on?  Also, I realize that I have to be aware of chest pain and SOB.  I do have intermittent pains in my chest.  Nothing constant or consistent even.  Whenever I feel a pain, I take a deep breath and I figure if it doesn't hurt and I am able to do it, then shouldn't be a PE.  Right? I just don't know when to be concerned about chest pain, and I know that I am more tuned in to pain I have, and its beginning to get confusing!  I have pain everyday with the CREST, and mostly, I ignore it, unless its really in my face, but to have to pay attention....grrrrrr!   As always, I appreciate your input, recommendations, insights.  Other than all the above, life is good here in the Land of Enchantment!  Weather is awesome right now. Beautiful sunrises.    Thanks for your help!\n\n",

    "content": "\"Complicated\" can be a good thing as well, you know. :)  Boy, never a dull moment. The reasoning re: the lymph node biopsy vs. pleural mass is really sound. That makes perfect sense. With the, well, complicated history I wouldn't even hazard a guess as to what that might turn up, but feel malignancy would be pretty far down my list. I'll be anxious, though, to learn what it does show.  As for those ongoing (and acting up) DVTs, this happens. It really does. And it's very difficult to say how long they'll actually be there. The flare up of symptoms, the pain in particular, is probably due to a prone-ness to inflammatory processes, what with CREST and all that. The body generally doesn't like that sort of thing anyway, but with a tendency toward inflammation this may be exciting the autoimmune response, which will probably come and go til the thrombi are completely gone or have lost all their biological properties at least.   Since you already have experienced PEs from this problem it is important to try and be aware of chest pain, although since the breathing problem resolved without ever tipping its hand, and since we all really do have some random pains from time to time, it's probably going to have to be a fairly \"in your face\" sensation that gets the serious attention; otherwise you'll drive yourself crazy. It really is complicated, and I feel really bad about that, because it's enough to have to deal with what's known already, without listening for some Other Shoe to drop. That \"take a deep breath\" test should be a good rule to go by, and maybe it can become almost second-nature so it doesn't take up so much of your conscious attention.   Make the most of those beautiful sunrises! Spring's just around the corner here, and I'm sure all this will begin to resolve (if somewhat slowly) before long. That really is \"the land of enchantment\" by the way. I've seen a lot of beautiful places, but parts of NM just have some sort of almost mystical beauty. Maybe that's why, despite all the physical woes, you continue to maintain a great attitude. Whatever the reason, do your best to keep that switched on. It really does help.   I'll be looking forward to an update post biopsy, but please feel free to follow up here at any time.   My best, John\n\n",

    "content": "John!  Hope all is well with you.    I am 2 days away from this mediastinal biopsy, and I have to tell you, I am getting scared.  Not really so much by what the findings will be, but just for having this procedure done.  Afraid of being under anesthesia...what if I don't wake up?  Afraid of bleeding issues...what if I have an internal bleed?  That kind of thing.    I have decided that I really do not want this problem!  I don't want PEs or DVTs or CREST.  I am really ready to be done. So I'm believing in miracles and hoping for one of my own.  I wanted to tell you that the results of the echo show mild pulmonary hypertension.  Pressure in the right side was 48 mm hg. This I imagine will be a mystery as to why it developed, since it could be from PEs or from CREST.  Either way, I wonder if this is the cause of the shortness of breath.  And if its normal for it to come and go.   I haven't had a chance to discuss this with my PCP yet, but will ask the thoracic guy about it on Weds.  And of course, asking your opinion!    My legs......well.  In some ways they are much much better.  But since yesterday, my calves have been tight and crampy.  As if I had done too much exercise and strained them.  I haven't.  Presuming this is still from DVTs, and I guess I have to believe that they're nothing new.  Just in retrospect, before I was dx'd with PEs, I did have some tight crampy calf pain that I just presumed was from walking up and down steps.    Today, I am having sharp pains in my chest.  At one point, the pain even radiated to my jaw.  Really felt more like a spasm of some sort, and I was able to take a deep breath with no problem.  Thinking I am having some esophogeal spasms.  I believe nerves are the issue.    I'm just scared of myself, John.  I'm pretty sure thats normal.  And as the time gets closer to having to go to the hospital, its just getting a little worse.  I have never had any problems with anesthesia before, so no reason to really believe that I will now, but I wish I didn't have to do it.  And I know its my choice, and if I really didn't want to, I don't have to.  But I need to finish this part of the story, so I'm gonna do it regardless of myself.   Thank you in advance for letting me vent.  You have been so very helpful and I appreciate it very much.  Perhaps my problem is in part, due to the moon.  I have always thought of myself as a 'lunar chick' and its just about full!    I will let you know what happens post biopsy.  Again, thank you so much!!  Kathy\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Kathy,  I was just notified of your latest post, and if I do the math right, I suspect today's the day of the procedure, so a lot of what I say will probably be moot by the time you read this, but still -- I want to say a few things.   First, of course, the overriding issue, which is fear of the procedure, fear of something going wrong, fear of having no control, fear of yourself, even. It's all more than normal: it's natural as well. For all the easy advice dispensed by clinical people, we each are generally afraid of all these things, which is why (and this should sound really weird, but think about it) I have always favored emergency surgeries -- for me, not for anyone else -- simply because when there's no time to think about what could happen, and when things are already bad enough to warrant quick action, well, that's where I function best on either side of the fence. The only time I've ever had elective surgery was when I was little, to have my tonsils out, and had to wait around for a few hours and almost went crazy. The other, much later, much bigger stuff? Pretty much like when the bells ring in a fire house. You just go with it. So I can really feel for you regarding the anticipation. I don't know how some people manage so well with that. But then it's done, it's behind you, and it's amazing how quickly we move beyond that and back to why we had it done. Not without some soreness, of course. Biopsies probably carry the lowest rate of complications, and the anesthesia will probably be something \"light\" anyway. So many of them aren't true anesthesias anymore like those used in major surgical procedures. But you'll have done all that by now most likely, so I will be eager to hear your account of it all, and most of all to learn what the doctors find out.   And of course you're ready to be done with all this. Who wants that? You've been extremely good through all this and I think no matter what the findings, your attitude is going to probably cause you to enjoy a better prognosis than someone who holds it all in or someone who feels inordinate and irrational fears. You've done neither, near as I can tell. Sometimes \"normal\" is good, too. Usually it is.   You're very welcome. Venting is a big part of the process and hopefully this has been helpful to you. I'll be here, waiting to hear all about how it went and what you learned. \"Lunar chick.\" There could be something to that. The timing couldn't have been much more, well, lunar. :)  My best to you. Be well.  John\n\n",

    "content": "hallo, john!  so i survived the biopsy, and all went well.  i have this lovely incision on my neck that is healing really quickly.  had a lot of bruising the first couple of days, but its almost all gone now.  not too much discomfort, all in all.    i asked the doc if he saw anything black or nasty, and he said \"i didn't see anything that made me say Oh Wow or made me panic\" so i'm taking that as a positive statement!  i will see him again on the 27th, and expect to have results that day.  he seems to think that this will be auto-immune related.  and i have to say, while i'm glad (and thinking positively about this) that there wasn't any obvious malignancy, relating it to the auto-immune disease is just as scary.  but i will worry about that when i know for sure.    since the biopsy tho, i have been back to the ER twice!  once because of the discomfort in my legs.  i still have the DVTs and i had another doppler done on the 13th, which actually shows some improvement in comparison with earlier studies.  i understand that DVTs are going to cause some discomfort with their 'lasting presence' but its really odd, to me anyway, that the pain i am having is in my thighs and behind my knees.  the recent doppler indicates the DVTs are below the knee.  so i presume this is referred pain?  ER doc gave percocet and i took about 3 of those, and while they did seem to help my pain, they did a number on my brain! so i decided i didn't need them anymore.    i went to see my PCP yesterday, after talking to the surgeon's office.  i noticed  about 2 days prior, i started to have this weird little cough.  then of course, the shortness of breath seemed more pronounced again.  however, i could take a deep breath with no problem...no pain.  so i knew it wasn't a PE, but something weird was going on.    PCP ordered chest xray and EKG.  EKG came back abnormal, so she sent me back to ER for some stat testing....was hoping to avoid the ER all together, so that was a funny little jig.    anyway, ER doc repeated the EKG and compared with prior studies.  had one in dec that was pretty normal, one in jan that was abnormal, then this one that was abnormal, but not as bad as in jan.  so they drew some blood anyway to check cardiac enzymes.  fortunately, that test was perfect.  however, WBCs were up, so she decided to start on antibiotics (Zithromax) and sent me on my way.    which brings us to today, and i still have the weird little cough, but kind of feels like its breaking up, getting a little phlegmy.  i have a feeling of tenderness in my back..on the right side.  not constant.  when i take a deep breath, i feel kind of ... sore, is the only way i can describe it.  but not always.  just now and again.  so maybe i was headed from some kind of pleurisy or something.  i don't know.  back to that point where i don't know when to be worried and when not to be.    i think at this point, i'm just not gonna go to the hospital anymore.  i'm really tired of that!  totally cramping my social lifestyle!!    so there you have the latest, john.  i will let you know what i find out from bx results.  in the meantime, i appreciate any input you have regarding the leg pain and the weird little coughing stuff.    hope all is well with you.  its a beautiful day once again in the Land of Enchantment. seems spring is here to stay.  kathy\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Kathy,  So good to hear from you and to know that the news is mostly good, if indefinite, and the initial impression of the biopsy sounds promising. If I had to choose between  a malignancy and autoimmune problems I'd put my checkmark next to the latter, since it's generally a more predictable type of problem. Autoimmune diseases can be a royal pain -- sometimes worse than that -- but most often they can me managed well and be reduced to just a nuisance. Malignancies -- well, they tend to leave an emotional scar and lingering uncertainty even when they are relatively minor. But yes, one thing at a time.   I'm  glad the biopsy site is healing nicely and that you survived. :)  The subsequent thoracic infection may well be related to that, it's entirely possible, and this is something that we can only do so much to avoid. Again,  though, it is something that should be manageable and even fixable. It does sound pleuritic from the way you describe it, so it's probably somehow related.  Then there's the pain upstream from where the thrombi are located. It's entirely possible that is referred pain, since the entire length of a deep vein is innervated by one trunk line. It does make it difficult to stay clear on exactly what's happening and  what to do about it, and I empathize very much with that. I can hardly blame you for choosing to stay away from the ER, as it often is the beginning of more stuff that can just wind up going in circles. Of course that being said,  I still hope if anything truly unusual and/or disturbing surfaces, you'll go in anyway. It's a fine line, a difficult call, but you know your body and what's relatively normal better than anyone. It's one of the \"gifts\" of chronic physical problems. We get to know our somatic selves a little too well.   I'm so glad spring, which is official at last, has really arrived there. It must be beautiful. We're still having the March \"tease\" here, but it's getting nicer every day. Sunday promises to be at least in the 60s, and it should just get better from there. You have a wonderful rest of the weekend and I'll be looking forward to the next update.  My best to you, John\n\n",

    "content": "hallo John!  hope all is well with you.  myself....i am feeling pretty much like crap, thank you very much. ; }  i did not make it to abq for bx results on friday.  when i thought spring was here to stay, i thought wrong!  we had snow early that morning and traveling conditions were pretty rough so decided best to just stay home and rescheduled to tuesday.    in the meantime, and hopefully in a nutshell, my legs hurt, my feet swell, i have this nagging cough, i get short of breath with the least bit of exertion, my chest hurts now and again tho i can take a deep breath with no pain most of the time, i have fever off and on, my nose is stuffy and bloody, my shoulder hurts, i have a pain in my forearm that wasn't there a couple days ago, and waaa waaa waaa.  on it goes.   so i've been trying to give myself a good talking to, and thinking a pain pill might not be a bad idea.  took tylenol already for the fever.  done with antibiotics and not sure they did anything.  but couldn't of hurt, i think.  anyway...thanks for letting me rant for a moment.  promise not to make it a habit...or break a habit perhaps.  i wanted to ask if you have ever heard of a supplement called Nattokinase?  my father, a 78 year old mostly healthy \"don't believe in doctors\" kinda guy has been reading up on this stuff and is convinced that its exactly what i need to rid myself of the clots in my legs and will get me off the poison coumadin, tho i keep telling him i'm not a rat, so its not hurting me so much.    this stuff is used quite a bit in japan, if i'm not mistaken and is initially derived from the soybean.  doesn't appear to be many studies done on it, but i have found several websites where people are chattering about it.  some say their docs recommend, some say their docs know nothing, some see naturopath docs.  most so far seem to have positive feedback.    what is kind of starting to get my interest about it, is that it can be used in conjunction with coumadin, with appropriate follow up. supposed to break up clots within hours.  i was wondering too, if you know if coumadin can cause shortness of breath?  i honestly am at a loss for that one.  my chest appears clear but just walking to the bathroom and back is an effort.    ok...thats all the questions i have for now.  as always, i appreciate very much any input, advice, thoughts from you.    the incision in my neck has healed really remarkably quickly.  there was extensive bruising the day i came home, but its almost all gone now, and there has been no problems with that at all.    will let you know what i find out on tuesday....if nothing else, to finish the story.  thank you very much again, john.    kathy\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Kathy,  First off, I'm so sorry you're feeling so punk! That's awful Seriously, you sound like you have a classic case of The Miseries. So many possible causes for all that, and probably a combo of lingering infection and perhaps some clot-related stuff. A pain pill does sound in order, would have to be opiod because of the coumadin, but that's OK, especially if helps. Plus isn't a late cold snap and/or snow just the worst? Makes everything feel worse, I think. Amazing. But we know (look at the calendar) spring is actually here, it's just such a big tease (it always is here, so I can relate for sure).  I have heard of nattokinase, long story behind that, it's been around for centuries and the Japanese swear by it. There have been, by reason of inertia, very few \"respectable\" studies done on it here, but since a lot of doctors are starting to integrate alternative medicine into their practices, you may have some luck with this -- and it would require some oversight so long as you're on Coumadin already. I personally feel it has great potential, but of course wouldn't dare recommend blindly. Get your doctor involved and maybe this could turn out to be a happy surprise for you. Worth a shot at least.   As for Coumadin and shortness of breath, I have compiled a good deal of anecdotal evidence -- patient complaints -- that correlate with this, but no one has advanced any convincing theory as to why it might happen, so it's been dismissed. Still, there's an awful lot of people out there with a similar complaint and nothing else to hang it on. I wish someone would look into this more thoroughly because it's in such common use and I've heard this so many times. So yes, it's a possibility, but I have nothing with which to back that up.   I'll be looking forward to hearing how your appointment goes and wishing you much better health real son. Feel better! There, that should do it. :)  Take care and I'll be looking for your update.

    "content": "ah John.  thank you as always for your kind words and votes of confidence and information and advice.  it helps me so much to put things in perspective.  well, so.  i met with the thoracic surgeon today.  i am trying to contain my terror.  i don't, i can't, really, accept the diagnosis.  which is metastatic adenocarcinoma.  the doc was surprised at the diagnosis, as he really hadn't expected such from the way it all looked.  but then again, i suppose thats why they do sampling anyway.    he explained that adeno indicates a glandular type of disease, and could be esophogus, stomach, intestine, colon, breast, pancreas related.  i asked if he thought my thyroid could be the cause, as i have had some really high anti-thyroglobulin tests (over 5000) but he didn't think so.    he was very good about it, advising that the best thing would be to get to oncology as soon as possible for further testing including blood and scans to find a primary tumor, if in fact there was one.  i asked if perhaps we could have the tissue read again, and he agreed to make a phone call, but thought we should move forward in the meantime.  of course, i agreed to that, as i told him that even tho i cannot accept the diagnosis, i know its prudent to rule out or find out as much as possible about the whole thing.    i asked him about detoxing my lymphatic system, and he didn't look at me sideways or anything, but again deferred to oncologists.  i will be seen at the m.d. anderson cancer clinic in albuquerque, and he advised that they were very very good.  i, in fact, read about them online, and am pleased to note that they also have natural, spiritual, and traditional protocols for treatment.  i think i will want all of those, should it come to it.    anyway....as it turned out, they called me and asked if i would come in tomorrow and of course, i agreed.  i'm feeling like the sooner i know what to fight, the sooner the fight can begin.  i am praying hard and trying to keep the faith.  i don't feel like i'm in danger. i hope thats a good thing.  the doc said we were not going to panic.  and i think thats a good thing too.    i did tell him about the twinges and aches and the shortness of breath, which all seemed to be exacerbated by the procedure.  he seems to think those are probably related to enlarged lymph nodes.  i seemed to think they were related to the procedure, and things getting irritated.  ah well.  i suppose in the end, it doesn't really matter.    so i will keep you posted on what happens from here.  apologies for being weird tonight, but trying hard to be positive, and not scared.    thanks  again, John, for your reassurances and your advice.    kathy\n\n",

I am Kat's sister. she was so scared till the very end. She did not want to die and prayed daily for her miracle. I will forever miss my sister. Thank you for your advice and insight as she found comfort in coming to this site. She felt like she could ask her questions and verbalize her fears, unfortunately her worse fears, as well as mine, have come to pass. She breathes divinely now with no effort and no pain.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  For some reason I didn't get a notification of this last post of Kat's til just now, and am feeling just beyond anything I could possibly put into words. I feel I will likely refer to her in the first person for some time to come, because this is a spirit that nothing can kill, Kat has been and remains a powerful presence, but I realize, in the midst of very powerful feelings of denial, that we won't be hearing from her here on the forum anymore. I just wanted to express my profoundest sympathies to you and the rest of her family because there can be no doubt she will be missed terribly. If she is here (and she most certainly is) then I can't even begin to imagine the sense of loss there, where it is three-dimensional and all the time.  Thank you for your very kind post letting us know, and I, for one, share your certain knowlege that \"she breathes divinely now, with no effort and pain.\" I would only add to that also no more dread -- ever.   We meet a lot of brave souls here on this site, but I don't think any more brave - and honest -- than Kat has been during this ordeal. We are better for having known here, even in this very limited way. I feel I have lost a dear friend.   Again thank you and again my deepest and most profound sympathies.   John Kenyon\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you so very much John. Her memorial service will be held this evening 4/21 at 6pm. Her cremated remains will be taken back to a final resting place in Calif where she spent most of her adult life and where her 2 daughters continue to live. Gonna be a long day, but thankfully she's been with us the whole time. I had the privilege of getting to take care of my sister, as a mortician, it's what I do, so I could have it no other way. I tell you that because I want everyone to know what I know to be true. She IS okay. She DID get her miracle. She told me that. We were all praying for her healing and we all said we'd gladly suffer for her wellness and now we are and now she is well. Nothing has changed between my sister and I. She is as here now as she was a week ago with the exception of that poor broken body. I've discarded that for she no longer needs it. This is our faith and now we've been given the humble honor of living our faith. My sister knew her angels and tho she was fearful of the initial journey, who wouldn't be, she still laughs and jokes and fills our hearts.  Thank you again.\n\n",

It should resolve in a short time, but if it doesn't it becomes a medical-legal problem. We can address the  medical aspect here, but we do not dispense legal advice, especially of the sort you may require.   If the numbness does not resolve within a few days you'll need to see a neurologist to have this evaluated for possible trauma to a nerve. How this would be compensated does not fall within our purview. Sorry about that. Different website.   Good luck to you.\n\n",

Have this checked pronto and then please  get back with us and give us an update. Good luck to you.\n\n",

Mostly the ones in my hands but when it goes on for hours I start getting pains elsewhere. If I raise my hands then the redness starts to fade. This use to be barely noticeable but it keeps getting worse. Also get pins and needles  and sometimes painful cramps. Also weird feelings in my head, cold chills that give me goose bumps on my arms, I had about 20 within a couple of hours before at its worst. Am feelin tired pretty much all the time and always want more sleep no matter how much i get. Alcohol seems to have the same affect. If i put my hands in my pockets when i have a weird feeling in my head just for a second and take em out i can see the clear white outline of my pocket and it will take several seconds for the redness to return. After a busy day yesterday my hands were very red and patchy and you could clearly see my imprints on them. Think my knees go the same as my hands. My vision is normally affected when the symptoms get bad ranging from my normal vision to fairly blurry.  Have a doctors appointment in about 2 weeks but this thing only seems to need minutes to get bad. Should I try and arrange an earlier appointment?   And anyone guess at what the problem might be. I spend a whole heap of time on my computer , maybe I've given myself a blood clot?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Worsening circulation problems, 5 minute shop creates worryi",
    "content": "Hello --  The main symptom you describe, the discoloration  of your hands, is usually normal and is called acrocyanosis, meaning \"blueness while  upright.\" Many people have this. However, you have other symptoms as well which suggest some sort of autonomic dysfunction causing poor venous return from your extremities, blood pooling, and general discomfort and lethargy. There are many potential causes for this and most of them are relatively benign. You definitely need to have it looked into, but I don't think  it's urgent. It sounds as though your blood vessels are dilating at inappropriate times, which is not nearly as serious as if they were doing the opposite. While this can be a very annoying problem, it's probably not anything life threatening. Sometimes it can be managed medically and sometimes even with a supervised, progressive exercsise program. I don't think you need to step up the appointment date, although if you can ever get in earlier that's always a plus. I definitely don't hear anything that suggests a clot is at fault here. You may have what is called dysautonomia, and again, sometimes this is treated most effectively with graded exercise. We'll know more once you've been seen by the doctor, but it is, again, a pretty common complaint.   I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you and please follow up with us as needed and  update us after you've seen the doctor.\n\n",

I questioned which forum to list my question under as it seems I have many things going on, but here goes: I am 38 yr. old female; have Factor V Leiden which is presumed to have caused 3 prior m/c over 8 years ago. Within the last 4 months I have had the following symptoms: muscle pain, fatigue, hair loss, sleepless nights, anxiety, excess oil in face/hair, confusion, chest pain, numbness in face/arms/legs, vaginal yeast infection, elevated ANA 1:640, elevated anti-phospoid lipids, and last wkend a d-dimer of 3.7 in ER. They did a CT with contrast of chest but found nothing, EKG and CT of head normal. One Rheumatologist thought maybe fibromylgia or mixed connective tissue and has me taking 12 mg of Elavil at night for the last 2 wks... another rheumatologist said 'no' to fibro and did more test that are outstanding. The recent d-dimer concerns me. Only other history is saline implants in 1993, migraines and TMJ for several years. Any thoughts on how it may or may not be related to what is going on and the real question... what is going on? Thanks in advance for any thoughts.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Trysh and you're very welcome. There is certainly some good news in the findings you report, but there is also some worrisome stuff that seems pretty much unrelated to the original problem. While all this could be perfectly innocent I would think the discovering doctor would suggest biopsy of the mass or cysts and the nodes as well,just to rule out any other potentially  serious problems. Some people are just prone to formation of these sorts of lymphadenopathies without and serious disease, but there's enough there to at least warrant an exploration (by needle biopsy I would think, at least for starters).   Please keep us updated as to your progress with this. Again, I'm glad the studies you've had done are all negative, but now this new development also needs to be understood and managed as needed.   Good luck to you. Please stay in touch.\n\n",

    "content": "Roughly six weeks ago I started experiencing a mild, dull ache in my left leg.  The pain is in and around my calf muscle.  It seems to move around and sometimes affects my lower ankle, sometimes my tibia.  Sometimes I touch my leg and it's tender to the touch and other times I touch the same spot and it's not tender.  There is no swelling, no redness.  My mother has varicose veins but I don't think this is it as I don't have any veins bulging or twisting.  I can see a few blue veins but they are clearly under the skin and I can't be certain of whether or not they were always there.  The pain becomes worse after walking, sometimes making my leg feel heavy but usually it's just this annoying dull ache.  I did fall down the stairs in September but to be honest I never felt any pain in that leg, so I don't think this is due to the fall.  I can't get in to see my doctor until after December and I'm travelling to Cuba next week (Nov 23-30).  Is this something I should go to a walk-in clinic for?  I can live with the achyness it just concerns me as it seems wierd that sometimes it's the calf, sometimes it's the bone etc.  Last night i lifted my nephew (a baby) and the extra weight made my leg ache even more.  I should also note that from time to time I do feel a sorta pulse or in the leg, that lasts for a couple of minutes and then just goes away  What could this be?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  While your description makes the problem sound like it is probably orthopedic or muscular in nature,  it's impossible to know from a distance, and since you will be traveling out of the country shortly and probably immobile for some periods of time, it's probably wise to at visit at least a walk-in facility where you can have an ultrasound of the deep leg veins performed, so that you can travel with reasonable peace of mind. While DVT is unlikely, it is not out of the question, and you don't need the risk nor the worry of this hanging over your during your trip. Best to have it ruled out first so you can enjoy yourself.  I hope this is helpful to you. Best of luck, and have a great trip.\n\n",

    "content": "I have what started out to be a dull ache in my left leg and now is painfully unbearable.  I have had it for about 4 months now.  I went to my PCP and he ordered a ultrasound and there was no blood clots.  I then went to see my Ortho doc and he did an x-ray and MRI of my knee.  He saw nothing too important, just some mild joint effusion which I guess most people have a little fluid anyway.  I think he thinks I'm over reacting but that's what he thought about my shoulder 2 years ago and it turns out my labrum was detached and torn.  Anyways, he wants me to try physical therapy cause he doesn't know what it is and he is basically done treating me. I am considering trying acupuncture but then I noticed that I am starting to get that dull pain in my right calf when I am squatted down and try to stand up.  The pain that is in my left leg started out in my calf. Pain moved around and sometimes could push on the sore spot. The pain gradually migrated almost in a straight line from my calf, up behind my knee to the middle of my thigh.  If I sit more than 5 minutes, it huts/throbs. If I stand up after sitting, it hurts.  Having it sill in one position either while laying on the couch or sleeping in bed, it hurts when I move it.  Stairs are not my friend, going up or down hurts the worse and I live in a 2 story home.  It does hurt when I walk normal but my biggest complaint is while walking, the upward movement or when I bring my leg up gives me the most pain ever.  Here's the odd part, I can ride a bicycle and exercise on an elliptical machine with no pain.  I don't even know what type of doctor I should see for this.  It could be muscle, nerves, veins and artery...just don't know and either does anyone else.  Have any suggestions?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there --  Based on the details you've provided I'd guess you may have either a nerve problem or a tendinitis that's due to some inflammatory process and somewhat mimics the symptoms of deep vein thrombosis but appears to not be that at all. It's telling that stair climbing causes problems but the eliptical machine does not, as this would be a problem in either case if this were DVT related.   I also must wonder when I run across the rare case like this, if there isn't some mild form of compartment syndrome involved, which can cause many of the symptoms similar to what you've described but usually with some swelling and tightness of the skin as well. While this is usually seen in hard-training athletes, I've also seen a similar problem in a few people (all women by the way) who attempt to train or workout without going to extremes, and much of the symptomology, once DVT is ruled out, leaves either compartment syndrome or simply torturouos deep veins with no particular disease process.   A vascualr surgeon would be the first line of approach to this, in order to rule out any vascular problem that may have been missed. Any such doctor should be a serious vascular surgeon and not one who has gone into what is basically plastic surgery (the treatment of varicose veins). With this out of the way, a sports medicine expert might be the next best bet, since one in this specialty is most likely to be able to recognize mild compartment syndrome.  I hope this is helpful to you. Please follow up here with us as needed, and good luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Connection between high d-dimer,lung and breast nodule?",
    "content": "Hi, I was wondering if there could be any connection to an extremely elevated d-dimer level and the nodule in my lll lung and now a small nodule in my right breast. Let me start from the beginning. In Dec. 07 I started having chest pain while shopping. I have a hiatal hernia and I really felt like it was probably just acting up, however it was extremely intense and painful and no matter what I did it just wouldn't go away. So I drove myself to the ER. While I was there the pain went away, and I was really embarassed to stay.I didn't want to waste their time.Before leaving they asked if they could at least get an ekg and some labs. So I stayed. They said that the EKG was a little off and that my d-dimer level 18.The emergency room physician treating me said it was the highest one he had ever seen, and that it was crucial that they admit me to run some test to rule out pulmonary effusion. I spent the next 5 days in the hospital getting heart enzymes checked and rechecked(totally normal) as well as daily d-dimers. They contined to stay around 18.I believe they told me that the high normal for their tests was around 1.4. They did chest xray,ultrasounds,ct's. Still the only thing that ever showed up was a small LLL lung nodule. They told me to recheck it in 6 months, which I did and it shows no changes.Since then I have had my baseline mammogram. It showed a \"very small nodule in the supcrolateral aspect of the r breast,which appears to be an intramammary lymph node\".The Radiologist said it isn't anything to worry about(benign)based on mammo. I'm not setting around worrying too much about it anymore, however now that I have gotten the mammo report back, it has once again instilled within me the slight worry and desire to figure out just what in the world is going on! I am in the medical profession,having worked in a hospital lab for several years and now am on the radiological side of things-and I just don't even have a clue as to what kind of physician to make an appointment with who might be able to answer my questions. I would really appreciate any ideas or suggestions on this matter! Thank you in advance.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Connection between high d-dimer,lung and breast nodule?",
    "content": "Hello -  Since you've worked in lab before you must realize just how extremely high that D-dimer was. It is strongly suggestive that there had been a clot somewhere during the time (or sometime shortly prior to) when that result came up. However, nodules and clots don't look much alike.  What probably should have been done at the time was a VQ scan to determine if there was a clot in your lung at the time. It sounds as though if there as one that it has lysed now, although a senile  clot (they sometimes solidify, calcify, or otherwise become almost like a bezoar in the lung) could  perhaps be mistaken for a nodule. It seems unlikely, but the VQ scan would have helped tell the story when the chest pain  first occurred.  I am a huge advocate of pro-active detection of DVTs and clots and ruling these things out early on so the patient can move on to lesser concerns and not have to remain on edge indefinitely. You now have been determined to have what appear to be a benign breast lump and an equally benign lung nodule. Both should, of course, be followed routinely, but not urgently.  That still  leaves the other issue open. The sort of specialist you should probably see now is a hematologist. You'll  need to determine whether or not you have an predisposition to clot formation (such as Leiden factor V), and either have those things ruled out or medically managed. There's no sense leaving something like that to chance. If you're hematologically fine then this was probably an isolated, freak instance, but you really should be certain.  That's my best answer to your question. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "John, I and a lot of other people I'm sure,really appreciate you helping us figure out our healthcare mysteries and concerns. Sometimes we can worry ourselves into a tizzy and just need some perspective! That is why I am writing you again,I need your perspective. I haven't had anymore d-dimers running in the teens I'm happy to report, and I have been following the LLL nodule for one year as recommended. The first and second reports indicated no changes.However I just received my third and final ct report, and I find it troubling. This radiologist reports that the lll nodule remains unchanged as well as the \"other ground glass opacities\".This is worrisome because neither of the other two radiologist ever reported any other \"ground glass opacities\".Could you explain to me what this is? I have asked a couple of the radiology techs that I work with and they just tell me it's a texture they see on the images.That makes since but I don't know what they could represent and if I and my nurse practitioner should be concerned about them.I suppose I keep wondering if they really did miss a PE when I was hospitalized for the crazy elevation in d-dimers. My nurse practioner was going to put me on estrogen since I am in my thirties and have had a total hystorectomy. But I am very nervous about it considering the big mystery! I explained to her the whole episode and also I told her that 3 weeks after I was discharged from hospital,I had what looking back-now looks like a TIA(migraine,massively dizzy,couldn't focus or stand-for about 1 hour).I told her I wondered if perhaps the five days of heparin shots was just enough to resolve a missed PE but not enough to totally break it up,and wondered if perhaps I passed a small clot during this headache episdoe.Don't worry I know I don't have DR in front of my name, and basically I know only enough about things like this to probably just confuse myself! Anyway she sent me for a whole slew of coagulation testing,of which none is back yet. Anyway I really do need some perspective on all of this.I don't want to chase after elephants if there really aren't any around-there's already plenty of challenges in my life without making one up!Thanks\n\n",

    "title": "Re: INR 9.5!",
    "content": "Hello --  It would seem that perhaps the combination of medications would have had a good chance of increasing the INR to such remarkably high levels anyway, when used in combination as they are now. Why it would change so suddenly is open to debate, but it seems there would be a good chance of this reaction simply due to the medications. It is possible she had developed an internal bleed because of this and that it changed the dynamic of medication to blood volume (causing, in effect, an overdose of the drugs). Her response to the 3 units of FFP suggest this may be what happened, and is my best guess as to the cause. If this is so, then the situation may well repeat itself, and her levels and hematology in general will need to be closely watched for a while. Even the level of 4.0, which is far, far better than it had been, is considered the beginning of \"high\" in ordinary situations. This is not an ordinary situation, so your aunt's CBC as well as drug levels will need  to be monitored closely for a while, and there should also be some exploration of the possibility of an occult bleed, probably gastrointestinal (the most common area for this to happen).   I hope this is helfpful to you. Good luck to you and to your aunt. Please follow up with us as needed and also keep us updated.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Which Vitamins really helps Warfarin? And what doses?",
    "content": "Hello -  I'll try to answer your questions in order.   First, while there are no vitamins that can \"help\" warfarin work better, there are some (along with some foods, drinks, etc.) that can work against it, so it is important that those things be avoided. Anything with vitamin K in it should be avoided, as this has the opposite effect of warfarin. Also green, leafy vegatables are generally contraindictated as well.   Vitamin therapy can be a very good boost to natural health, but it's also an extremely imprecise science and not exactly a medical area. So far as what might be able to help your father's vision to heal, it is impossible to say with any certainty which ones would help, since his vision loss is due to a stroke, which is a mechanical event and not a nutritional one. There also are generally no \"exact\" doses for vitamins, but mainly upper limits as to where certain ones may become toxic. For this reason any vitamin therapy would necessarily be guided by staying within the recommended daily intake (as spelled out on the container label), and not exceeding that. Also, again, vitamin K,  in particular, should be avoided. Probably your best course with regard to vitamin therapy for your father would be to discuss this with his doctor, so as to be certain there is nothing given him that might interact with any other medication he is currently taking.  The vision loss can sometimes resolve, and the warfarin may well be helpful in that regard,  but this is a completely unpredictable thing. It's best to have a medical person follow your father's progress carefully and hope for the best.  I hope this is helpful to you. Best of luck to you and especially to your father. Please follow up with  us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Dr. Kenyon,  Thank you so much for your precious information and for the kind words. You helped me a lot.  The problem is that we don't have really good doctors in Iraq, most of the giants have left Iraq to save countries, so I don't know if I should trust the current doctors or not.  Besides, they don't give the patient enough chance to ask and discuss all what he thinks and wonders about. Not mentionig that we have no research centers or alike stuff to upate our doctors information to the latest knowledge. That was the main reason for me to search for help online.  However, I also read something about that we should be careful when using Warfarin with depressed patients (here http://www.doctorslounge.com/hematology ... rfarin.htm) My father got very depressed after his last stroke. He starts to cry every time he sees one of his frinds or relatives, or when he listen to any sad music, or any imotional situations. He always feels upset and desperate... is that one of Warfarins side effects? And what should we do for that?  Thanks a lot again.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello again,  You are very welcome. I only wish I could have given you a better answer. I hope what I've provided is somewhat helpful. I understand all too well the limitations of medical care in the area where you are right now and pray this will improve sooner than later.   Regarding the use of warfarin in depressed patients, although there is no documentation in the literature about this, there is a great deal of anecdotal evidence passing among healthcare personnel and some patients and I myself have heard some stories which make me wonder if there may not be some connection between use of warfarin and mood disorders, even though it's unclear to me why this should be so. Of course there are also other circumstances at work which likely contribute to your father's current depression and sadness: his illness for one thing, plus current conditions in Iraq. plus the fact that many stroke victims tend to experience a period of marked emotional lability due to injury to that part of the brain which processes emotional reactions. All this no doubt contributes. Sometimes, though, situational depression (essentially sadness over prevailing conditions) is enough to cause a great deal of depressed affect in the patient.   I would suggest you be as positive and supportive as possible for your father right now. Hopefully things will get better not only for him personally, but that things in general will soon start to improve in your location. You father is very fortunate to have you as his advocate and helper.   My very best to you both. Please keep us updated. If I find more information on this subject I'll be sure to let you know.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello again Dr. Keynon,  Several days ago, my father's doctor prescribed Amiodarone 200 mg/day, in addition to his already prescribed 6.25 mg/day Carvedilol. After that I noticed that happens some blood in his spittle, snuffle, and stool. His health was generally good till yesterday, he could standup, walk, and excrete alone. He could also wash his face and do several hand activities normally.  But yesterday, when he was trying to stand up, he sort of passed out for like 5 seconds, and he lost all of his power after that. It was like he returned back to his first day of stroke! untill now he is very weak and desperate again... I don't know what is the explanation of what happened. Is that because of the new Amiodarone? Now he can't walk alone any more. And his appetite became worse. I hope that you can help with an explanation, and what should we remind his doctor about?  Another question: is Omega-3 pills good for him?  Thanks a lot in advance...\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  It's difficult to be certain, but there is a possibility that some of the new symptoms are being caused by amiodarone, which can have some fairly strong and noxious side effects. This would be worth your doctor's time to look into, as there are other antiarrhythmics which could be substituted if necessary, and which don't have as many side effects.  As for the Omega 3 supplement, it is generally beneficial, but since it has the potential to interact with anticoagulants, it should be cleared by your father's doctor before use.   I look forward to further updates and hope your father's current setback is brief.\n\n",

    "content": "I am hoping you can help me. In the past I have suffered from PE's and was treated with warfarin. During the last four years I have had no episodes and took myself off the warfarin some three years ago.  I undertook a 13 hour drive on the 2nd of January this year and during that journey had severe pain in my hip joint. During the last 5 days or so I have had a nagging sharp pain in my upper right chest midway between my nipple and shoulder.  Whilst it may seem obvious that may well have a reocurrence of a PE, I am a little doubtful due to the length of time that the pain has been obvious.  I do have a cough, nothing severe, just a little annoying. My chest is extremely painful when I sneeze or cough and keeps me awake at night.  The pain is not constant, only when I breath deeply or move in certain directions.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: PE?",
    "content": "Hello -  There is a proposition in logic and critical thinking called \"Occam's razor\", which suggests we look at the obvious things first because they are most likely to provide the answers we're seeking. When those obvious things are eliminated then we can work our way down into the more obscure possibilities. This would especially apply in your case, since you have more than a single risk factor for PEs and are having symptoms  that are totally consistent with this, plus a recent history predisposing to it. You also smoke, which adds to the risk in a quantum fashion.  For all these reasons you should most definitely have the obvious thing ruled out (or in) first. Your symptoms are consistent with PE, even though you've had some experience with these and so may feel you can recognize one apart from other things. This is a lot like people who say \"I've had a heart attack and I know this isn't one because it didn't feel like this.\" The problem is that each time we have a serious medical event that causes damage, we are left with a little less functioning tissue in the affected area, so eventually the problem could feel different and even present differently. Everything has been changed over time. The fact remains you have that history and those factors working against you. It would be extremely foolish to try and look past the obvious. If you do not currently have a PE, then you have something else that needs to be resolved. Get the most problematic thing out of the way first.   To accept your argument about the character and duration of the chest pain, it does sound equally as though it could be pleuritic pain due to an inflammation of the chest wall or pleura, but this can also be a complication of PE, so we're back to that again.   I hope you'll just have this looked into and if it's not PE then be happy. If it is, be happy also,because you'll need to know in order to treat it properly. If it's pleurisy it should respond to non-steroidal anti-inflammatories. However, please bear  in mind that people who have repeated PEs have them because of a blood clotting disorder and not just bum luck. If you can find a way to get back on the warfarin therpay it would be a huge advantage to you. Just because you haven't had another PE doesn't mean you can't or won't. You've been fortunate so far. I hope you'll consider taking better care of you in future.  Best of luck to you. Hope this is hepful, and please do follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  While there are other potential causes for this sort of discomfort, any sort of pain, tightness, swelling or warmth in the calf should be examined, especially if there is a family history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or coagulation issues. SInce you have a positive family history for this and are using birth control, you should have this checked, at least via an ultrasound of the calf and possibly a D-dimer blood test as well, even if you have to go to a walk-in facility to get this done. It's just not worth the risk.  Some other potential problems which could be  at the bottom of this are compartment syndrome (more common in athletes, but sometimes occurring for no apparent reason), and varicose or torturous deep veins.   I hope this is helpful. Please update us as to what's going on. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

You're on a very high dose of Coumadin already, so increasing it is unlikely to fix this problem.   I think by \"Coumadin level\" you're referring to your INR, which ideally should be around 3 in your case.   If there is no other medication or supplement you're taking which would compete with the Coumadin, then your doctors are going to have to delve deeper for the cause of the failure of the medicaion to be effective.

It is strictly a diagnostic aid and not a measure of one's overall health or lack of it.   Since you've been having some swelling and pain in the leg and the D-dimer was elevated, it would seem someone should have been following up with you regarding a possible DVT, since this is something that needs to be managed, not simply the indicators  for it, such as D-dimer. If you have a hereditary clotting disorder, that would  need to be treated medically. There's not much in the way of homeopathic medicine to cover such a problem. Your doctor should be on top of this one.   I hope this clarifies the issue for you. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

Someone is following it closely, so the D-dimer is probably somewhat misleading in your case.  The fluid on the shin that happens after exercise sounds like the result of a problem with a superficial vein most likely, perhaps part of a larger issue in that leg, but apparently nothing to get excited about.   All in all a very good report. Thanks so much for following up, and do stay in touch.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi and thanks once again for the prompt reply I received the results from my blood test with two anomalies apart from d-dimer 399 RBC   4.47  (4.50-6.50) PCV   0.397 (0.40-0.50) I did 16 miles training with 6,000ft of climbing, steady over 7 hrs & no problem with the calf the day after but when i finished my fingers went knumb, and I dug this up on the internet.  Vitamin B12 deficiency is less common than iron deficiency and is usually not due to dietary deficiency of vitamin B12. The most common cause is a disease called pernicious anaemia, in which the body stops making a substance (called \"intrinsic factor\") that is needed to absorb vitamin B12 from the diet. Vitamin B12 deficiency can also cause nerve problems, often causing numbness and tingling that start first in the hands and feet. Haemoglobin is low, but red blood cell indices are usually increased. Tied in with the results above could this be leading to anaemia / Vitamin B12 deficience Thanks Kevin\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  The D-dimer result remains something of a mystery and, I guess, basically renders it useless as an indicator for you. Those other two readings were so close to normal that were it not for the new symptoms they'd probably be passed over. But since you do now have this tingling, and it is for sure something one sees with B-12 deficiency (with or withouth pernicious anemia) it is well worth bringing to the attention of your doctor, especially if it persists. While it could be due to something more concrete (like a postural problem having irritated a nerve), this seems fairly unlikely.   I'd press for this, since there is enough evidence to at least warrant an investigation. It's entirely possible there is some other cause if you are deficient in B-12. It is at least manageable. I'd definitely make some noise about it.  Best of luck, and please keep us updated.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: knot on lower left shin",
    "content": "Hi there -  You suffered a trauma to the leg and it's normal for this to cause the symptoms you describe. It sounds like there was significant soft tissue injury as well as possible brusing of the bone underneath. The injury, however, is superficial, and it should resolve with time. The best thing you can do for it is to keep it elevated when practical, rest it when you can, and it should slowly resolve. If there is a clot (not likely) it would involve a superficial vein, and those don't pose the same sorts of problems deep vein clots do. More likely there's some bleeding into the tissues around the site of injury. Again, keep off it as much as possible, keep it elevated when you can, and it should improve fairly soon. If the swelling persists beyond a week or so you might want to have it x-rayed to be certain there's no fracture, but that seems extremely unlikely. No need for a water pill or anything like that. Swelling is a natural bodily response to physical trauma. No relation to the use of beta blockers, either. Not to worry. Be glad it's not hurting too much (and if it should, try to go with acetaminophen rather than the usual NSAID pain pills like Advil or Aleve, as they are effective but increase the bleeding tendency, so could slow healing).   Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Blood Clot in Lung/Right Heart Pressure",
    "content": "Hello -  First, I wish doctors would  either explain findings to their patients (in the context of the specific patient) or else not throw out random findings at all. While there are some figures that have fairly fixed normal ranges, there are others that are totally relative to the whole patient, including anatomy and any disease process that may be going on. But that's just a pet peeve of mine. It leaves people worrying, often needlessly, about what a finding means. Another minute or two to explain wouldn't hurt.  The fact that you've had numerous pulmonary emboli is significant,  and you know that already. Further, your peripheral blood pressure is textbook perfect, which means things are getting done as needed. However, the right ventricular pressure is high (normal is 15-25 mm/hg). This is no doubt due to the amount of damage and lost lung function due to previous eboli winding up in your lungs, some of which will have caused lesions and others which may have calcified. Technically you therefore have pulmonary hypertension (PH), but with a known  underlying cause. This is not nearly as worrisome as primary PH, as the right heart is forced to work harder because of the damage to the lungs. Sometimes this improves, also, whereas primary PH doesn't often improve on its own, at least not without some major intervention.  Your right ventricle is probably also somewhat thickened (the muscle has likely become thicker -- stronger) and it may also be somewhat dilated relative to the normal size. This is all expected when there have been multiple PEs over time.   I would think that if your high right heart pressure was of major concern to your doctor that he wouldn't have you waiting two weeks to sit down and discuss it. It's a sign that there is pulmonary damage, but that would pretty much go without saying. The idea now should be to create a plan to manage the after-effects of the PEs, and to prevent further ones from ocurring.  I hope  this clarifies things a little for you. Nothing of immediate concern would seem to be going on, and your doctor will likely present a long-term plan to help keep your heart and  lungs healthy in the future. Best of luck to you and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  The main danger with clots or phlebitis (inflammation of a vein) in the superficial veins is infection. While there shouldn't be any overwhelming reason for concern in terms of a threat to life, the thing has to at least be uncomfortable and could, if it hasn't already, become infected. It should at least be looked at. Sometimes these things can be made to resolve by application of moist, warm (not hot) compresses, but if it doesn't clear up on its own soon, it should at least be evaluated medically. If you have tingling in your hand the clot may be causing pressure on a nerve.  As for the hair loss, I have no idea what may be causing that. Your mean  blood pressure isn't a meaningful measurement, but if the upper (systolic) number is high (over 140) and the diastolic is low (below 60) a wide range like that is often indicative of anxiety more than anything else.   I hope this is helpful to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  As you already know, pleurisy can  be excruciating. That alone warrants urgent symptomatic care. As for the difficulty breathing, that could be due to pleurisy or could be due to a PE. You already know all this, so it must be very frustrating to just be told you've got pleurisy. The leg needs an ultrasound, and you should also have a D-dimer drawn, to be  certain you don't have another clot or haven't had one recently.  The only problem with going to the ER frequently (with a very positive history of a serious problem such as you have) is not that they will think you a nuisance -- they're being paid to be there anyway -- but that you get the appropriate attention and diagnostic procedures to ensure you remain safe and healthy. If the local ER is unable to provide this, hopefully there is another facility reasonably nearby where you can be evaluated properly. On the other hand, if they are doing these tests and are coming up empty-handed, then perhaps you do have pleurisy only at this time, but with your history you deserve a comprehensive workup whenver symptoms appear. Is it possible to make an appointment with a vascular surgeon to follow you for the current problem?  Please follow up with us as needed and keep us updated. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "I have a history of recurrent DVTs while on Warfarin due to APS. I am quite aware of what my symptoms are of a DVT, which are not often typical (I do not always have swelling, color changes, or temperature changes in calf).  Often I have found them due to discomfort and heaviness in my leg with extreme tenderness behind and/or below the knee, and occasionally with pins & needles in my feet.  Since I am a runner, I usually stop and wait a week or so to see if it's just a muscle strain, then head to the ER for an ultrasound with compression to find the nasty thing.  The doctors don't know what to do with me when they find them, since I'm already quite thinned out on Warfarin (my range is 3-3.5).  So this last week when the symptoms presented themselves, I quit running and called my rheumatologist who had me go straight to get an ultrasound, but at a different hospital than I normally go to.  This hospital did a quickie two-point ultrasound, where they check femoral and popliteal veins, then cheerfully dismissed me with a \"no clots!\" diagnosis.  How can this two-point ultrasound possibly be as thorough and definitive as a regular, whole leg ultrasound?  We're talking about a 5 minute exam as opposed to a 20-30 minute one!  Unfortunately, the pain has simply increased to where it is uncomfortable to walk. Not only that, but yesterday, my OTHER leg started with same symptoms!  My rheumatologist wants me to come in for a visit this week, but doesn't think it's DVTs since the ultrasound didn't show one.    So what now? Do I demand a whole-leg ultrasound of BOTH legs? I'm sure they must think I'm a hypochondriac.  But I'm afraid to start running yet...what if they are all wrong and a clot breaks loose?  Then I'm done running for a long time.  Thanks for any advice and help.  Cynthia\n\n",

Please do either go back or to a different  facility and be adamant that you receive a proper workup to rule out DVT.

Now am I to understand an intravenous drip was placed in the palm of your hand? I don't think I've ever seen that done before, and I've seen (and done) some  odd IV placements. Be that as it may, this is a sensitive area and it's not surprising the IV has caused problems. However, that doesn't make it  OK. It should be healed by now, and if it's not then it needs to be examined by an MD who cares enough to pay attention to the problem. It may actually have irritated some other structure, a nerve or a ligament, but it's impossible to tell from here. In any case, this isn't a normal IV placement nor is it a normal outcome. Pain relievers don't solve the problem, and it sounds like a quite painful one.   A second opinion is about the best thing I can recommend,  as your current doctor doesn't seem appropriately concerned about this. Hands get a lot of use.   Best of luck to you.

They immediately started me on Heparin, with doses of warfarin being taken until the treatments became thereauputic. I got out of the hospital, and my leg started hurting very bad.

Since starting back, my  (Left) leg has become extremely swollen. it is a little bit painful, but just feels like it tires out very easily. The skin feels very tight on this leg, and flexibility becomes alot worse when it is swollen. When I lie down at night, I make sure to elevate my leg above my heart and that seems to help bring down the swelling. My vascular doctor has said that this swelling is typical with where the clot resides in my abdomen, and blood getting back to the heart. When can I expect this swelling and pain to reduce/go away ?Also I should note to make things more complicated- I apparently was born without a inferior vena cava so the filtrationn method for the vena cava is not an option for me.

    "title": "Re: How long can my leg stay swollen from pelvic blood clot?",
    "content": "Hello -  The big clot you had was probably due to long-term poor lower extremity blood return due to the lack of an inferior vena cava. This can happen, and even with that part of the vena cava present, given the clot was there, it could take a while for the leg to return to normal. Absent the inferior section of the vena cava, the swelling will probably take that much longer to resolve anyway. You'll need to have this followed to be certain there are no further clot formations in the leg or elsewhere, which could be a recurrent problem, but the swelling should slowly resolve at least up to a tolerable point. Keeping the leg elevated when  possible is excellent, and  the need to walk so much at work is a mixed thing, part good, part not so good. It will help force blood return in the affected leg, but also will, due to gravity, cause it to swell some during the day, cancelling out some of the benefit.  The heparin and eventual warfarin will reduce your risk of clots a great deal. This is especially important because there is no place to put a filter.   It sounds as though you're doing everything right, it's just going to require some patience and of course vigilance as well, to get through the recovery period. If the leg swelling doesn't reduce some over time, by all means let your doctor know. However, it may remain a little puffy compared with the other one, perhaps routinely. So long as it's not frankly swollen after a while, nor discolored, then you can be safely followed on a routine basis and of course if anything out of the way happens involving the leg or the area that was affected by the large clot, you should contact your doctor at once. Otherwise, keep up the good work. Best of luck to you, and please follow up with us as you feel necessary.\n\n",

    "content": "I had my first DVT 2 months ago and have since been diagnosed Factor 5 Leiden homozygous. I'm currently on warfarin to treat the existing clot. Besides the genetic predisposition, and having been a long time smoker (I quit 2 weeks prior to getting the clot) I have no other apparent risk factors for clotting.  What is the current thinking on keeping someone like me on permanent warfarin therapy? Or maybe the question should be; does one clot in 44 years warrant a lifetime of anticoagulation?  I've read both pro and con online, but some of the information is pretty old. Both my PCP and hematologist will only say I'll be on warfarin \"for a long time.\"   Your thoughts on the subject are appreciated!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: F V Leiden homozygous = warfarin 4 life?",
    "content": "Hello -  With either form of Factor V Leiden resulting in DVT, treatment is initially with lightweight heparin for about a week, followed by 3-6 months on warfarin. This may seem like \"a long time\" for a lot of people. Also, at the end of standard therapy, if there is still a high D-dimer result, this can result in extended warfarin therapy. Finally, if a subsequent DVT should occur, this is usually considered cause to make warfarin therapy lifelong. But on, one DVT in 44 years does not, in itself, warrant, as a rule, lifelong warfarin therapy. There are some additional risk factors that may be weighed and which may influence the duration of warfaring therapy, but these are all the standard risk factors for DVT in an otherwise healthy person.   In short, I would think your doctors' \"for a long time\" qualification probably was in consideration of an initial 3-6 month period, and possibly longer depending on post-therapy blood testing.   I hope this is helpful.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there. I am a 44 year old woman recently diagnosed, first time, with a large DVT. I had blood work done with results that came back positive for F5 Leiden homozygous, also presence of a Lupus anitcoagulant.  My question is, they drew my blood after I had already started on Lovenox and coumadin (2 days, 5mg coumadin 1x day, 60 ml lovenox 2xday). Would that skew the test results? The test (I think it's called Analyte Specific Reagent?) was developed by the Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic. I thought only a gene test could determine if the F5 Leiden mutation was either homo or heterozygous? I have a copy of the results, and the note says \"this individual DOES have the factor V Leiden R506Q mutation on BOTH alleles\"...should I get tested again, or is my next step to go to a hematologist?  Your help is greatly appreciated!\n\n",

The good news is you can know this and manage the disorder and likely avoid any serious future problems.  A hematologist is definitely your next stop.   Best of luck to you.

    "content": "Hi there -  We all have both superficial and deep veins. The ones you are now noticing are superficial and quite often appear to be green instead of purple. In fact, usually only the most superficial veins (the ones that stand out) tend to appear to be purple. The fact that you've not noticed these before could be on account of recent weight loss or, if not that, then you maybe just had never noticed them before. Trust me, they're supposed to be there, and there's no process by which superficial veins suddenly appear. If they seem to be distended then they could be varicosities, but that is  almost always only seen in people with serious liver disease that has already been  diagnosed, and there are many  other pronounced symptoms also preceding this.   Having been out of the sun and losing one's summer tan can also expose these veins. There  are other,more obscure and non-serious ways this can sometimes happen.  I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you.,\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  It is entirely possible to get a charley horse (muscle spasm) in one's forearm, and these tend to happen a lot at night when potassium levels are low. Some people have chronically low potassium levels, and while there can be clear-cut cause many times, there are also unclear causes which sometimes require a prescription potassium supplement (time-released) which will not only help reduce or prevent muscle spasms, but also the occasional heartbeat irregularity that can be caused by low potassium.   I'd approach my doctor to have serum potassium (K) tested and, if it is consistently lwo, have an inexpensive, generic time-release potassium prescribed at least until or unless the source of the potassium loss can be uncovered.   Best of luck to you with this. It's a fairly simple problem to manage, sometimes more difficult to actually cure.\n\n",

I'm a 26 year old female, never on any hormonal birth control before, and I began using nuvaring 3 days ago.  It was after only ~24 hours using the ring that I noticed an odd sensation in my left leg (calf, behind knee, and groin).  Not pain, as is listed as a DVT synmptom, something more akin to restless leg syndrome or tightness, sometimes individual 'twinges'.  No swelling that I can see, no discoloration, just the odd feeling.  However, I am quite active in sports (jogging, volleyball, ice hockey, all at least 2x/wk), so who knows - I may have just pulled a muscel or injured my leg and not noticed initially.  Perhaps I'm being hyperaware of how my legs feel, and am just paranoid (clots were a large factor in my long hesitancy to try hormonal birth control) about DVT.  However, please advise on whether this is something to be concerned about, and if it is, at what point should I think about seeing a doctor or emergency room?  (Additional info:  I have never smoked, though I am overweight - ~200lbs, 5'8\".  No clotting/cardiac issues in family history except paternal grandfather who had a fatal heart attack at age 73.

This factor increases your odds for developing a clot but how your body may deal with it is impossible to predict in advance.

While it is common for people to worry that they may have something similar to what recently claimed a loved one, you are describing symptoms which are worrisome. While it would normally be quite strange to have such a problem occur so close to the loss of a family member due to a similar issue, it is not impossible. There is also the question of why your father developed the clot that lodged in his lung. If he had a clotting disorder it could be genetic and for that reason, plus the rather troubling description you provide here, I'd strongly recommend that while the symptoms are still present you have someone examine the leg, peform a doppler ultrasound exam of the veins in the affected leg, and perhaps also request a D-dimer blood test as well as the usual clotting factor tests (INR, PT-PTT) just to be sure. If all these are negative I think you can assume the problem is either muscular or perhaps even psychosomatic. But it would be remiss of me to dismiss this as simply a case of emotionally-mediated imaginary illness. You would feel much better knowing whether or not there is any possible familial connection.  My best to you. Please do follow up with us here.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  I think I understand why you posted in this topic, but what you describe sounds most like two separate problems which may be related. The cramping of your hands sounds like something that could be caused by one of three things: hyperventilation (are you an anxious person?); a compressed nerve at the spinal root; or possibly an electrolyte imbalance (usually potassium depletion).  The legs falling asleep thing sounds like a probably nerve issue as well, although with cramping also part of the picture it makes more sense to suspect potassium depletion, which is the one thing which could explain both complaints.   I would definitely bring this to the attention of a doctor. A simple blood test can determine if your electrolytes are out of balance and if so, some dietary and hydration tricks might  solve the problem. If there is any nerve compression that's something you'd want to know too, as the sooner it is discovered, the sooner it can be managed properly and the discomfort reduced or eliminated.  Please let us know how things go.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 32 year old female diabetic, who was recently hospitalised with diabetic ketoacidosis. I had a PICC line inserted into my right arm for IV treatment of the ketoacidosis. Within mintues of treatment starting through the line, my arm was in extreme pain & was very painful to touch or lift. After 36 hours, my ketoacidosis had been rectified, and the line was removed. An ultrasound 24 hours after the line's removal, showed a 35 cm clot in the cephalic vein. I have had contradictary information by my admitting doctor as well as that of a haematologist. My doctor within the hospital advised that 3-6 month treatment of Warfarin as well as Clexane injections daily. A haematologist has advised that I was being over medicated & to stop taking the Wafarin but continue taking the Clexane until an ultrasound can confirm the status of the clot. I would like to know more about the cephalic vein & if the 'clot' dislodges, how dangerous it is. Also, what is the recommended treatment. I have read some literature about the cephalic vein, which says that the vein is superficial, so does that mean it is not dangerous??\n\n",

Not as dangerous as Deep Vein Thrombosis which could lead to lung complications. If the 'clot' dislodges, how dangerous it is.   Its a superficial vein so it is quite a protective factor. Hopefully the clot will resolve with time.   This is not to scare you but you should be aware of a rare possibilty - pulmonary embolism (clot reaches the lung). In case you feel sudden shortness of breath or unexpected increase in respiratory rate, you should contact your doctor asap.   As you are out of ketoacidosis, take care and see your blood sugar is within normal range always.  Best Luck.\n\n",

When it sits there in your legs, a clot can form and as you experienced, it can be life-threatening.  Most likely you were somewhat prone to the problem, perhaps genetically, and the long airline flight presented the perfect conditions for a clot.  Perhaps the clot was in one of your legs than in the next two months it traveled to your lungs.    It is now recommended that a person gets up and moves around during long flights just for this reason.  Congratulations on surviving this episode.  Be in touch with your doctor to be sure you are getting the adequate doses of anticoagulant therapy.  It is a fine art to keep it thin enough without causing it to be so thin you bleed too easily.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello penclepaper -  Your problem is a fairly common one, since muscle spasm (charley horse) in the calf can cause swelling at times, a not-well-known fact. It should not, however, be discolored (red) or warm. A duplex doppler ultrasound study at the outset could have resolved this question for you, but now it seems you're going to have to go back and have one performed to rule out DVT, since the two problems can often mimic one another and you can't \"walk off\" a DVT.  Hopefully the swelling, redness and local warmth are just indications of a severley pulled muscle, but there is one good way to find out. Also, if there is any doubt left, a simple blood test called a D-dimer test would help rule DVT in/out once and for all.   The worry and moderate risk just aren't worth it. I wish more acute medical facilities would consider DVT sooner. Hope all is well with you. Please do let us know how things turned out.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: mild thigh, severe calf pain and plantar feet pain",
    "content": "Hello kmoo -  Due to the long-term nature of your problem I don't think clots are the culprit, as they would have caused either a progressive problem with thrombophlebitis and leg discoloration, local fever, etc., at the least, and quite likely would have dislodged and caused a catastrophic pulmonary event as well. You mention the perplexity of doctors regarding hair dispersion on your legs, which could suggest some sort of aterial circulation problem, except that seems to have been ruled out. There is a thyroid problem which could possibly be related in some obscure way, but that would be out of the scope of my knowlege. I would guess the cyonitic appearance of your hands and feet may be unrelated to the pain and could be coincidental, but it is a huge coincidence if it is one. Some people do have this appearance chronically (acrocyanosis) or you could have poor venous return without a clotting problem to complicate it. It is entirely possible,however, that once again we come back to the horrible coincidence theory and your leg pain is due to either a postural and/or nerve compression problem so far not discovered, since you have enough circulatory signs to misdirect attention.  I certainly hope you have been able to find a suitable pain management strategy by now in lieu of methadone, which as you know can bring its own problems into the picture.  Best of luck to you and please update us if things change.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Pulmonary Embolism and Septic Shock",
    "content": "Hello Lori -  First, my belated condolences on your loss. I hope time has helped put this all into some sort of perspective for you.  Pulomonary embolism and septic shock can, technically, have some outward similarities but generally do not look alike at all. However, they certainly can coexist in the same patient. Septic shock also will produce different findings upon autopsy. While sepsis may have been present in your husband at the time of his passing (and some of your descriptors could fit that picture), it would seem the terminal event was the multiple PEs. One condition could even have led to the other, since with sepsis it is difficult to maintain correct body chemistry and blood viscosity could be affected, producing clots even with the patient being moved on a fairly regular basis.   Sepsis can be determined upon autopsy (and prior to death as well) by both symptoms and blood chemistry as well as multiple organ failure, which would seem to have begun in your husband's case. The ultimate cause of death is usually what is listed on the certificate, although sometimes it is listed as \"secondary to\" some other condition. Septic shock or at least sepsis seems a possible predisposing condition, although it is impossible to know without knowing what was written in the post mortem report.   Again, my deepest condolences. Hopefully by now you have learned more about the circumstances and perhaps have gained a little peace of mind about what had to be a difficult event for you and your family.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Gary040-  While what you describe does sound like a muscle pull of tendonitis, if it persists or recurs you would probably want relief from the discomfort at least, and a visit to your general practitioner would be in order, if only to prescribe some stronger prescription non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication (such as naproxin) and maybe a muscle relaxer. During the exam the doctor would also probably feel for any unusual tenderness, swelling or a knot under the surface, which could possibly suggest a DVT. If so, a doppler study or more sophisticated testing could be done to rule out a DVT. Hopefully by now the problem has resolved or been managed medically.   Good luck to you!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, No, this would not be a clot according to your description.     I wonder if it is a ganglion cyst, most often found on wrists but they also appear on fingers.  If so it is harmless and fluid filled.  Usually these resolve on their own so you can watch and wait.    If it starts to cause pain or bothers you in any way, you should have a doctor look at it to decide what your options are.  Sometimes they recur, even with treatment.  Since we can't give you a definite diagnosis here, it would be best to show this to your health care provider when you get the chance.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Question about slow clotter getting clogged arteries",
    "content": "Please see my profile for medical background. For reference, I am an ex-EMT in California, so reasonably knowledgeable about medical facts. I will give a brief background of my question just so you have some reference.  I was diagnosed as being a \"slow blood clotter\" back when I was a child (~1969) when I had a tonsillitis operation. After the procedure, the doctors couldn't stop the bleeding, and I was sent to Children's Hospital in Seattle for immediate attention. I ended up getting a transfusion, and later, when I was older, my parents explained that the doctor's had classified me as a slow clotter, but NOT a hemophiliac. They mentioned something about a \"missing 13th gene\"?? or some such, but I've never been given a good explanation.  Throughout my childhood (and still today), I bruised very easily, was slow to clot when cut or hurt, and bled a long time when having teeth removed (for example). Even today, if I cut myself with a knife, I would bleed for a couple of hours, but it will eventually clot. None of this was ever unmanageable, but I did have two accidents of note. One when I was about 12, where I fell on a pair of scissors, in my neck, and bled for about four hours before I was sutured and treated. Did not lose consciousness. Later, at 18, got in a motorcycle accident and lacerated my ankle such that a fair volume of blood was spurting out before I spotted it. Taken to ER, and they popped the hematoma (size of a baseball), and I almost did pass out briefly. Not sure of the exact volume lost. This one was pretty severe though, and I spent three days in the hospital, continuing to bleed periodically during that entire time. It took almost 24 hours for the bleeding to subside enough that I was out of danger. No other substantial injury since then.  Okay, that brings me to today, and two questions:  Clearly, I am an extremely slow clotter. Does this \"help\" me in any way as far as forming or not forming clots in arteries? Logic would imply that if my blood tends to clot very slowly, or rarely at all when in motion, then I would find far fewer plaque build ups in my arteries, and thus less susceptible to blockages and common issues related to this. Does this logic hold water, though?  Second, I have an umbillical hernia that showed up in the past 1.5 years. I've seen my doc, plus a specialist, and both said that it would be good to have it fixed, but it's not critical. I discussed my clotting problem with the specialist, but he said he would do a few test (which, likely??) and decide then, but didn't think it would be an issue. The hernia IS annoying and unsightly, and I would prefer to have it fixed rather than leave it alone. However, at 44, and slightly overweight for my frame, I am hesitant to have my first substantial surgery in my life with this risk. What would be your opinion on the likelihood of complications or risks, especially not being able to clot after the procedure? Would it make more sense to leave this alone and live with it as-is? Or is this still -- even being a slow clotter -- still a fairly straightforward and low risk procedure?  THANKS MUCH!! bruce\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Question about slow clotter getting clogged arteries",
    "content": "Hi Bruce,  A very good question and sorry for a late answer.  Let\u2019s get some facts straight. I want to explain to you three different medical terms first.  1. Atherosclerosis: This is defined as deposition of fatty material on the inner lining of blood vessels [endothelium]. This deposition also attracts some calcium and then it becomes a hard plaque. Gradually as the deposition progresses the size of plaque increases to obstruct part of the vessel lumen which is now called 'Stenosis'. Note that nowhere in this process blood components or blood clotting is involved.  2. White Thrombus: Blood contains three types of cells. White, Red and Platelets. These Platelets are elongated cells that have the property to stick to each other on trigger from vessel injury or foreign body exposure and form what is known as a White thrombus or a Platelet plug.   3. Red Thrombus: The blood contains Red Cells [RBCs] as well as clotting factors in the plasma. On injury or foreign body exposure a chain chemical reactions take place and a 'clotting cascade' is triggered and a mesh like structure is formed out of these clotting factors in which the RBCs get entangled and this results in formation of what is called a Red Thrombus.  If you are a slow clotter, this last item of clot formation or Red Thrombus is what is delayed. This gives you absolutely no protection form the first item Atherosclerosis. So you are as much or as less prone to development of Blockages or Stenosis in your arteries any anybody else.   Having developed the stenosis from Atherosclerosis, the formation of white thrombus may be somewhat delayed in some types of slow clotters and the third thing, Red Thrombus is delayed in all slow clotters.   So you might be somewhat protected from acute catastrophic effects of artery clogging like a heart attack. But you have no protection against Atherosclerosis and Stenosis or the arteries.  There is no issue whatsoever for you getting operated for Umbilical hernia. A hematologist has to be in the team of your doctors and she would administer appropriate clotting factors through blood component therapy prior to surgery.   Apurva\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  This is an interesting question, have not encountered such a query till now. After reviewing the literature on this I have found some information that might be useful to you.  First the basics: Warfarin is a medicine that prevents clotting. This it does by preventing the synthesis of clotting factors by the liver. Liver uses Vitamin K to produce these clotting factors.  Now, smokeless tobacco apparently contains a lot of Vitamin K. When liver gets extra vit K the effect of Warfarin inhibiting the synthesis of clotting factors is blunted out, and Liver is able to continue production of the clotting factors. Thus warfarin becomes ineffective and patients might develop undesirable clotting in arteries.  So those patients who have been advised to take warfarin because of their disease should absolutely refrain from using smokeless tobacco.   http://www.theannals.com/cgi/content/ab ... 7v2?ck=nck\n\n",

Vit K is heat stable that is to say it is not destroyed by normal cooking. So dietary sources are good for Vit K even when cooked. However my common sense and logic says thet Vit K in tobacco is unlikely to survive burning as in the cigarette. Also I do not know that If at all it survives incineration whether it can get absorbed via the smoke through the mucus membranes.  Apurva\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  Claudication, better known as intermittant claudication is a classic symptom of clogged arteries of the legs. Typically there is no pain at rest. The pain starts after a fixed and predictible distance of walking, which is known as claudication distance. As the disease progresses this distance could get shorter. A stage comes when the blockages become so severe that ischemia- lack of blood supply due to blockage- persists even at rest and the person would get what is called 'rest pain'.   What stage your husband was in prior to operation? If he had pains only on walking, and now has them even at rest, then it is worthwhile to get to your surgeon and get some tests done. On the other hand if the character of pain is totally different from the one prior to surgery this might be some thing totally unrelated.   Apurva\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  Thickening of carotid arteries, also called carotid intima media thickness [IMT] is an indicator of atherosclerosis. As age advences, the IMT increases by 0.04 mm for every 10 years of age.   In hypertension this progression becomes faster. IMT is also an early sign and predictor of hypertension, as it is seen in people who are non hypertensive and then they go on to develop hypertension  later in life.  IMT is also a marker of atherosclerosis- hardening of arteries with fat deposition. Increased IMT is an indicator of possible future Myocardial Infarction and stroke.  If you are without any symptoms or disease now and all you have is increased IMT, you should start regular vigorous exercises, keep weight down, keep BP down if you have it, eat a lot of fresh fruits and vegetables, cut down on salt intake as well as saturated fatty foods, amd in general lead a heathy life.

Would you happen to know of a specialist in San Antonio who would like to study my blood to determine why my body is able to partially disolve the clots so quickly when they get large enough to cause symptoms?

    "content": "I have had varicose veins since my teens. I am now 54.  Also low blood pressure. Someone recommended grapeseed extract, as it seemed to work for them. After just 2 days, 2 tablets a day, I develped a painful blood clot in my leg. The area was red, warm, painful to the touch. The only other time this happened was when I tried vitamin k for heavy menstrual bleeding. Do you think the grapeseed extract caused this? Should I continue trying it?  Thank you for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Sharon165,  Grape seed extract has been shown to affect clotting, although most of the studies I could find on this show that it inhibits clotting rather than causing clots.  The hard part about herbal supplements is that they are not regulated by the FDA so there is actually no guarantee that what you think is in the supplement actually is in it.  Some studies have shown that some supplements claiming to be 100% of supplement X actually are only about 60% of X along with 40% of other things, including dangerous compounds.  So, the actual grape seed extract probably was unrelated to your developing the clots but I cannot say for sure that the supplement was not involved in the developing of these clots.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I just turned 20 this year, I am a female college student, and while I realize that I am a little young to be worrying about blood clots I am on birth control and am not very active which I also know can effect them.  Since its the end of the semester I have been sitting around for hours at a time doing homework. I have a laptop so I usually sit on my bed. One day after my right leg constantly falling asleep I started to get a really sharp ache in my ankle. I didn't think much of it because I've always had weak ankles, but today the same thing happened again only it moved from just my ankle to my ankle and my knee.   One of the main reasons I'm concerned is that my mom is always telling me since I'm on birth control I need to be more active or I'm going to get blood clots, so I was wondering if I should see a doctor or if I'm just overreacting.  I don't know of any family history and I've never been diagnosed with having blood clots before. I do have scoliosis and I was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency and had to take synthetic growth hormone in high school, but I'm not really sure if that would have anything to do with it. The only medication I'm on besides birth control (seasonique) is over the counter allergy medication when needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Cleadens,  Your risk of blood clots, assuming there is no predisposing genetic issue, is fairly low  given your young age, though it is higher than those not on birth control at your age.      When you're sitting for long periods of time it is a good idea to move your legs around some.  Also, I would strongly advise against smoking, not only for all the negative reasons typically thought of but that smoking will also increase your risk of blood clots particularly while on birth control pills.

    "content": "I have an 84 y/o aunt who has a PMH/PSH significant for CHF, DMII, HLD, Obesity, DVT/PE w/filter placement and Coumadin therapy since 1977, and bilateral TKA. She recently had a spacer placed to her left knee secondary to an infection x 4 weeks ago.  Since that time she has also been on bed-rest.    I recently went to visit her at home and noticed that her RLE was grossly edematous (approximately 2 to 2.5 times the size of the left lower extremity), which worried me because there were no procedures performed on the right extremity.  I contacted her home health nurse and eventually discovered that her Coumadin levels were sub-therapeutic (<1.5).  Additionally, I also discovered that she had been transported to the ED 7 days prior to my arrival for a blood glucose of 7 and during this visit, the ED physician performed an ultrasound of the right lower extremity due to suspicion of DVT, which was negative.  After 3 days of constant debates with the home health agency, my aunt was finally taken in to receive an ultrasound of the right lower extremity, which was positive for a DVT.  Although her INR level was still sub-therapeutic, they increased her Coumadin from 5mg qhs to 7.5mg qhs and then discharged her to home.  Her leg is still taut and grossly edematous, and she has also started to complain of pain/discomfort.  I\u2019m concerned about venous insufficiency resulting in tissue/muscle necrosis.  Should I be concerned?\n\n",

If her symptoms are persisting from the DVT she should also follow up with her doctor to be sure.  The filter should prevent any clots from traveling up to the lungs or brain as it dissolves but while it is present in the deep leg it may cause significant swelling.  Close follow up with her doctor is important.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Cavrose1,  This is a little bit of a difficult question to answer because it depends on the reason for the DVT to have occurred.  In general, after an appropriate period of time on an anticoagulant, such as coumadin,  the medication can be stopped there are no ongoing indications for anticoagulation.    If there were recurrent clots it may be recommended to continue some form of anticoagulation.  If your hematologist thinks it is OK to stop then it is likely safe to do so.  In general, tips to avoid future clots include staying well hydrated, not having prolonged periods of time without moving (such as taking long plane flights without getting up) and avoiding things that increase clotting risk such as smoking and using oral contraceptives in women.  Best wishes.\n\n",

However, it may only be temporary.  Like I said before I had about 15 blood test done and they all came back negative.  The only two in question were the protein s and protein c.  I will have my PT INR and these two test done again in two weeks.  If all is ok I will be able to stay off Coumadin unless I get another DVT of course.  But if those two test come back abnormal then my doctor said I will have to go back on the Coumadin because it will mean my blood has a tendency to clot.  Please wish me luck that these two test come back normal and thanks again for your help. cavrose1\n\n",

It is worse when I sit down & put pressure on the back of my leg while sitting.  Does anyone have any reccomendations?  Could it be nerve pain?

Generally speaking, when a clot is present, there is typically swelling and pain. As the condition worsens, symptoms may include warmth and redness or discoloration. It is certainly possible that you could have unknowingly injured your leg or lower back. That would also produce tingling sensations aside from other symptoms. I am glad to hear there is improvement but if symtoms worsen please notify your physician as a re-evaluation would be recommended. I hope this was helpful. Best wishes!

I was in the ER for 9 hours where all they did was run a EKG which came out abnormal & send me home with a copy of it, & told me to bring it to my doctor.  No strenuous activity until released by him.  I was very unhappy with that so I went to a different ER about 10 minutes down the road & was only there 2 hours.  They gave me an aspirin, did an EKG, hooked me up to a heart monitor, did X-rays & took blood.  They said I had no clots, did not have a heart attack & no pneumonia so they don't know what is causing the chest pain.  They gave me a \"GI Coctail\" & this helped some but I still had some chest pain.  The pain that stayed after I had the medicine was in my upper left chest, like a horizontal line that kept squeezing.  I also had residual pain from when the center of my chest was hurting, but it didn't keep on.  Is there any suggestions on what this could be?  I have never had heart problems before, so this is a little weird & scary for me.  I have been advised to see my doctor first thing monday morning & would like to have an Idea of what to expect.\n\n",

Sometimes an EKG can appear abnormal and it it be relatively insignificant. By the same token though it should not be brushed off as merely nothing unless it is evaluated by a specialist. Now as far as the chest pain you describe being somewhat relieved with a gi cocktail this indicates a relationship to a gastrointestinal disorder such as GERD(gastroesophageal reflux disease). I hope there has been improvement in your symptoms and an evaluation has been completed. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "title": "Re: high d-dimer postpartum",
    "content": "Hi Rene,  D-dimers are a factor that becomes elevated when blood clots split up some.  An elevation in the level would be indicative of some clotting in the bloodstream somewhere.  This test is often used to help detect a pulmonary embolism since, in cases where there is shortness of breath and other symptoms of a PE, an elevated D-dimer is expected to be coming from a clot in the lung blood vessels.    However, the d-dimer test is not specific for clots in the lungs.  If there was clotting somewhere else it would also cause an elevation in the test.  With a negative CT scan the probability of there being a PE goes down significantly.  Very small clots in the small blood vessels may be missed but these are less likely to be clinically significant.    Following pregnancy, there is likely to be clotting in the uterus (normal to help prevent bleeding following delivery of the placenta).  This would also make the d-dimer go up.  I am not familiar with the exact amount of elevation that would be expected in this case, though.  I suspect that since your levels are coming down it is likely related to your pregnancy and is less likely to be significant.  I would recommend you follow up with your doctor to be sure.  Best wishes.\n\n",

(The doctors said it was from the birth control I have been on for years.)  I'm currently in the hospital waiting for the Coumadin to start working so I can go home.  I will be on this medication for the next 6 months to a year. Ever since I have had symptoms of something wrong (chest pains, SOB) i have also been getting what have almost become the hives.  My hands and feet were very itchy and my lips were starting to puff up.  I thought I was just having some sort of allergic reation to something I had eaten, but then it happened every night.  When I finally found out about the clot, I mentioned it to the doctors and asked if it was some sort of reaction to the clot being in my lung.  The doctors didn't think so but did tell me that once I'm on the Coumadin a side effect could be hives or itching.  So, I guess my question for whoever is reading this would be: do you think that the reaction could be a side effect of the clot itself and not the drugs?  Maybe since it happens to people after they take the medicine, they assume it's a reaction to that, but instead it could actually be a reaction to the clot itself?  Also, to anyone who is reading this and has had a clot in their lung, did you have an allergic reaction before you started with the Coumadin?  I appreciate any answers you can give me. Thank you so much.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi 29inaz,  If your hives started before you began taking the coumadin it is almost certainly not from the medication.  I'm not aware of pulmonary embolism causing hives and an allergic reaction.  There are several viruses and other infections that can cause hives.  It is possible that you may have had an intercurrent problem such as an infection that was leading to the hives when you developed your PE.    Best wishes.\n\n",

I'm not sure which of the conditions you are referring to when you say major factors.  There are many, many clotting disorders.  The most common are Factor V leiden, prothrombin 20210 mutations, and antiphospholipid antibodies or lupus anticoagulant.  It will be very helpful to determine the cause if possible so future generations can also be aware of the condition and possibly be tested to assess their risk.  Best wishes.\n\n",

It may have been that you moved it or lifted something causing some increased pressure in the vein leading to it breaking.  The vein will heal on its own without difficulty.  Bruises, especially large ones, can take several days before they begin to resolve and full resolution can take a few weeks.  If it isn't getting better it is a good idea to have it checked out, though.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "22, overweight, PCOS, hypothyroidism, female.  Last Friday (11/16/07) I went to the ER with chest pain & shortness of breath.  The only test they did was a blood test to check for Pneumonia, A urinalysis to test for pregnancy & a chest X ray.  They said the chest X ray didn't reveal any 'significant' cardiovascular problems, but they told me I had Bronchitis.  I went for a follow up with my Dr. today and he said a regular X ray is not a good test to check for a blood clot/PE.  He said if I have anymore chest symptoms to call him or go back to the ER because my symptoms were symptoms of PE.  Since last friday I have had SOME chest pain but it is not near as bad as what it was.  I have had just below both rib cages, & right in the center (sternum).  My initial symptoms which sent me to the ER were severe chest pain in the center of my chest, severe back pain in the center/upper back, shortness of breath, rapid heart rate.  My thought was that the initial chest pain from the bronchitis made me have a panic attack, but I'd rather be safe than sorry.  I am considering going back to the ER because I still have pain in the center of my back & just around my left shoulder blade, but I haven't had any shortness of breath.  The chest pain has been VERY limited the past few days, more random than anything.\n\n",

    "content": "The chest x-ray is good for ruling out other lung problems that could cause your symptoms.  If you had shown risks or symptoms for PE, such as a deep vein thrombosis, they would probably do other studies to discover if there was a pulmonary embolism.  Generally ruling out other problems is first in the diagnostic process.    In most cases there will be breathing difficulty - shortness of breath, etc.  In some people, the first symptoms could be light-headedness, fainting, or seizures, resulting from a sudden decrease in the heart's ability to deliver enough oxygen-rich blood to the brain and other organs. Irregular heartbeats may also occur.  If a person has symptoms such as these, they will likely follow with diagnostic testing specific to pulmonary embolism.  The pain can be from the respiratory infection and bronchitis.  You're right to be cautious but you should be able to follow up with your regular doctor and avoid the ER unless you are truly in an emergency with breathing difficulty or other problems.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I wasn't sure if this was the right place for this question or if I should be in the neurology forum so if it's not please point me in the right direction.  I am 26 years old and back in April of this year I was 33 weeks pregnant and had what my neurologist believes was a mini stroke/TIA.  I had a sudden onset of a migraine, loss of peripheral vision in my right eye, numb/tingling in my right arm and hand, I had memory loss and a very hard time speaking.  I looked at my kids and knew who they were but I couldn't think of their names and couldn't say anything to them either.  I contacted my primary physician and he referred me to a neurologist who I saw a week later.  He did an MRI and ran blood work for stroke on a young person.  My MRI came back fine, he said that it had been too long since my symptoms to see any clots.  But my blood test showed some issues.  I had a low protein S and a high d-dimer.  My protein S Free was 34 and my d-dimer was 0.7  So my neurologist said that with those two test results he is sure that I had a blood clot in my brain.  I went back and had my protein S checked again after I gave birth and it was 70 which he said was normal so I was fine.    So here are my questions, I asked them to my neurologist and my primary doctor but didn't get much answers.  Can you tell how bad my clot was from my test results?  What are my chances of having another mini stroke/TIA or an actual stroke?  What do I need to be more careful of the rest of my life/what precautions do I need to take?   My Dr. told me that it was pregnancy related is that really the case?  Should I avoid having any more children?  Should I see a Hematologist?   Is there any type of medication that I should be on?  Thank you for your time in answering my questions.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, This must have been very frightening for you.    I know of no medications for post-TIA unless the doctor feels you need some type of blood thinner.  You are at a greater risk for another at some time or even for a stroke.  The good side of this is that you can make life decisions that would decrease your risk such as losing any excess weight, eating right and avoiding smoking,   If you ever experience such symptoms in the future, do not hesitate to go the the emergency department.    I do not believe it is cause to avoid having children unless your neurologist comes up with something more severe than this as a diagnosis.  Most people who have a TIA never experience another one.  But, at the same time you don't want to set yourself up for a stroke by eating poorly, etc.  Good luck\n\n",

I recently got labs checked and was iron deficent and my INR was at 1.5. They increased my warfarin and placed me on iron tablets.   They took blood and ran an IV in the large vein in my wrist that runs towards my thumb up the side.  It has been 4 days or so and I have had what appears to be clot in my wrist. You can feel that the vein is huge and it snaps back and forth when you very lightly glide your hand across the area. Also a large knot pops up on my hand periphrial to the vein, and appears to be effected by when I use the wrist. (it comes and goes) I figured I don't need to worry since it is a superficial vein but yikes it hurts like crazy, sometimes enough to make me have to sit and focus the pain away.  I don't want to be eating NSAIDS or pain killers if I do not have to, and due to the interactions with my warfarin. Should I worry about this? or is it common for superficial clots to hurt pretty badly?   I get nervous due to my history and have an appointment in a few days but ow! What will help?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Brokenseraph,  What you may be experiencing in the vein in your hand is thromboplebitis.  This is a condition where the vein becomes inflamed due to a blood clot in the vein.    If you have not been evaluated for clotting problems (ones that make you more likely to clot) I would strongly recommend this.  Possibilities include Factor Five Leiden, Prothrombin 20210, and Lupus anticoagulant among others.  I would be very suspicious that you have one of these conditions.  For most, the treatment is the same as you are doing now but knowing what the cause is is important because it can have implications for future issues.  Using some warm compresses may help your pain some as well.  Tylenol is safe to take with warfarin.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I didn't get confused and I don't recall any numbness anywhere, though I have had some pains in my left arm lately and tingling in my hands. I don't recall any pain anywhere else in my body.   The only problem I've been experiencing lately is a bit of sinus problem with our changeable weather.  Could this have caused the blurriness? Or could this have possibly been a TIA with no other symptoms?   It's probably nothing, but just thought I'd see if anyone has been through the same thing. I'm debating whether or not to contact my doc - I hate to seem like an alarmist.     I'm Female, 51, and had an aortic valve replacement/aneurysm repair in 1999. I'm on Warfarin and Tegretol for a seizure disorder.  Had an echo last year and all was fine.   Thanks in advance for any comments.   Cheers!\n\n",

It can be a serious issue if it continues.  There are other possibilities.  I think a TIA is less likely but possible.  Your doctor can help determine if further tests are needed and get a better sense of what is going on.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Have a question about my d-dimer results, but let me give a short history leading up to it:  I am a professional athlete, and in the very beginning of June I was diagnosed with 3 PE`s. Two very small, one medium. I was hospitalized for a week and put on warfarin. My INR was theraputic after 5 days, and has been between 2.2 and 2.7 without fail. I had a d-dimer done after 3 months (as prompted by the PREVENT study), and my doctor said the result was \"less than .01\", and that it was a remarkable result. My question is, what exactly does it mean? My doctor is very helpful but by no means a specialist and couldn`t  (or wouldn`t) tell me more than that.  The causes of my PE were clearly defined and were transient (and resolved). My main question, again, is what does it signify with a \"less than .01\" D-dimer result?  Thanks again!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi The Phoenix,  D-dimers are formed from the break down of clots.  So if the level is elevated it signals that there is increased clotting somewhere and for some reason.  In your initial case, the PE's are basically clots sitting in the pulmonary vessels.  They slowly breakdown (even in the early stages) causing the D-dimer to go up.  As the clots resolve, the d-dimer level will drop also.  Your low level is indicative of little active clotting going on.  This is the goal of the warfarin therapy and the low level is indicative that it is working.  I hope this helps some.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Today the breast on that side (left) has started lumping up similar to how it did when I was nursing my babies, who are now ages 12 and 8. My arm and left breast now hurt when I move or bump them. About six months ago I had some brown discharge (did not appear to be blood) in both my breasts, but no pain.(Prior to this, I had not had any breast discharge in seven years) Do you have any advice about what I should do?

    "content": "While this could be just some kind of muscle spasm, possibly related to extended sitting, the main worry is the possibility of a blood clot, which can be life threatening if it dislodges and travels to the lungs.  Many people show no symptoms even when they have a clot but yours do sound suspicious.   Because of this, it would be wise to see your doctor to have it evaluated.  When you call, tell them your symptoms so you don't have to wait for an appointment.  If you can't get in, you may need to go to a hospital emergency room.  Better to be safe here.  Call for emergency help (like 911 if you have that) if you begin having chest pain, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, fainting, or any other symptom that concerns you.  Do not drive yourself to the hospital in this situation.    If this is not a clot, you may still want to consider the possibility in the future.  For this reason I would suggest you talk with your doctor about the restrictions where you work so he/she could write a letter explaining the health needs of walking periodically to avoid such an injury.  It would be irresponsible for your employer to jeopardize the health of employees by refusing to allow adequate break time and opportunities to move around and avoid prolonged sitting.  We can assume the employer doesn't understand the risk and attempt to educate about this.    Best wishes.\n\n",

I couldn't recall what i did that would cause a bruise because by the way the bruise looked, it looked like it would have hurt and I'd remember.  When I found the bruise it was a yellowish green, which lead me to believe that it was older because I know they're that color when starting to heal. But throughout the week it started to turn blue with purple streaks. And now it is purple and red. I'm kinda confused because it seems to be going in reverse. There is no pain now, but the day i found it there was very little pain in one part near the edge.\n\n",

If it continues to get larger, if you develop more mystery bruises or if this one simply does not improve in the next week or so I would recommend that you see your doctor.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Im 28, female, and was diagnosed 3 yrs ago with chronic pericardits which lasted a bit over 2 years with constant pain. On corticosteroids 5 months and have been fine. About 5 weeks ago went to doc cause arms, legs felt like jello, really tired, neaseaus, odors made me sick, (not pregnant), loosing concentration, eyes blury, joints achy all the time, all muscles in body burned and ached all day terribly. Checked for thyroid, diabetes, sed rate, lupus, cbc, and h-pylori. Everything came back normal but came back high blood sugar. Took hba1c test came back normal.  About 1 week ago was standing doing dishes, and my heart flip flopped in my chest and this time it didnt stop also felt like being stabbed, I had this before but it was over very quickly. This time my legs and arms hurt and were sooo weak, my jaw clenched tight, I started fading in and out like I was gonna pass out. My neighbor rushed me to e.r. Gave me 4 baby aspirin, my blood pressure was high when I went in, and my heart rate fluctuated between 94-130bpm. They checked my blood and all was normal except and elevated d-dimer test. Had ct scan and chest xray and no blood clot was found. Also have this terrible ringing in my ears that wont go away. Had me on a holter moniter???? Going on tues. for another echo. Do you have any idea what could be happening to me? The doctors don't. Any info helpful. Family history= everyone on moms side has cardiovascular problems (pad) or heart attack, type 2 diabetes, dad side (grams had massive stroke at 28 and had to learn to read write and walk all over again)?? vnd4jesus\n\n",

    "content": "Dear VND4Jesus, Was it chronic effusive pericarditis, or chronic constrictive pericarditis?  What did they surmise was the initiating factor? When your heart did its flopping in your chest and you went to the ER, did they tell you what rhythm you were in at the time?  Certain arrythmias can contribute to inadequate cardiac output leading to inadequate perfusion to the rest of your body.  If your brain is robbed of adequate perfusion, you will pass out.  A heart rate that fluctuates between 94 and 130 seems suspiciously like an atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, or an atrial arrhythmia that translates into a sinus tachcardia/sinus arrythmia. There must have been a concern that there was indeed a cardiac dysrythmia for them to place you on a holter monitor whose intent is to record 24 continuous hours of heart rhythm.   Did your corticosteroids stop suddenly?  Steroids need to be weaned carefully or the body goes into withdrawal due to the action of inhibition to the adrenal glands by the steroids.  The symptoms of steroid withdrawal include:  weakness, fatigue, decreased appetite, and nausea (sound familiar?)   I am sure they must have done cardiac enzymes: were they also normal? Steroid withdrawal can also contribute to joint and even cardiac pain/arrythmia, and tinnitis ringing in the ears). Please ask your PCP if you are on the right type of weaning for your steroids.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello and thank you for answering. My doctor did not tell me wether it was constrictive or effusive pericarditis. When I had my first echo in 95 they said I had a small amount of extra fluid around my heart but the doc said it wasnt enough to be concerned about. I have been off steroids for over a year now, and yes I did gradually wean of as per the doctors request. No ma'am they did not give me rythm time. If they did cardiac enzymes they did not give me any answer about them. All the e.r doc said was that my d-dimer was elevated and so they gave me a ct scan and chest x-ray, but they did not find the blood clot. I have been very active and healthy for over the past year. don't smoke, drink or use any type of drug other than tylenol occasionally. How could my d-dimer be elevated but not find a blood clot and could it have traveled or broke apart? I am going in on the 9th of july 2007 to have another echo. I will let you know of any findings. Again thanks for the help. vnd4jesus\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there - What you've got there is a  really large bruise, and some of the blood has infiltrated the tissues because of the sheer size (and apparent depth) of it. This can  really irritate nerves that serve the area, and the burning sensation should slowly go away as the bruise dissipates. If it  doesn't, or if the leg becomes more painful, you might  need to have it looked at again, as an infection could  possibly develop in a bruised area of that size,  although it is unlikely.  Good luck to you. Hope you are feeling much better by now.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello - Given the potential for multiple clots to develop rather rapidly, a single  325 mg. aspirin is not excessive at all. Hopefully the vitamin therapy can help set the other components back into a better alignment, but meanwhile the aspirin is an excellent anticoagulant that is a lot less of a nuisance than, say, coumadin, and quite possibly just as effective.   To emphasize the answer to your last question, yes, your are at risk of developing one (or more) clots. You've had one,  and  that one was not that  remarkable in  itself, but now that you are known to be MTHR C677T positive, there is no ignoring the potential for additional clots. One  325 mg aspirin seems   like a pretty easy regimen. Just be sure to take it!  Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "My daughter was diagnosed in February with a blood clot in her right leg. It was determined to be in a superficial vein. The treatment prescribed was 2400 mg of ibuprofen per day, heat compresses and support socks.  Two months later, she now has three additional clots, one more in her right leg and two new ones in her left. Doctors have done ulstrasounds (several) and a lot of blood work. They haven't figured out what is causing the clots. Her only risk factor is birth control pills, which they took her off when she got the first clot in February. The doctor wants to do a CT scan of her torso, which we are in the process of attempting to schedule but our insurance is making things difficult.  In the meantime, I am concerned about her continuing to get clots and am wondering why she has not been given blood thinners? Is it because the clots are in superficial veins? Also, any theories as to what would cause blood clots in a young woman?  Thanks from a worried mom!\n\n",

These types of diseases make clotting much more likely.  You are correct that the superficial veins to not pose as much threat as a deep venous thrombosis (DVT) so this may be the reason that her doctor has not recommended blood thinners (which carry their own set of risks).  You may want to have her discuss the idea of taking a baby aspirin daily with her doctor.  This can help prevent clot formation and is relatively safe (but again does have a few noteworthy side effects that should be discussed).   Clot formation is multifactorial.  In women, estrogen is a big risk factor.  This is the reason that oral contraceptives are generally recommended against with blood clots.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I understand that the cost of healthcare can be prohibitive when there is no insurance, but the cost of not attending to something potentially serious can be even worse.  I strongly suggest you go to the nearest emergency room where they can do simple tests such as an EKG, and certain labwork, to determine if you are having a problem with your heart. You can make arrangements with the hospital, which has an obligation to see you, and pay over time.  To not address this early, and discover you have a correctable problem at your young age is not a good idea.  There is a department in many US hospitals (MEP) which can address Medicaid eligibility also, and help you apply if you meet the criteria. Your health depends on your choices.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Argylebairn, Generally speaking, signs and symptoms of a DVT (Deep vein thrombosis) when it occurs in the lower leg are: swelling, bluish discoloration or redness and warmth, tenderness in the calf especially when the foot is pulled upward, pain when walking (typically in the calf). Treatment typically consists of hospitalization for administration and monitoring of blood thinning medications, bedrest, to prevent a Pulmonary Embolism  where the clot breaks loose and travels to the lungs, and of course providing pain relief. DVT's do not subside without treatment. There are many risk factors one of which being inactive or sedentary for a long period of time such as during travel. Superficial thrombophlebitis is a clot in one of the superficial veins instead of the deep veins. The thrombus in this case usually adheres (or sticks) firmly to the vein wall and does not typically dislodge as sometimes happens with a DVT. In this condition, the area becomes red, warm and tender and typically feels like a piece of cord under the skin. Treatment for this condition does not generally require hospitalization. Pain is decreased by the use of NSAID's (Ibuprofen etc.) Symptoms usually subside over a few days time.  Untreated DVT's may develop into a life threatening emergency situations and if there is any question regarding symptoms, persisting or worsening etc. an evaluation is certainly warranted. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

I think your main problem is worry now. Other than that you seem to be safe. I do not think you need to go to your doctor's again. However, if you are still worried you could give her a call.  Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "You know this is very interesting because I haven't got DVT, but I do have an annoying little something that makes me curious more than worried. I get dizzy spells frequently and many of them seem to start when I cross my legs,  regular seated cross legs or Yoga-style cross, cross my ankles or stand on my toes. Just normal movements that people make every day trigger light-headedness. It's not debilitating, it's just odd, but was wondering if it is common for the system to work this way when blood flow is, I don't know the right word, compromised? I know this is funny to most people and I have humor about it as well, but I am terribly curious as to the mechanism that facilittes my dizzy spells.\n\n",

I go to the doc and they say all is fine, but then after I feel good for a couple days about what they said, I notice a new symptom having to do with dvt. I have worried a lot about my health in the past but usually the symptoms subside a lot when the docs say it's okay. This particular problem, however, has been going on for around 4 months and it's driving me CRAZY!!! I've gone to several docs now, had 1 ultrasound, but I still worry about it. I tell myself that in 4 months something would have happened with it, but I keep getting new, different feelings and pains in that leg. not worse, just different. I think there is something definately wrong with mine, whether it be nerve or muscular, but I'm just thinking the worst.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello there. I am a realatively speaking healthy for the most part 43 yr old male. I am not a doctor but dealing with the onset of blod clots is something I am extremely familiar with. If a clot is setting in in one of your legs you can easily associate the feeling with that of either a major muscle strain or cramp that just does not allow you to get comfortable. If you attempt to walk the pressure alone feels like you leg is being clamped off from the pressure.         The skin temputer will elevate localized and may radiate to the upper quarants of the limb then return to a colder feeling. There will not be a body increase in overall temp. Swelling will begin and will subside after resting the limb, such as in the morning after sleeping, if you can at this point. When speaking of blood clots for the most doctors do not worry too much about superficial ones or if they appear below the knee. When speaking of DVT the pain will begin to become unbearable to attempt to support full body weight.          To check for swelling apply light indented pressure from one finger, then remove quickly to check for rebound or indent remaining. When a clot has developed in the deep vascular area applying and releasing pressure will not show a color change. When the condition of DVT is establishing the pain will spread from the ankle region up above and into the thigh area. At this point mobility will become tasking at the least. The flesh coloring may become that of appearing as a sunburn in lower area and this is because of the lack of circulation.         Treatment consists of hospitalization of up to 5 days to modify clotting factors to proper level via a heprin IV and oral anti coags of Cumadin of varying mgs. The docs know this all too well. I have DVT in both legs and again in my right thigh that migrated into a puliminary embolism. When that happend it felt similiar to having a busted rib pressing into a lung while trying to cough up blood. Sitting with the feet elevated above the heart for periods of 1/2 to one hour during the day is more likely than not. Protime levels need checked regularly and more than likely a supply of either Warfrin or Cumadin will be required. Common swelling of the feet, ankles and calves will occur. The chances of leg ulcers and brutal edema are associated side affects.                  In short if you develop a clot it will start off feeling like a bad cramp that will not stop.\n\n",

    "title": "Blood clot again?",
    "content": "I am now 20 (21 in May) but when I was 17 (almost 18) I was about 5 months pregant when I was put into the hospital with 2 blood clots, one superficial and one DVT. They put me on Lovenox thoughout the rest of the pregnacy and after I gave birth they put me on Coumadin. After being on that for a few months and going to a specialist they did some blood tests and told me everything looked fine and I could stop taking the meds. That it must have just been from the pregnancy that I got the clots since there was really no history of it. They said I would only have to worry about going back on them if I got pregnant again.  Now I have been noticing ( and I don't know if I am just paraniod of it happening again or what) but my left leg (the one that had the clots) always seems to be more swelled up than the right. (not near as bad or big as it was with the clots though) But it is a significant difference between the sizes. Also every once in a while that leg will just get a pain in it and I get really scared and wont let any one touch it,( my fiance will want to massage it to make it feel better) but incase it is a clot, I am afraid of it breaking loose so I wont let him touch it.  And for the past couple of weeks every once in a while I get these warm sensations that go runnig down my leg. (the best way to describe it is that it feels like I am peeing down my leg, but on the inside) I have just been blowing them off, not thinking much of it. But then my fiance said something like 'well what if your blood is having small blockages and thats when you feel that warmth is when the blockage breaks free. And it could be related to the clots.'  So it got me thinking again and also a little worried.  So I have a couple questions. Is it normal for my leg to still swell up even though the clot is suposed to be gone? And do the warm sensations have anything to do with possible clotting?  Do you think I may be getting another clot or is it just still after effects? (or am I just paranoid?)  Thank you in advance!!!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Heavenlyangel,  One of the complications of having a deep venous thrombus in the leg is destruction of the valves of the veins where the clot was. The function of such valves is to make blood go in a forward direction and prevent it from going in a backward direction. If this happens, the blood in the veins usually stagnates and this leads to a condition known as post-phlebitic limb where there is pain and edema in the affected leg in addition to some skin changes as well.  i think you should be evaluated by your doctor to tell you how to deal with such comolication if this is the case.  i can not tell you without examining you and getting an ultrasound of the legs whether or not you have a new blood clot.

    "content": "Hello Rbro3079 - First of all I would second nurse Jones' advice concerning an evaluation at a facility where there is a program in place to help uninsured people get the medical attention they require. In a number of states now are laws requiring every patient be treated for emergent conditions regardless of their ability to pay. Your problem falls under the \"emergent\" category. You have clearly sustained a testicular trauma. While this could possibly resolve on its own over time, I certainly wouldn't want to sit around and wait for that to happen - if it even can resolve on its own.   From your description of the situation you definitely should be seen, treated and followed up. These injuriies are not usually extremely serious, but only a real-time examination can determine this for sure. Meanwhile you are in what has to be pretty exquisite discomfort. It's not worth worrying about the potential expense right now, and again, it is likely there is a facility or at least a private practice doctor willing to work with you on the cost of an exam and care.   I hope you will be seen soon and please stay in touch.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Apreal - Your bruising could be a cause for concern or it could be something as simple as bumping into something in the middle of the night. Tell me, are these bruises just on your legs or are they in other places as well? Do they appear in a random pattern or do they appear symetrically on both sides of your body? (as in the same place on both legs, etc.).   If this is due to a vitamin definciency it would most likely be Vitamin K, which helps make our clotting factor. Failure to include adequate green leafy vegetables in one's diet could lead to a Vit. K deficiency.   It's possible also that the anti-depressant you're taking might  have an obscure side effect that could affect clotting, or if you've been taking frequent, higher doses of NSAIDS (such as ibuprofin as found in Advil).   Some basic blood work might be in order to rule out a vitamin deficiency, blood disorder or some form of anemia.   Good luck to you and if you can add any information it might help clarify the picture somewhat.\n\n",

    "title": "Leg Pain",
    "content": "I'm not sure where to post this, so I will post it here.   About 8/9 months ago, while carving I slipped and stabbed my leg. My legs are average to small in size. The wound site is approx 4\" above my right knee. It is a hair right of center. About a 1/4\" in length It bleed severely, and I did not seek medical treatment. I just tried to care for it myself. I don't know if my problem is caused by the stab wound or what. However due to it's location I thought I would ask.   The problem: Approx 2\" down is a hard odd shaped area, no pain involved. To the right and more lateral is a swollen area the size of my fist. It is sometimes painful and is becoming more painful more frequently. Sometime sharp pain radiates up my leg about 6\". Sometimes only the site hurts. And sometimes, lately it hurts off and on for hrs. Could this be something related to the stabbing? Should I think about having it looked at? Or is the normal?   Thanks for your help in advance. LaDonna\n\n",

    "content": "Dear LaDonna, I appreciate your efforts to describe the exact location of the problem in your leg, and the obvious careful thinking you have put into deciding what is wrong.  Without being able to see you directly, and assess your leg first hand, it is difficult to come up with a definitive diagnosis. There are so many things that can cause or contribute to lumps and bumps, and it really needs to be addressed with diagnostic equipment and tests that can better pinpoint the problem and the underlying cause. It seems somewhat unlikely that an incident that occurred 8 months ago would all of a sudden now cause an acute problem such as you have described.  At the same time, it is possible that an unresolved cut may have not healed properly, and contributed to a slowly developing problem that has now gotten bad enough to warrant your concern. In either event, I would strongly suggest that you see your primary physician, and if you do not have one to go to one of the walk in clinics, or urgent care facilities for a medical professional to evaluate. From what you are describing, this may not resolve on its own unattended, and may signal a problem that may quickly become of urgent concern (if it is not so already!)\n\n",

When I said the lateral area was the size of my fist, I should have said, it's the size of my fist in circumference, not that is is swollen in depth as the size of my fist. In terms of depth I can feel it with my had and see it, but if you were to look at my legs out of the blue you may not notice it. If that makes any difference.

    "content": "Dear LaDonna, I appreciate the clarification.  One of the things I teach is that Pain is not your enemy - it is a sentinel - it tells you when something is wrong.  It is always wise to identify the etiology of a pain.  Sometimes pain and soreness and even hardened areas on our extremeties are merely the result of a localized trauma such as banging your leg on a table or other hard object.  Sometimes it can be more serious - such as a hematoma (oversize blood clot - if you will) under the surface of the skin.  This latter one deserves further inspection because the source of the bleed should be identified. My concern for you is that you are obviously concerned.  Our bodies \"talk\" to us, and when we listen well we eat well, live well, and treat our bodies well.  If yours is telling you something is wrong, and you are not able to easily identify just exactly what is wrong, then a specialist in bodies - called an MD - might be needed to help you do so.  I still suggest you have your concerns evaluated at your primary care physician's office, or at a walk-in clinic.\n\n",

My legs are aching so bad I cannot sleep.  Now I had a breast reduction 5 years ago and am not sure if maybe that might be causing some pain.  I also keep getting headaches around my eyes and sometimes a tingly feeling in my arms and at the back of my head.  Also get a warm feeling through my chest, down my back and arms.  The chest hurts to touch on top (in breast area) and underneath in rib cage.  I am on anti-depressant celexa, have ibuprophen 600 for pain and also take prevacid for acid reflux-although I never had heartburn.  Can anyone give me some help as to what is going on because I am so afraid of a blood clot forming.  Also had pain in throat-hurts to push on it but not to swallow\n\n",

If there is concern for DVT's the most appropriate test is a doppler ultrasound to look at the blood vessels and assess for clots.  Your symptoms have many possible causes.  Embolising clots may cause your symptoms.  Other possible causes may include panic attacks, vasculitis, and other nerve problems.  I would strongly recommend that you see your doctor for an examination.  DVT's can potentially be serious and should be evaluated for if there is a possibility they exist.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "If you are having unbearable pain, an emergency room visit is reasonable.  If you are comfortable, you can likely wait.  What was your CT scan of?  If it was of your legs, by chance, and they did not see any clots you are unlikely to form any new ones while you are on blood thinners.  I think the likelihood of your initial symptoms being caused by embolized clots is also low.  There are several nerve disorders where damaged nerves cause pain.  Your symptoms seem fairly diffuse.  Fibromyalgia is a possibility.  A peripheral neuropathy could potentially cause these symptoms as well.  Without a full examination I am not able to get any more specific.  Hope this helps a little.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Sandscollins, According to your post, you had a blood test (probably a D-Dimer) that came back positive, and caused your MD to order a CT of the chest to rule out/rule in a Pulmonary embolus.  I understand that this test came back with a result of \"low probablilty for a PE\", which typically would clear you for any clots in the lungs. However, the fact that you are experiencing calf pain is cause for alarm - because a DVT (deep vein thrombosis) which is frequently situated in the lower extremeties, would also cause a D-Dimer to read high.   I strongly encourage you to go immediately to the nearest Emergency room and tell the ERMD of your current concerns. They will probably order an ultra sound of your leg (s) to determine if there is a clot there.  A clot anywhere in the body is cause for significant concern, as it can break off and travel through the blood stream and lodge in the brain, heart, lungs, kidneys, etc.  The treatment for this generally includes some form of anticoagulation therapy - the choice being predicated upon the nature of the clot and the location. There are other treatments included as well, involving in most cases complete bed rest for a period of time to be determined by the MD.  Please address this urgently.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Guest,   There are 2 types of blood vessels, veins and arteries.  Superficial thrombophlebitis is a condition that affects superficial system of veins.  Veins contain valves that make the flow of blood towards the heart and prevent its \"backward\" movement away from the heart.  If the superifical vein is affected by inflammation or thrombus formation (two different disease processes), and if inflammation or thrombus formation happens to involve the area where a valve is present, most probably this valve will be affected and will be destroyed leading to regurgitation of blood and its stagnation in the veins, leading to dilatation of the veins, a condition known as varicose veins.  Yes, the veins in the thigh contain valves.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and I hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

I have since been told by 2 other neurologists that they would have started me on Aggrenox instead of Plavix.  The best I can find out by internet research is that Plavix acts by coating platelets with a smooth surface so they won\u2019t stick together, and the active ingredient in Aggrenox, ER-DP, acts as a vasodilator. Is there any information  or study addressing the theory that a combination of these would add symbiotically ?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello dynodub - I apologize for being so late in replying to your question but it somehow got by me. Oh, by the way, I'm not an MD, but an allied health professional. Still, I think I can answer your question. Here goes:  Aggrenox is, as you accurately point, out a vasodilator, or at least contains something (dipyridamole) which has that property. It also, however, contains aspirin. While on paper Plavix and Aggrenox should provide increased protection, and Aggrenox has become very much favored by doctors for its protective capabilities regarding strokes, adding aspirin to a Plavix regimen increases one's bleeding potential to an undesireable (because potentially dangerous) degree. While aspirin has anti-coagulant properties, Plavix reduces the viscosity of blood. The combination could, in a worst-case scenario, lead to a very dangerous and difficult to stop bleed.   If you feel you might be better served by Aggrenox than Plavix (a controversial issue) I would strongly suggest you contact your doctor, asking if he would be willing to prescribe a trial of Aggrenox. If he doesn't feel it's appropriate he probaby has his reasons and since I don't have access to your chart  (nor the authority of an MD), I wouldn't second-guess such a decision on the part of any MD.   In any event I would discontinue the aspirin unless specifically recommended by your doctor, for the reasons stated above. You've already noted that your self-medication with the aspirin might be risky, and you are correct. Since Plavix does not cause blood vessel dilation, any signifcant increase in blood pressure could result in a bleed on the brain that would be far more serious than an ischemic stroke.  Hope this helps answer your question.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear sarta - Given your description of the hand as being somewhat bluish as compared with the other one, and given that there is some sensory distortion or loss in it, there are two possibilities that come to mind right away, probably working in tandem to cause this: first, one would expect this sort of presentation possibly in someone who suffers from Thoracic Outlet Syndrome (TOS), a condition in which the structures of the scalene triangle (composed of the collar bone and first rib, an area where the ulnar nerve and blood vessels feeding the arm and hand pass between) become a little too close together, putting pressure on the nerves and blood vessels serving the arm and hand. This is a common, if controversial finding, and can cause pain, numbness, tingling in the hand on the affected side, as well as chest pain, shoulder discomfort, poor venous return, etc. Not serious but often annoying and sometimes causing limiitation of movement or difficulty doing repetitive tasks, it can be the result of an anatomical abnormality, poor body mechanics or an injury such as whiplash.   The other possible cause, and one which might show up this way because of a mild underlying TOS that hadn't caused problems previously, would be the use of Inderal, which can, in many patients, cause coldness and even some discoloration in the hands and feet due to constriction of capilaries as one of its side effects. If this is of new onset, it may be because you started the Inderal and perhaps have a mild TOS problem on the affected side.   Your doctor could do a simple screening test that involves taking your pulse at the wrist on the affected side while elevating and manipulating the arm. This isn't the gold standard but can be a useful tool for determining if TOS may be present. Often there is nothing much worth doing about it. If it causes considerable pain and limitation of motion, TOS can sometimes be surgically corrected, but usually it is managed with some simple exercises, posture awareness and practicing good body mechanics. It's not serious in any event, but you might want to have your doctor take a look at this to be certain there isn't some other, really obscure and unusual cause for the symptoms. It seems pretty likelly it is a combination of TOS and Inderal use, but of course only your doctor can say for certain.   Good luck to you with this, and please keep us updated as to any changes or anything new you may find out about it.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,   The chest contains many organs, like the heart, lungs with its pleural covering, esophagus, muscles, ribs, tendons, and nerves. They all can be the source of the pain felt in the chest.   - It sounds like muscle spasm is the cause of your symptoms.   Muscle spasm alone can cause this pain which can be an unidentified cause but in many cases is the result of inappropriate posture for long time like traveling, driving, carrying heavy objects, and certain types of work.   Muscle spasm can also occur due their inflammation (viral infection) or overexertion of the chest wall muscles following heavy long attack of coughing. Tenderness over the affected areas is usually present.   - Pleurisy is an inflammation of the pleura, which is a double-layered membrane covers the lungs separating it from the rib cage. Viral infections like flu, are the most common cause of Pleurisy. The pain is felt as sharp pain which get worse by Coughing, sneezing, moving and deep breathing.  Auscultation of the chest shows a characteristic sound known as pleural rub.  Other causes (less likely): -Pain due to rib or chest wall bone disease (costochondritis of viral origin) is also another cause of chest pain.   In all of these conditions the chest pain is usually aggravated by taking deep breath and cough.   Cardiac causes should be excluded in any case of Chest pain although your symptoms are not typical.   Direct clinical examination is essential.  I advise you to follow up with your doctor.  Keep us updated.  Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 70 yr. old male with a cardiac pacemaler implanted. I have been monitored for warfarin use by family doctor since implantation almost 3 years ago.  Minor adjustments to warfarin level have been made during this period.   I recently moved to a new city and have a new physician.  His technician used the same machine my previous doctor's tech did.  I observed several differences in protocol which were disturbing: 1) She inserted a test strip into the machine, then stuck my finger applying the blood drop directly to the test strip, not via pipette as done previously.   2) to get a large enough drop of blood she squeezed or pinched my finger. 3) The first test strip produced an error. She put in a new test strip, and pinched my finger even harder to get more blood from the original stick.  This test failed as well. 4) She put in a third test strip and pinched my finger REALLY hard to get blood from the original stck (now about two minutes has elapsed). 5) This third test yielded a reading of relatively (compared to past) low INR.  I am concerned because I had been led to believe that the blood from a finger stick must be sampled within 15 seconds of the stick.  Was this multiple attempt to get a reading from one stick correct?  Doesn't pinching the finger hard cause other fluid to exit the stick wound?  By the way, this technician did not wear any hand gloves during any part of the procedure.  Thanks for any advice or comments......\n\n",

My mother had High Blood Pressure, Angina, a heart attack in her early 40's and died from a stroke at 61.  Could I be experiencing TIA's?

Symptoms may include weakness, numbness of the face, arm, leg, one the same side of the body, dizziness or lack of coordination, slurred speech, dizziness, visual disturbances, etc. Temporaryy interuption of blood flow to the brain is the causative factor. Diagnostics may include, a carotid ultrasound (to identify if there is decreased blood flow in the carotid arteries), arteriogram (to identify if there is blockage in one of the other vessels), etc.  Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "I'm 20 years old, female. I was earlier concerned about a dvt, since I had right leg pain for around 2 months. I just got an ultrasound that came out negative. But the day after, all my leg pain was gone but i noticed that at times it has been hard to breathe in, and my chest feels like there is pressure on it and my lungs won't expand, and a slight pain in my chest and back, also like a slight lump in my throat. My heart also starts to beat really fast and I feel dizzy, but I don't know if that was from a panic attack or not. I took a xanax and it subsided. I always have to clear my throat and force myself to cough to get up all this phlegm, which is clear, light yellow, and ocassionally a darker brownish-yellow. I've noticed a slight amount of blood, rarely, but I don't know if this is serious or because of my forceful coughing and \"hawking\" all the time. I am concerned that maybe I really did have dvt but it moved to my lungs before they caught it...or would something still have showed up on the ultrasound showing that there was recently a clot there? Also if it were PE, would the symptoms subside and then return later? I'm reluctant to go back to the E.R. since I was just there and don't wanna go broke from these visits. Thanks much!\n\n",

    "title": "Syncopal Episode",
    "content": "Hi:  I would recommend that your wife have some further testing to confirm the cause of her syncope (the medical term for \"fainting\").  The most common cause of syncope is what is known as vasovagal syncope...A classic case of vasovagal syncope would be a slightly dehydrated person in a warm room who feels faint and weak, maybe a little nauseated and shaky, sees their vision dim, then passes out for a few seconds.  This is very common and not a serious medical problem.  Anxiety may also cause syncope by hyperventilation.  This is also not a serious medical issue, but would require better treatment of the anxiety or panic attacks to prevent recurrence. There are however other more serious causes of syncope.  It is possible for a young woman to have a heart arrhythmia that would produce a sensation of anxiety, breathlessness, chest pressure and syncope.  Your wife should definitely have an ECG to rule out this possibility.  A 24 hour recording by a Holter monitor would be ideal (this is a little device you wear on your belt for a day, that records your heart rhythm). Many medications can also predispose to syncope, particularly blood pressure medications and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs).  What is the medication that your wife takes for anxiety? Did the doctor do any blood tests (this would be important to rule out low blood sugar or anemia, among other things)?  Does your wife make any movement while she is unconscious?  Does she wake up immediately, or does she seem confused when she wakes up? While most cases of syncope are not due to a serious medical illness, it is very important to have some further testing done to rule out the rare, but potentially serious causes.  Please return to your doctor asap!  - Reid Perala, MD (medical resident)\n\n",

A thrombosis may affect superficial veins. Superficial thrombophlebitis may cause inflammation, pain, tenderness, warmth, and the vein feels much like a cord. This usually lasts a short amount of time, doesn't require hospitalization for treatment and since the vein is not encompassed by contracting muscles as the deep veins are, rarely does this condition cause any sort of life threatening complications.  If however, you are still experiencing symptoms, you may want to have a re-evaluation. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

However, for the past 2 plus months, I have been having right leg problems. it started as a  pinching pain in the calf. Then thigh pain came, with a burning sensation in the lower thigh, right above the knee, and a very \"thin\" sharp pain in the inner thigh. Also there has been sharp pains in the inner knee,and an intense \"bone pain\" in the shin, ankle, and foot, and a bruised buttock feeling. The most recent pain is in the hip, outer and inner thigh, groin, and lower right abdomen with low back pain(rarely). It is dull,achey, and warm. The pain in the calf is almost gone. it's intermittent, and worse at night it seems. There has not been outward signs. I'm worried I could have had an undiagnosed dvt that moved into the hip/groin/thigh area, but am not sure if it's possible or likely. I have been to 3 doctors, they all say i have no reason to have dvt (although I went through an inactive period) and won't give me an ultrasound. Does this sound like something to be worried about?  Thank you!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Nelly,  The constellation of symptoms you describe is most unlikely to be caused by a DVT.   Moreover, if the underlying problem was due to a DVT then you would expect some swelling (and possibly hardness) in the right calf and this clearly is not the case.  No, your symptoms sound much more likely to be due to a disc lesion in your lumbar spine and I suggest that you have an MRI scan arranged to confirm this.  Best wishes,  DJ\n\n",

Although heart is filled with blood, but it takes nothing from it. Llike every other part of body, it has to be supplied its share by two arteries called Coronary arteries. (coronary=relating to heart)  You can decrease your chances of getting it by: 1. Refrain from smoking or stop it if you do. 2. Take regular excercise 3. Choose a diet low in cholesterol  Some studies have proposed a genetic element to this as well.  I hope that answered your query.\n\n",

A D-Dimer is a test typically used to help identify certain conditions including a pulmonary embolism. Elevations, due to the nonspecifity of this test, may be caused but several conditions, for example, recent trauma or surgery in the preceeding three months, fever, infection, blood clots anywhere in the body, and malignancies. Was there any other diagnostics completed, for example, an ultrasound of your leg, or a VQ scan? If not and you are still experiencing symptoms, I would strongly suggest that you inquire with your physician about these diagnostic studies. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

I appreciate all of the help you can give me. :)  Dear Holmes,  As I always do, let me preface this by saying that I am just a medical student and not a full physician yet.  So also as always, none of the information provided is supposed to be substituted for the sound medical advice of your physician.    Now, in regards to your situation, I can definately understand the frusteration you must be going through.  I hope you are coping well while your doctors try to manage your care.      I don't know if your doctor has explained how clotting necesarily works in your body but hopefully this will better help you better understand the pathophysiology behind your condition.  Just like there are factors in your body that help you form clots when there are injured vessels; quite intuitively, there are also factors that help break up these clots.  Most pertinent to your case, a substance called antithrombin III is formed by your body and helps break down clot forming factors to prevent you from over clotting.  Just like antithrombin, another anticoagulant factor naturally produced by your body is called Protein C.  Protein C also aids in breaking down clots.  So as a result, a deficiency in any of these factors may cause you to hypercoagulate and cause a DVT.   So when your doctor put you on enoxaprin (Levanox), this drug was meant to accentuate the features of antithrombin III and enhance the break down of the clot.  The coumadin that you are placed on is a drug that prevents the metabolism of Vitamin K.  Vitamin K is important because it is needed in order to form various clotting factors.  Also important however, is that vitamin k is essential in the formation of Protein C and S.  The same protein C and S that are required to break down clots.  So, by putting you on coumadin, the drug is preventing the metabolism of vitamin k, which is a significant molecule necessary for the formation of Protein C, hence - your lab work shows a decreased protein C level.  So the bottom line is, your Protein C levels are low because you are on coumadin.  They could also be low because you had a genetic deficiency of Protein C but given the current scenario, your coumadin is leading to the low Protein C count.  However, if your physicians take you off coumadin, give you vitamin K, and your protein C levels don't elevate - you might have an inherent protein C deficiency (although this isn't very likely).    I hope this helps and doesn't confuse you.  Just to reassure you again, I would not be worried of any type of serious cancerous condition if I were you.   Sincerely,  Student Doc\n\n",

I  tested positive on the Factor V Leiden test; ALLELE 1, mutation present.  (Whatever that is.)  I understand the interpretation on this report, though.    My blood pressure is normal.  I don't take medications, vitamins other than ibuprofen for occasional pain.  My job is very sedentary, but I swim at least three times a week, 1 h 15 m to 1 h 30 min per workout.  My questions are:  1)  Are there any residual effects from a PE?  My PE was very painful, and I feel the area has healed well.  I will have pain/pressure -- not anything to take medication for -- about an inch to my left of my sternum, even with my nipple, where it feels as if someone is poking with their finger, small area, but internal.  Any thoughts?  2)  On occasion, I will have achiness in my upper thighs, more noticeable around my cycle.  Before I had my PE, my hips hurt where it would be hard to even walk.  It's not the same pain.  I just don't know if I'm having possible circulation problems where I should let my doctor know.    Any information would be appreciated.\n\n",

Most PE are very minute ones , not causing a large enough infarct to have any lasting symptoms. If you had a large PE your condition at the time would be a serious one and you would be critically ill and you would be on ventilator.   If the PE was small it would heal and in any case it would not throw any symptoms on the chest wall after this much lapse of time. This pain is more in the nature of musculoskeletal one.  The second question: Heaviness and pain in the inner thighs is common around the periods as pevic blood flow increases and there is generalised engorgement in the area.  For your height you maintain a good weight and keep up your exercise schedule. never again take oral contraception.  A. Madia\n\n",

    "content": "I had, as stated in the topic title, an ovarian cyst burst last week and had the extreme pain that went with it (low blood pressure resuled along with tachycardia and syncope) and went to the ER where I underwent CT scans and blood tests.  EKG came back normal.  I developed an infection two dyas later as I was not prescribed an antibiotic at the outset.  I was then put on 400mg avalox and had been on Vicodin and Naprosyn.  I am still on avalox but last night developed pain on the right side of my chest and around to the back side of my right shoulder blade.  I again went to the ER and again experienced syncope and tachycardia.  They did blood tests and chest x-rays to test for a pulmonary embolism but both came back negative, EKG came back normal. (I have since read that you can get false negative reports on the blood tests and that it does not always show up on early chest x-rays).  I was diagnosed with costalchondritis (?) and/or pleurisy.  My questions are 1) can my original ovarian cyst rupture be considered a trauma bad enough to cause a PE and 2) if I am on antibiotics, is it reasonable to believe that I could develop a bacterial infection such as pleurisy?  Sorry to be so long winded but any answers I could recieve would be most helpful.  Thanks for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Pilotgirl,  I am sorry to hear of your traumatic event, hopefully all is going well for you.  Ovarian cysts are extremely painful but usually do not cause any type of threat for pulmonary emboli (PE).    Pleurisy is the infection of the parietal and visceral pleuras which line the inside of the rib cage. When a breath is taken, they rub together and this causes great pain.You are on an anti-bacterial medication which would probably stop a bacterial infections but pleurisy can also be caused by smoking, bacterial or viral infections or it may have an idiopathic cause. The pain in pleurisy will start suddenly and painfully in a stabbing fashion when you take deep breaths and can be felt in the lower chest area and around to your back.  Pulmonary Embolism (PE) is a blockage in the lungs blood vessels that is usually caused by air, fat, particle, fluid or blood clot traveling from another part of the body. When the ER department did the pulmonary (lung) scan on you they probably looked at the blood flow through your pulmonary vessels to see if there was a blockage of blood flow. If you think you have a high probability of getting a PE have your doctor do a blood test to see if you are susceptible to clots.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I was diagnosed with 3 blood clots (DVTs) in my calf at the beginning of April. Since then, I have been on coumadin. I see that side effects of coumadin could be dizziness and fatigue, but I am now getting to the point where I can barely function. I am so light-headed and fatigued that it is difficult to perform any regular duties. Additionally, I have no appetite and have lost about 10 pounds in the last 2 weeks. I am a 42 year old male. I also have hemochromatosis and hypothyroidism. My synthroid has been raised after checking my TSH once I begun coumadin therapy. Is it possible these symptoms are from the coumadin? The hematologist I went to said that coumadin would not cause these effects, but these symptoms are getting progressively worse. I have an appointment with my family doctor next week. I am wondering if he would go along with doing another ultra sound of my leg to see the status of my clots and then allow to go off the coumadin a couple months early. Thank you very much for any input. Sean\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Sean,  I'm a 40 year old RN &  have an extensive DVT in  my femoral vein and have been on Coumadin since Feb of this year.  I have had the DVT since March of 2004 and do not recommend requesting to go off of your coumadin until your DVT is gone.   My family doctor took me off of my anticoagulant after 4 1/2 months and started me on an aspirin a day and I developed 2 new clots. Back to square one.    My advise to you would be to get an emergency appointment with your doctor or go to a walk in clinic or ER & get checked for a small pulmonary embolism, which may cause you to feel lightheaded and tired. You shouldn't be feeling so exhausted and lightheaded that you can't do your usual daily activities.  Do you have shortness of breath with activity, a cough or chest pain?   I think you should also have your TSH checked again to see how you are responding to your new dosage of Synthroid.   As you probably already know it could be due to the hemochromatosis,  so you'll probably need to get that checked too. I've been having problems with lightheadedness in the last 2 weeks too, but my blood pressure has been on the low side and I get PVC's (preventricular contractions) so I think mine is due to that.  The thought has crossed my mind that I should maybe get checked for a PE too.  In fact that is why I came to this site today.  I'm getting tired of feeling lightheaded and not being sure what is causing it too.  It's not to the point that it's debilitating for me though, it just comes and goes.   I wish you luck Sean !  Let me know how it turns out. My e-mail address is  a_z5590@yahoo.com  It's nice to have support from someone going through similar problems.  They should have an online DVT support group.

    "content": "Dear esorami, Warfarin dose really depends on her INR (International normalized ratio) results and the target INR which her doctor wants to reach. For stroke and infarction that would mostly lie in the range of 2.0-3.0. As for what causes her blood to thicken, well, there are many causes. I would put atherosclerosis in your mother's case at the top of the list. Best regards,\n\n",

    "title": "warfarin",
    "content": "The dose of coumadin ( WARFARIN) is usually adjusted based on the INR, in patients with infarctions usually, the goal is to keep the INR: 2-3, for patients with mechanical valve replacements, the goal is to keep it 2.5-3.5. there are many risk factors for causing blood to become thicker, atherosclerosis, atrial fibrilattion, hyperlipidemia (high lipids), diabetes complications, some blood clotting factors deficiencies, and smoking. I do not have information about your mother's medical conditions, however , since she is taking warfarin at home, it is very important, to regularly check her INR, because there seem to be lots of drug-drug interaction, as well as food-warfarin interaction , which may either potentiate the blood thinnig effect of warfarin, or decrease its effectiveness, making it less effective is resolving the blood clots. and for that, i may recommend watching or avoiding vitamin K containing food products as they may reverse the action of warfarin. usually the dark green vegetables contain high contents of letuce. Some drugs when taken together with warfarin, can also affect the latter drug. Check to see with your mother's doctor, whether she is taking some drugs that may affect it, and remember , that warfarin dosing remains to be dosed according to the measured INR. thank you and hope that helped.\n\n",

    "content": "Recently I spent a whole day travelling by subway, then train, then bus, then plane and had to lug my luggage (weighing 50 lbs but on wheels) sometimes up steps while also wearing a heavy backpack on my back.  (My other bruises from this trek look like normal bruises...and I don't remember them either.)  I don't remember this injury or blow but on the underside my right forearm near my elbow is a bruise 2 1/2 to 3 inches inches across.  I thought I had a mosquito bite because of the bump in the center of the bruise but there was never any itching.  Now 6 days later the bruise is fading but the bump is still there and remains pale while the purple around it is fading.  The bump is somewhat tender.  What caused this?  Is this a burst blood vessel?  Will the bump go away (dissolve)?  Thank you, in advance, for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi slam, The reason I asked the questions was to have a better understanding of what may be the problem. There are certain positions that the foot can be manipulated when assessing someone for signs and symptoms of a blood clot, which apparently seems probably not to be so in your case. If the redness, tenderness, warmth, and swelling has increased in size over a period of time I would be more inclined to consider cellulitis of which the symptoms appear to coincide. As you well know it would be impossible for anyone to \"diagnose\" a problem online, the purpose is to give supportive information, not to replace an evaluation by your physician.

When bacteria enters  the skin by any means, insect, animal bite, injury or trauma, etc. it causes the skin in that area to become inflamed, red, and tender. As the infection spreads so does the inflammation, redness and tenderness. Again I'm not saying that this is your problem but it is something I would consider. In my opinion, I would have an evaluation done.  Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

There are other causes for the symptoms, for example,  the numbness in the arm, hand and fingers may be related to compression of the nerves in the wrist etc. In my opinion, anytime there is unexplained numbness accompanied by symptoms affecting the head, vision etc. this requires medical attention.

    "content": "I am writing asking a question in concern for my mother.  She has a very extensive medical history. I will try to review as in depth but breif as possible.  A little more than 2 years ago she had a 4 bypass surgery. which didnt take very well. She has had 4 heart caths after 3 of them she wound up in ICU on a vent. had surgery after the last one for internal bleeding in her belly when they pulled it out. before the surgery she really didnt have any other medical problems amybe a little depression. She has since moved cities and began seeing differnt doctors than the ones who performed her bypass surgery. She has been hospital many times due to chest pains. Recently she was hospitalized due to an infection in her leg. While she was there the doctors treated her with antbiotics to heal the infection in the mean time her white blood count dropped significantly low and her blood pressure dropped she had renal failure and was put in ICU on dopamine. Once she got out of ICU they couldnt get her white blood count increased. and they also diagnosed her with hep c. as many blood test and doctors she has been too an had she was never diagnosed with hep c before now. she couldnt walk while in ther her foot even after the infection cleared hurt to bad to put pressure on it. While she was in the hospital and on the dopamine the iv infiltrated and she has a large open wound on her hand she is seeing a wound care specialist for but since she has been home and her hand has began healing other sores began appearing on her ankles feet elbows knees  toes they began as sores and turned into looking exactly how her hand looked they are now very infected and a cause of concern because they keep appearing out of no where she cant get back into the doctor for another few weeks we are concerned and wondering what in the world could be the cause if this all open sores and layers of skin peeling off. It almost appears something is eating away her flesh. Please reply soon were really worried. any words of suggestion or encourgment are welcome, thank you for allowing me to take up some of your time.before i go i would  also like to add since her 4bypass surgery her left foot constintly stayed swollen the leg they retreived the arteries from for the bypass, and now her right foot is just as swollen. they both are covered in sores.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Billee,  The swelling after taking the vein out of the leg is a normal phenomenon as one of the functions of the veins is to take fluid back from the leg to the general circulation and since it is gone, the fluid collects in the leg.  First of all, your mother has to be seen by a doctor right now to assess these new sores and the risk of getting an overwhelming infection from them.   My impression is that may be your mom had an allergic reaction to one of the medications that she might have gotten in the hospital and antibiotics are usually the culprits.  i can not tell just sitting here what are those sores, they have to be evaluated as soon as possible.

    "content": "Although the added risk of developing a DVT caused by travelling appears to be low, it can be reduced even further by exercising the legs at least once every hour during long-distance travel. This means taking regular breaks if driving, or walking up and down the aisle of a coach, train or plane.   The muscles of the lower legs (which act as a pump for the blood in the veins) can be exercised while sitting by pulling the toes towards the knees then relaxing, or by pressing the balls of the feet down while raising the heel.  Other preventive measures:Don't take sleeping pills. These cause immobility, increasing the risk of DVT  Drink adequate fluids  Avoid smoking  Avoid beverages which contain alcohol and/or caffeine both before and during the flight  Avoid crossing legs when seated  Walk around the cabin whenever you can  Stand up in your seat area and stretch your arms and legs  Carry out the foot and leg exercises: as stated earlier. Wear loose fitting comfortable clothes when travellingIf you have any of the additional risk factors listed below, you should seek medical advice before travelling. In particular, you should discuss: The advisability of anti-embolic stockings  The advisability of low dose aspirin before flight  The advisability of anti-coagulant medication or other prophylactic measures before flight Some doctors recommend taking aspirin or their anticoagulant before travelling because of its blood thinning effects. If in doubt, seek advice from a doctor.  People who have one or more of the risk factors mentioned earlier should seek medical advice before travelling.  Anyone who develops swelling or pain in the leg, or breathing problems after travelling should seek medical advice urgently.  Risk factors for DVT: major injuries, or paralysis  surgery, especially if it lasts more than 30 minutes, or involves the leg joints or pelvis  cancer and its treatments, which can cause the blood to clot more easily  pregnancy and childbirth - related to hormone changes that make the blood clot more easily and because the fetus puts added pressure on the veins of the pelvis. There is also risk of injury to veins during delivery or a caesarean. The risk is at its highest just after childbirth  taking a contraceptive pill that contains oestrogen. Most modern pills contain a low dose, which increases the risk by an amount that is acceptable for most women  hormone replacement therapy (HRT). For many women, the benefits outweigh the increase in risk.  other circulation or heart problems\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Lzzy,  Having repeated blood clots in the veins of the legs or anywhere else without provoking factors (such as laying in bed for a long time, having surgery or travelling lets say in a car or plane for prolonged periods of time) can be suggestive of a disorder where the blood has a higher tendency to clotting than the normal.  This could be related to having a congenital disorder, where the naturally occuring anticoagulants in the body are deficient and/or defective.  It could also be related to  - Cancer. Your friend should be checked for cancer. - Heart failure which leads to blood stagnation.  Coumadin is the treatment of choice if your friend has a higher tendency to clotting and if your friend has an underlying precipitating factor (like cancer) till this precipitating factor is gone.  An index of 2.5-3.5 is good. But if the dvt is recurrent eventhough the index is within therapeutic range, i think your friend has to see a specialist in blood diseases so that he checks why she is getting recurrent blood clots and decide whether she needs an even higher doses of coumadin and run an even higher index.

    "content": "Dear Joey, Before I start jumping to conclusions I would like to know what your temperature is. Its best take directly as soon as you wake up in the morning. It still looks like Raynaud's phenomenon to me. Did they give you any reason why they have excluded it? Raynaud's is not really a disease of the vessels as it is a faulty reaction by the heat regulating system in the body. The heat regulating system which is controlled by a center in the brain controls the body temperature by either  1. preserving the body temperature at times of cold: It does this by constricting the vessels in the periphery 'e.g. the skin' to shift the warm blood away from the cold environment and to warm the more vital internal organs of the body. In effect this leads to cold extremities and skin.  2. decreasing the body temperature: It does this by the reverse reaction. It dilates (expands) the vessels in the periphery so that the warm blood is closer to the environment and away from the vital internal organs.  In Raynaud's there is excessive constriction of the vessels in response to cold. Another important factor is age. The heat regulating center becomes more lazy and less coordinated. Ativan is a benzodiazepine wich may lead to hypothermia but usually in larger doses than the one you are taking.  Regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Nancy, Exanta is a very promising new drug. It acts as an anticoagulant but by a different mechanism than that used by coumadin. I have checked the literature for you but unfortunately have not come accross any studies performed on patients similar to you. However, it is assumed that it should replace warfarin for all its indications; however, that remains to be seen. Unfortunately, as of today, the drug hasn't yet been approved by the FDA or in Europe for that matter, as it is still in its early phases of testing. The only way exanta is given to patients is through their enrolement in clinical studies. There has only been one concern up until now with exanta and that is an unexplained elevation of liver enzymes. You may discuss with your physician if you are eligible for an exanta clinical study that would suite you.  If you haven't already done so, please check our article about exanta:  Click here!

This could be the result of a blood clot.

If there are some undiagnosed clots in my body, will going off the pill make my blood flow more freely thereby dislodging the clot and moving it to a more dangerous location?   2. What test is there to look for clots in the pelvic veins and how common are these?   Thanks, please please respond.   P.S#Repeat d-dimer weeks after the first is still high at 500 using a cut off value of 200.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: D-dimer and contraceptive pills.",
    "content": "Dear Tiffairy,  Thank you very much for using our website.  After looking into the litterature, i found one article that mentionned a study that looked into the relation between contraceptive pills and d-dimer and it was found that d-dimer is increased in females taking contraceptive pills in comparison to their female counterparts who were not using contraceptive pills. So this could be the cause of your elevated d-dimer.  If you stop taking the contraceptive pills, your blood will go back to normal in that it will not be as prone to coagulation. And no it does not mean that if you have a blood clot that it will dislodge from its place and go somewhere else.  Isolated pelvic vein clots are not that common. Pelvic vein clots are commonly formed by extension from clots of the leg veins.   Risk factors for pelvic vein thrombosis include trauma, surgical procedures involving the pelvis and hypercoagulable states (conditions in which the patient is more prone to coagulation than normal due to some diseases). It has also been reported as a complication in the postpartum period. Also, thrombosis of the pelvic veins,  can be seen in women with pelvic inflammatory disease.  The data regarding the clinical significance of pelvic vein thrombosis, however, are limited. This may be partly due to the difficulty in diagnosing this condition.  Diagnosis can be made by direct venography (injecting a dye into the veins and see whether there are clots or not. Other possible way is by doing a magnetic resonance venography of the pelvic veins.

    "content": "Dear Tiffairy,   Pelvic vein clots as a complication of pelvic inflammatory disease is not a common occurrence.  To know that one has pelvic inflammatory disease, one must have symptoms in the form of fever, lower abdominal pain and tenderness, cervical motion tenderness. Then if the doctor suspects that the patient has pelvic inflammatory disease, tests are done to confirm the diagnosis and these include an endometrial biopsy, transvaginal sonography or other imaging techniques showing thickened fluid-filled tubes and laparoscopy in difficult cases.

Since the burns I have noticed a dramatic increase in the attacks.  Furthermore, I have had more of a burning, tingling sensation in the area of the scars.  I have researched this topic at the library in Gainesville, Florida, however, I find nothing publised. I would be interested in your thoughts and opinions.  I thank you so much for your time.

    "content": "Dear Lora1957, Sorry to hear about all the hardship you must have gone through. Raynaud's disease is primarily a disease of the vascular system as you well know. The blood vessels do not supply enough blood to the peripheral areas of your body (e.g. toes). A 3rd degree burn is capable of altering the vascular system in that area further. Normally when a part of the body receives little blood there are mechanisms that try to compensate. One of these mechanisms is the creation of collateral blood supply. Now the role of collateral blood supply in a disease like Raynaud's would be questionable but all the same these compensatory mechanisms could be impaired all the same by a 3rd degree burn. This would lead to an increase in your symptoms.  Here is an article which may be useful to you:  http://www.john-libbey-eurotext.fr/arti ... 6/399-404/  Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi.  In my left shoulder area, a heaviness starts, goes down the arm, within a half hour, it's down to the knee, lasts for a little bit, then the heaviness turns into a dull pain, with my left hand going numb. Then it lasts for about an hour longer, then it all goes away. And it happens about every three or four days, for the last month. Do you have any idea why this is happening, or what it means?   Thank you, I really appreciate it.  -Ella\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Ella,  What do you mean by heaviness? Do you mean that you have weakness in your arm and leg or a sensation that occurs to someone when his hand or foot goes to sleep and then start to wake up?  i do not know about your health background.  Weakness could mean that this is a warning symptom for a stroke if in the proper setting.  Heaviness only on the other hand could mean that there is either  1. Nerve problem going on, or 2. Brain problem. This could be an equivalent to a stroke as well.  My advice to you is to visit your physician to be checked either way because this might be a prelude to a stroke.

    "content": "Hello, doctor!  My friend told me that she was awaken last night by this pins-and-needles sensation all over her body (except the head part) and lasted for a couple of minutes. she was claiming that she might have experienced a mild stroke ( transient ischemic attack). but i have thoughts about it, since manifestation of a stroke is almost always hemilateral. could she be right? what other diseases present  this kind of symptom?or is this only brought about by too much stress? I was thinking of a heart/vessel problem. By the way, she's only 31 y/o and has no previous history of any kind of illness. Please enlighten us. Thanks in advance.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear guest,  Thank you very much for using our website.  Being 31 and a female and having a heart condition is rare although not unheard of especially if the patient has other risk factors like diabetes, family history of heart dieases, high blood pressure, smoking, high cholesterol, lack of exercise.  The symptoms that your friend had are non-specific and can represent symptoms of lots of diseases. Having a heart attack while having this sensation is uncommon but could happen although with your friend age and gender i would suspect very much.  If you or she are still concerned then the best way of action should be to seek medical advice at her doctor's office and have a stress test done.  About a transient ischemic attack, it does not have to be on one side of the body and the symptoms are not typical of a transient ischemic attack as well in this case.  i would worry if this recurrs but if it does not i would not worry about it.
