    "title": "Benzo and Sleeping pills only works sometimes",
    "content": "Hello. I have a question regarding the effects of sleeping pills and benzodiazepines.  I have Zopiklon 7.5mg sleeping pills on prescription and I am allowed to take one per day. The problem is that it only works 50% of the times. For example:  Week 1  I only need one/two zopiklon to be able to sleep. And the benzodiazepines I buy from a friend also works great, I can just take 3-5 xanax and get a great effect on that. Then i can have a break for weeks from both benzo and sleeping meds and then start off with low doses on the meds, but when i realize it doesnt work at all i increase the intake a lot (last week i took 18 xanax, 12 rivotril, 5 zopiklon and 4 rohypnol/flunitrazepam in one night) and I still didnt get any effect what-so-ever.  No one I know has ever heard of such a thing so I am really curious as to why I react so differently to drugs each time?    I know its not a issue of tolerance - Some times ive been off the drugs for months and when I try it again it still doesnt work. Some years ago i abused subutex, amphetamine and benzodiazepines like there was no tomorrow, can it be that ive somehow damaged myself so that I react this strange to medicine?  I don't want to bring this up with my current doctor because I'm pretty sure he will cut my sleeping pills the second i bring the drug abuse up. Also worth to mention is that half a year ago I started to eat a medicine against bi-polar disorder called Lamotrigin and from what I can recall it was also about half a year ago I started to get these strange reactions.  Very thankful for any information you can give me!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Insomniacx,  Even with the information you provide you may still have a component of tolerance going on.  Additionally, we do find that medications do not necessarily work the same for all people.  Most have a predicted response but some have other responses or no response.  As an example, diphenhydramine is a common antihistamine that is sedating for most people but a small percentage of the population actually feel more hyper when taking the medication.  I would strongly advise you to talk with your doctor about all the medications you are on.  Additionally, you can have a frank conversation with your doctor about your past.  There is a significant risk of not having your doctor aware of what you are taking as medication side effects and combinations can be potentially deadly.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello HealthParanoid,  In general, I always urge caution when dealing with supplements.  By far, the best thing is to simply eat a healthy, varied diet to get all your nutrients from food.  The problem with supplements is that they are not regulated so no one is actually testing them to be sure that what is promised is actually in the supplement.  There are countless examples of supplements that have claimed to be 100% of supplement X but the are found to be maybe 20 or 30% supplement X and the rest inactive ingredients or even harmful ingredients like lead or mercury.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,Coating the tablet is done not only for elegance and ease of swallowing but to prevent the bitter or irritant medication to come in contact with mucous membranes like of the throat.More important is to modify the drug release profile.Examples are enteric coatings and delivery of the drug in pulses.By chewing these mechanisms get altered and the drug may not act at optimal levels.Apart from this bitterness if it is there would be felt and chances of gastric irritation becomes more.So you should swallow as a single piece and should not break it or chew it. For the damage done salt water gargling may help.It would be some time before recovery would set in. Best wishes.\n\n",

Mefloquine's reputation has been tarnished as it can cause serious side effects such as anxiety and hallucinations. Fortunately, these are rare. More common minor side effects are disturbed sleep and intense dreams. The drug is contra-indicated in individuals with a history of depression, anxiety or epilepsy. Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, my grandmother is taking a mixture of drugs for many different health reasons such as allergies, osteoporosis, she has horrible hips, had polio as a child - has walked with a limp since. She has bladder retention problems - has to go frequently...she gets horrible pain in her joints. She has fallen a few times and broken around 22 bones in her lifetime. She is tiny and is shrinking. She was just put on Doxepin -25mg, because she has been getting hives and they cannot pinpoint the allergy - the allergist said \"her body is turning against her.\" She is also on the following: Doxepin - 25mg/day Nexium - 40mg/day Rantidine - 150mg 2/day Vesicare - 10mg/day Hydroxyzine - 25mg as needed Vitamin D - 50,000units once a week Bystolic - 2.5mg/day Singular - 10mg/day Reclast 1/year Vicodin - 5-500mg as needed (but she takes at least 1 - 2/day) Vitamins: Another dose of Vitamin D - 1000 I.U/day, Citracal 400IU/day, Caltrate 600+D+Minerals/day. The combination of all these medications seems like an over prescribed nightmare. What can she do to decrease? She wants to be more free of all these chemicals and wants freedom from whatever these medications are doing to her mind/body/soul.

    "content": "Hi -  One of the things to consider is that as we age, our organ systems become less efficient, so there will be situations in which we need medical and pharmaceutical intervention to replace what may be lost through the aging process.  Many begin to feel as your grandmother does, and want to decrease whatever medication they can.  Sometimes it's possible, and sometimes it's not.  I could find no adverse interactions among your grandmother's medications.  Nexium and Rantidine have some similar actions, so one of those may or may not be able to be reduced.  Since we aren't able to actually see or evaluate your grandmother, it's impossible for us to say whether it could or not, but it certainly is something she can discuss with her doctor, if she'd like.  When balancing the medications and supplements against what your report about your grandmother's conditions, it appears that she really needs all that are prescribed.  If she hasn't discussed her feelings with her doctor, it would be a good idea.     It may help her to consider altering her perspective, to see her medication regimen as something that is helping her keep mind, body and soul together, vs. being detrimental.  The fact that she is mindful, perceptive, caring and active actually indicates that she is likely not overmedicated, since she is so highly functioning.  I hope she continues to do well, and I wish you both only the best.\n\n",

He also ran a rather large spread sheet of blood work and it was all fine except for my cholosterol.

I suspect it is coincidental and you developed this at the same time you were dealing with the high blood pressure.  I would not worry about needing to take the diclofenac if it is helping.  Looks like success to me, even though it's not perfect.  You may be able to reduce your cholesterol with diet and exercise.  If you are overweight, the joint pain could also be reduced with weight loss.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I am not aware of such a restriction by the FDA, so perhaps this is a manufacturer's recommendation.  My understanding is that ACOG (American Academy of Obstetrics and Gynecology) support the use of this drug for all ages.  There are restrictions for selling this to girls under 17 that require a prescription in the USA but if an older person bought it, there would be no problem even if they shared it with a younger girl.  Nobody is regulating beyond the purchase of it.    In a girl as young as 13 the rationale to have it by prescription is probably to examine her and inquire if there is a rape or other illegal activity going on for which she may need help and/or counseling.  It is assumed that an older woman is more prepared to make decisions regarding her sexual activity but a child needs protection beyond the risk of pregnancy.    Best wishes.\n\n",

A few weeks ago I tried 50mg and that worked really well, and I have a patient, supportive girlfriend thankfully. But then I took 50 mg again a couple days later and it didn't really do anything. If I just say screw it and take the 100mg tablet of viagra next time I'm going to have sex, can I trust it will work for sure? That is my question..because this hit and miss really sucks and is really tough to take. I believe with the meds for bipolar that I'm on, which really work well, I might just need this high of a viagra dose in order to be alright. I have a doctor and everything already but just saw this site and wanted to ask. Thanks.\n\n",

With a supportive and compassionate girlfriend I would assume you could risk it and that is the only way to know.  Seems it would be worth trying since that is still within the prescribed parameters.  Also, there is an emotional element involved as well so don't rely completely on the pill.  Other factors come into play as well and most people who depend on medication to \"fix\" the problem will at times be disappointed.  Even those without erectile dysfunction due to medication or other causes sometimes have this problem without explanation.  That's life.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "My aunt (77years old) is having nose bleeds, two or three times a week, often at night. They are very heavy indeed (necessitating a complete change of bedding) and often last more than 30 mins.  They used to be worse, and her doctor gave her medication to stop them but did not identify whether or not existing medication might be causing them.    They stopped for about 6 weeks after the new meds, but have started again.  My aunt is reluctant to change her doctor, or bother him too much but is not getting straight answers nor much help.  She has been diagnosed with diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol - but not at very high levels. She also recently had a hip replacement and has recovered completely with no pain.  I list here the medications she is taking and would appreciate any advice. She is prepared to stop taking (or at least ask for an alternative) if the doctors here felt any of these meds were causing  the problem: Some of these names may be different to brand names used in the USA (we are in New Zealand)  Betaloc Inhibase Metformin Ranitidine hydrochloride Calvasc Lipitor Cozaar Cyklokapron  Any help you could give would be much appreciated. Thank you Lynda\n\n",

I have a family history of reactions to vaccinations and we tend to very sensitive to most forms of medication.  My Dad was given a smallpox injection when we emigrated to Egypt; being an eczema sufferer, he reacted to this vaccination which resulted in total alopecia.  To this day, he has no body hair.  Like my father, I am atopic, as I have eczema and psoriasis.  Some professionals have told me that I may well react to the Japanese Encephalitis vaccination.  What are your thoughts on this?  I intend to have tetanus, typhoid, polio, hep A & B and possibly Jap Encep.  I do not plan to have vaccinations for cholera or rabies.  Yellow Fever is not needed.  Are there any possible contra indications for my type for the other vaccinations I have listed?  Aside from this, I also need to consider malaria medication.  I have been told one particular brand is not good for psoriasis sufferers.    Is there any further medical information that would be important to know to minimise potential reaction to the vaccinations or malaria tablets?  I have a fatal allergy to penicillin, had breast augmentation in 2000 and suffer from genital herpes.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  The brand you are taking is perhaps the formulation (ES) that contains 750 mg paracetamol and 7.5 mg hydrocodone.   Other tablets by different manufacturers containing either 5, 7.5, or 10 milligrams hydrocodone are available. However, unlike the brand you are taking, they contain only 325 milligrams of paracetamol per tablet. Therefore, they can be safely taken in higher doses because of their lower paracetamol content and thus less likelihood of potential damage to the liver.  Hydrocodone is a short-acting opioid. One drawback to short-acting opioids (short half lives) is that patients initially they have a good effect, then the efficacy rapidly declines, and tend to have \"mini-withdrawals\" throughout the day, which can precipitate overuse. Rebound headaches also can occur with these short-acting opioids.   In chronic pain management, It is necessary to achieve a balance between medication and headaches, and to strive not to over-medicate. If a low to medium dose achieves pain relief of 40 to 80%, it may be a lot safer to accept this level, as relief of pain by 40 to 80% is generally enough to greatly improve functioning and quality of life.  In some patients, the body develops tolerance to the narcotic drug and the patient needs increasing doses to achieve a given effect. In such a situation, according to some experts, rather than to increase the doses, at times, it may be wiser to discontinue the opioid for one to two months to restore its efficacy. Another strategy is to switch to a different opioid. It has been noted that a small number of patients the response is so good that they may remain on the same low-dose opioid for many years.  Yet another available alternative strategy in individuals who develop tolerance or rebound headaches due to short-acting opioids is the use of longer-acting opioids.     The main advantages of these are, - the smoother, much steadier blood levels, protecting against the ups and downs and rebound.  - the long-acting forms are pure narcotics, without additional paracetamol or other extra ingredients.  Of course, prior to utilizing any stronger therapy, one must be sure that the patient is not experiencing rebound headaches from analgesics.  Any changes in the daily dose or dosage schedule are very crucial decisions and must only be done in consultation with your regular doctor. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: alcohol and nortriptyline",
    "content": "Hi -  Using alcohol in conjunction with nortriptyline is risky, and there are specific recommendations against doing so.  Both substances are metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine, although that's not the primary reason to avoid using them at the same time.  Using alcohol with nortriptyline can result in potentiating the side effects of nortriptyline; the central nervous system effects and the cardiovascular effects are most notable, but excessive use of alcohol can result in suicidal thoughts and attempts, or in overdosage of nortriptyline.  Central nervous system effects can include dizziness, confusion, headache, anxiety, nervousness, panic, tremors, overstimulation, weakness, fatigue, insomnia, nightmares and/or memory impairment.  Cardiovascular effects may include orthostatic hypotension (dizziness or fainting on standing, or sitting if the person had been lying down), heart racing, and/or irregular heartbeat.  Other effects that may be increased are dry mouth, sedation, increased appetite and constipation.  Finally, alcohol can trigger migraines.   Nortriptyline has a half-life (the time it takes for about half the medication to clear from your system) of between 16 and 90 hours; the higher the dose, the longer the half-life.  The maximum recommended dosage is 150mg per day in divided doses.  Since you take 100mg, the half life would be quite long.  The time for the medication to clear entirely would take considerably longer.  If you're thinking of discontinuing the medication, it would be best to discuss that with your doctor before doing so.    I hope you have a very enjoyable, alcohol-free birthday!   Good luck.\n\n",

Your dosage is low, so no major withdrawal symptoms would be expected if titrated over the time mentioned.  Abrupt withdrawal can result in anxiety, irritability, insomnia, panic attacks, and/or tremors.  Abrupt withdrawal after prolonged use of high doses can result in seizure activity.   Some physicians may choose to prescribe another medication, but most drugs of this type do require a tapering off period.  Since we do not know your situation or overall medical status, it's beyond our ability to make specific treatment recommendations.

Healthy, cocaine-naive persons undergo passive heating, to even small dose of intranasal cocaine.This is believed to be due to  - impaired sweating and  - cutaneous vasodilation (the primary autonomic adjustments to thermal stress) and heat perception. Some studies have indicated that in addition to increased metabolism, impaired thermoregulatory responses contribute to the elevation in temperature associated with cocaine use. These thermoregulatory alterations are suspected to be central in origin.

    "title": "Can long-term Singulair use result in untreatable depression",
    "content": "I took the 5mg Singulair pill daily (before bed) from ages 9 through 13 to treat my asthma.  I started experiencing some bizarre symptoms since early on in my treatment that I just learned to tolerate because nobody ever correlated my mental side effects with the asthma medication.  I would frequently experience insomnia, confusion, obsessive-compulsive thoughts, and depression.  I've had a mild hand/arm tremor that only occurred after I started the medication and still remains six years after withdrawing from Singulair.  It's hard for me to tell if the Singulair directly caused the depression or not, but I have a strong feeling that it at least made it significantly worse.  I have been more emotionally stable since I stopped taking the medication though I still don't feel \"right\".  I'm mainly concerned that the Singulair has caused irreversible damage to the reward system in my brain.  I've been researching the side effects of the drug and I understand that not much is known about how it works, but should I be worried about this?  I really will appreciate any information/suggestions.  Thank you.\n\n",

    "title": "Feel terrible one week after smoking marijuana",
    "content": "I smoked one joint last week for the first time ever and I'm a little scared about how I'm still feeling.  I feel really depressed, disconnected, anxious, I've lost my appetite and have trouble eating food, feelings of impending doom, and I occasionally will get nausea though I have yet to throw up but have come pretty close on 3 separate occasions. My legs also feel tingly, almost numb. My heart is beating faster most of the time, like I am very nervous about something, and I am having trouble sleeping because my legs feel so weird.   What had happened was I was on a short two day trip. I smoked on the first day, in the afternoon. At first I did not feel anything. Shortly after first lighting the marijuana, perhaps 10 minutes, I started to feel nauseous. Following that I felt very scared, my eyes were getting heavy and I was having trouble keeping them open, I needed my hand to support the weight of my head, and my speech was very slow. Following that I began to sweat extremely profusely, my face and body were absolutely drenched. In fact I was so soaked that when I leaned forward and put my head between my legs the sweat on my face dislodged and soaked my jeans. Almost immediately following placing my head between my legs I began to feel better.   Though it is possible it could have been laced I highly doubt it, as none of the other 3 friends I was with had been changed like I did, though we all had our separate joints and I did not see my friend roll it. The \"high\" was also not making me hallucinate or see more vivid colors. It had only made me hungry, made me laugh at things, and make me want to take a nap. Following it I was fine, and I only got this way once I got home a day later.   I was only on one prescription at the time, minocycline, or minocin, for my acne (not very severe, only on chest and back), which I had not abused, if that is possible. I was on my third bottle at the time, and taking two pills, one in the morning, and one at night, as instructed by my doctor. However on the day I smoked I did not take a pill in the morning, evening, or following morning. I did however take it the following night and resumed taking it regularly afterward but stopped on the last pill in the bottle because I had read it causes nausea and thought it might be the cause.  I have never abused any drugs, prescription or illegal.  Will this go away naturally or do I need to see my family doctor?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Feel terrible one week after smoking marijuana",
    "content": "Hello margit,  Marijuana, or cannabis, has properties of being a stimulant, a depressant and a hallucinogen.  The most active ingredient is THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), with an estimated 66 or more additional cannabinoids.  The amount of THC in cannabis is used to determine potency.  A more potent than usual cannabis is available in some areas, and is \"homegrown.\"  Cannabis may be adulterated by other drugs, soil, animal feces, and oil, among other substances.  Smoking cannabis is probably the most harmful way to use it, since inhaling the smoke from organic matter can cause health problems; with prolonged use, it has been implicated in cancer and stroke.  Short term effects of cannabis use include changes in perception, change in mood (either good or bad), increased heartrate, low blood pressure, episodic impairments of short-term memory, working memory, psychomotor coordination and concentration, stimulates hunger, eases nausea and vomiting, lowers eye pressure, and provides pain relief.  Your description suggests you are sensitive to either the cannabis or a contaminant.  Minocycline can cause upset stomach, diarrhea, dizziness, vertigo, unsteadiness, drowsiness, headache, vomiting and photosensitivity; it can trigger autoimmune hepatitis.  A rare side effect is intracranial hypertension.  It is not usually recommended for use by women, as more women than men experience more severe side effects.  Both cannabis and minocycline can contribute to a disorder called Depersonalization.  It's a sense of observing oneself, with no control over the environment or a situation.  The environment seems less real and dreamlike, and the person feels separate from body sensations, feelings, emotions and behaviors.  Cannabis has a half-life (the time it takes for about half of the drug to clear from the body) of 4 hours, and minocycline has a half-life of 11 to 22 hours.  Taking them within the same 24 hour period conceivably could maximize their shared effects.  The effects you're experiencing are unusual, in that a one-time experience generally does not create a long term problem.  However, since it's difficult to know exactly what contaminants may have been present in the marijuana, plus the potential enhanced side effects of minocycline, the best approach would be to see your doctor if your symptoms haven't cleared by now, or if they recur.  Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi -  Since it has been a week since you posted your question, you likely have experienced any side effects of abrupt discontinuation of your medications.  While there is no contraindication for rapid discontinuation of Adderall, there is for Xanax.  Xanax should be tapered downward over a period of two weeks, at least.  Abrupt discontinuation can result in insomnia, anxiety, tremors, or seizures.   Torodal is given for moderately severe pain, but it generally should not be taken for more than 5 days in a row.  It is classified as an NSAID, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug.  Side effects include gastrointestinal bleeding, gastric ulcers, and renal failure.  Since your physician is under investigation and is not able to prescribe other medications, perhaps consulting another physician would be a good idea, at least until your current physician is once again able to address your concerns.    I hope this information is helpful to you.\n\n",

    "content": "I have a very low income and don't have medical insurance.  I went to a county psychiatrist and he asked me questions about my life.  I told him I am married and, since the school year has started, I told him that soon I will go back to working as a substitute teacher.  I told him I was not having any symptoms at the moment.  He said that since my medications (Lithium 3mg bid, zyprexa 5mg qhs) are very expensive, the county was not going to be able to pay for them.  He told me to continue taking my medications until I run out of them.  Then, he said to go back to see him after I had ran out of my meds.  This sounded good to me, but my wife is really worried because she says I get overwhelmed easily when I'm not in my meds.  She also said that antipsychotics should be tapered off and that my MD should've not told me to just stop taking them.  Is this right?  Thanks in advance.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  There is no contraindication to rapid discontinuation of Lithium.  However, what is the condition that you're taking it for?  If it is Bipolar Disorder, it may be worth further discussion with the psychiatrist or administration, as the cost of hospitalization is much higher than the maintenance dose of Lithium.  It is not safe, however, to take Lithium without routine monitoring of blood levels of the drug, due to the narrow margin between effective dose and toxicity.  It would be a good idea to discuss with the psychiatrist what medications would be available for you.  Zyprexa should not be discontinued abruptly.  Recent information has come forth that rapid withdrawal of certain antidepressants can result in what is known as \"Discontinuation Syndrome\", with severe effects.  Symptoms include anxiety, tremors, visual disturbances, visual hallucinations, restlessness, muscle and joint pain, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, headaches, lethargy, weakness, unstable gait, insomnia, flu-like symptoms, electric-like \"zaps\", tingling sensation, and irritability.  This syndrome is possible with all antidepressants classed as SSRIs, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, which includes Zyprexa.  The worst offender is Celexa.  Serzone, Wellbutrin, Remeron and Prozac are the least likely to cause the Discontinuation Syndrome.  Tricyclic antidepressants do not appear to result in this type of problem.  Although the package insert for Zyprexa recommends titrating dosages downward over a 2 week period, extending the withdrawal period over 2 to 4 months or even longer may be necessary.    Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  You have not mentioned what the indication for the therapy. However,  the 2G single dose regimen is commonly prescribed for  - bacterial Vaginosis(BV),   - trichomonal Vaginosis, and - Gardnerella vaginalis vaginitis.  In some studies, a single, 2-g dose of metronidazole given orally for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis resulted in a clinical cure rate of 65% and a therapeutic cure rate of 25% at 3 months.  Amsel criteria for BV is frequently used for assessing response to therapy. Therapeutic cure:  is defined as resolution of all 4 Amsel criteria and investigator cure and Nugent score: 0-3 for normal bacterial morphotypes. Multivariate analyses in some studies have revealed that statistically significant variables associated with clinical failure were, - African American race,  - smoking, and  - colonization with Mycoplasma hominis.  The use of condoms and oral contraceptives had some protective effect against clinical failure, but they did not reach statistical significance. (Doug Brunk, OB/GYN News, September 15, 2004).  The data about long-term outcomes in women with bacterial vaginosis treated with single-dose metronidazole are very limited. There are no long-term studies, and most of the published treatment trials had involved small numbers of women.  In one study, a single 2-g dose of metronidazole was compared with a seven-day course of 500 mg given twice daily in the treatment of symptomatic Gardnerella vaginalis infection. Results showed only 46% (16/34) of patients treated with the single 2-g dose were considered cured compared with 86% of those treated with the seven-day course. (JAMA. 1985; 254(8):1046-1049)  Bacterial Vaginosis: Routine treatment of male sexual partners is not necessary. Trichomoniasis: sexual contacts should be treated regardless of symptoms.  Before repeat courses of therapy are given, the manufacturers recommend that the presence of the organism should be reconfirmed by wet smear and/or culture and an interval of 4\u20136 weeks should be allowed between courses of metronidazole.   If treatment failure occurs following an initial metronidazole regimen of a single 2-g dose and reinfection has been excluded, the CDC recommends that the patient be retreated with an oral metronidazole regimen of 500 mg twice daily for 7 days or, alternatively, a single 2-g dose of oral tinidazole. If retreatment fails, then 2 g of metronidazole or tinidazole should be given once daily for 5 days. If the multiple-dose regimen is also ineffective, consultation with a specialist is recommended and in vitro susceptibility testing of T. vaginalis isolates may be indicated.  Metronidazole vaginal gel or clindamycin vaginal cream placed inside the vagina can be used as alternatives to the oral regimens of metronidazole and have been shown to be equally effective.  I hope this information is helpful. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "I have taken 4 drug tests(urine) in the last month and all have come back positive for methamphetamine.  I have never done meth in my life and now CPS has taken my children away because of it.  I have researched all the drugs that cause false positives and haven't taken any of them.  I have taken some generic pain relief pills that an old lady gave me on the bus and was wondering if maybe they weren't what the bottle said they were.  But I have had 3 doctors tell me thay look like pain relief pills to them so I have to be on meth. I promise I am not and never have been so I was wondering if they could be laced with something or maybe if something medically could be going on with me that could be producing this result.  My childrens lifes as well as my own depend on an answer because I don't know where to turn to prove my innocence when more than one has said positive.  They gave me a mouth swab test and I am still waiting on the results but i'm worried for the simple fact that I'm not using and 4 different tests have said I am.  PLEASE HELP ME!!!!!!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello smith80amber,  Stimulants, antihistamines and cold remedies, and weight loss preparations all can cause false positives for methamphetamine.  The most cited resource appears to be the \"Journal of Clinical Chemistry\", Vol. 38, No. 12 (1972) and Vol. 39, No. 3 (1993).  The Los Angeles Times News Services also produced a report listing 65 drugs that produced false positive results in urine testing for methamphetamines, but I could not locate a date; it was mentioned as a resource but not properly cited, so those drugs are not included.    Some of the over-the-counter drugs mentioned were Dristan Nasal Spray, Medications with chloropromine, fluspiriline, Nyquil, Contac, Sudafed, Allerest, Tavist-D, Deimetapp, Phenergan-D, Robitussin Cold and Flu, Dexatrim, Acutrim, Vicks Inhaler, and Afrin.  Asthma medications Marax, Bronkaid tablets and Primatine Tabs are also noted.  Prescription medications that produce false positive results in urine testing include benzphetamine, fenfluramine, Redux, phentermine, Dexedrine, Ritalin, Cylert and Eldepryl, among others.  I sincerely hope this information helps you in this stresssful situation.  Please let me know if we can provide any further information.  Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Extacy and Back pain",
    "content": "Hi agil86,  Ecstasy acts as an agent to release serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine (neurohormones in the brain), which has the potential to lead to neurotoxic damage to the Central Nervous System.  The effects of using Ecstasy are similar to that of marijuana or the psilocybin (mushrooms) without the hallucinatory effect.  Ecstasy has a long half-life (the time it takes for about half of the dose to clear from your body), which is after the approximate 2-hour effect has ended, which indicates that an acute tolerance to the substance develops rapidly.  65% of Ecstasy is excreted in the urine within 24 hours after taking it.  This means that taking more Ecstasy within 8 or more hours of the previous dose produces higher concentrations of the substance in the bloodstream than the user realizes, which can lead to psychoactive and toxic effects.  Chronic use of Ecstasy may lead to depression, anxiety, impairment of long-term memory and impairment of cognitive functions.  Long term use of Ecstasy has been associated with liver damage and excessive wear of teeth.  Back pain is not an established effect of Ecstasy use, unless it is associated with liver or kidney damage.  If you have had blood tests to monitor liver and kidney function, with results within normal limits, then your back pain is not likely to be associated with your previous use of Ecstasy.  I hope this information is helpful to you.  Good luck!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: methadone and Tramadol",
    "content": "Hi Marc1982,  Since Tramadol at high doses may increase the incidence of seizure activity, recreational use can be very dangerous.  Used according to recommended dosages, it is known to have effects very like those of other opioids, such as Codeine.  The effects aren't as intense, however.  Tramadol can cause nausea, dizziness, insomnia and/or loss of appetite.  It can be used to alleviate withdrawal symptoms from opiates, and has the advantage of being easier to lower the dosage in withdrawal programs.  Use of Tramadol with Methadone has not been scientifically shown to lower the effects of Methadone, but some persons who have used the two medications together are convinced otherwise.  There is no established contraindication for using both Tramadol and Methadone at the same time.  As always, monitoring by your physician is key, and always report any unusual effects to your doctor right away.  Good luck!\n\n",

Does anyone know how long it takes to do such damage to one's self for any amount of time taking 3000 mg of APAP per day? I would really appreciate the input in anything anyone has to offer.

    "title": "Re: vicodin for long term use.",
    "content": "Hello pillhelp45,  As you know, Vicodin is an addicting substance, particularly when misused, as in taking extra doses or using the drug without the authorization and supervision of a physician.  Of those who become addicted, some have taken as many as 30 or more Vicodin daily, which also greatly increases the risk of liver damage.    Each Vicodin 5-500 contains Hydrocodone Bitartrate 5mg and Acetominophen 500mg.  Hydrocodone is a morphine-like (though less potent than morphine) opiate pain reliever and cough suppressant.  The acetominophen halts the formation of pain-causing substances called prostoglandins.  Hydrocodone works through binding to pain receptors in the brain, which stops the sensation of pain.  Long term use of Vicodin may cause dependency, or addiction.  Some physicians consider addiction less likely if it is being used for legitimate acute pain, and not fear of pain, based on some similar evidence in morphine addiction studies.  This is not a commonly accepted belief in the medical profession, however.  Most medically supervised pain treatment that results in dependencies are considered \"accidental addicts.\"    If addicted, symptoms of withdrawal can include severe pain, bone pain, insomnia, restless legs, irritability, runny nose, loss of appetite, cold sweats, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, muscle pain, severe depression, feelings of distress and increasing panic, and aching limbs.  These symptoms are not usually life-threatening, particularly if the person who has become addicted receives appropriate detox treatment.  There are detox programs specific to Vicodin.  The intensity of withdrawal depends on the dosage and longevity of Vicodin use, especially overuse.  Abrupt withdrawal after long term use is not recommended.  High doses of acetominophen may cause liver damage.  The maximum daily dose of acetominophen is 4Gm in adults.  Toxicity is associated with taking a single dose of 150mg/kg, or about 7 - 10Gm in adults.  The toxicity threshold may be lowered by alcohol use, poor nutrition, fasting, or dehydration.  When dosage recommendations are followed, the risk of toxicity and resulting liver damage are small.  There is an antidote to acetominophen, called N-acetylsteine (NAC), which has maximum effect when given within 8 hours of ingestion of the 7 to 10Gm in adults.  It should be administered regardless of the time since overdose.  Reducing the amount of acetominophen in Vicodin is under review.    If you are taking 3000mg of acetominophen daily, you are under the 4000mg (4Gm) maximum daily dose, and are likely not damaging your liver.  Your doctor can order blood tests done to evaluate your liver function; since you are concerned about liver damage, that would be a good thing to discuss with and request from your doctor.  It would also be a good idea to talk with your doctor about the best plan for withdrawal from Vicodin and if there is an effective, less addicting medication that he or she would recommend to control your pain.  Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, gigim,  Your question is very reasonable, since medication interactions can be dangerous.  I did considerable research on Lamotrigine and OTC drugs, and found only one possible contraindication identified, and that is folic acid.  Folic acid was also listed as a potential benefit to be taken with Lamotrigine, but it was noted that they shouldn't be taken at the same time.  It could be that no research into the particular substances you mentioned has been done in regard to Lamotrigine, but that also would be an indication that no adverse effects have been reported.  It appears that you could take your tanning pills safely while taking Lamotrigine.  However, if you notice any untoward effects after taking the tanning pills, discontinue them.  It's always best to be safe, rather than sorry.  I hope you have a very nice holiday.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Cialis Side Effects Concern",
    "content": "Hello Mike65,  The most reported side effects of Cialis use are headache, flushing, nasal congestion, indigestion, and back or limb pain.  An erection that lasts more than 4 hours requires immediate treatment.  Persons using Cialis should not drink alcoholic beverages while taking the drug.    Visual disturbances are rare, but most often include seeing a blue tinge to objects, having difficulty discerning between green and blue, eye pain, or blurred vision.  Temporary or permanent blindness have been a very rare complaint.  It hasn't been possible to determine if it's from the medication or from other medical conditions, genetics, a combination of these factors, or something that is completely unrelated to these factors.  The blindness results from a condition called NAION, or non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy; or, in other words, a stroke of the optic nerve.  This condition can lead to sudden loss of vision in one or both eyes.  In most cases, those who have developed NAION, with or without the use of Cialis, had other risk factors that increased the chance of developing the condition.  These risk factors include being over the age of 50, being diabetic, having high blood pressure, having heart disease, having high cholesterol, smoking, or having hypothyroidism.  Hypercholesterolemia is a particular risk.    If symptoms of NAION occur and the person notices any loss of vision in one or both eyes, immediate treatment is essential for the best outcome.  Taking an aspirin and going to the emergency room is recommended.  Treatment consists of large doses of corticosteroids during the early stages.  Visual acuity can improve for up to 6 months, but is not known to improve after that.  Some permanent visual loss is likely.  Research has linked Viagra to the development of NAION.  I hope this information is helpful to you in making your decision regarding the medication.  Good luck to you.\n\n",

The medication increases the urinary excretion of sodium, chloride and water.  When it's first administered, the daily amount of sodium that is excreted in the urine increases for at least one week.  With regular daily use, the daily sodium loss reaches a balance with dietary sodium intake, and no sodium replacement is required.  There have been no observed drug interactions with Demadex.  Lasix is also a diuretic, and results in the urinary excretion of potassium, calcium, sodium, magnesium and water.  Potassium loss is the primary concern, and potassium replacement is needed with regular use of the medication.  There have been multiple observed drug interactions with Lasix.  Photosensitivity is a significant side effect.  Your information is basically true.  I hope this information is helpful.  Good luck!\n\n",

The promethazine with codeine  was prescribed to me by a military doctor.  I have been in the military for 10 years and this has really caused me some major anxiety.  Hopefully they will review my medical record and this will be over.  One last question, can you tell me a book that I can reference that says that the urinalysis has only detected codeine from my prescription and not that I have abused drugs?\n\n",

    "content": "Unfortunately, I don't think there is such a book.  The problem is that the drug tests only look for the presence of the drug.  They are of no help in determining where they came from.  The one thought I have is that a more comprehensive drug screen can be performed to look for the presence of the promethazine as well.  If both are found together it would support that it came from the medicine (although again this isn't 100% since both medicines could be taken individually).  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Vicodin is brand of hydrocodone with acetominophen.   Dilaudid is a brand of hydromorphone.  It is very common to find both  hydrocodone and hydromorphone in urine within 24-72 hours after ingesting Vicodin.  This is due to the fact that a major metabolite of hydrocodone is hydromorphone, and it is not uncommon to find both in the urine. While rare, it is also possible for the Vicodin (hydrocodone) to fully metabolize to hydromorphone where no detectable parent hydrocodone is found.  Without seeing the actual analysis results, it is hard to judge what your Physician is interpreting. My guess is he is mistaking the presence of hydromorphone as evidence of taking Dilaudid when, in fact, the presence of hydromorphone is normal.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello nikki0713,  I apologize that this response is so tardy.    Hydrocodone, hydromorphone, Lortabs and Lorcet are all narcotic analgesics and cough suppressants that are semi-synthetic opioid derivatives from either codeine or theobid.  They are legally considered opiate narcotics, and testing urine, hair or saliva will yield positive results for codeine metabolites.  I don't understand why someone would say the medications that you mentioned do not contain codeine since they are derived from codeine with similar properties and action.  They are considered less addictive than codeine alone.  If your work testing program does not have a physician involved, perhaps your own physician could give you \"official\" information to assure your employer that your medications are codeine derivatives, if this answer isn't sufficiently helpful. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, KEL-BROOKE-ASH,  Premenstrual Tension (PMT) or Syndrome (PMS) involves physical, psychological, and/or emotional symptoms during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle.  The symptoms are sufficiently severe to interfere with one's usual status.  Some of the known symptoms include tension, irritability, stress, anxiety, unhappiness, mood swings, insomnia, headache, and fatigue.  Each person's set of symptoms is unique to that individual.  The set of symptoms must be present in multiple consecutive menstrual cycles for the diagnosis to be established.  There is no laboratory test to confirm or refute the condition.  The incidence of PMT is higher when there is a family history of the condition, high caffeine intake, stress, history of depression, increasing age (until perimenopause, when symptoms begin to disappear), and low levels of vitamin E, magnesium, and manganese.    Agnus Castus is also known as Chasteberry, which has been used internationally for centuries by women to ease menstrual problems (particularly in Mediterranean countries), and is accepted by medical professionals as valid.  Research in the United Kingdom reportedly found that vitamin B6 appears to relieve PMT symptoms.   Lofepramine has been found to be helpful in easing the symptoms of PMT.   I hope this information is helpful to you.  Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "About two weeks ago I had a severe flu which turned into a respiratory infection. I was given Levaquin 500mg tablets, which I took for 2 days and then discontinued because of feeling dizzy and anxious, very unusual for me. My chest cleared and the doctor put me on a milder antibiotic, Augmentin, which I completed over a week ago. It's been over ten days and the feelings of disorientation and major anxiety haven't abated. Could this be a lingering effect of the Levaquin? I read some online horror stories about side effects from flouroquilones but only took 2 days worth and had no other major reaction at the time (eg, tendon pain, etc.). Please advise, as I'd like to get back to myself. Thank you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Levaquin side effects?",
    "content": "Hello curious01,  \"Flu\" can be a connotation for a number of short-term illnesses, including viral and bacterial infections.  Generally, once the major symptoms have cleared, there are no residual effects.  There is a rare condition, Guillain-Barre Syndrome, which is very serious and can follow severe bouts of flu-like illnesses, and involves neurological effects which can be life-threatening.  If your symptoms worsen, see your doctor immediately.  There are some possible considerations in the use of the two medications.  Levaquin has a half life of 6 to 8 hours, which is the time it takes for about half of the medication to clear from your body.  Levaquin does interact with some other medications which might affect the absorption rate of the Levaquin, such as aluminum hydroxide, aluminum-magnesium hydroxide, calcium carbonate, didanosine, magnesium hydroxide, zinc and sucralfate.  Potential side effects include restlessness, confusion, hallucinations, encephalopathy, seizures, dizziness, headache, insomnia, pain, parasthesia (a prickly, tingly sensation), and allergic reactions.  It should not be used by persons with hypersensitivity to penicillins or in seizure disorders.  Augmentin has a half life of 1 to 1 1/2 hours.  Potential side effects include anxiety, insomnia, agitation, confusion, behavioral changes, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and allergic reactions.  Combining Augmentin with allopurinol can increase rash.  Hormonal contraceptives are less effective in the presence of Augmentin.  Probenecid can increase the effects of amoxicillin and other penicillins.  If your symptoms are related to medication, it appears they could be related to either one.  It would be really unusual, though, since both have short half lives and it has been a week since your final dose of Augmentin and much longer since the final dose of Levaquin.  It's also possible there are some lingering effects of the illness itself.  Your symptoms could also reflect personal stressors in your life.  I'm sorry that I can't be more definitive, but your symptoms don't clearly indicate a specific condition.  It would be worth a trip back to your doctor for further evaluation if they persist.  Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Affect of corticosteroid injection on a 16 year old?",
    "content": "Hello dhuang93,  DeQuervain's tenosynovitis occurs with repeated use of the wrist after a minor injury, which extends the injury and the tendon becomes swollen and inflamed.  Initial treatment is usually immobilization of the wrist, and NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) such as Advil or Motrin, or naproxen (Aleve).  A corticosteroid injection may be recommended to reduce swelling.  Immobilization of the joint after injection is recommended because the injection will make it \"feel better\" and it's difficult to resist overusing the wrist during the corticosteroid effects and thus may damage the tendon further.    Side effects of a single injection are very uncommon.  Short term complications have been reported, and include atrophy (shrinkage) and lightened color at the injection site, possible bacterial infection at the site (the skin is broken by the needle), localized bleeding or soreness at the injection site, or post-injection flare of symptoms, which is an increased inflammatory reaction to corticosteroids.  Tendons can be weakened by steroid injections into or near tendons, and can rupture as a result.  Brief, temporary facial flushing can happen.   Depending on the dose and frequency of injections, long term side effects can occur, and are more common than short term complications.  Long term effects can include weight gain, facial puffiness, osteoporosis, cataract formation, thinning of skin, and easy bruising.  Very rarely, there can be serious damage to the bones of large joints.    Short term effects after a single injection really are relatively rare, so before making your decision, it would be a good idea to discuss it again with your physician, as well as to include your parent(s) in the discussion.  I hope this information has helped.  Good luck to you!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello tucansam10,  There is considerable information about coming down on ecstasy.  The effects of the \"high\" don't appear worth the risk.  The \"high\" is described as a \"rush\" feeling, followed by a sense of calm and well being, often with heightened perception of color and sound, a feeling of energy, and may include hallucinogenic effects.    The side effects, or coming down, include any of the following in any combination:  confusion, depression, sleep disturbances, sleep apnea, anxiety, paranoia, muscle tension, teeth clenching, nausea, blurred vision, faintness, chills or sweating, elevated body temperature, rapid eye movements, memory impairment, increased heart rate, elevated blood pressure, tremors, hallucinations, and muscle cramps.  In repeat users, the development of an acne-type rash may signal a risk of liver damage.  With any use, there is damage to neurons in the brain related to using serotonin and dopamine.  Repeated use has resulted in Parkinsonism.  The symptoms you have experienced indicate that you are at risk of further damage with continued use of ecstasy - or a long-term \"crash\".  Your symptoms are very troubling, and I encourage you to see your doctor, and implore you to reconsider if you are tempted to again use ecstasy.  Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello kimjoy85,  There might be an alternative, but it's essential that your mother consult her doctor before proceeding with the medication, which is an over-the-counter drug.  A \"weight reduction aid\" fat blocker named \"Relacore\" has been found in some preliminary studies to reduce cholesterol and triglycerides.  It has been an incidental finding noted after persons being treated for elevated cholesterol levels used the weight reduction product.  It was used in combination with cholesterol reducing medication, so it may not be useful, or as useful, to persons in your mother's situation.  That underscores the need to discuss it with her doctor.  I hope this is helpful to you.\n\n",

However, if the 5 mg tablet is for \"daily use\" and the 10mg is prescribed for use every 36 hours, then no, they should not be considered comparable and should not be interchanged without the advice of the prescribing physician.  The issue is the amount of active ingredient that can remain in the body for more than 2 days, and cumulative dosage can lead to unpleasant or even dangerous side effects.  Your pharmacist can also assist you with information and will provide the package insert from Lilly, the manufacturer.    Good luck to you.\n\n",

However this year up at college I decided to give Adderall another try and see if it would give me the benefits it was not seeming to give me a year ago.    I started up last Wednesday (10/21/09), however I started up with a bottle of about 130 of them I had left over from last year that is outdated about a year.  Immediately I noticed I was able to focus a little better.  I was also excited for the side effect that I never had before, of having no appetite (as I am obese, weighing roughtly about 400lb).    My few questions are, is it safe to be taking out of date adderall of about a year?  Is there a way for me to keep my loss of appetite side effect as it will help me a lot now that I am working out?  Little more information, my doctor does not know I have started up again, and my current dosage that I am taking is 40mg in the form of 2 20mg pills a day in the morning (which I feel I need to take more for better effect as I'm heaver than I was when I was last prescribed).\n\n",

If this is helping you it would be wise to consult a doctor so you can get the prescription as needed in the correct dosage.  However, this is not a drug that is weight-determined.  Body size does not seem to matter when prescribing this medication.  Some adults need much less than some children.  It all depends on the individual response.  Adult ADD does occur and you very likely will benefit from treatment.  Best wishes.\n\n",

While women are more prone to urinary infections due to their anatomy, for the most part it's a one-way route and your bladder does not usually receive external fluids.  It is protection against infection through foreign material and fluids.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "As far as I know it doesn't effect them.  I had Typhoid (I had 4 tablets not the injection because the tablets in the this dose lasted longer than the injection (3 yrs instead of 1yr)), Hepatitis A, Tetanus Booster, Diphtheria Booster when I went to Thailand (normally you don't need these but because I take stomach medications to reduce acid reflux (zantac) I was told I needed these because I would be more susceptible because I would have less stomach acid to kill off the bugs.  I had already had Hepatitis B, Annual influenza, pneumococcal pneumonia as well as all of my childhood vaccinations (measles, mumps, rubella, polio, whooping cough.  When I saw the travel doctors they didn't mention that my contraceptive pill would interfere (and as they are hormones which we have naturally I cant see that they would interfere but I would ask the Doctor/ clinic who will do your vaccines), but do recommend that you use other protection (condoms) if have a \"relationship\"...  I would let you know though that some vaccines have to be done a long way in advance as more than one injection is needed and a set time is needed between each vaccine (Like hepatitis A needs 6 months between each injection and there are 2 in the series).  Not sure where you are in the world but if you are concerned I would call a clinic that specialises in travel medicine or your treating GP/PCP.  I am not a medical person but have travelled (never to Africa but would like to go one day) and the above etc is from my experience.  Good Luck with your trip sounds great.\n\n",

    "content": "First off, I am a 40 year old recovering cocaine addict and alcoholic.  I was diagnosed with depression by a psychiatrist in 2004 and prescribed Paxil (before I started using cocaine) but it made my restless legs syndrome drive me crazy.  I stopped Paxil, and shortly thereafter started using cocaine for approximately two years...long story short I had an intervention during a suicide attempt and was baker acted (hospitalized for 72 hours) and have been clean since.  (1035 days ago!)I the first couple of weeks after the attempt, the psychiatrist put me on Paxil again and again the RLS drove me insane.  No sleep at all.  After 2 weeks I took myself off so I could get some rest.  6 months later my primary care physician put me on Wellbutrin, (Yes, he has full disclosure on my history) which to my (limited) understanding helps increase dopamine and not serotonin (which for me drives the RLS). I have been on the Bupropion for over 8 months now and seem to be doing OK.  Problem is, my memory, attention span and motivation are severely diminished.  My ability to read something, stay focused, comprehend it and retain it is very frustrating.  My wife often calls me Dorey (character from the movie Finding Nemo) because I am easily distracted by 'shiny objects'.  My job is very technical in nature with tons of reading as well as certification exams that I have to periodically take and this is affecting my performance on the job.  My question is, after reading up a little on the subject this seems to be a side effect of the Bupropion and it is not unusual for Adderall to be prescribed along with it to assist with these symptoms.   Questions\u2026are these symptoms of the Bupropion?  Given my history with cocaine would Adderall be something I should ask my doc about?  Is there an alternative to Adderall that would effective?  Thanks in advance for your help.\n\n",

It's true that both partners should be treated in many of the pelvic diseases.  Cipro would probably not be the drug of choice as it is not specific for such conditions.  Clindamycin might be appropriate, again depending on the actual diagnosis.  The very best approach is to contact your doctor at your earliest opportunity to discuss the most appropriate treatment.  Good luck to both you and your wife, and I hope this information is useful to you.\n\n",

In reviewing her medications, there doesn't appear to be any specific negative interactions among them, except that there is a possibility that R-Tanna and carisprodol could potentiate certain effects.  Many of the issues your mother is having are listed in the side effects of the carisprodol.  It would be a good idea to discuss her medications with her pharmacist to assess the possible interactions and side effects, as well as to list her symptoms and inform her doctor so he or she can take any appropriate action in adjusting her medications.  If there are no obvious medication issues and her symptoms persist and/or worsen, keep a record of her symptoms and ask her doctor to assess her overall mental functioning.    Good luck to you both!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Goodfellow56,  Klonopin is known to be effective in several different conditions, due to its effectiveness in the central nervous system.  Some of the conditions it may be used for include various types of seizures, panic disorder, bipolar disorder, in combination with other medications in the treatment of schizophrenia, restless leg syndrome, Parkinson's Disease, multifocal tic disorders and neuralgias (certain types of pain).  Whenever a side effect is identified and confirmed, it's added to the list of side effects, even if it's very rare.  Since you're seeing a different doctor, it would be a good idea to have a thorough discussion with him or her about your concerns.  There are several alternate medications that might be used; when you talk with your doctor about your issues, ask about them and ask about side effects.  Your pharmacist can also help with drug information.  Because your twitching is inconsistent, it would be a very good idea for you to keep a daily record of them, including what kind of twitching happens, what time it happens, what you were doing when or just before it started, how long it lasted, what helped or made it worse, and any other information you think is important.  This will help your doctor be able to clearly see the impact on your life as well as to document any patterns that might be useful in diagnosis.  Take your record to all medical appointments.  It will also help you track your condition and any improvement or worsening.  I hope this information is helpful, and I wish you the best of luck!\n\n",

Lethargy has been reported by some patients taking Omeprazole, and some small studies have been conducted, but it doesn't appear that any long-term controlled studies have been done.  Side effects of any drug may resolve over time as the person's individual metabolism and chemistry adjusts to the drug, but this is not always the case.  The most appropriate action would be to discuss the situation with your doctor.  A regular, mild and progressive exercise program may help improve and restore energy levels, if approved by your doctor.  Biotin is known to improve energy, but should not be added without your doctor's knowledge and approval, and an alternate medication might be his or her preferred choice.  I encourage you to see your doctor at your earliest convenience to discuss your concerns.  I hope this information is helpful to you.  Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "It is a long story, but I had been on pain meds prior to surgery through a pain Dr.  The Pain Dr. had referred me to the Surgeon as they worked out of the same hospital had been consulting back and forth on my case.  I had the surgery and was directed to stay on my current meds and was given scripts upon discharge as well.  It turned out later that what I was given at discharge from the surgeon was very close to what I had been taken all along from the pain dr.  It had a different name, but was almost the same thing I later found out. I never questioned it as I had been on multiple pain meds prior to surgery.    It is now 5 weeks after surgery and after requesting a refill on the medication I was receiving from the pain Dr., I was called back by the nurse who was very nasty to me on the phone saying she needed to talk to the Dr. about my case.  At this point I was confused so I called the office back and asked that the Dr. please call me so we could talk about this issue.  I spent 4 days trying to get him to return a call to me.  I was told that I was not to receive anymore meds until I saw him.  He was in an office 2 hours away and I have not been cleared by the surgeon to drive and I couldn't arrange a ride until the following week.  I explained this to the nurse and they grudgingly said they would work me in to see another Dr. at the Pain Clinic at a location an hour away.    I told this Dr. who I had never seen before that I had not realized that the meds I had been taking from the Surgeon and Pain Dr. were pretty much the same thing.  He became very angry with and basicly called me a liar.  I went on to explain that the names of the meds on the bottles were different.   He calmed down and said \"you may have cooked your liver and if you did there is nothing we can do about it\".  I was terrified at this point. I had been honest with everyone about what I had been on in terms of meds from start to finish and the meds I had been on prior to surgery were listed on my discharge paperwork when I left the hospital, along with the new scripts.  It ends up that the Dr. leaves, a nurse comes back in and says that they are dismissing me from the pain clinic.  They give me a 30 day script of another pain med I have never taken before and a sheet to get a blood test for liver function.  I was also given a discharge sheet that says I need to find another Dr. to continue meds.    I am totally confused and scarred at this point and I don't know what to do.  I am worried I have hurt myself and on top of it I was treated like a criminal and just cast off like trash.  I need some advice on what I should do.  I know that there are 2 sides to every story, but if someone could please provide some guidance from the assumption of what I am saying is true.\n\n",

It would be a good idea to make copies of all of your discharge paperwork to take with you to your new doctor; keep your original copies.  Ask your pharmacy for a printout of the medications prescribed, and make a copy and take that along, too.  Also ask the pharmacist for information about all of the medications that have been prescribed; product inserts should be provided when the prescription is filled, and part of a pharmacist's usual role is to help you understand what the medication is for and to understand potential side effects if you ask for assistance.  It might be helpful for you to request your medical records from the pain clinic; you likely will have to do that in writing.  The clinic may prefer to forward the records to your doctor; in most states in the United States, a person is entitled to copies of their records, if that is an option that you would prefer.  You can check the status of where you live by doing an online search for patient rights in that state or country.  Document what happened from your perspective before you see your doctor, to clarify any details and so you don't have to do it from memory if you are stressed.  It's often very helpful to maintain a daily record of your symptoms, including when they occur, their duration, what helped or made them worse, and the medication dosage and time taken.    You can submit documentation of your concerns to the local County Medical Board, to the State Board of Medicine, and/or seek legal interpretation of your situation, according to your preferences.  I am not encouraging you to pursue legal assistance, although that is your right; I am trying to help identify routes of action that you might or might not consider in trying to resolve your problem and plan for future treatment.  Finally, although your situation is scary, try to wait and see what the result of the liver function test is.  \"You may have fried your liver\" is a statement of possibility, not of fact.  Once you have seen a doctor and gathered your information, you may find that while there was risk, there was no or minor damage in actuality.  I hope this information is helpful to you and I wish you the very best of luck in this situation.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I'm glad I found this website. I called the Nicoderm CQ phone number and asked them the same questions...but for some reason their responses are really short and basic. I guess they can't give me much of a medical opinion.  I had a hard time asking my question in the title/subject line, because I actually have another question that goes with it. I will try to explain my situation.  I used Nicoderm CQ to quit smoking. I started on step 2 and then step 3. Almost 2 weeks ago, I stopped using the patch (because it was time to). At that time I wasn't taking my bipolar medication/Lamictal, so I think that's why getting off the patch was difficult. Since I was having a hard time with it, about a week and a half ago I had a weak moment and went back to smoking. I'm only smoking about a half a pack a day. Now I'm back on my medication and definitely want to stop smoking AGAIN. I want to rewind a little bit and go back on the patch. I think I'll do better next time, since I'll be more myself and back on track.  So anyways...my question is...since I've only been smoking for a week and a half can I start on step 3? If not and I have to start on step 2, do I have to be on step 2 for the full amount of time? They say step 2 for 6 weeks and then step 3 for 2 weeks. I really would like the process to be a little shorter...since I just did the full 8 week process when I first stopped smoking. I would hate to start all the way in the beginning again. Will it work just as good if I just shorten the time a little bit or start on step 3?  I hope this wasn't confusing...it's so hard to explain. Hopefully someone can help me.  Thank you so much\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I do empathize with you for on your frustrations on not getting a satisfactory answers to your queries from the manufacturers.  But, i observe that you have missed out on some details(this time at least!). For example, you say that you initially started in step 2 and then went on to step 3, but you have failed to indicate how many cigarettes you were smoking prior to that. You have not indicated whether you completed step 3. You say that now you are smoking \"about\" half a packet/day but don't indicate if it is less than or over 10.  Psychiatric disorders and nicotine: Nicotinic receptor systems of the brain have been known to be  important for a variety of aspects of cognitive function which are impaired in schizophrenia and aggravated by antipsychotic drugs. Nicotine and nicotine agonists can potentially reduce some of the cognitive impairments caused by some antipsychotic drugs. Novel nicotinic agonist treatment for the cognitive impairments of schizophrenia and antipsychotic medication hold great promise as therapeutic treatments to improve the lives of people who suffer from schizophrenia. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2702723/)   Schizophrenic patients have been noted to have high rates of cigarette smoking. Several studies have observed that \"Atypical\" antipsychotic agents (include Risperidone and olanzapine) , in combination with the nicotine transdermal patch, significantly enhanced the rate of smoking cessation. Risperidone and olanzapine were seen to be associated with the highest quit rates.  Thus, it appears that the newer medications used to treat schizophrenia also might be helpful for these patients in treating smoking and other types of drug dependencies.  I feel that (based on the details given), one may better start afresh at step 2 atleast for a full 6 weeks followed by step 3 for 2 weeks rather than to try and shorten the duration of the steps.  Now that you are back on your medications, it may be better to discuss the implications with your psychiatrist as well before using the patches. From the aforesaid information, may be you will be able to be truly successful in quitting this time around now that you are back on your meds(whose efficacy in this context is not known). Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Safe amounts of Paracetemol",
    "content": "Hi, Firstly, i  note that you have not provided any background information about your present general health, past medical/surgical history, drug history or the indication for the need for such a dosage schedule.  Recommended dosage schedules for the oral formulation are variously quoted(with minor variations) in the medical literature. One of them is as follows. The maximum amount of paracetamol for adults is 800 milligrams (to perhaps 1000 mg) per dose or upto perhaps 4000 mg per day in 4 maximum doses.  Taking four 500mg tablets in 2 hours (will make it 2000 mg in a single dose or at least equivalent to a single dose) and there after a further 1000 mg after 8 hours is certainly neither scientific nor safe.  In this proposed regimen (of yours), - the first 'dose' is certainly higher than the recommended maximum per dose and - the second dose is too close to the maximum (or nearly maximal) dose for comfort.  Although, the total dose for 24 hours(provided you stop at that) is seemingly within the recommended daily maximum, it is not to be recommended or tried without medical supervision.  These recommended dosages have been arrived at following years of experimental/clinical research, post-marketing surveillance, and case reports.  PS: Of late there have been increasing concerns about paracetamol and its 'recommended' dosages.The US believes a high proportion of paracetamol associated hepatoxicity is caused by unintentional overdoses. Also, there are concerns that apprehensions over the toxicity of the NSAIDs may cause an increase in paracetamol consumption.That view differs to that in the UK where direct research, has shown that almost all paracetamol overdoses are intentional.  ( In july 2009, an FDA(USA) advisory committee had recommended that new restrictions should be implemented on paracetamol usage in the United States to decrease the chances of the potential toxic effects. The maximum dosage to be consumed at any given time had been recommended to be reduced from 1000 mg to 650 mg, while combinations of paracetamol and narcotic analgesics would be prohibited.These recommendations had not been implemented as of march 2010).   Therefore, perhaps one may be justified in taking other than the recommended dosages only in the following circumstances. - your doctor recommended or - as part of a clinical trial. Best wishes!\n\n",

I would still wake up several times during the night and not get more than a few hours of GOOD sleep. So I started taking 100mg to 125mg about an hour before bed and it has worked great. I was just wondering if that was a good idea or not. Ive heard from friends that it can get you \"High\", but that is not my intention I just feel very drowsy about 30min. before bed and I fall asleep quickly and stay asleep which is great. I am however scared of becoming addicted and was also wondering if taking a higher dose could lead to dependency. I will hopefully at some point be back on first shift but not for some time and would like to stop using it if and when that does happen.

    "title": "Re: Waterproof DEET",
    "content": "Hi, I believe you are referring to the \"West nile virus\" which first occured in 1937 in the West Nile district of Uganda.The first epidemic in the western hemisphere started in north america in 1999.West Nile virus (WNV) activity in the Dominican Republic was reported for the first time in november, 2002.  Affects many bird species, horses and humans.Transmitted by mosquito bites. Migratory birds were the prime suspects for the rapid spread of WNV through North America.  Mosquitoes are attracted to humans by skin odors and carbon dioxide from expired air. The active ingredients in repellents make the person unattractive for feeding.  DEET (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide) and  Picaridin (KBR 3023) are two of the most reliable and tested mosquito repellents.  Perspiration or getting wet may result in the need for re-application. In general one should re-apply repellent if one starts to get bitten by mosquitoes again.  Many of the mosquitoes that carry this virus bite between dusk and dawn. Repellents containing a higher concentrations (higher percentage) of active ingredient tend to provide longer-lasting protection.  A product containing 23.8% DEET provided an average of 5 hours of protection from mosquito bites. A product containing 20% DEET provided almost 4 hours of protection A product with 6.65% DEET provided almost 2 hours of protection Products with 4.75% DEET were both able to provide roughly 1 and a half hour of protection. (Fradin and Day, 2002, CDC publications)   DEET concentrations higher than 50% do not increase the length of protection.    Some of the recommendations for avoiding mosquito bites effectively are, - one should choose a repellent that provides protection for the amount of time that one will be outdoors.  - one should choose a product with a higher percentage of active ingredient if one will be outdoors for several hours while a product with a lower concentration can be used if time outdoors will be limited.  - repellent should be re-applied if one expects to be outdoors for a longer time than expected.  I am not aware of any water-proof mosquito repellent containing the aforesaid safe,tested and peer reviewed chemicals. Best wishes!\n\n",

He suffers from multiple mental conditions and is prescribed 20 mg of adderall that he takes every day.  He also recently has been smoking marijuana once or twice a day now for about a month.  I am trying to convince him that it is not a good idea to mix the two, as they are both and upper and downer, but he claims that they cancel each other out.  I am aware that they work on both the peripheral nervous system and the central nervous system and that there is not a way to cancel them out because they work on each system.  Can you give me some information on the dangers of mixing the two substances?  thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Regardless of the Adderall, marijuana poses health dangers.  To deny this is being irresponsible with your health.  Manipulating your moods with drugs when not prescribed by a doctor is dangerous so combining these without the prescribing doctor knowing about it is not smart.  I think your fiance is rationalizing his irresponsible behavior and this would be a red flag for future problems.  Self-medication with illegal or addictive substances is asking for trouble.  Good luck to you in your efforts to help him.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Debbie Miller is completely wrong in her post, mixing these two substances is safe, even if they do cancel each other out. Marijuana is not harmful in itself and therefore can ultimately be combined with any drug without imposing a potential risk. Marijuana doesn't affect the CNS that much, it has a greater effect on your concious mind, in other words your motor skills and functioning skills. It imposes no danger to the body in itself when consumed. The legality of marijuana has nothing to do with whether it is safe or not, proven ignorance in itself. Marjiuana is not dangerous and is kept illegal because the government cannot tax it. In reality, the adderall is more harmful to his body than the marijuana as adderall's main compound being amphetamines, the same stuff found in methAMPHETAMINE and SPEED, its just \"legal\", so it's deemed \"safe\". On my last note, marijuana is not proven to be physically addicting in any way shape or form which is why you can obtain a \"medical marijuana card\" if your state provides one which allows your fiance to go to a distribution center and legally obtain marijuana, with the MMJ card being his script.   Best Wishes\n\n",

    "content": "Okay I can agree marijuana is somewhat \"harmful\" to the body. But really? How bad can it REALLY be if people are fighting to get it leagalized. You can already get a prescription for it. There's drugs that are legal and they do more harm than marijuana, such as painkillers and k2. Now, Im not saying that having a fiance that smokes everyday is perfectly fine, because I do believe marijuana is a gateway drug and can very easily lead someone to experiment with other drugs. But I know people that have smoked everyday for like a year or two and there's nothing wrong with them? At least that I could see. However, I do not know much about adderall except the active ingredient in it, but I wouldn't think it would do any serious damage. Especially if he's just taking his prescribed amount. I think that doctors just say all this crap cause it's all they know about marijuana. It's all the propaganda about it. But I do agree marijuana is a gateway drug and somewhat mentally addicting. I have know this first hand. I've seen it when I went to rehab. It happens more often than what most people think. When you're used to smoking everyday, and then you're suddenly told to stop, it can be hard because that's what you were used to doing and it was part of your daily routine. Thats what you might need to worry the most about is mental addiction. IN MY OPINION. Im not the doctor so believe whoever you want.Im just saying, she sounds like one of those old people that say bad things about it because she was raised to believe it can kill you. WHICH MARIJUANA CANNOT KILL YOU! Just to throw that out there. Thank you\n\n",

    "content": "Hi  I\u2019m wishing to ask a question regarding alopecia androgenetica. I\u2019ve been suffering from this since the age of 13 (since my periods started) as well as hirsuitism and acne, on my chin and neck. From the age of 25 I started wearing lace wigs / systems specially designed for hair loss wearers as my hair thinned to the point where it could no longer be disguised with cover products or thickening products.   My brother also suffers from this alopecia androgenetica, acne and hirsuitism, but he has had amazing results using Propecia (I think the generic drug is finasteride). He has been able to regrow hair, and his hirsuitism and acne has been controlled  As all the literature surrounding Propecia has always said it is strictly for men I\u2019ve never tried it. Recently my brother has switched to Avodart (I think the generic term is dutasteride) due to reports that it is more effective that Propecia as it tackles both types of 5-alpha-reductase enzymes which thins hair on scalp and causes excess hair / acne on face and body as opposed to Propecia which tackles just one type of 5-alpha-reductase enzymes. However, he made a very interesting comment to me.  He mentioned that the reason why Propecia (and also Avodart) is restricted to men is that it can cause horrific deformities in unborn male fetuses so women who are pregnant or are able to get pregnant are in danger. However, what if I definitely don\u2019t wish to have children? I am 31 years of age and am currently on Dianette / Diane-35. I\u2019m not using it for contraceptive purposes either; I use it to help my acne and hirsuitism. For religious reasons I do not have sexual relationships.  My question is; is it safe for me to try either Propecia or Avodart so long as I ensure there is no chance of me getting pregnant? I\u2019ve tried all other avenues (various preparations of minoxidil which seems to slow down hair shedding but by the time I was introduced to it I had lost a lot of hair already and it would not regrow hair, just slow down further loss. And I\u2019m tired of wearing wigs and lace systems which are costly, take time and cause your scalp to itch. As Propecia and Avodart have worked so well for my brother I would love to try them myself but I\u2019m scared of the fact that these medications all state that they are prepared just for men  Thank you\n\n",

I doubt you have done any harm to your liver but you should stop taking the extra tylenol with your norco prescription now.

The difference was that I could eat and sleep more easily after use and I experienced no Depression on the come-down.  (cut cocaine did give me side effects but when purified it gave me none)  So in my Senior year of high school I used pure cocaine in place of my Adderall, and for the first time in my life I got straight A's in school, and more importantly I was happy, eating and sleeping all the while.   I know cocaine is illegal but it seemed to work with my body much better than the legal amphetamines my doctor prescribed me. Am I crazy for feeling this way?  I'm very confused about this issue.\n\n",

    "content": "There is no physical addiction to caffeine. It is a psychological problem with very minor physical side effects related to the lack of stimulation. Therefore it is not only safe, but much more effective, to simply stop use of caffeine-containing products, since psychological dependence is often more difficult to manage by weaning than is actual physical dependence. You may feel low energy and sleepiness for a while after withdrawal, but if you attempt to wean yourself from caffeine you likely will never get very far with the program.   Hope this is helpful. Good luck to you.\n\n",

Side effects from psychostimulants may get worse if you take excessive caffeine, either in other medications or drinks so it would be related to excessive stimulant intake. Taking a high amount of caffeine can increase the risk of nausea, nervousness, palpitations, problems with sleep, rapid heartbeat, tremor, or other side effects associated with Ritalin.    Caremark.com is a good resource for checking drug and food interactions and they report no significant interactions with grapefruit juice. When I search Drugs.com, Rxlist and FDA information I still do not find any concern with this so I don't know of the information you have received regarding the effects on the drug's half life when citrus is taken.  If you can provide more information about this, we might be able to learn more about it.  This is the reason I suggested you speak to your pharmacist as well.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Thank you Debbie for forwarding this post. I also have searched to find a link between grapefruit and Ritalin / caffeine and could find none.   Grapefruit juice is a relatively strong inhibitor of an enzyme in the liver called cytochrome P450 (isoform CYP 3A4). This is a very important enzyme responsible for the metabolism of many drugs (including certain calcium channel blockers, immunosuppressants, some antidepressants and cholesterol-lowering drugs among others).   Hence there is a host of drugs that are affected by ingestion of grapefruit juice. Other citrus fruits do not cause significant interactions compared to grapefruit juice.  Interestingly Ritalin (methylphenidate hydrochloride) itself causes signficant drug interactions too. What the combined effects of all this are, is really beyond my scope of knowledge but I don't think it's a problem.  I think we may need to consult our pharmacy team with this one.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "It is correct that grapefruit juice is an inhibitor of the liver enzymes that break down the medications we take.  In most cases this means medications would not have the desired effect, such as if you took less of the drug than was prescribed.  However, this is not always the case.  If the medicine relies upon the liver enzymes for its activation, then grapefruit juice would have the same effect as if you took a higher dose than was prescribed.  Behaviorally, caffeine will have additive effects to Ritalin or any other stimulant.  So, if Ritalin calms you, adding caffeine could make you drowsy.  If Ritalin gives you the jitters, adding caffeine will cause you to need to be scraped off the ceiling.  Physiologically speaking, the caffeine will have additive stimulant effects to your brain.  If you add two powerful stimulants (caffeine and Ritalin) to the brain you could be risking serious, permanent damage to your brain.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

Recently, the drug has been losing its effectiveness. I will have an opportunity in the month of July to take some time off of the drug. I have a full week without work, but I could try to not take it during some work days as well. My questions is, typically (and I know it varies with people) how long does it take for a drug holiday to affect tolerance?

It also inhibits CYP3A4 so theoretically would decrease levels of phenobarbital in the system.    In practice, acetaminophen and Primidone are reported to have no adverse interactions and are considered safe to use together.    Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  There are no specific long-term effects due to use or even overuse of nicotine gum, but there are occasional recorded instances of overdose, which apparently hasn't happened with your mother. Those symptoms would include nausea, vomiting, excessive saliva (drooling), unusual sweating, headache, dizziness, confusion, fainting, rapid or irregular heartbeat and, most especially, hearing problems. If none of this has happened to the extent of disruption then there has effectively been no overdose. The only long term side effects are controversial and uncertain, such as gum disease and hiccups and excess saliva causing swallowing problems. After 10 years your mother has either adapted or worked through these side effects. There's really nothing else in the course of normal use, and 10 sticks per day really isn't excessive, although over 10 years I'd have to say the gum hasn't really accomplished anything except to keep her off actual cigarettes, which is a plus but not the usual way this works. In short she's probably better off doing what  she's doing than actually smoking -- by a long shot.  Hope this is helpful.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Just to add another thought on the subject.  Possibly your mother is chewing the gum too fast.  The \"chew and park\" method is suggested to get maximum benefit of gum.  This means she would chew the gum just enough to release the nicotine then park the gum in the buccal cavity until taste (or tingling sensation) is gone and then chew again.  Each piece is suggested to last about 30 minutes.   If she is chewing the gum too fast then she may be swallowing much of the nicotine which may cause gastric and esophageal side effects.  The swallowed nicotine is virtually rendered ineffective as it is metabolized by the liver, so she probably isn't getting the full effect of each piece of gum.    Hope that is helpful.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I'm encouraged to hear that you want to stop smoking.  This is a very challenging but beneficial thing for your overall health.  I would suggest using the \"patch plus\" method where you would start with the highest dose of the nicotine patch (21mg) applied daily to quell your baseline craving and then use the nicotine gum at those high craving times.  This will be safer than any amount of cigarette smoking you do because the level of nicotine will be lower as well as all the other negative aspects of smoking (i.e. carcinogens, carbon monoxide, tars, etc.) will not be present.  I would be watchful for signs of toxicity  including headache, nausea, vomiting, nervousness and excitability.  If these should occur contact your primary care physician. All the best to you.\n\n",

    "content": "I would want to ask if you have taken any other prescribed medications or over the counter products.  Some medications such as those in cold remedies/sinus medications over the counter can cause a false positive amphetamine screen.  Pseudoephedrine is a big one.  (Sudafed's original formula).   Ephedra will also do this.  (although I am not sure Ephedra is even accessable now over the counter anywhere).  However, I believe that the exact culprit can be identified through specific blood tests.  What may show up as a postive amphetamine on a urine screen can be confirmed on a blood test.  Blood work will even differentiate between an amphetamine and a methamphetamine. So, though it may cost money and be more of an effort, you could request a serum drug screen in order to prove yourself.  Please be sure to give a list of everything you take prescribed and non prescribed before your drug screens.  Include all herbal substances and over the counter supplements.  Debra Van Ness RN\n\n",

That said, a urine drugs of abuse screen should always be confirmed, typcially by Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GCMS). The are too many other-the-counter compounds (decongestants, diet pills) that can cause a false positive for amphetamines.  This method of confirmation will also differentiate methamphetamine from amphetamine or phentermine, two commonly prescribed sympathomimetic amines that yield positive screening tests.

The question of using it along  with Propecia is almost moot, although there are certain medications which certainly would render ecstasy more dangerous than it already can be under the right circumstances.   I wouldn't try this, since there's no known work been done on every possible combination of illicit and legal drugs. Then again I wouldn't be using ecstasy anyway,  due to the known dangers associated with it all by itself.\n\n",

    "content": "Last week, I experienced what the doctor told me are floaters in the eye. I am 59. l was told that the problem was due to aging and because I was short-sighted.  I did some research in the internet and understand the cause of the problem a little better.  I also understand that there is currently no cure for this problem although there are some claims of lasik procedure that could correct the problem.  I read also that for some people, the vitreous could settle down to the bottom and hence reduce the incidence of floaters.  My questions are : a) since there is no procedure to correct the floater problem, is there any thing one can do to minimise the increase of floaters as one grows older? b) can correction of short-sightedness prevent or delay the onset of floaters? c) as floaters is caused by aging, can I assume that the situation will only get worse as one ages? Is this assumption correct? d) statistically, what is the percentage of floater sufferers that are lucky enough to have the vitreous settle down to the bottom and the effect of floater minimised?  Appreciate your help in gaining more insights into the floater problem.  Thank you!\n\n",

    "content": "HI there --  While  floaters do tend to increase with age, it seems to be only up to a point, at which they reach a plateau and don't just keep accumulating forever. I'm not sure how short-sightedness figures into this, since floaters are essentially debris, so I'm not sure if vision correction would have any effect, though this would seem logical if it is true. I'm also unaware of anything that can be done to minimize floaters whether aging is a factor or not. They generally tend to be somewhat intermittent, so shouldn't be a full-time problem for most people.   As for your question regarding the floaters settling, I am of the impression this happens anyway, at least intermittently.   Given that this is not my area of expertise, I will refer your question to the opthamology team here to see if anyone has anything useful to add regarding this, since I know this is an issue and a major aggravation for a lot of people and any new light would probably be appreciated by many readers (as well as certain staff).   Please check back here in a day or two to see if there's anything addtional to be learned. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,floaters are  common  in an aging eye say after 40-45 yrs of age group. It is because of the vitreous degeneration which is a gelly within the eye. The gel becomes sol and the floaters start. They can be few or many more. They can be very frequent and  can stabilize or keep on increasing. They can be of any shape like a dot, thread, mosquito, fly, cobwebs etc, depending on the debris within the vitreous. Myopes are more prone especially high myopes. For few floaters normally no treatment is advised, since other than the nuisance they don't cause any problem, but if they are very much surgical procedures can be tried, which is rarely done. Over a period of time we develop the habit of negligence of the disturbance and that is the best line of treatmemt. Regards, Dr Ramamurthy M G\n\n",

    "title": "Re: How much potassium will affect you with Micardis HCT?",
    "content": "Hi there --  First, the amount of potassium (K) in the two Slim Fast drinks is about what one would find in a healthy meal, and about the same as a single over-the-counter K supplement sold in health stores. In other words, it wouldn't really count as a K supplement any more than eating the occasional banana might. In fact, hydrochlorothiazide (the diuretic part of Micardis HCT) can cause loss of K, and so the warning  to avoid potassium supplements might seem counterintutive. The reason for it is that when a person using HCTZ develops low K levels this should be corrected by prescription K supplement under the direction of a doctor, and OTC potassium supplements could add too much to the mix, since this would then be a form of self-medication and it's difficult to guage the amount to take using unregulated supplemental forms.   In  short, no problem with the Slim Fast, just don't use over-the-counter K supplements while taking this drug, only prescrption type, if it should be needed. Your doctor should periodically check your K level just to be sure it's okay. Usually there's no need to add any, if general nutrition is good.  Hope this answers your question. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Levaquin Side Effect?",
    "content": "My 17 year old son, who is a high school football and baseball player, has suffered from Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis since the age of 3. Last July, the rheumatologists at Duke took him off of all JRA medications and he has been doing pretty well. He has always played ball without injury or much pain.   Recently, he was diagnosed with mono and kidney infection by the local doctor. He prescribed levaquin oral as treatment, which he finished a week ago. In the past few days, he has been suffering from nausea and vomiting as well as abdominal tenderness. He has also developed a problem with his achilles tendon and know I think a patella tendon (on the inside of the knee).   I just discovered that all of this could be a side effect of the levaquin. He went back to the doctor and they seemed puzzled by what was causing the stomach problems and prescribed a pill for that (I think it is fenagren).   Do you think that these problems are related to the levaquin and is he at risk for any permanent problems. I initially thought the tendon problems were a result of baseball practice, but since I discovered this about levaquin it seemed like too much of a coincidence.  Thanks for your help.  Barry\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Levaquin Side Effect?",
    "content": "Hi Barry --  These symptoms definitely could be side effects caused by Levaquin and I have to question the wisdom of prescribing of this  drug, even though it would normally be approriate for a kidney infection, in a child with JRA. Rheumatoid disease, juvenile or otherwise, is a connective tissue disease which already puts the patient at greater than average risk of tendinitis and other inflammatory problems, so Levaquin would likely only increase the risk. The nausea and vomiting are quite typical of strong broad-spectrum antibiotics, so this is hardly surprising, and is a particular problem with something as strong as Levaquin, so I don't understand why this would puzzle the doctor, but Phenergan is certainly a potent anti-nauseant, so should at least help with that part, although it will likely make your son sleep a lot or at least be lethargic while taking it.   The risk for permanent problems would be confined to the tendon issues, and moreso due to the pre-existing JRA. However, this doesn't sound as though it has progressed to a serious point. The literature on Levaquin is very clear, however, in  stating that the prescribing doctor should be advised of this at once and the drug stopped, at the first sign of tendinitis. If there's no rupture, once the kidney infection is confirmed to have been resolved some anti-inflammatory medication should probably be initiated to treat the tendinitis and it should be followed closely for a while. For now your son will need to go easy on the activity and  rest the lower extremities to help avoid tendon rupture. A rheumatologist will likely need to be consulted for this problem, but if it hasn't worsened by now the  risk of long-term problems is probably lessened by  now.   I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck to you and your son, and please  do follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Side effect from combining Lyrica, Norco and Milnacipran?",
    "content": "Hi,  I have had a chronic pain condition since summer 2008 (diagnosed as possible fibromyalgia; not the result of any injury or accident). I have been on 4 x 75 mg of Lyrica daily for months, and it has helped me tremendously, with absolutely no side effects. I also take Norco, and have been doing so every day since November, with  no side effects. Since fairly serious pain remains, I started Milnacipran, the latest FDA-approved drug for fibro, also on the market in Europe for ten years as an anti-depressant similar to Cymbalta. I started with 2 x 25 mg daily two and a half weeks ago. I had no adverse effects at all (also no improvement, but I was told this could take a while to work); after seven days on the low dose, I increased the dose per instructions, to 2 x 50 mg a day. I have now been on this higher and final dose for about nine days. The first few days were awful: vomiting at night, vertigo, sweats. Then, the side effects stopped entirely for a few days, and I felt good. Suddenly, I have dizziness and mild nausea again, and am very tired. My main question is: is the Milnacipran probably causing these effects on its own, or could it be the combination with Norco and/or Lyrica that is causing the problem? I want to give Milnacipran a chance to work, and am willing to stop the Norco, but when I decrease it I get very bad withdrawals, and my doctor has said we will taper it, beginning in a few weeks. Thanks.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Side effect from combining Lyrica, Norco and Milnacipran?",
    "content": "Hi there --  If you've been having no side effects from Lyrica even when combined with Norco (probably the most innocuous of the three you're using), it's almost certain the milnacipran is causing the new side effects because those are ones it is noted for anyway, and there are no interactions with the other two drugs listed in the literature for it. This class  of drug (SSRI) generally does require some time to kick in and reach full effectiveness, and this one is well known to produce nausea and vertigo, so it would seem to be the culprit. Oh, and when I say Norco is innocuous I mean in terms of side effects, not potential for withdrawal syndrome (which Lyrica can also cause). So I'm virtually certain the milnacipran is responsible for the new symptoms and the only question remaining is: Will the benefit outweight the side effects and/or will the side effects subside and the stuff do any good? Long, convuluted question. Probably are two or three in there, really, but I think you get the idea. It seems to be the problem child among the  three. If the effects subside and it manages to help improve the overall picture it should probably stay. If not, you seem to have done fairly well with the first two.  Hope this answers your question. Good luck to you, and please do follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

I color my hair and 3 weks after i stopped taking voltaron, I got my roots done and ALOT of breakage happened!! almost a inch from the root in alot of patches and areas - THIS HAS NEVER happened before  - I  2. I did have a what I thought was a heat rash / red bumps on my forearms and upper stomach in florida-WHEN it started to heal the bumps were white and now seems to be gone. this has never happened befor either and go to florida every 2-3 months. My hair is still breaking 7 weks after I finished Voltaron in at the same length! Does Voltaron stay in the system for a long time? and would it have effected my new hair growing and made it weak and sensitive to sun or hair coloring? I still do have pain in my neck and numbness in my shoulder and upper arm - although it has improved it is STILL not healed - Voltaron seemed to really help but no one seems to know if it would effect HAIR - If it does I need to know ?

    "content": "Hello, I'm sorry about the trouble you are having, but I doubt very much it is related to the drug, Voltaren.  These side effects have not been reported and, though each person is different, usually the studies are extensive enough to pick up on any common threads in this regard.    I suspect it is something else causing the hair problem.  Dyes and bleaches do contain harsh chemicals and on repeated use, especially with bleaches, damage can be done and hair can fall out.  If color is combined with other hair treatments such as perms and straighteners, there is even more potential for damage.  You need to talk to your hair dresser as well as your doctor about what has happened.  The doctor will need to check your thyroid or other glands to see if there is a systemic problem causing your symptoms.  Best wishes.\n\n",

As for alternatives, the SSRI antidepressants don't appear to be a problem in pregnancy but since testing is not done on pregnant women, we recommend they be used based on risks and benefits.  There is a slight risk to the baby in transitioning (persistent pulmonary hypertension) has been reported in some cases of the mother taking them at the end of the pregnancy, but it is not known if that was the cause or not.  Some mothers choose to wean off in the last trimester, then resume after delivery.  They are safe in breastfeeding.  You can check otispregnancy.org for more information but several of the SSRIs such as Zoloft and Prozac have been used long enough now that we can feel quite confident when depression is a concern (and depression is known to be a risk factor for the baby).

    "content": "Since December (It is currently April) I have had aches and pains in my legs, feet, arms and hands. For the most part they are dull and somewhat tightening. There have been instances where the pain is more sharp and tense. For instance I have been at the computer using the mouse for an extended period of time as part of my job and my hand and wrist will tighten almost like a muscle spasm. This also occurs on the bottom of my feet, quads, inner thigh, hamstrings and upper arm. They last for about 5 minutes at a time and don't stay in one particular area. The pain also is continuous throughout the day off and on.  In December I was on my third month of the Alesse and taking Valtrex twice a day for three days for outbreaks of HSV-1 (genital) which were occurring monthly since my diagnosis in October.  I had blood tests done to check levels (specifically looking for anything related to vitamin deficiency, thyroid, arthritis) and everything came back normal.  I went to my normal chiropractor for more frequent visits for a month which didn't show or change anything.  Is it likely that I am experiencing these aches and pains as a side effect of the hormones from the BC pill? Or perhaps the Valtrex or maybe just from having HSV-1?\n\n",

The pain you describe would also not be typical of side effects of Valtrex so I'm stumped about the cause.

She originally had a breast size of 36C, but as a result of pregnancy and breast feeding her breasts have become smaller and less firm. I understand this is perfectly normal. She has become quite self conscious and has considered getting breast implants. We are not certain however that this is an expense we want to take on, nor the right message we want to convey to our young daughters. I have been doing some research into breast enhancement herbal supplements. Do they really work? My gut instinct is that they do not...if they did every women would be taking them. I don't trust user reviews or testimonials in that I feel that they are just part of the marketing of the product and not from real people with real results. Please let me know what the medical field knows about the effectiveness of these products.\n\n",

Hope that answers your question about the effectiveness of such products.  About the message you may convey to your two daughters, if you and your wife choose implants, I doubt that would ever be an issue.  Your daughters are at this time too young to understand such a thing, and parents don't have to reveal everything of this nature to their children.  Now, in the case that you did decide to tell them, I still think it would not be an issue, if she is simply restoring her figure to pre-breastfeeding size.\n\n",

    "content": "Yeah, there's definitely a point where it will cause death.  I remember reading an article from the news, published two or three years age, but read a month or two back about a girl (I think) who was kidnapped for ransom in either Mexico or Brazil (where kidnapping and demanding ransom is big business).  I don't remember how or why, but somehow the police came to rescue her (or maybe they were retrieving her after someone paid the ransom).  They found her body covered in nicotine patches.  Unfortunately I don't remember if she died or not.  It's likely that she did, though, given that the human LD50 for nicotine in adults is around 40mg.  Three cigarettes have more than this, however, because pyrolysis destroys most of the nicotine before vaporizing it.    Nicotine is very dangerous, it has a lower LD50 (lower = less drug needed to kill of course) than even Sarin, a organophosphate banned by both the UN and the US.  Not to say that the US doesn't have stockpiles, of course!  Despite all of this, because it's a nicotinic-ACh receptor, low doses are actually GOOD for you in many respects.  It's an effective treatment for IBS and ulcerative colitis, and it also greatly diminishes the risk of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.  The former is certainly the result of it's nicotinic ACh receptor agonism.  The latter is likely a blend of the increased extracellular DA concentration, and the MAO-B inhibition from a metabolite of a beta-carboline (norharman is the metabolite's name) contained in tobacco..  Not that this is a reason to start smoking.  I would suggest using drugs that do the same things without giving you cancer.  But then again, if you're 55 and in otherwise good health, with a history of Alzheimers or Parkinson's in your family, but have no insurance, smoking a cigarette a day won't give you cancer or any other problems before you die.  Then again, if you live to 100, that's an awfully long time to smoke.  Not to mention the fact that 1 cigarette a day should be cheaper than just about any other relevant drug on the market.\n\n",

It is not advisable to take both Tylenol and Advil together. If a person takes these medications they should be administered on an alternating basis. If you are experiencing a reaction after taking Tylenol make sure you inform your physician of this symptom with your next visit and avoid taking the product. I hope this has been somewhat helpful.

Signs and symptoms of MS may include:(keep in mind that these may also indicate other illnesses as well) Tingling or numbness in one or more limbs of the body or in specific parts of the body and the tingling or numbness can come and go.  Difficulty balancing/dizziness, recurrent or steady pain in an area of the body, Confusion or impaired thinking or memory Sensitivity to heat, fatigue, impaired vision, spasticity or muscle cramps, impairment of bladder or bowel function, partial or total paralysis. If the intermittent numbness is still an ongoing symptom I would certainly suggest an evaluation by your family physician. Waiting it out is not advisable. In my opinion (although not impossible) I don't consider it to be an effect of using the Nicoderm CQ. I hope this is helpful. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

On Monday evening his ears and nose looked red and felt hot and itchy and he broke out in hives, all over his body but primarily on his arms.  He has taken dukoral in the past without incident, so I don't think it had anything to to with it but we are concerned about the malaria pills, especailly since he is going away this Friday and is supposed to take another pill at the time and well as one while he is away.  Can this medication cause hives and if so, can they occur several days after taking the pill, in this case the pill was taken on Friday morning and the reaction was on Monday evening.  He took Benidryl for the hives on the evening of the breakout, and was okay for the better part of the next day, but broke out again in the evening.  As a precaution, would there be any harm if he stopped taking the Novo-chloroquine?    Thanks in advance for you help.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: allergic reaction to novo-chlorquine?",
    "content": "Hi there --  While novo-chlorquine has a fairly long list of possible side effects, any drug or substance has the potential to cause an allergic reaction, and while it is usually upon first use, it also can happen after many uses without incident. Also, while delayed anaphylactoid responses are rare, they can happen, especially if the reaction is a first-time  one.   My advice to you (or your husband) would be to discuss this with his doctor, since it's not certain which of the drugs he reacted to, and since he has to take more medication which may be responsible for an anaphylactoid reaction, and since these reactions are often more severe each time, pre-medication with Benadryl and/or steroids may be necessary in order to prevent a serious (or even just an annoying) reaction. Since the meds are necessary for travel to malarial areas, prophylactic premedication is probably the best way to prevent this from  happening again, and a doctor would have to prescribe or advise based on the individual patient's history.  I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you both. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Is it safe to take Dramamine daily?",
    "content": "Hello --  There are two formulations of Dramamine, \"original formula\" (Dimenhydrinate), and \"Less Drowsy Formula\" (meclazine). The former, which is an antihistime with antiemetic properties, is recommended not to be taken for more than eight tablets in 24 hours (or as directed by a doctor). Some people tolerate this fine for extended periods, but the drying effect can cause problems for some people who may have unrecognized bladder neck problems, and it also can cause significant drowsiness. It can be take on an as-needed basis, but is not ususally recommended as a maintainance medication.  The latter (meclizine) has more broad utility, as it also treats vertigo specifically, but is  often used as a maintainance medication, with the patient taking one or two tablets every 24 hours. This  can be taken indefinitely, especially when  prescribed in its generic form (which can also be purchased over the counter in larger amounts), or as Antivert. Meclizine has very little in  the way of side-effects and for most people drowsiness is minimal if there is any. This would probably be the better choice for daily or long-term use, and in generic form is a good deal less costly than the brand name form.  Hope this is helpful to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I had a check up with my PCP on Monday.  I spoke to her about some anxiety that I feel occasionally.  I am 47 and feel that is related to perimenopause.  By occasionally, I mean once a month or less.  I just wanted something that when this anxiety sets in--to take the edge off until it passes.    She prescribed 30 Buspar pills to be used on an as needed basis.  The pharmacist questioned this, saying that Buspar is not intended for this use--it needs to build up in your system before it is effective.  He said there were several other fast acting drugs specifically for this use, such as xanax.  My doctor says that Buspar can be effectived with occasional use and that it is a very safe drug--where xanax can be addictive.  She does not intend for me to take Buspar every day, just on an as needed basis.  I'm confused, if I am feeling anxious, will taking 1 Buspar help me?  The idea of having something to take is very comforting to me--but now I'm not sure if I got the right medicine prescribed.  Thanks Jenny\n\n",

    "content": "My opinion and opinion only here.  I have only seen Buspar prescribed as a daily medication over the years.  Not as a prn medication to take when you need it.  I won't argue with your doctor though.  The doctor might know something I don't.  As for Xanax, of course it CAN be addictive.  It is a completely different type of anti anxiety pill than the Buspar.  Xanax is most often prescribed \"as needed\" and not on a routine schedule.  It has a quicker onset of effectiveness.  Some doctors hesitate to prescribe anything that is a controlled substance/potentially addictive.  I understand the reasoning.  However, most of what I have read in studies indicate that short term use or occasional use of a drug such as Xanax is not really much a danger for \"addiction\".  Of course the doctor will take into account your specific medical history and specific needs.  Debra Van Ness RN\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,   I think i have a problem with codiene i was prescribed this medication over 2 year back after a miscarriage,  I started to take the med because of the heavy cramping etc but started to notice it also clamed my nerves and mood down.  I can say i was self prescribing, anyway last dec i had fertility treatment and got preganant and lost the baby due to ectopic. i lost my last remaining tube as it ruptured and again was sent home with codiene, I knew myself i was going to take this med just to self medicate.  I then had surgery for a bad tendon tear in august and was put on a repeat script for the painkiller. I did visit my GP and told her i thought i had a problem with painkille addiction, she asked how many i take and what mg i told her 30mg codiene and about 2 per day. I was very supprised when she replied i think your beating yourself up and do you really feel any effects? I again said yes and told her i was worried about the effect this was having not only on my health liver etc but on me emotionally. She then asked if I wanted to stop the prescription i of course said yes and need some help. I am now down to 20 pills left and no repeat with no idea how i am going to come off these pill alone. I feel i did not get any support or advise as to how to help me, any advise would be great thanks  Ps just for reference i have suffered very bad panick attacks in the past and this med does help a great deal with that. I am now scared what is going to happen after my Gp has stopped this med??\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Trying to taper off opioids after prolonged use (including abuse) can be difficult.    A few options:  - slow taper over the course of 8-12 weeks.  This can be worked out with a family physician: meeting with physician weekly, slow taper, and support like narcotics anonymous or other counseling.  - checking into a treatment center. - discussing with a physician the use of buprenorphine and naloxone for withdrawal.  This med is prescribed by a certified physician and is used for narcotic withdrawal.    Anxiety attacks may worsen with narcotic withdrawal so finding some coping mechanisms is very important.  Some physicians recommend short term course of a benzodiazepine however these have potential for dependency so caution must be exercised.   Let us know how it goes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  There are great benefits to nitrous oxide in dentistry and few risks. The gas is administered with a small mask on the nose, and the patient breathes in through the nose and out through the mouth.   Of course there are risks with all drugs, most commonly with misuse by an untrained person or used illegally for a \"high\".  With a competent professional, the risks are rare.  As a precaution against aspiration of stomach contents due to vomiting, patients should not eat anything for about two hours prior. The patient begins to feel a pleasant level of sedation anywhere from 30 seconds to three or four minutes.   After the gas is adjusted to the appropriate dose and the patient is sedated, the dentist can give any needed injections, and perform dental treatment. After completion, the patient is given pure oxygen to breathe for about five minutes, and all the effects of sedation are usually reversed.  Best wishes.\n\n",

However, if you have such as severe reaction to this, perhaps your doctor would prescribe an emergency kit for treatment of potential anaphylaxis and you could have this handy just in case.  Knowing you were covered this way might make it easier for you to relax in the sexual realm.  You could also use condoms at first until you are feeling up to trying it without.

I have recently found that over the course of the last 3 or 4 months she has been taking anywhere from 2,3,4,5, and sometimes even 6 of these pills per day.  I confronted her on this and she said that it is not dangerous, it is only dangerous if it makes your heart \"race\".  She said she asked her doctor if \"she was not feeling any effect\" if it was ok to take more and she said her doctor said that was fine.  My questions are these:  1.  Even if you don't \"feel the effect\" wouldn't that amount of this drug cause internal damage? 2.  Does this mess with your menstruation cycle and your fertility? 3.  If she is averaging 3 to 5 per day, what other kind of issues should we be concerned about?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Phentermine and long term use",
    "content": "Hello -  Your sister has lost 80 lbs in 6-8 months, which borders on dangerous in and of itself. She certainly doesn't need to work hard at losing any more, which would only involve fine-tuning anyway. As for the drug, yes, your concern is definitely warranted. While most people taking as much as your sister is taking would definitely have symptoms, some tolerate this drug better than others, which means abuse is a greater possibility. Her doctor's advice that it's OK to take as much as she  can tolerate without symptoms, if it's true and not something she's made up, is criminal. The normal doseage for phentermine is one tablet per day and sometimes one-half a tablet twice a day. It's not recommended that more be added, so the volume your sister is ingesting currently is extremely dangerous in many different ways. Her doctor needs to be advised of the  situation and if, in fact, he confirms the advice as his, this  could become a police matter. I think it likely he would deny having said any such thing and would recommend your sister stop taking the high volume of medication at once.   The greatest potential danger of phentermine is its not-fully-understood role in the development of pulmonary hypertention (PH), usually in the past, in conjunction with fenfluramine (as Phen-fen, no longer legal). There is also a related potential for life-threatening damage to heart valves. Unfortunately, just having the drug make one's heart \"race\" is no guarantee damage is not being done.  Since your sister is taking such a very high dose (overdose) of this drug, she undoubtedly has developed a psychological dependence on the drug. This needs to be addressed by a medical professional specializing in drug dependencies. Also there is the potential for heart and pulmonary injury. Further, it seems likely, since the loss of weight due to Phentermine use is only marginally greater than that seen in subjects given only a placebo, it is likely there are other drugs or other dangerous behaviors such as forced vomiting (bulimia), etc. She needs to be evaluated for body dysmorphic disorder as well,  even though she has currently reached a healthy body weight (for a very broad range of heights).  This is a very serious situation and  must be handled with a great deal of sensitivity toward the patient, since psychologic disorder tends to develop over time and can make dealing with the  person much more difficult as they will tend to try and hide and/or deny any dangerous behaviors (another reason to question  the story about the doctor's \"advice\" which seems very strange, because it would be criminal).   I hope this is helpful to you. Your sister may not appreciate your \"interest\" in her problem at present, but in time she will, since it may well save her life.   Best of luck to you. Please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

It is not regulated by the FDA so we can't recommend or refute this treatment.  I'm sorry I can't be more helpful.    There are many hair loss treatments that are scams so be careful.  If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.    If you are suffering from hair loss, you should see a doctor to determine if you have anemia, hormonal deficiency such as thyroid or PCOS or even an autoimmune disorder or chronic illness contributing to the condition, in which case legitimate treatments might be available by prescription.  Androgens may be too abundant and there is medication to counteract this condition.  It is important to find the cause and treat it appropriately so if you haven't already done so, please get help from a doctor.    Some hair loss can also be helped through your stylist but it is important to be sure you have excluded possible physical conditions that might be underlying.  Get a complete workup by a doctor who specializes in female pattern balding.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Other forms of testosterone replacement might be better, where regulation is more consistent so the best idea would be to talk with a doctor about the need.  He may want to check levels and examine the other concerns you have regarding delayed maturation.  In many cases the risks may be greater than the benefits and these include mood disorders, stomach problems, high blood pressure, headache, prostate problems and skin irritation.    This may ultimately be helpful to you but it would be best to use it under a doctor's care.  I can't verify it will do anything for penis size.      Best wishes.\n\n",

This is an antihistamine so check bottles carefully for ingredients before adding to the dramamine - this could be added to cold or cough medications, Benadryl, Zyrtec, Tavist, Dimetapp, etc.    Flexaril or Tramadol may also compound the drowsiness you might get with the dramamine so caution should be used, especially when driving or operating machinery.    Also, Wellbutrin and Tramadol are not recommended to be used together because of potential side effects.  Flexeril and Wellbutrin should be combined with caution, so you may want to discuss concerns with your doctor or pharmacist.  Sometimes the benefit outweighs the risk but you want to be sure nothing is overlooked and that every caution is taken for your safety.  If it is not absolutely necessary, I would not add Dramamine to the list.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Many drugs are used \"off label\" or for more reasons than the primary use.  It is because, especially with the brain and neurotransmitters, the problems overlap and different symptoms can result from abnormal levels of these naturally occurring substances (dopamine, adrenalin, norepinephrine, seratonin, etc.) which are sometimes out of balance.  Correcting them can help any number of problems and many anti-epileptic drugs help with other brain chemicals that need a boost.  It is exciting to find other uses for these drugs because each person is individual and it can be difficult to find the right one or combination of meds.  We sometimes have to experiment until we find what works.  It has been very frustrating that people suffer so with migraines, for instance.  But, now we can see that they may benefit from the same medications that prevent seizures.  So, apparently there is a relationship between various conditions involving these neurotransmitters.    Do not discontinue your medication without consulting your prescribing physician.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The only explanation I can give you for the response you had to this steroid is that each person responds in his/her own way to medications.  This is why the list of side effects on any drug is so extensive.  Not everyone has every effect and in almost every case someone has reported at least one effect - often this is a rare complaint and there is no way to determine if it was actually caused by the medication or was coincidental.  Therefore, the side effects that are most common with a particular medication are the ones the pharmacist and labeling folks will include in discussion.   It would be nearly impossible to mention every side effect ever reported with its use.  As for using this for weight loss - not a chance.  There are too many risks associated with its long-term use and dramatic results would not likely be achieved over time anyway.  Most likely your body would stop losing before you had been on the drug long enough to make the difference you seek.  Short courses of methylprednisolone are usually well-tolerated with few, mild side effects. Long term, high doses of methylprednisolone may produce predictable and potentially serious side effects.   These meds are used only when other treatments fail for inflammation.  There are better options for weight loss without compromising your health in other ways.  Seek the help of a dietician, personal trainer, Weight Watchers or other structured support program or your doctor for other medical treatments.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Both drugs (Nexium and Prilosec) act by inhibiting the secretion of gastric acids, so basically they should be equally effective and shift between them is generally allowed. The fact that your symptoms were controlled on the generic form (Prilosec) is more reassuring to do so.  However, it is better to always follow up with your doctor before doing any change in your current therapies. He is more aware by your condition and the available medications for treating your specific problem, so he can provide you the most convenient therapy.  What seems not explained is the fact that you receive at the same time the medication ranitidine (Zantac), although there are no reported interaction between these drugs, this combination is not a standard of care and is not usually recommended. Ranitidine acts by antagonizing the effect of the gastric acid on its receptors, so if you take another drug that already abolished acid secretion, it is not convenient to use ranitidine. Moreover, patients are advised to receive either of the drug alone to treat conditions like yours and not both of them.  I would advise you to follow up with your doctor and please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi. I just saw this and wanted to note that there ARE some circumstances when an H2 Histamine blocker and PPI are taken.  Laryngopharyngeal Reflux (which differs from GERD in that the Upper Esophagheal Sphincter is not working versus the Lower Esophageal Sphincter) allows acid aspirate into the pharynx which has zero tolerance for acid. In this case as much acid suppression is needed and so the treatment is more aggressive. About 6 percent of the population has it, with the symptoms varying from annoying to socially debilitating.  The standard of care is two (2) Nexium 40 mg a day PLUS an H2 acid inhibition drug at bedtime like Zantac, Pepcid or Axid. This is a lifetime treatment for most and effective for most. Of course with such suppression of acid digestive enzymes are important and possibly even bone scans, but I just wanted to note that there are medical reasons for combining these two classes of medications with this lesser known condition.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, My sister-in-law has been addicted to pain meds for several years and I believe she is going down hill again. A few years ago she was given morphine(patches) she was addicted and after a year or so came off of it cold (told a friend stole all her meds, but I believe she just really abused them and couldn't get refilled for a few weeks). She said she would never take it again, and it was the worst thing she ever went through. WELL, 2-3 months ago she was fired from her job, which was at a hospital (catering/food dept.). She had gone in and from the way she was acting (bouncing off the wall, from what I am told) her boss (or someone) escorted her to the ER side and she had to submit to a drug test. WELL she tested positive for morphine and alcohol, and she was fired and escorted out. The alcohol I believe made up as failing, so it would seem that the morphine was not true. She drinks only 2 times a year (new years & annivers. if even then). She swears to my brother, me & everyone else there is NO way she had morphine and even I believed her UNTIL yesterday. While my brother is in the hospital, we went to get something to eat and she tells me she has on a fentonal patch (her friend gave her) I asked what it was and she said a pain med that is awsome??? Well I didn't know what it was, and hadn't heard of this med. and she tells me her friend is sending her some fentanol lollipops, so I learned yesterday from her.I decided to research this med on line today because of the way she was acting last night it had me thinking if this may have been the med she took when she was fired, if it was along the same lines of morphine???? So my question is... if she was taking fentanol that day, would a drug test show positive for morphine? I am stuck, with watching her go down hill again, and my brother having many health issues this year. If he knew she was taking this fentanol he would be done with her. The morphine a few years ago had them separated, and with her getting fired, my brother being self employed and can't work much recently the bills are growing. If my brother found out for sure she was fired for that, or this med, and that she is taking this stuff, and falling downhill it would be the end of their marriage, and her 3 kids would be done with her as well.  I have my own medical issues, and have actual caught her stealing my meds (right after getting out of the hospital) but never told my brother because I didn't want to get in the middle. But this I have to know if it could be so I can decide what to do for my brother and his 3 kids.... PLEASE HELP.... as soon as possible... THANK YOU,  DC~Angel\n\n",

    "content": "Dear DC-Angel,  Substance addiction can be a real tragedy to a family.  There are so many possible underlying issues that can lead a person to fall into the trap of substance addiction.  I don't know why your sister-in-law started on the morphine to begin with, it possibly was for an acute injury, or for a chronic pain issue, and the starting reason is actually less important than why she stayed on it for a year (such as intractable pain - real or imagined) which very easily led to her addiction.  It seems, on the surface, that your surmise is correct, and that she overused the patches, ran out of them, and was unable to get them reissued.  The doubling up of the patches not only depleted her supply early, but also increased her dependence on them sufficiently to contribute to a hellacious withdrawal.  Sometime after that, it may be that she used her original justification for the need for a narcotic pain medication, whether it was an \"acute injury\", or \"chronic pain\", contacted a new MD, and requested strong medicine.  Fentanyl is an extremely powerful synthetic opioid:  a classification of drug that includes morphine.   Standard lab testing looks for the opioid metabolites that are found after the use of both morphine and fentanyl - as well as after other medications.  The fentanyl patches most commonly used are known as Duragesic and are supplied in a variety of strengths.  These patches are so strong that even disposal of them needs to be tightly controlled.  There have been cases when people have taken used patches and chewed on them to get the residual drug. Fentanyl lollipops are very quick releasing suppliers of the drug, and have been useful for people who are afraid of pills, or cannot swallow them,  or are not able to receive the medication in an injection form, and do not need the long-lasting release of a patch. They are also given for breakthrough pain for Cancer patients who are already on the fentanyl patch.   If your sister-in-law was using either the Fentanyl patches or the lollipops, she is technically telling the truth that she is not using morphine.  HOWEVER, she is only lying to herself in a way, because Fentanyl is still in the opioid family, is considered 50 to 100 times more potent that morphine, and will test positive as an opioid just as morphine does with lab serum or urine testing. Opioid tolerance is easily developed - and patients are considered tolerant if they are receiving morphine at about 60 mg/day, fentanyl patches of 50 mcg/hr or more, or on an equivalent dose of another opioid for a week or longer.  Chances are very high that she has been receiving some form of opioid for quite some time.   I feel for your anguish on behalf of your family and the children.  A whistleblower is a very difficult position to be in.  At the same time, if your sister-in-law is lying to herself and to her family, the lie will catch up to her and to them sometime, and then she may be found incidentally guilty of serving as a role model for the children for inappropriate and inadequate coping. You will need to decide for yourself, and with your immediate family as to what the family priorities are, and weigh the consequences of discussing - and NOT discussing - the concerns about her and her unfortunate addictions.  There are mental health professionals and substance addiction specialists in most major cities that may be of value in getting her help to both get clean, and to address the underlying issues - whether physical pain, or emotional distresses, that seem to be causing her to seek self destructive methods of narcotic relief.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi DC-Angel,  I will assume that the medication that you have referred to that your sister-in-law has said she was taking is Fentanyl. This drug is in the same family as morphine, known as Opioids, which refers to the class of medications either derived from the poppy plant or made to act in the same way by drug companies. So, this would show up on drug tests as positive for opioids, and could be further determined to be Fentanyl. It workds in a similar way and has a similar risk of addiction and abuse as morphine and a number of other opioids.   One way to look at addiction is that it is an illness, and people who have an addiction are at risk for relapses in abusing their drug for the rest of their life. With motivation and good treatment, your relative can recover from this episode of illness. She may need ongoing treatment over a long period of time.   I would encourage that she consider getting re-evaluated for her substance abuse problem and any other problems that may be contributing to it, and that she receive appropriate treatment.   Good luck!    -E. Seigle MD\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Family Member Addicted to Pain Meds-Need Anwser",
    "content": "Addiction to opiates is so destructive-- people who have never been addicted find it hard to understand why the addict keeps returning to such destructive behavior, blaming it on 'weakness' or 'immorality'.  While there are certainly 'poor choices' at the start of opiate addiction, one the addiction is in place there is little possibility for the addict to stop without aggressive treatment.  I encourage opiate addicts and their families to understand that addiction is a disease.  Such a view should NOT take responsibility away from the addict, or serve as an excuse-- just the opposite;  the addict has the RESPONSIBILITY to keep their disease under treatment.  Promising to stay 'clean', without doing something to treat the addiction, will always be an empty promise that ends badly.  I lost my anesthesia career to addiction to fentanyl;  I am now a psychiatrist.  It has always taken drastic measures to recover from opiate dependence-- such as leaving a high-paying career and going through another three years of residency!  Many people make the mistake of thinking that they can beat addiction through 'education'-- again, I was one of those persons.  My PhD in neurochemistry, studying receptor systems-- certainly that knowledge would help me!!  It didn't... if anything it kept me sick longer, as it gave me one more reason to treat myself instead of asking for help.  Even in residential treatment, some people don't 'recover' because they want to hold on to 'who they are' and just get some education... rather than make the changes necessary to find good recovery.  Like they say at AA meetings-- 'it works... if you work it.'  The 'rock bottom' is useful to open a person's mind to change.  I am a big fan of rock bottom experiences and their effectiveness in motivating change, but studies have shown that a person can recover without having a drastic bottoming process.  The biggest problem with waiting for a 'rock bottom' is that many addicts lose everything or die before getting to their own 'bottom'.  We now have Suboxone-- which has introduced a completely different treatment paradigm.  Suboxone will induce remission of opiate dependence fairly reliably-- in my experience treating addicts with the medication 'older addicts', say over 35 or so, do much better than 20-y-o addicts-- who tend to get bored on the medication.  Suboxone is a Godsend for addicts in that it can take a total mess and make it 'stable' in a few weeks... the problem, though, is that the addict must keep taking the Suboxone to avoid active addiction.  It is different from methadone in many ways, and I compare it more to naltrexone than to methadone-- the active drug in Suboxone is a 'partial agonist' (buprenorphine) at the opiate receptor, and it virtually eliminates cravings and at the same time blocks the receptor so that other opiates have no effect on the addict.  But again, it is not a 'cure'-- in my opinion a person should stay on it for at least a year, and then go off it only if they are replacing it with active recovery including 12 step meetings.  Suboxone does have considerable opiate potency and so it is being used more and more to treat chronic pain as well as addiction (the chronic pain use is 'off-label').  You will find about everything you need to know about Suboxone at http://SuboxoneTalkZone.com  A final comment about the drug testing:  Fentanyl will NOT show up in standard drug tests as morphine or as anything else.  It is a synthetic opiate;  I had to be monitored by the state licensing board after my addiction came to light eight years ago (I was monitored by urine testing for six years).  Fentanyl requires special testing that is more expensive and would not likely be done at the local ER.  If the testing WAS done for fentanyl, it would not 'cross react' in any way with the test for morphine.  I did come up positive once for morphine after eating a Starbucks poppyseed muffin-- I was tested about two hours later and had 700 nanograms per ml of morphine in the sample (a nanogram is one thousanth of a microgram, which is one thousanth of a milligram-- small amounts, so the muffins are not a cure for withdrawal!).  Codeine will show up as morphine, of course--  as codeine is metabolized to morphine at the liver.  As for what the person was actually taking... it doesn't really matter.   Fentanyl is much more potent than morphine, and in my opinion much harder to get away from-- it is very lipid-soluble, and so it crosses into the brain much more quickly than water-soluble morphine.  Fentanyl also builds up in fat stores in the body;  in low doses it has a short half-life from redistributing throughout the body, but when taken over time, from a patch, it fills the 'fat stores' and leaves the body very slowly, making for a long, miserable withdrawal.  My detox required a locked psych ward for a week, followed by over three months in a residential facility.  I started sleeping well after about 4 months!  Your sister-in-law needs aggressive treatment of one kind or another.  Her husband cannot save her, but he can perhaps use the leverage of leaving with the rest of the family to get her into treatment.  Addicts believe that they are completely unique, and that nobody will understand them-- but in reality, addiction is remarkably similar from one person to the next.  There IS help for her.  But it will take more than a few days-- it will take the rest of her life, living by a new set of priniciples.  The good news is that active recovery often provides a life that is better than the addict has ever experienced, even before using.  Recovery can help a person learn to open up to others, to establish proper boundaries, to take appropriate risks in life, to experience happiness, rather than 'giddiness'...  I am always amazed at how strongly an addict avoids recovery-- something that will improve his/her life so dramatically.  I feel for you, as the situation is truly tragic.  You can't carry the load for your sister-in-law, but maybe you can help her see that there is treatment out there, and if she doesn't take it, she will be alone-- if not dead.  I wish you well.\n\n",

Your sister in law seems to have developed tolerance with opioids and her recent relapse puts her even at a higher risk. I suggest you to talk to her and ask her to seek help before it is too late. Ask her to schedule an appointment with either a psychiatrist or therapist for better understanding of her situation and adequate referral. It is very important to do so not only for her but for the sake of the little kids and her husband. Having opiods at home puts kids at risk as it can be lethal for kids. There is methadone treatment also available for opioid addiction but she needs to be evaluated first.\n\n",

Assays for fentanyl are more expensive and not done routinely as part of drug screens by ERs or employers-- part of the problem in detecting fentanyl is that it is active in microgram doses, as opposed to the thousand-fold higher doses used of morphine;  another reason is because fentanyl is metabolized at the liver, rather than excreted at the kidney. As I mentioned in my other post, the nature of the substance in the urine is a moot point.  But for the sake of accuracy, codeine and some other opiates will appear as morphine in urine tests;  some tests will simply measure 'opiates', but in either case, fentanyl will not show up.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello... I am currently on a few different medications following a neck injury that caused some nerve damage. I am taking Lyrica (150mg 2x a day), amytripaline (25mg before bed), and Tylenol 3's (as needed, normally only 1-2 a day, unless I am in a lot more pain). I understand that any and all of these meds cause a lot of side effects. I have been sleepy (all of them cause sleepliness), and having a general feeling of being out of it, which as I understand are fairly normal reactions to these drugs. My worry is, the last week and a half, I have been smelling really bad. It is not my normal body odor (which has never been a problem), but a funky, garlicly, nasty smell (and no I'm not eating any garlic!). I have been showering, keeping clean, not sweating or doing anything different (except perhaps showering more!) and have no other issues other than the nerve problems (ie: infections or anything... and I am not menstrating either). The other day I had a shower and put on all clean clothes, and within 5 min. I smelt again. Is this a normal reaction to these meds? and is there any way around this problem?  Also... I have noticed that I have not been able to control my urinary function. I have no buring or smell or anything else to indicate a uti, just a lack of control (which has never been a problem before). Is this also a side effect of these meds?  Please let me know... thanks!\n\n",

I went through the list of medicines you are taking and two of them Lyrica and Amitriptyline lead to dryness of the mouth (it decreases saliva) and may do so at a minimal level but it could be enough to trigger off a bad breath. I am not sure that answers your question though because I understood you are referring to a body odor. Has anyone else confirmed this? Is it restricted to a particular part of the body?

When I told my mom, she told me they took me off of phenobarb & dilantin at the age of 1 1/2 because I would just cry & bang my head into the wall, they figured i was in pain and developing a resistance to the drugs.  Currently, I'm on gabapentin, i was told is a anti depressant med , but I'm reading it's also a seizure med.  I'm just wondering if these 2 drugs are chemically related & I don't know how to find out?    do you know?  I would think if this is a anesthesia side effect it would be gone by now  == sugery was 11/21.     Advil & aleave  are good for about 3 hours.

    "title": "Re: Drug allergies, How do I tell if this drug is a problem",
    "content": "Hi there -  Gabapentin is an anti-seizure drug which is also used as a nerve pain blocker (especially for post-herpetic neuralgia, but basically for any sort of nerve pain). Pamelor (nortryptaline) is a tricyclic antidepressant used also as a nerve pain blocker (primarily anymore -- rarely used for anti-depressant purposes now).   Your question \"...are these two drugs chemically related?\" is unclear as to whether you're asking if gabapentin and Pamelor are related or if either of them are related to phenobarbital and dilantin. To clear this up, none of the four drugs are in any way related to one another. Neither gabapentin nor Pamelor are related to each other nor to dilantin nor phenobarbital.   That being said, I question the wisdom of prescribing both gabapentin and Pamelor simultaneously, as they both can have rather marked side effects, some of which may overlap. Your main complaint, however, seems to be this headache \"from the neck up\",  which sounds rather like a tension headache. This could be due to rigor in the neck muscles or some other neurological response to one or both of the drugs you're currently taking. While gabapentin rarely results in headache being reported, but Pamelor does carry \"sudden  headache\" as both a side effect and as a reported adverese  event. It could very well be the cause of your unique headache. You probably should report this to your doctor and inform him that you intend to discontinue to drug to see if the headache abates. You should taper off the medication over the course of about a week's time to accomplish this.   The fact that the top of your head is sore to the touch suggests this is actually a nerve pain, so may well be a paradoxical reaction to one or both of the medications you're currently taking, but since Pamelor is more notorious for reportedly causing headache, while headace is rarely reported with gabapentin, I would remove the Pamelor first. You may well require one or the other (or possibly both) to manage your pelvic pain, but if you have to trade that for a bad headache, you may as well weigh your options. Just be sure you consult the  prescribing doctor and let him know if you choose to try taking a break from the Pamelor. He can't force you to take it anyway, but he should be aware of whether or not you're taking it.   If stopping  the Pamelor causes the headache to resolve, you've solved your problem. If it doesn't, you might need to persue some other course to relieve it,  or you may need to have your whole pain management plan rethought. However, I'd be  willing to bet Pamelor is the  problem here, and possibly moreso because it's being used in combination with another nerve pain blocker.  This is only a suggestion, and your conversation with your doctor, should you choose to persue this suggestion, should be what helps you make your final decision on the matter. However, I do feel use of the two drugs seems an unnecessarily risky and potentially very uncomfortable combination that a lot of people wouldn't be able to tolerate for a variety of reasons.   I hope this is helpful to you. Best of luck with all this and I hope you're feeling much better really soon. Please keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "1) Is it typical and appropriate to prescribe daily doses of Klonopin, Lactical, Seroquel, AND Celexa (plus Xanax on an as needed basis)?   2) If so, would it be typical and appropriate for a patient who has never had a seizure, and has not been diagnosed with manic depression, schizophrenia, or any other psychosis? 3) Would the combination of these 4 drugs be likely to cause a side effect of interference with thinking, memory, and speech?    I ask for a family friend, who has been prescribed and is taking these all 4 of these medications daily this year.  During that time he has become increasingly debilitated, so that his thinking is foggy, his speech slowed, his memory impaired, and he cannot work.  His doctor insists that the mental deterioration is a new symptom, but I am concerned it is more likely a drug interaction side effect.  The use of anti-psychotic medications began about January 2008, when the patient (who had been taking Effexor, Xanax, and a third psycho-active medication I can't remember, for mild depression, anxiety and insomnia) had a first-time ever episode of manic-type symptoms: racing thoughts, extreme insomnia, panic, and distorted thinking.  Neurological problems such as a tumor or brain trauma have been ruled out by an MRI and a CAT scan, and because the episode was a one-time event occurring at age 62, the doctors consider it unlikely that it represents permanent psychosis.  My concern is that our friend seems to be caught in a downward spiral of overmedication, in which new drugs treat side effects of old drugs, but create new side effects.  I am writing instead of him basically because he is so debilitated that he doesn't even have the energy or acumin to be asking probing questions. I am hoping that, by at least letting us know whether the combination of these drugs is typical, and what risks they have, it may help our family friend to look for new solutions.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  While we are talking third-hand about a patient with a medical record that isn't present here (except for the list of psych meds and the doctor's rationale for prescribing them), which makes this a little bit less than a definitive discussion, you certainly have a very reasonable concern about your friend, as well as good reason to believe you may be correct about the inappropriateness of the combination of drugs, as well as the potential for a medication  \"spiral.\"    Prescribing Seroquel (alone) for a single episode of racing thoughts and agitation seems rather precipitous. To add to it an antidepressant (Celexa), an anxiolytic/ anti-seizure med such as Klonopin (excellent for panic disorder or chronic anxiety) plus an anxiety/panic \"rescue\" drug (Xanax), all combined with \"Lactical\" (with which I am unfamiliar, but know there is a calibration chemical used by the milk industry, mainly for goats -- could you have meant Lamictal, an anti-seizure medication, instead?) seems extreme, at least.  First, yes, the drug \"cocktai\" your friend is taking could certainly cause the altered level of conciousness and mentation you've observed in the patient. Any one of them could. potentially, do this. All collectively would almost be certain to cause this. Unfortunately this happens all too frequently due to what I like to call the \"Rube Goldberg\" or \"shotgun\" approach\", where medications are added to treat symptoms, often caused by medications already being taken, without removing anything from the mix. Often it happens because there is no single \"quarterback\" doctor keeping track of all the medications being prescribed by different specialists. In your friend's case   Some third party needs to evaluate the medications and the rationale for each, then find the most workable (optimal) combination that would manage his problems without putting him in a state where he cannot hope to think clearly nor function.   Just based on the little history provided in your post, I would think Seroquel and Lamictal (I'm going to assume that's what it actually is) would not only be the main offenders, but also seem like the least necessary.   I hope your friend will  have a solid advocate who can perhaps help him find a \"quarterback\" or, at the very least, a second opinion/consult with a neurologist or psychopharmacologist who can clear this up.   Best of luck to you and to your friend. Based on what you've provided here, it would seem very likely he is overmedicated and would probably improve greatly with proper management of the medications. Please let us know how things go.\n\n",

    "content": "I've taken Yasmin for 6 years or so, and then I switched to Ocella (the generic version) because it was cheaper.  I was on Ocella for three months when I had an episode that seems to be called \"aura.\"  It started with a hole in my vision (not a black spot, just a piece of the first word I'd be focusing on seemed to be missing and the end of the last word was where the beginning of that word should have been).  After 5 minutes or so my vision became slightly blurred, and a few minutes after that a crescent shape appeared that was rainbow/iridescent colored.  I got up to walk across my apartment and felt somewhat off-kilter, so I sat back down for a few minutes.  Then, as quickly as it began, everything was over--the entire episode lasted about twenty-five minutes.  I did NOT have a migraine after this episode, nor have I ever had a migraine in my life.  I rarely get headaches at all except as a side-effect to some antibiotics.  I did not go to the doctor at that time, but I did have my annual female exam about two weeks later.  I have moved since my last annual exam, and my appointment this time was with a rushed nurse practitioner who switched me back to the actual Yasmin instead of Ocella.  However, everything I've read since then suggests that having had this episode (if it qualifies as \"aura\"), I should not be on birth control pills at all.  Should I be concerned about continuing with birth control pills, or could it indeed have been caused by the switch to the generic drug?  I don't want to be paranoid, but I'd hate to have something serious occur that could have been prevented.  Thank you for any information you can offer!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Birth Control Pills and Migraine Aura",
    "content": "Hello -  What you've described is, almost certainly, the \"aura\" that occurs with what's called optical migraine, wherein the aura is all that  happens. This is often more disturbing, at least until it's understood, than having an excruciating headache,as it seems more exotic. You've described the classic \"blind spot\" followed by scintilating scatoma (the irridescent crescent). These things last, in some people, up to an hour, and can be very distracting, but cause no other problems.  The change from Yasmin to Ocella is unlikely to have caused this. They don't happen, then one day they do. They can  be one-time things, extremely rare, or frequent.   Birth control pills cause problems by making the user of them more likely to develop blood clots, which shouldn't have any bearing on the problem. However: one of the adverse side effects of Ocella/Yasmin is new-onset migraine headache with focal neurologic symptoms. The reason this is considered a reason to stop the  medication is because migraines can be so severe as to be disabling. Since you're only having optical migraine, this may not present an insurmountable problem for you, but you should, at least, report it to the prescribing nurse practitoner or another physician. It may be an indication that you'll need to switch to a different BCP.   I hope this answers your question. Please follow up here with us as needed. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Typical symptoms of UTI in adults are painful micturiton (dysuria) with sense of urinary urgency and frequency. Diagnosis is done by urine analysis and culture and sensitivity C&S. This will confirm the diagnosis and provide information about the most effective antibiotic therapy.   Did you mean with sepsis that you had fever, low blood pressure and low urine output due to the presence of the bacteria in your blood proved by blood culture and sensitivity tests? This is a serious situation and uncommon complication. Or you had a complicated form of UTI with pyelonephritis?  In both conditions IV therapy and hospitalization are essential, and shifting to oral therapy is considered when safe, convenient and appropriate.  However, persistence of symptoms may indicate incomplete recovery from the infection.  Urinary tract infection (like most types of infections proved by analysis and culture) is always followed up with repeating the initial tests. For example if based on urine analysis and/or Blood culture, these tests should be repeated after the antibiotic course completion to make sure you are cleaned from the organism.  Ciprofloxacin is one of the antibiotics commonly used in UTI, the recommended dose ranges from 500 mg once daily to twice daily and based on the presence of complications the antibiotic course may last for 14 days.  Being on antibiotic for longer duration (as a prophylaxis) is considered in patients with underlying local defects and poor immunity that make them in high risk for recurrent attacks of infections. So, this is a decision physicians take based on detailed analysis and overall assessment of their patients.  However, there are always side effects from the prolonged use of antibiotics. For ciprofloxacin, a specific form of diarrhea is a common side effect from its use for long time.  I would advise you to follow up with your doctor, update him with your sysmptoms, he might recommend a new urine analysis. You also should discuss with him your concerns to better understand your situation.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  The metabolism of different body elements like calcium, potassium, sodium, and proteins is affected by steroids.   Steroids are also known to irritate the stomach and cause gastritis especially in predisposed persons like those with GERD.  Steroids cause also an increase in the blood pressure and CNS effects like insomnia, and may aggravate psychiatric disorders.  Mild increase in weight gain is expected due to water retention and a true increase may result from increase in appetite and excess food intake.  The widespread use of anabolic steroids to accelerate the muscle building among body built professionals is well known despite the well known steroid side effects and the increased concern inside the medical community. I am not specialized in this issue, however, to my opinion the use of steroids at this dose regularly is concerning and is better avoided. So, if there is another way to get the same result even if it will be more slowly, I would recommend you to consider it.  Steroid therapy has many side effects that are for sure expected by your doctor and I assume he is keeping you on adequate supplements and he chose the diet that would help you overcome them.  I would advise you to follow up with your doctor and to discuss with him your concerns. He is more aware with your medical history and your clinical status thus can better estimate the risk versus the benefits from any prescribed medication.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, To my knowledge there are no reported interactions between these two specific medications, but theoretical interaction is still possible.   The amphetamine derivative MDMA or Ecstasy is well known with its immediate short-term undesired side effects, moreover there are major concerns about its long term physical and psychological effects in the medical communities. Thus its clinical use has been discouraged long time ago and the recent available data is from its abuse and its fatal outcomes.  Some of the versions of this drug Ecstasy contains chemical compounds that may also add to the side effects. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has warned consumers not to purchase  a herbal version of the illegal street drug \"Ecstasy\" in 2004 and you can read the details in the following link: http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/2004/NEW01026.html  So, informing your physician about your current medications is essential to avoid complications.  I would advise you to follow up with your doctor and to discuss with him your concerns. Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I am not sure if I have this correct but I am going to try and explain:  I heard that working out causes an increase in testosterone. While Propecia actually is lowering DHT, a type of testosterone. If I work out about 3 times weekly wouldn't this just balance out and make the Propecia basically worthless? Since I am working out and raising testosterone while Propecia is lowering it. Should I stop working out so Propecia can do its job and lower my testosterone levels?   Thank you for your help, Nick S.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I've recently been taking zinc supplements to ward off cold and sore throat symptoms. (Someone told me that it can boost my immune system). I have been taking 100mg of zinc for periods of about 5 days until I feel better, and about 50mg the other days when I'd remember to take vitamins. Lately, though, I've been getting dizzy spells about twice a month for short periods of time. I also feel a general tiredness and malaise. After doing a little research, I've realized that I've probably been taking too much, as most people recommend to take no more than 45mg of zinc a day. I have two questions:  How long will it take for what I think are zinc side effects to go away? Have I done any longterm damage in taking too much zinc?  Thanks so much.\n\n",

I looked it up and saw that those are all possible side effects of the drug.   My question is how long should these side effects last? I keep insisting on taking her to a doctor, but she has large unpaid hospital bills, no health insurance, and we're tight on money right now. Is there anything i could give her that would make her feel better or help speed up her recovery. I'm very worried.   Thanks for any and all help  -Brian\n\n",

Drugs are sometimes used to reverse the effects, especially in the case of overdose, but this would need to be evaluated and prescribed by a physician.  Flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepine-receptor antagonist, is sometimes indicated for the reversal of the sedative effects of benzodiazepines (the type of drug Klonipin is).    Best wishes.\n\n",

I'm sure as with all drugs are there are some risks, but I was looking for a more exact answer. The cough syrup of choice is usually delsum. As far as i know the active drug is DXM; it is not alcohol. It also sometimes causes dirreah or just unpleasant bathroom experiences and the high often lasts for 5+ hours. I was going to do it last night and take some pepto bismol to counter act the nasty bathroom side of things but I thought my body probably needs to get rid of what's in me so stopping that could be dangerous. How dangerous do you think abusing cough syrup is? Thanks for your help.\n\n",

Over time it can also lead to potentially permanent mental deterioration and liver failure. There are additional ingredients in this product as well which in the long run can harm you.  There is a reason OTC meds are often now stored behind the counter.  If it was safe the pharmacy would be more than happy to sell all you want of these cold medications that are often abused.  Please get help from a professional in substance abuse and find a way to get high on life, rather than chemicals.    Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Is there a reason why someone would have tingling sensations & spasms throughout their body from taking prescription medication? This started with Chantix causing some extremely painful esophageal spasms & abdominal pain, once those returned without using Chantix, I started using Chantix again for a short while, to quit smoking (keeping the dosage lower because raising it after week 1 is what made me sick before), started taking Levsin, which caused bladder retention, bladder/kidney spasms, pressure in vaginal area, feeling constant urges to pea though I could barely go, but it helped my esophagus, I think my kidneys had a toxic reaction at this point, I was switched to another antispasmotic, and then bladder overactive medication, all same response as Levsin, stopped these medications & ended up getting better. Take Prevacid later on and same reaction except it doesn't cause retention. Stop taking it, start feeling better. Now I currently use Ibuprofen as needed, Adderall (when I can remember to take it) & Ambien, I am starting to get tingling/spasms all over again & I think it's the Ambien, yet I've taken Ambien for 7 years so why would it do this now? The spasms are hitting me in my face, chest, & kidney. I have tingling sensations in my legs, chest, upper back, back & front of head right now.

I was wondering if such a problem can cause funny reactions to medications.   Like antispasmotics, overactive bladder medications, and one particular acid reflux medication, caused spasms in my bladder, kidneys, constant urge to pee, made it feel like something was shoved up inside my vagina that I needed to push out, most caused retention, hesitency.   After I discontinued Levsin which I could barely pee from, I started feeling really ill, couldn't eat, drink much, stayed in bed, had tingling sensations shooting through me, started peeing 15 to 20 ounces of urine about 18 different times that day, it turned white, the specific gravity stayed 1.010 everytime I checked it with lack of liquid intake, but went back up the next day.   Then I got an injection of Bactrim a few wks ago and had an allergic reaction, abdomen & back broke out in a splochy red rash, started getting red spots on my legs, was itchy all over, took Benadryl and it went away. I have taken Bactrim many times and never had an allergic reaction. I do not have kidney disease, just stones. Do you think it could do this? Thanks!\n\n",

I have tried to wean off the drug a number of times but the withdrawls are horrific and intolerable.  about 10 weeks ago I weaned myself off by taking 5mg for 2 weeks, then 2.5mg for 2 weeks, then 2.5mg every-other-day for 2 weeks.  It's been about four weeks since my last dose and I am still having withdrawl symptoms.  I am still emotionally sensitive (crying), I still have flu-like symptoms, cannot sleep and the worst, most dibilitating side effect is the heart and brain \"shocks\"  I feel like my heart will either stop beating, skip a beat or will beat too fast and this sends shocks throughout my body as well as into my brain.  It can affect my breathing and I have no energy level.  At times, I cannot think straight and definently have a hard time falling/staying asleep, even with 10mg/Ambien.   I know for a fact that these symptoms are not depression-related, but are from the med withdrawls.   Are these withdrawl symptoms normal?  Especially the heart palpatations? When can I expect them to stop?  I hear it can take up to 8 weeks for the withdrawls to diminish, but I don't know if i can handle this for another 4 weeks! Is there anything I can do to help relieve some of the symptoms?\n\n",

The second form of contraception (condom) is certainly a good idea as a rule but I would probably not feel that the morning after or plan B is necessary  if her compliance has been good.  That type of hormonal alteration definitely has side effects.  You really can't avoid that.  They do need to be taken within 120 hours of the sexual activity you are concerned about if you do use emergency contraceptive pills.  Best wishes\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, There is no problem getting pregnant immediately after going off birth control pills so if this has happened you don't need to be concerned.  Sometimes it takes a little while for ovulation to return so if it took a little while that would also be normal.    I always recommend a preconception visit with your gynecologist to be sure you are in good health, free of STDs or other infections and so you can get started on vitamins if you don't already take a multivitamin.  It is always best to go into pregnancy in good health if possible and this improves your chances for a healthy baby.  Your doctor will do a pap smear if you are due for one, a breast exam and test your thyroid.  Sometimes adjustments in your thyroid medication are needed in pregnancy so it is good to be in touch with your endocrinologist throughout your pregnancy (if you see one for this condition) as well.  If you have weight to lose this would also help.  Eating a healthy diet is very important so avoid drugs, alcohol, excess empty calories such as soda, candy, cakes, etc. Early and regular prenatal care is also important once you are pregnant.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Sometimes the vaccines are suspended in water, sometimes they contain egg products, sometimes the serum from  various types of animals' blood serums (many times horse or monkey serum). I know of no vaccine which contains arsenic, although I can imagine it is possible, in trace amounts perhaps. Formaldehyde would seem highly unlikely even in trace amounts.   Where did you get this \"information\"? And why, indeed, would any health professional want to introduce anything harmful into a baby or child  or, for that matter, an adult? Modern vaccines save untold millions of lives yearly. They don't accomplish this by introducing poisons into people.   I hope this eases your mind.\n\n",

However, many pharmacies don't carry but one generic, so you may have to find another source for your med. This does sometimes happen, too, that a certain manufacturer's generic doesn't work the same for certain patients.

    "content": "I was scheduled for a pelvic MRI last week but after arriving, drinking the contrast material and having an IV inserted the MRI tech refused to do the MRI because I have asthma.  He said that because of my asthma I need to take Medrol before I have the test. He said I would be given 2 pills... 32 mg each and I should take 1 pill 12 hours before the test and the 2nd pill 2 hours before the test.  When I picked up the prescription that my doctor's office called in to my pharmacy, it wasn't for 2 of the 32 mg pills. It was a Medrol dosepak. 21 pills... 4 mg each.   I asked the pharmacist about it and she said that was what was called in... she instructed me to take 8 pills as the first dose, and 8 pills as the 2nd dose. Because at 4 mg each, that would equal 32 mg each dose.   Is that what I should do?  It seems like a lot of pills to be taking at once...\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  There are several possible reasons  why the dosepak wound up being prescribed, and I'd probably call and ask the doctor which he  prefers you do, explaining what the tech had told you. In my experience the usual precautionary dose for those  with allergic problems potentially caused by contrast has always been one tablet before (along with one Benedryl capsule) and another tab following the  procedure,  but if your doctor tells you to use the entire dosepak there certainly should be no harm in doing it that way, and it will make it  all the more unlikely that  you'd have a severe reaction. If there's no time to reach the doctor, than I would definitely trust the pharmacist on this one and use the entire dosepak.   I hope this helps you and that everything comes out well. The main thing is to avoid you having a severe reaction to the contrast media. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

It is definitely my personal choice over phosphate of soda, which can be pretty unpleasant.   As for kidney problems,  while magnesium citrate is contraindicated in people with existing kidney disease, it is not known to cause it, at least not in the amounts found in normal useage.   I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck with this.\n\n",

    "title": "Propranolol help",
    "content": "I am a 23 year old male and working on my masters degree in social work.  I was diagnosed with severe tremors (head to feet) at about age four.  I began taking propranolol at age 12 when I could no longer hold a glass to drink.  The medication adequately treated my tremors and continues to does so. Because I began taking the medication before puberty I was really not aware that the drug was causing any negative effects.  Since maturing I have noticed several negative effects.  I find that I now have a flatter personality, lessen sense of humor, less social, and I have significantly less energy (which causes a real problem keeping up with the advanced graduate program work).  I am also experiencing mild erectile dysfunction, less sensitive private areas, and decreased libido.  I am taking prescribed viagra, which helps the ED but my 22 year old fianc\u00e9 although supportive misses the spontaneousness she had with previous significant others and I still lack sensitivity and libido (urge).  I have experimented with various stimulates such as diet pills, energy drinks, and recently adderall in hopes that I could boost my energy and regain my personality.  The diet pills and the energy drinks made the ED worse, increased my tremors and left me feeling very irritated from the caffeine.  I obtained the adderall from a friend with ADD and I am very familiar with the effects and uses of it from working in a mental health clinic.  I took one 30mg pill once a day in the morning for two weeks.  I of course had more energy, I was happier, I accomplished more activities, and I was more social.  The pill did increase my tremors the first three days but after the first week the tremors returned to its normal amount.  The first day I experienced severe ED.  Surprisingly to me every day I was very sensitive in my private areas and my libido increased.  After the first day I found I was able to be spontaneous and maintain a normal erection from what my fianc\u00e9 tells me (this is without viagra).  Now for my questions.  Is it possible that the propranolol is causing the physical and personality changes?  Could adderall maintain these positive effects in me?  Could adderall worsen my ED in the long run?  Are the effects I experienced placebo or is it medically possible for these to occur?  If these effects are real would a physician prescribe me adderall for these reasons although it is not FDA approved for this?  Finally what type of physician should I see?  P.S. I have not seen a neurologist since I was placed on propranolol and a family physician has maintained my refills.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Propranolol help",
    "content": "It is possible that propranolol  caused the symptoms you now describe early on, by suppressing the uptake of adrenaline during your development (all of adolescence) and may be maintaining these as  a form of delay. Withdrawal is still possible (and very probably desireable) but should not be attempted without the supervision of a physician. Since your family physician chose to place you on propranolol to reduce tremor which clearly was due to excess adrenaline, instead of trying to determine the root cause of the problem, I would not trust this doctor's judgement in supervising your withdrawal. However, many of the symptoms you describe are common anyway in people just starting on beta blocker therapy, and I feel fairly certain you could be withdrawn and reverse many of your personality changes over time. This could be quite surprising and disturbing at first however, and probably should also be accompanied with some psychotherapy to help you deal with the \"waking up\" of your body and brain.   I would definitely not try to counter the classic beta blocker syndrome you describe by taking adderall or any  other stimulant, since it is very difficult to balance opposing pharmacological forces like these.  Rather I would seek professional help in getting off the propranolol, finding out what causes your tremor (and  since propranolol seems to have controlled it, it was likely an abnormal level of adrenaline in the blood, possibly due to an adrenal tumor or some related endocrinological problem. Meanwhile you are unable to enjoy your life in a normal and satisfying fashion and really do need to get to the bottom of the basic problem.   I hope this will be of some help and perhaps get you on the path to feeling normal again. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  Swelling of the nipples is probably not due to gynocomastia, but only a doctor could tell for sure. In the meanwhile, consider this:  While Gynexin Alpha has not been evaluated sufficiently (if at all) in any medical studies, the claim is made that it targets the fat cells in breast tissue only, which is very unlikely. I haven't looked into the product's makeup, except to know that it is supposedly an herbal supplement. I can think of very few ingestible materials which have a prediliction for a specific part of the body, with rare exceptions. Most just act on certain parts of the body, and fatty tissue is fatty tissue. There's no way this product could tell the difference between breast fat and, say, stomach or arm fat. The supplement in question contains a thyroid stimulant which would increase (theoretically anyway) one's  metabolism, which would actually do exactly what I said above: act on all body fat -- and muscle as well. The supplement contains guggulipids, which are suspected of being able to increase LDL cholesterol, which would be potentially very dangerous to one's heart health. Between the likely stimulant effect and the possible increas in \"bad\" cholesterol, this stuff probably does not work.  It  isn't inexpensive, either, except possibly in comparison to breast reduction surgery.   I would suggest seeing a doctor about the problem,  and I suspect the first steps would include diet and exercise programs and possibly some hormone therapy to help change the imbalance that  causes the problem,  if such an imbalance exists in your case.  I'd  stay away from the \"cheap and easy\" route to solving any medical problem. Let your conscience be your guide.  I hope you find a solution to this problem and that you enjoy the  best of health.\n\n",

Vicodin is a potent pain killer and serious side effects such as excessive sedation, confusion, or coma may result if alcohol is taken with it.  In addition, patients who drink more than 3 alcoholic drinks a day along with this medication risk serious liver damage.  Adding tobacco to this equation further increases liver risk.  It logically follows that other drugs that affect the central nervous system could also aggravate side effects and cause decreased reaction time, etc.  Machinery (like cars) should not be operated while taking these drugs.

As for other drugs, there are far too many to cover here, but there are some specific groups which can be cited as definitely risky when used in conjunction with alcohol, and others which should be combined only with extreme caution and the knowlege and supervision of a doctor. All opiates and opioid drugs (such as Vicodin [dehydro-oxycodone] ) should not be used in conjunction with alcohol for the reasons pointed out by Ms. Miller previously. Also, any drugs which have the potential for sedative side effect. including certain antihistimines, all actual sedatives, anti-anxiety drugs, and many antidepressants. It is always best to check with the prescribing providor if alcolhol use is possible or routine for the patient.   Hope this is helpful.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: naproxen sodium usage",
    "content": "Hi John Crowe -  While darkestdays30 has covered the most basic problems with long-term NSAID use, it should be noted that there is also with this class of drugs a statistical correlation with long-term use and greater incidence of heart disease. That being said, naproxen sodium has been found, in separate independent studies, to not exhibit any such correlation. Also, not everyone who uses NSAIDs for extended periods suffers stomach irritation either. It's something to take into consideration, and coated tabs are definitely preferable, as is taking the medication after meals when possible and taking them with a full glass of water also when  practical. On balance naproxyn sodium and ibuprofen have a lot better safety record overall than some of the cox-2 inhibitors which have been taken off the market, even though those were supposedly easier on the stomach.  As always, the risk vs. benefit has to be weighed. If you have serious inflammatory joint disease and/or pain, the dose you are taking is  less than what would probably be prescribed (prescription strengths are 275, 500 and/or 550 mg. (depending on brand name or generic), and you are using the generic over-the-counter 220 tablets and are well within the limits of safe usage for an otherwise healthy person. You still could possibly experience GI or other internal bleeding (though unlikely) and so should be aware of the signs of this, which include black stools, persistent stomach/abdominal pain, vomit that looks like coffee grounds, chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness on one side of the body, sudden vision changes, slurred speech. I only mention this to be certain you would recognize a problem if it occurred.   I hope this all this is helpful. Bottom line is that you're using the most safe of all the NSAIDs and so run the smallest risk of serious side effects, but you should be aware of any of those signs of bleeding and if you observe any of those, contact medical help at once.\n\n",

    "content": "This is going to sound weird, and I'm not sure if this is the right forum for this question, but I've had a chronic illness for four years, and these are the basic symptoms:   *extreme fatigue  *constant dizziness and extreme weakness (weakness described as a feeling of constant  starvation, despite feeling full and eating)  *inability to tolerate exercise without collapsing  *shaking/tremor  And most importantly...the inability to tolerate medications, especially antibiotics. Every time I take any medication, no matter if it's an over the counter pain reliever or an antibiotic, I suddenly get very weak, very dizzy, very nauseated, feel as if my heart is beating very slowly, and have to fight passing out (I imagine this is due to low blood pressure). Each time I take the medication, the reaction gets worse. So, in the case of antibiotics, I am able to take the first couple doses, but after that, it gets worse. We have ruled out all psychosomatic causes, so there is no mental stuff involved here, it's actual reactions. My doctor is stumped, and I can't find anything online about anyone who has ever had this type of thing happen to them. It's really very, very frustrating, and quite dangerous to me because without antibiotics, I could die of a severe infection (I currently have a raging sinus infection that has come back after I took a couple of doses of amoxicillin but was unable to continue the medication due to the reaction). I'm at a loss, and don't know where to turn, hence this post. Any clue as to what could be causing this?\n\n",

I've been told alcohol depletes vitamins necessary for hair growth - such as folic acid and vitamin B1 - and since I got clean' a' weak,,' or' so' ago, I've been taking those supplements, in addition to a daily multivitamin.  I've been taking a double dosage of the recommended dosages as well.

    "title": "Re: alcoholism, hair growth, and vitamins",
    "content": "Hello, It is true that alcoholism can affect hair loss.  But many other things do as well - primarily genetics and hormones.  Poor nutrition can also affect hair growth and some medications (think chemo) definitely cause hair loss.    If your brain senses distress, malnutrition, vitamin deficiency, your body conserves what reserves are there for the vital organs and hair is considered expendable - obviously it is not survival stuff.  For this reason it is vital you eat well.  Alcohol also interferes with digestion and often people drink when they should be eating healthy food.  A multivitamin is probably good, but recently there has been some concern about men taking supplemental folic acid.  It is critical for women, but like many vitamins it is possible it could be overdone and with older men this seems to be the case.  What you would get in a multivitamin should be sufficient.    It is possible to overdose on vitamins and the effects of megadoses of some vitamins have not been adequately studied.  I can say this - if particular vitamins made a real impact on hair growth, this would not be a secret kept from the mainstream medical community.  Vitamin B1 supplements are usually around 50mg. but there is no known toxicity level.  Vitamin B1 should not be taken with drinks that contain acid, such as soda or orange juice, and vitamin B1 combines well with vitamin C and with other B-complex vitamins.  Most people who want to improve hair and nails take a B-complex supplement.  It is impossible to say if your hair will return to the pre-drinking point.  You may talk to a dermatologist or other doctor because you may be a candidate for Rogaine to improve hair growth and minimize loss.  If it is early baldness that is genetically caused, this won't help a lot.  If it is hormonal, your doctor can evaluate that too.  So, while alcoholism can be a contributing factor, you cannot be sure it is the whole problem.  In answer to your last question, this is not a problem (absorbing nutrients after having taken vitamin supplements).   Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, While I understand your desire to help your child's behavior and autism with dietary changes, during a time of illness, fever, etc. the more important concern is treatment for the illness.  The dietary adjustments should be secondary.  Once the child's fever is reduced, you can resume the diet as you wish but I would not sacrifice the child's immediate health and comfort for the benefits of the dietary restrictions.    If the diet were for severe allergies, this might be different, because the risk of the additives could be life-threatening.  But, I would encourage you to use the medications necessary to make the child well and comfortable, regardless of the additives that might be contraindicated on your autism diet.  While this diet helps some autistic kids who seem to be especially sensitive, it does not cure autism so you are not in danger of interfering with a long term treatment.  Your child could be in danger if medicine is withheld, however.  I hope your child is doing better by now.  Good luck to you with your challenges.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear SH  warfarin remains a very interesting drug, especially with its mechanism of action , it may take up to 36 hours for a warfarin dose to exert its full effects (by blocking the clotting factors)  usually INR is used to target coumadin dosing, not the PT. Based on this patient (TIA) her INR goal will be 2-3. do we have any information about her INR LEVEL? I think this is a key point because higher INR levels will indicate higher risk of bleeding.   in addition, the patient as you mentioned, was on Amitryptilline and Imipramine..these agents can interefer with cytochrome P450 enzymes, which are involved in the metabolism of warfarin. in general most if not all anti-depressants are inhibitors of cyt. P450 enzymes, including Amitryptilline and Imipramine. therefore, it is possible that these two drugs inhibited the metabolism of warfarin, and caused an increase in INR, and eventually bleeding.  steroids as well can increase the risk of bleeding on patients recieving warfarin therapy by increasing INR.  one should also take into consideration, the patient's dietary intake. herbal products, vitamin K and E containing food can all cause fluctuation in the INR, and therefore, affect coumadin therapy.  it will be very helpful to have INR levels on this lady? what was her first dose of coumadin, and what is her wt? how often were her labs monitored/  Thank you very much\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Reaction to Warfarin",
    "content": "Dear SH.  thank you very much for your responses. i am enjoying this discussion and it is in deed a learning opportunity for me.  when i mentioned that warfarin can cause fever in up to 1 % of cases, i was trying to check all the possible side effects of warfarin that has been reported in pharmacology references, and 1 % was documented (as a rare side effect). i havent found an article about warfarin and fever, dosing, etc. There is no data about warfarin causing fever and how it was managed.  However, it is possible that the fever was not due to warfarin, and fever has been shown to increase the responsiveness to warfarin, that is bleeding. it has been shown that hypermetabolic states produced by fever increase warfarin responsiveness probably by increasing the catabolism of vitamin K\u2013 dependent coagulation factors.  we have heard more about heparin induced thrombocytopenia not warfarin induced thrompocyopenia. Was your patient on heparin, or aspirin? or any other medications beside the anti-depressants?  you are right about calculating INR based on PT, but the accuracy of PT is system dependent. INR can be calculated using INR = (patient PT/mean normal PT)ISI  ISI or International Sensitivity Index can vary from place to place, therefore calculating the INR using the working prothrombin is only valid when the ISI of the thromboplastin is known. This is why in my institution, we usually order both when patients are on coumadin, but adjust the dose based on INR not the PT.  i don't know what is the highest acceptable INR range, but i can share with you what i have seen in my practice. I had patients that present with INRS up to 20 without bleeding, and i had patients that present with INRS of 6 or lower and bleeding . it is really patient-dependent. So depending on the patient if their INR is 4-6 and they arent bleeding we usually hold warfarin for few days. In cases where the patient has risks of bleeding or they are bleeding we usually stop the coumadin of course and give vitamin K.  The key i think it to keep the INR at targeted goal : 2-3 for most indications and 2.5-3.5 for patients with mechanical prosthetic heart valves.  I am sorry that i could not be of any help regarding the warfarin, fever, and thrombocytopenia. i did a lot of research in pubmed  but nothing came out. That is why it is very possible that whatever happened to the patient  had a different underlying cause or maybe this is a newly discovered aspect of warfarin that you came across with this patient.   Regardless, i hope that your patient feels better, and thank you very much for this discussion.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Dr Riham: Thank you very much for your great effort and time Iam very grateful for your  cooperation and more than valuable discussion.  I would like to clarify that patient was feverish for about one month during which her PT was not high enough as for adequate anticoagulation (so I doubt that bleeding was due to catabolic state induced by fever)  and then mild increase in dose of Warfarin was added after which the PT became about 25 sec after which ,that's why I was wandering if this mild increase in dose can induce such a dramatic change, and as I mentioned before I preferred not to be rushing in decreasing dose again and decided to repeat test after 2 days but ...it was too late  I really can't remember if she was still on Aspirin  or not when she started Warfarin? But she was on Aspirin in earlier periods for some years and didn't suffer any bleeding  As regarding Heparin she used it only for short period until Warfarin started working and this was stopped some weeks before even the fever   I don't know if it is of any value to mention this ,  but unfortunately the patient died just few hours after the intracerebral bleeding .But it is a big question mark what happened exactly??  Again thanks a lot , SH\n\n",

    "content": "Dear SH I am sorry about your patient. But having all the information, it is unlikely that fever was caused by warfarin. Although she recieved heparin for while until the warfarin was added to the regimen, frequent monitoring of the platelet count will help determine if the patient had HIT.   Although heparin was stopped , patients can have  delayed heparin induced thrombocytopenia. I am not sure if her platelets started to drop while on heparin or after stopping the heparin for several weeks. But one could have ruled out this possibility by measuring the heparin antibody. if positive, this indicates HIT, if not, most likely it is caused by something else.  the reason i asked if she was on aspirin, is just due to the additive effect. when each aspirin or warfarin are given alone, they may never cause bleeding, but sometimes when given together there is a higher chance of bleeding that is all.  any ways, i wish you all the best, and i thank you for your time and discussion. it was a pleasure discussing the case with you. I am sorry about the belated response, but i was gone for a year, and that is why i did not see your case until few days a go.  have a great day\n\n",

    "content": "Dear clay 70  the fact that you are taking both tablets four times a week and not on a continuous basis should not cause tolerance or liver damage. the maximum recommended daily doses of tylenol is 4 gm/day...which means 12 tablets of the 325 mg acetaminophen containing tablets or 8 tablets of the 500 mg acetaminophen containing tablets... therefore the fact that you arent exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of acetaminophen, liver damage should be a problem.  you mentioned that you have used NSAID like naproxen , and other pain meds like toradol. I am not sure if ibuprofen (another NSAID) worked for you. ibuprofen is very safe and effective pain relief medication, and it is a renally eliminated, which means it is handled  by the kidney not the liver. IBUPROFEN IS ALSO AVAILABLE IN COMBINATION WITH NARCOTICS : DARVOCET.  so this is another alternative for you.   like i said, as long as you are not exceeding 4 grams of acetaminophen/day, and that your pain is under control, there is no need to worry about liver damage   Thank you very much and remain blessed\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Vitamins can help your hair to be healthy and if you don't get proper nutrients, that can contribute to loss, but if there is genetically based hair loss, they won't likely help you regrow hair.  There are some products on the market that may help, but you should rule out any physical problem such as thyroid disorder and some infections first.  Stress can also result in hair loss.  Women often lose hair with childbirth and stress may be responsible for that.  Of course there are also medications and treatments that can cause hair loss.  I'm sure if this was your case you would be aware of it.  You could talk to a hair stylist.  A trichologist is a hair specialist whose training covers both the cosmetic and the medical aspects of the subject. Some trichologists are also trained hairdressers, but they are not usually medically qualified.  Nioxin, Propecia, Avodart, Nizoral, Rogaine, anti-androgens, nonsurgical hair replacement and hair transplants are all used to help to restore hair loss and their effectiveness varies and some do have side effects.    Ask your relatives about family health history, especially the males on your mother's side, to see if this is a genetic tendency here.  Many people do go bald at a young age; it is not something that only happens in old people.  Some men these days opt to shave their heads as soon as the hair begins to thin - then it feels intentional and many people are quite happy with it, but for others it is a very traumatic event.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Clay70,  These doses of tylenol are very unlikely to do any damage to the liver.  The recommendation is not to exceed 4 grams of tylenol per day.  The doses you are taking are far from this.  The codeine part is also pretty small so it is less likely for you to develop tolerance to this.  If you find that you are not getting as much effect over the years it may be that you are becoming tolerant but I don't think this is likely to happen.  Also, at this doses, it is unlikely for you to develop any significant dependence on the codeine.  Other options besides tylenol basically include ibuprofen and the other non-steroidal anti-inflammatories.  There are some ibuprofen/narcotic combinations but they tend to be a fair amount stronger than tylenol 3.  If needed, your doctor can discuss these with you.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello MuzicLov3r,  N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a compound that is used when too much tylenol has been ingested to help prevent liver damage.  Basically, it helps prevent the tylenol from being metabolized via a secondary pathway that creates a metabolite toxic to the liver.    In theory, taking NAC at the same time as the tylenol could potentially help prevent damage from too much tylenol; however, this cannot be guaranteed.  In addition,  I would strongly recommend against a patient using NAC to be able to take a larger dose of tylenol than is approved/appropriate.  The side effects and the actual outcomes can potentially be different than expected and liver damage cannot be absolutely predictably prevented.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Nyquil Liquid for Insomnia",
    "content": "Hello, In addition to the ingredients you listed, Nyquil contains about 10% alcohol so you are actually getting a \"nightcap\" when you take this.  It's a fairly low dose and a pretty expensive way to get a little alcohol to sleep on.  The antihistamine is also commonly used in such over-the-counter sleep aids as Unisom so you may get the same result from that.  The cough suppressant ingredient is sometimes helpful with pain so perhaps you are having some underlying and unrecognized pain.  You might do just as well taking a Unisom and acetaminophen for pain at a fraction of the cost.    Long-term concerns would be mostly if this is an addiction for you.  Do you \"need\" the alcohol that is present here?  You should not add alcohol to this or operate machinery after taking it.  I am not aware of any serious problems with taking this daily.  Because it is an antihistamine it could theoretically affect your body's immune response.  Whatever you do, if you see your doctor for other conditions, be sure you notify him/her so they will watch for negative drug-drug interactions.  It is important when insomnia is present to try to determine the underlying cause of the sleep disorder, rather than just treating the symptoms so you might benefit from a sleep study.  Best wishes.\n\n",

If a longer acting medicine is needed, valium is often chosen.  If faster onset and shorter action is desired, ativan is better.  There are other medicines in the same class (benzodiazepines) that have longer or shorter durations of actions as needed.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Several anti-seizure medicines can help reduce cravings as well, such as gabapentin.  There is a medication called Nocaine that helps block the effects of cocaine and reduce the high that is obtained; however, this medicine is currently only in trials and not available publically.  I do not know when this will be available, if it passes the trials.  You may want to seek the advice of a psychiatrist that specializes in drug abuse for some recommendations about some of these medicines.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: daily contraceptive pill and morning after pill",
    "content": "Hello, The contraceptive pill is one of the best methods of birth control available and it is not intended to be used with the morning after or plan B pill except in rare circumstances.  Your body does not need all that extra hormone and using it each time you have sex can wreak havoc with your hormones.  Yes, there is a small chance of pregnancy, reduced if you are 100% in taking the pills, but if you feel a backup method is needed for your peace of mind, find something other than plan B for this.  The concept of plan B is for those rare times when a condom breaks, the couple just doesn't use contraception, rape, etc.  It is not without side effects and should never be used as birth control, say each time you have sex, as you imply here.    Alternate methods for your security would be a condom or other barrier method, contraceptive foam, etc.  You may also consider doubling up on the method during your possible worry days (potentially fertile), though with regular use of the pill  you don't actually have these typically.  If you were ovulating, this would be day 8 through 19 (approximately) when you start counting on day one of your menstrual period.   Being sexually active as a young woman always carries some risk of pregnancy in the absence of sterilization, hysterectomy, etc.  For this reason some women do choose a second method, but again, I recommend something besides plan B.  Best wishes.\n\n",

She was not able to get blood through her body from the neck down through her arms.  She had corrective surgery (modified upper ribs) and was started on methodone for the pain. She remained on methadone for 3yrs along with multiple other medications for nerve repair.  She has now been to several doctors and has just been diagnosed with Firbro Mialgia. My concern is along with that, she is being told she has chronic fatigue sydrom.  Her current medication are: CYMBALTA (Oral 60 MG Capsule) LORAZEPAM (Oral 1 MG Tablet) LORTAB (Oral 500 MG-10 MG Tablet) LYRICA (Oral 300 MG Capsule) PROVIGIL (Oral 200 MG Tablet) RESTORIL (Oral 22.5 MG Capsule) TIZANIDINE HCL (Oral 4 MG Tablet) TOFRANIL-PM (Oral 75 MG Capsule) CYMBALTA (Oral60 MGCapsule) ZOVIA (Oral 1/35 6X28)  With all of these, I feel her doctor is crazy for adding Provigil for Chronic fatigue.  Most of these pills are designed to put her to sleep at night or cause drowziness.  With a diet consisting of mostly caffeine and nicotine, am I wrong?

Also while reading the Pulmicort packet it states to be cautious when coming off prednisone while taking the inhaler.  I would like to know everything I need to look for, be cautious about and if I should even take these together.  The Prednisone and Erythrom were prescribed by an ER doctor a week ago and the Pulmicort was prescribed by a Pulmologist yesterday.  Also what supplements can I take to help keep my immune system up while taking these steroids as well as any other supplement to be as safe as possible while taking this medication.  Anything else feel free to add.  Coming off the prednisone I have notices some muscle and joint pain in my knees and ankles mainly. The Erythrom did give me some bad cramps and gas at first but now that has subsided and I just feel a little sore to the touch just below my ribs from right/left to my soloplexis.  But that is it. Thank you for your time.  1. Age: 25 2. Sex: M 3. Past diagnoses: Sick for 8 months, searing pain in trachea, having difficulty tracking down cause. Blood tests, Ct scans & xray came back fine. 4.

    "content": "Hi Porschedrifter,  It is safe to erythromycin (Erythrom) with prednisone.  Erythromycin is well known to cause stomach discomfort so I am not surprised you've had the abdominal pain.  Everything should resolve with this once you stop the medicine.  The concern about stopping the prednisone while taking pulmicort is that there is a possibility of the lung disease (usually asthma) flaring up.  The warning mostly comes from the fact that those who are on pulmicort are likely to have a lung disease that is improved by prednisone so it may flare when the prednisone is stopped.  This is not particularly common but should be watched for.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I have recently started to take Reductil (one capsule in the morning) to help aid weight loss, and i was also given Eltroxin tablets (one tablet after my first meal) at the same time (no blood tests at all) and was wondering if it is ok to take both of these tablets...I am 72kg, male and 180cm tall. Having done some research i believe Eltroxin is a treatment for hypothyroidism - as far as i know my thyroid is functioning as it should!  Your advice is much appreciated. Thank You in advance\n\n",

    "content": "I have been taking 100mg of minocycline twice a day for about 2 and a half months for treatment of acne.  It has been working great and my face has never looked better.  About a month ago i noticed that glands in my chest were a little swollen.  Initially i did not think much of it but as they became bigger and more painful i decided to go to a doctor.  She said i had gynecomastia, i found this unusual as i researched it since i am 21 yrs old and in great shape.  The only conclusion i can draw is that minocycline is the cause, but i could not find any data online to support this theory.  Could minocycline be a cause?  and if so will the swelling go away if i stop taking it?  Any suggestions on alternative medications to offer my dermatologist?  Thanks in advance for any help.\n\n",

This certainly doesn't mean that it can't do this just that it hasn't been reported that I found.  There are a few other causes of gynecomastia as well.  I would recommend you see your doctor to investigate some of these other issues as well as see about the possibility of needing to stop the minocycline.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I cannot see how you could develop allergy to both in such a way. The swelling of the eyes is not a very characteristic picture for allergy either. However, if you are not comfortable with either drug you may like to try the old fashioned but all effective aspirin.  Best wishes and hope you get well soon!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Sairoung, If your daughter is allergic to both these drugs then we should be very cautious with any drug she takes later. If she should develop a fever then she should first be evaluated to check what the cause of this fever is. If a bacterial infection then it would be more appropriate to give her antibiotics. However, if your specifically asking about what alternative antipyretics are then there are many. The commonest being the class known as NSAIDs (Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). As I mentioned earlier any drug should be taken after testing first for allergy or not.\n\n",

U.S. doens't produce salycilates anymore coz the side effects (according to my PCP), and my dad told me the factory in my country has stop producing it too (7 years ago).... last week I had some fever so I went to see doctor... she gave me Ibuprofen 400mg... the first day was fine... I thought it's ok.. but the second day I had the medication my eyes swollen again.. but it's not too bad compare to other medication I had.... according to my doctor there's no other medication she can give me if next time I'm sick.... & I'll have some difficulty if I had surgery too... is that true?

In that light recomending Asprin to a Paracetamol allergy sufferer appears to be poor advice, add to that that this thread shows that the eye inflamation problem is clearly an allergic response to paracetamol or other drugs worries me somewhat!\n\n",

    "title": "ANGIOEDEMA AFTER PARACETAMOL USE",
    "content": "The condition you have all described is known as angioedema.  There are two types of angioedema, the acquired type caused by hypersensitivity to certain substances and the hereditary type triggered by emotional stress or physical trauma. From the descriptions you have all given, your symptoms have occurred after the ingestion of certain drugs and are therefore of the acquired variety.  Almost any part of the body may be affected, but the common sites are the eyes, lips, genitalia, hands and feet. Any of the affected sites may swell two to three times their normal size within hours. The swelling may subside that same day or over a period of days. Itching may be minimal or absent. A skin rash may be present or absent. The condition may be serious and life-threatening if it affects the upper respiratory tract. Such acute, life threatening attacks require aggressive intervention in hospital, so seek urgent medical help if any swelling of the lips or eyes is followed by swelling of the larynx and breathing difficulty.  The standard medical advice for anyone who experiences itching, eruption of a skin rash or angioedema after taking any drug is to discontinue that drug and not take it (and any other drug in the same category) in future. In addition, you must inform your doctor whenever a treatment prescription is given to you. Do not forget also the pharmacist when you buy over-the-counter medications.

Commonly the medication is coated in a superficial coating that is dissolved by the stomach acid instead of having the medication affected.  Another method is to design the medication to be resistant to the stomach acid.  A third method is to design the medication so that the stomach acid actually alters the medicine to break it down into its active form.  I hope this helps answer your question some.

    "content": "Hi Darkside44,  Your symptoms may be due to withdrawal from Zoloft.  Six weeks is long enough to develop a dependence and stopping Zoloft should be gradual.  I would recommend you talk with your doctor about this issue.  It is always important to make sure your doctor is aware of the medicines you are taking and any possible side effects.  If the Zoloft was working it may be reasonable to simply stay on it rather than switching.  Ask your doctor about why he wanted to switch.  There may be a very good reason.    If your symptoms worsen you should go to the emergency room.  If they are from Zoloft, restarting it should cause the symptoms to improve and resolve.  Be sure to let your doctor know you've restarted the Zoloft.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Zoloft usually takes a couple of weeks to be in a therapeutic range.  The dose sometimes needs to be adjusted to find what works best for you but it is kind of a long process.  Try to be patient but be in touch with your doctor if you feel you are getting worse, have any suicidal thoughts or feelings of wanting to do harm.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I am a 27 years old and live in Japan. I have been taking Triquilar (28 pill pack) for over a year now with only minor side effects such as nausea after missing a pill and overall lower libido.  I pay $30/month for Triquilar (Bayer Schering Pharma) through my gynecologist but found numerous web sites that sell  Triquilar ED for much less, such as the following:  http://www.e-ten.jp/item/pill.html  Is there a difference between Triquilar and Triquilar ED? If so, is it safe to switch to Triquilar ED and only visit my doctor when something is irregular?  (Japanese gynecologists will generally only dispense 1 month's worth of pills at a time, so you have to go every month and do not have a backup pack -- very inconvenient, not to mention expensive.)  Thank you in advance.\n\n",

It is important to be sure that your doctor knows your taking the multivitamin just for completeness.    Be careful, though, that your multivitamin doesn't have any additional herbs or supplements in it.  Some of these can interact and weaken the contraceptive.  Your local pharmacist should be able to give you specifics on your particular vitamin and its interactions.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I recently reinjured my shoulder (from a preexisiting injury) and the doctor suspects a labral tear.  I am currently waiting on physical therapy and then possibly surgery.  However, since the reinjury occured I have been unable to straighten my arm and have been in significant pain.  My primary doctor and orthopedic surgeon have tried numerous drugs which have either not worked or I have had bad reactions to.  I have been on many doses of steriods to no avail.  I have been on the anti-inflammatory Etolodac, which caused a severe asthma attack.  I have also been on   PROPOXYPHENE which I also did not have a good reaction with.  They will not try most pain relievers because I have had severe breathing problems in the past with even small doses of Vicodin and Morphine.  I have tried over the counter relievers (tylenol, etc), but they do little to help.  The problem is that the doctor does not want to try anything (especially anti-inflammatories) else because they are worried about setting off another asthma/breathing problem.  This has left me in severe discomfort and stiffness.  Are there medicines that I could safely take without having an affect on my breathing?\n\n",

When I am sick my doctor usually has me do nebulizer treatments of albuteral (or occassionally Pulmicort).  Now I usually get the usual side affects from it, jittery and shaking.  My primary care doctor suggested taking Xopenex through the neb. instead since it does not have the same jittery effect.  However a friend of mine who also takes this medicine said it is not recommended in someone who has heart problems (I am being treating with Toprol for an unexplained rapid heart beat).  Would this apply to my condition?  And is this drug considered safe in that retrospect?  I would like to take something that doesn't make me as jittery but not if the risks are increased.

    "content": "Hi Dacubster,  If you can take albuterol you can take xopenex.  Most medicines have two isomers (forms) of the medicine molecule (termed R and S, basically right and left hand forms).  With many medications it is thought that the S form gives the benefits and the R form gives the side effects.  So, Xopenex is only the S form of the albuterol while regular albuterol contains both.  If xopenex is contraindicated for a heart condition, albuterol should be as well.  There are some studies showing that Xopenex gives less elevations in heart rate and \"jittery feelings\" when used every four to six hours compared to albuterol.  However, if the medicine is being used more frequently than every four hours the benefit goes away.  Xopenex comes in both a nebulizer form and a \"puffer\" form, as does albuterol.  If you're having a lot of problems with jittery feelings and fast heart rates it is reasonable to try the Xopenex.  Some people notice a big difference and others do not.  One other thing to consider is that, for a while, Xopenex was about 8 times more expensive than albuterol so most insurance plans would not cover it or would cover it at the highest copay.  You may want to check into this since in many cases this has now changed.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Your daily prescription of 10 mg is the minimal dose.  If you wish to know if the drug is the cause of your myopathy, a creatine kinase test is done. If it is markedly elevated at more than 5 times the upper limit of normal, the drug should be discontinued. The drug should not be started if creatine kinase is known to be elevated before the start of treatment.  Persons on Lipitor (or any other statin drug) are advised to report promptly unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness. A rheumatologist should be consulted to investigate that pain in your arm.   Dr Anthony Solomon Consultant Physician, Tropical & Genitourinary Medicine\n\n",

However, it has muscle pain has been reported with the use of statins, including lipitor.  you did not mention whether you had your CK levels checked out, and you have not mentioned whether you have been taking some other medications which could have interacted with lipitor and increased its level, and therefore, toxicity, like muscle pain.  muscle pain with statins is reversible upon the discontinuation of the medicine. you said that even after stopping lipitor , u still experienced some of the muscle pain. So i would recommend that you talk to your Dr. about it, and check with your neurologist, and address the issue of drug/drug interaction.  thank you\n\n",

We noticed something was strange when he was rattleing (talking alot) and asked us to come look at his heart beat through his shirt. I noticed he wasn't catching his breath too well also. Immediately I looked at the prescription name \"Daytrana\" and pulled it up on line. I then noticed a diffreence in the medication patch. We had been given, by the pharmacist, the Daytrana Patch 30mg box labeled with the 10mg instruction sticker. Instantly off to the ER we go where he was put on oxygen and a cardiac monitor. Diagnosis = OD .  My big concern here is this...my grandson had endured 7. 5 hours of being OD (3x regular script) above what he was prescribed. Is there anything we should be concerned about as to any short or long term effects that this OD could or can cause? Should we see any specialists for observation, MRI, etc to see if any damage has been done?   Thank You,  TJ\n\n",

    "content": "Hi TiegeTJ,  The symptoms you describe are very typical of a daytrana overdose.  Basically, daytrana is a stimulant of the body so it stimulates the heart, nerves and basically every part of the body.  This is what gives the rapid heart rate and tremors.  Having your grandson evaluated in the emergency department  was very appropriate.  Treatment is basically supportive until the medication wears off.    If your grandson has been released from the emergency room the physicians feel that he is now stable enough to go home indicating the medicine is wearing off.  There should be no long term side effects from this.  For your information and as well as our other readers, if there is ever a question about whether or not a substance is dangerous if ingested (medicines, plants, etc.) or what to do if an exposure occurs the local poison control center is an excellent resource.  In the United States there is now a universal number that can be called.  It is 1-800-222-1222.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Niacin can produce a skin flush which could be made worse if you use alcohol or eat hot foods or drinks at the same time that you take the vitamin.  It is also recommended that you not drink grapefruit juice when taking it.    The alpha gpc is a nutritional supplement and I don't know much about it.  It is not listed as one of the things that could be a problem with niacin, however.  This does not mean it is safe; just that there is no contraindication listed.  I do not see why you would need to stop taking niacin.  I have not found anything indicating a problem with long-term use.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Taking too much of a vitamin can actually lead to problems.  This is particularly true for vitamins A and E.  A multivitamin will have the recommended daily amount of these and the other important vitamins for overall health.  You can do this by taking a prenatal vitamin or a women's multivitamin.  Both will have a good mix.  Best wishes.\n\n",

This would happen for about 10-15 days at a time each month (lasting about 3 months) Doctors kept telling me it was stress as I was far away from home and just broke up with my fiance. I have since moved back home and life has gotten alot easier however my symptoms are still there. They don't last as long (3-4 days) but they are still reoccurring. I have been taking Immodium for the diarrhea and generic promethazine for the nausea. Lately it seems as if my muscles are always sore, I'm constantly tired, and my chest hurts sometimes when I breath. Not enough to hurt but enough to notice it. I am a smoker and have been for a while. I smoke roughly 6-8 cigarettes a day. Any advice as to what it can be? I don't currently have medical insurance so I havn't seeked out the advice of my doctor.   Optional Information:  Female, Age: 23, New York\n\n",

How high of a dosage can you go with Adderall? Is really high doses really even safe? I'm worried about it but I don't know what else to do. I am too sick to not take this stuff.   It is a normal side effect to make your heart pound isn't it? That really isn't a side effect I'd need to concern myself with is it?\n\n",

Then I started getting nauseas, the pain in my abdomen (epigastric & upper left side) got worse than usual, my chest started hurting on the left side (where my heart is), I got really bad pain in my right shoulder & down in my arm just a little bit, now up on the right side of my neck a little bit, sharp flank pain (both sides, up a little higher on the right), indigestion, and tingling sensations running through my legs and now through my upper esophagus and neck, which is promoting pain (I may be having spasms?). Feeling tightness in the upper part of my chest. Breathing a little heavier at times. This has been going on for over an hour. It's not getting any better, it's getting worse. All this didn't start all at once. I haven't had any adderall since 6pm yesterday. I couldn't sleep last night though and am feeling a bit sleep deprived right now. Part of this reminds me of a drug interaction I had years ago from 3 diff medications I was taking. I had experienced tingling, numbness, all over spasms, 2 weeks of no sleep, and had a severe pain attack from it in my organs, and it felt like it was trying to cut off my breathing. My doctor thought I was just crazy, didn't at all believe me, but I found a test online where I ordered and had it checked to see if I was having a drug interaction. And sure enough. But I'm not taking anything to react with the adderall, the only other medication I take is just overcounter digestive enzymes. I know this isn't an interaction but could it be a reaction from too high of a dose or just a serious need of some sleep?? This is definetly not normal for me. My heads starting to ache and my bladder's just starting to hurt but I have been having problems with IC anyways, but my kidney's feel like they could explode. I've had kidney stones before but this isn't stones cause the pain isn't jabbing me like it would with that, but not to have anything wrong with them, they sure are causing a GREAT deal of pain. It's like extreme pressure in my urinary tract too. Can adderall irritate your urinary tract? I can't believe how many problems I am having. The pain is really really bad in my kidneys, left side, and shoulder. I know this must sound completely ridiculous with this many problems happening. It hurts pretty bad but it's not as bad as it sounds. At least I am not in tears or anything cause of it anyways. I hope it's not a reaction. I am gonna go try to go to sleep again and see if that helps. If you have any insight here, would really love to hear it. Thanks.\n\n",

But I've had nausea and stomach pain really bad all day and now my bladder, left ureter & kidney is all in a spasm. I checked for a UTI but there's no blood or WBC. I had a 2nd cystocele over 2 mths ago. I was having some spasms in my bladder but it didn't get bad until a couple of weeks ago after lifting several car loads of boxes for my sister. I didn't have spasms in my kidneys and ureter until I started taking Adderall. Could it be making it worse? I also have urinary hesitancy, slow flow, intermittency, frequent urination (due to spasms), not feeling like bladder empties all the way. I was hurting when trying to urinate but that got better. I've had difficulty with the urination since the surgery. Can your bladder have any kind of problems with a sling as far as reacting to it in a bad way? Or could the pain itself from my bladder be making it so difficult with my urination? I know I'm having symptoms of obstruction but I'm hoping these symptoms could be due to something else. I'm afraid my bladder will end up prolapsing again because of all of the pressure in my urinary tract (it's extreme). What would cause that kind of pressure in your urinary tract?\n\n",

    "content": "I called for my urologist where I am not feeling any better and they told me that every symptom I was having was because of my interstitial cystitis and wouldn't do anything other than a urinalysis I already did, so I said no thanks. When I had kidney stones and a bladder prolapse mths ago, that was originally blamed on the IC too.   I rechecked my urine and now I have a moderate amount of blood. I'm thinking hydronephrosis and kidney stones again, but the pain isn't jabbing me like it would with a kidney stone. Nor does it make sense since the voiding problems started after the bladder surgery, unless I've had stones there all along. But I had laser surgery a mth before the cystocele repair though I never passed any of the debri but one tiny piece.  Last time I had the stones, I had blood pouring out of my urine and thought my bladder had either ruptured or was hemmoraging cause it hurt so bad. I ended up having flank pain afterwards. Like I am now, it made me sick to eat and I stayed nauseas. I also remember having the spasms and extreme pressure. Well I think I figured out the problem.   I can't even begin to believe that they blamed these voiding problems and flank pain on IC. I know it causes frequency, urgency, pain, & pressure, but since when does it make your kidneys hurt and keep you from urinating properly?   All those years I had so much trouble with IC, my uterus was laying on my bladder causing a deformity and fibroids in it was causing a partial blockage, and I had grade 2 cystocele, causing the incontinence and frequency. Isn't IC supposed to be diagnosed when everything else is ruled out? Through cystoscopy's, I have been told of no doubt of having IC but I am beginning to wonder if it's just a bunch of hog wash.\n\n",

I remember once i took a normal size dose of excedrin pm..and i had a SEVERE even what i think was life thretening reaction to it...it felt as if my whole body started tingling and i was paralyzed for hours and couldn't move to call a doctor ot anything..i was paralyzed till i passed out and after i woke up the next day it seemed i have SEVERE problems with vision (lights) etc...iit took me YEARS to get oveer that..of course that was the worst reaction i ever had..and i don't ever take any medicines that effect me since then...(1993) if i have a SEVERE cold...i will take advil cold medicine for kids..and take half a dose a kid would take..and even if i continue that over time it almost feels like it builds up... ANyway...i am just curious why am i so sensitive to medicines like this....i don't break out in rashes so i don't think i'm allergic..its just some sort of mental or brain sensitvity...i can't even eat too much dark chocolate or it effects me... If i tell this to people they think i am crazy and it's all in my head just because they don't experience this..but i am not crazy..so..if anyone could help explain this it'd hel...also..i think my grandmother may have had it because she never ever took any medicines and never drank, also she was a bit of a nervous wreck always running here and there i think she may have been sensitive to things also.....so maybe she had the same thing....it may or may not be related..but i am also sometimes sensitive to sounds and..i have extra sensitive hearing and sense of smell...

    "content": "Hi Girlwho....  As frustrating as this is for you, it does not necessarily mean there is anything wrong at all.  Each person is unique and the way they handle drugs varies immensely.  You will notice when side effects are listed for medications, almost every possible response has been reported by at least one person in the study so the list is huge - for almost ANY medication.   Understanding the effect it has on you is the most important thing because you can avoid most of the culprits.  No doubt such intense sensitivity will at times catch you off guard (especially with foods) but for the most part you should be able to live with this.  You want to let your health care providers know about your hypersensitivity so they will not prescribe even typical doses of some medications and they can use extreme caution.  If you need anesthesia some time, this could be especially important.    Many people do have hypersensitivity to many of the sensory stimulants - taste, smell, sound, light, touch, etc.  This may or may not accompany other disorders in the mental health category.  It is not really something you can treat, except through avoidance and planning for ways around (sunglasses if light sensitive, ear plugs if noise sensitive, choosing clothing with certain characteristics, etc.).    Most people can live their lives without needing to be exposed to many of the medications that are out there.  Alternative medicine and therapies such as acupuncture, yoga, cognitive therapy, biofeedback, etc. can often help in the same ways that the medications do for other.  You may be one who needs to find these alternatives and determine what helps you.  Even anxiety can be treated without the medication if the med itself adds to your problems.  I'm sure you are right that this could be an inherited trait.  Your grandmother likely learned by trial and error how to cope with her problems.  This can sometimes help, knowing there may be a genetic link that is out of your control.  You can also see by her example, that it is possible to live without all the chemicals available.  Environmental medicine is revealing links to many chemicals and substances in our environment that are contributing to our health problems.  As time goes on we will probably learn that more of us are sensitive to some external substances than we realize - we have just learned to cope with it and blame it on other factors.  If you can find a good mental health therapist, he/she could help you find some alternatives.   This does not mean you are crazy or that this is \"all in your head\" but teaching yourself how to deal with this problem will come through your head.  Our brains are amazing - they respond sometimes in ways we don't understand, but they can also work in ways beyond our understanding to help us if we let them and we learn how.  In choosing a therapist, do an interview to determine some important factors that would have bearing on their focus and if they don't seem to understand what you are dealing with, move on to someone who does.  Bad therapy can be worse than none at all.  Good luck with this.\n\n",

I would go into a coma like state for 2 or 3 days after taking an ordinary OTC medication. Some foods & supplements I can't tolerate either, for instance calcium or magnesium will cause me similar symptoms.  I can smell alcohol & get woozy. It makes life very difficult but just be very careful.  I learned when trying a new med to always start with 1/4 or less of a dose &  go from there.  I usually get pediatric doses of what \"precious\" few meds I can take.  Just wanted you to know you are not alone.\n\n",

I would not expect there to be a need for a dose change and it should not be necessary to increase the dose slowly.  I would recommend you let your doctor know about this just in case there is something that I do not know about your history that may be a reason to not restart the synthroid.

    "content": "Hi Tbarnes,  This is actually a great question.  Many people assume that since they are vitamins it is better to take more.  It turns out that many vitamins can have severe side effects at high doses.  At a dose of 65mg per day for the short term you probably would be OK but it is unlikely you would get any added benefit from the extra dosing.  At levels starting around 150 mg per day in some people toxicities can begin to occur such as a weakened immune system and impairment of normal iron functioning.  I would recommend you simply take the multivitamin with 100% of the recommended daily intake of zinc.  Best wishes.\n\n",

The issue is I am given Hydrocodone,Darvocet,Percocet and each time I either get sick to the point I ruptured the blood vessels in my stomach and had a hernia.After each surgery I had to be taken back to the ER because I would have an anaplytic shock can't spell that. Which is felt is due to the blocks they use. 5 times I have had the same reaction to the pain meds above and 1 time to extra strenght Tylenol. At this point the ER Doc is about ticked off because the Ortho is saying this is in my head. My allergist tried to tell them that I cannot take this and to keep the acetomentphine/tylenol out of my treatment also am allergic to asprin and my asthma I cannot take NSAIDs. I have used my epipen twice. Now I am about to go through another surgery this week and he gave me Norco. I am really getting scared of these drugs and not sure. The nurse says there is no Tylenol in Norco but that is not what I read. I still have the morphine the ER doc gave me but really do not want to take it. The surgeon that did the hernia in June got a full dose of my reactions and stayed in the hospital for 5 days Is the Norco safe for me ? I am thinking of trying to burn the nerves in my knees and shoulder I have to get rid of this pain at this point I have nothing to lose. They say they cannot fix a partial tear in the knee my neck is all messed up as well, at this rate I will not be walking within 1-3 years and that is unacceptable for me. Being this is WC I am stuck with this Dr\n\n",

I would recommend you not take the Norco if you are having anaphylactic reactions that may be due to the acetaminophen.  Hydrocodone and oxycodone (the narcotic in vicodin and percocet) can be taken without the acetaminophen if you are needing strong pain control medications.  Best wishes.\n\n",

The vitamins all are in safe levels.  Taking mega dose vitamins (as in some supplements with 300% or more of a recommended daily intake) can be dangerous.  This supplement appears to have all the vitamins in very reasonable concentrations.  Some herbal supplements can have significant effects on the body (both good and bad).  They can also interact with medicines, such as your birth control.  I would recommend you discuss these supplements with your pharmacist.  The pharmacist should have some references that can provide data on these herbs.   Also, keep in mind that herbal supplements like this are NOT regulated by the FDA so there is a possibility that there may or may not be other things in the supplement that they don't mention.  It is also possible that the things that are supposed to be in it may not be in it to the degree they claim.  Be sure to check out the manufacturer to see if they seem like a legitimate business and if they have standards they follow.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I have found if I even take 2 pills like it sais on the package my eyes will dialate and I feel out there so to speak, buzzed I guess. When I take one it is not so bad. Is taking 2 a allergic reaction or is this stuff that good? It does take my stuffy nose away for a few hours. What do you recommend?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Mutant1981,  Tylenol cold and sinus contains a medicine called pseudoephedrine.  This medicine works similar to epinephrine (adrenaline).  You are probably very sensitive to this medicine, which occurs in some people.  It isn't an allergy just an increased sensitivity to it since everything that you are describing is an effect of the medicine rather than an allergic response.  You may want to try some of the newer versions of these medicines with phenylephrine instead of pseudoephedrine in them.  (They are often marked \"PE\", for example Sudafed PE instead of just Sudafed.)  This medicine still has some sinus clearing properties but not as much of the stimulant effect that you seem to be experiencing.  Best wishes.\n\n",

It is a fungal infection and will need an antifungal cream to clear up.  You can try an over the counter antifungal cream such as clotrimazole or see your doctor for a prescription medication.  Keep in mind that ringworm needs to be treated for several weeks to ensure it doesn't come back.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there.  I'm 30 years old, female and generally healthy.  I have been under general anesthetic three times, twice for impacted teeth removal and just yesterday for a hymenectomy.  I did not react badly to the general the first two times, but did discover the second time that the Tylonol with Codeine that they prescribed afterward me made me vomit and I passed out once.    So, I know I react to codeine, and I also recently reacted badly to an antibiotic that was sulfa-something.  When I was vomiting badly my mom told me to stop the antibiotics because she also has problems with sulfa drugs.  I stopped and felt better the next day.  Just yesterday morning I was given IV morphine and percocet right after my surgery and I vomited almost constantly for 24 hours and couldn't keep gravol down to help.   Do you know if/how these drugs are related?  Is there something that is similar in them that I can say, \"I react badly to any drugs with such and such, or any derivative of such and such\"?   I am so rarely ill, but when I am it seems the pain relief is worse then the pain of surgery.  I don't want to go through this again. They put a band on my wrist yesterday saying not to give me codeine.  Should I be getting saying not to give me anything that ends in \"ine\"?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Lilonething,  You probably don't need an allergy alert to all the \"ine\" medicines quite yet.  Morphine and percocet are all in the same class of medications as codeine is.  They are all narcotics.  The body makes codeine into morphine to make it work.  Percocet contains oxycodone and tylenol.  The oxycodone is a narcotic as well.  This is a somewhat common reaction to narcotics.  Not all narcotics cause this reaction in people with a sensitivity to them.  Occasionally there is one or two of the narcotics that are different enough not to cause problems.    It is probably a good idea to let your doctor know about your reactions to the narcotics in case you need more in the future.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I am petrified of getting pain relief that is that wholly  agonizing again, though.  Just to be clear from what you said, do you think it is morphine and codeine specifically and not necessarily all derivatives of morphine?  It really was no ordinary vomiting and I'm afraid that if I was having serious surgery sometime, it would really set back my recovery to be that sick for that long.   Thanks for your help!\n\n",

I'm not an expert on this but I see lots of reason to make sure you are getting the Dianette from a doctor that has considered the pros and cons of using Dianette and will follow up with you.  This medication is not used for birth control except in some cases in Canada or Europe where acne also needs to be treated.  Even then it is controversial because of serious possible side effects such as venous thromboembolism.  See for example http://www.whp-apsf.ca/en/documents/diane35.html or http://www.cwhn.ca/hot/news/diane35.html, where the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada cautions against its use even in moderate acne.

    "content": "The combination is beyond my expertise for sure.  It seems Breast Sculptor is an herbal product that contains phytoestrogens.  Herbals are not regulated to assure you that they are safe or effective like drugs are.  Phyto- (plant) estrogens in some ways are similar and can add to estrogen effects and in other ways counteract estrogen effects.  If you are taking a small amount, as in some pills, my guess is that it is probably not harmful.  I base that partly on reading an article \"Can women taking birth control pills also take soy supplements or phytoestrogens?\" answered by a doctor at http://www.drdonnica.com/display.asp?article=3225  Best advice would be from a gyn or endocrinologist. baby_blu8359 wrote:Yes i am taking two medications.

Although you are attempting to use contraception, you are only 16 years old, and this is a very young age for having sexual activity, although it is legal.  In particular one young person (as the youngsters are called) had to have a smear, and asked why these are important and the nurse I was working with replied \"the cells in the cervix can become damaged with the pressure of a penis, and young women that are having sex are easily causing these cells to rupture\".  They just don't realise how sensitive these cells/tissue are.  You are not mentioning the use of any protection against STI's either.  As for your breast enhancers, again you are only 16, so you are not fully developed yet, I am 20 and still developing. I think you should be happy with the way you are\n\n",

In addition to the effect they may have on clotting factors, they can also cause some birth defects, particularly when taken late in the pregnancy.  The effect on clotting factors is a potential problem throughout the pregnancy.  I would also caution you that many over-the-counter as well as prescription pain meds are combinations containing aspirin or ibuprofen.  For example, a popular over the counter pain reliever is a combination of acetaminophen/aspirin/caffeine.  This is very effective for some people.  It should not be used during pregnancy.  Tylenol is tried and true for use during pregnancy.  Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 27 year old female with endometriosis that causes debilitating pain.  About every few months I have thee need for IV/IM narcotics to lessen my pain.  On the occasions where Morphine or Dilaudid were used I experienced the following effects within minutes of injection:  1). excessive sweating, 2) rapid pulse, 3) hypertension 170/120 (I run 120/80) 3)severe (Number 10) pain in my upper abdomen and my neck and  4) severe intractable nausea.  Over the last two years I've experienced this reaction once with Morphine and on three occasions with Dilaudid.  The combination of Demerol and Zofran or Ativan and Zofran reverse these effects.    I have asked several physicians what this reaction is from with no answer.  The only possible cause I have been able to associate is sulfite sensitivity (I typically feel the same neck pain when drinking wine, but to a lesser degree)  Any thoughts on why I am sensitive to these particular narcotics?

    "content": "Hi Iluvgrapes,  In a certain percentage of people, these reactions to narcotics (particulary morphine) are seen.  There are a few possibilities.  One is that you are actually allergic to the compound.  This is fairly rare and less likely.  Another is that you have an exaggerated response to the narcotic.  Narcotics such as morphine can cause histamine release.  In some people this occurs quite significantly resulting in effects that mimic an allergic reaction, although this is not a true allergy.  Benadryl often reverses these effects as you've seen.  Occasionally, other types of narcotics work better such as demerol or fentanyl.    If you are having trouble finding a good pain medicine you may want to consider seeing a pain specialist.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Ravi_kant_verma,  Unfortunately, this is a difficult question to answer.  Alprazolam is classified as pregnancy class D by the FDA.  This category is where there is positive evidence of fetal risk but in some cases the benefit may outweigh the risk.  If it were clearly a teratogen (birth defect causer) it would be classified as category X.  Probably the baby will be fine since it was a one time exposure and the baby is currently in a phase of growth where the body is mostly growing and not forming new parts.  I would recommend that you let your obstetrician know about the exposure and discuss this with her.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear jmasterson: Ativan is in a class of drugs called benzodiazepines that is often prescribed for anxiety, insomnia, and seizures.  Ativan is used to relieve anxiety, nervousness, and tension associated with anxiety disorders. It is also used to treat certain types of seizure disorders and to relieve insomnia (induce sleep).  Ativan may be habit forming. Physical and/or psychological dependence can occur, and withdrawal effects are possible if the medication is stopped suddenly after prolonged or high-dose treatment.  Xanax is a tranquilizer used in the short-term relief of symptoms of anxiety or the treatment of anxiety disorders. Anxiety disorder is marked by unrealistic worry or excessive fears and concerns. Anxiety associated with depression is also responsive to Xanax.  Xanax is also used in the treatment of panic disorder, which appears as unexpected panic attacks and may be accompanied by a fear of open or public places called agoraphobia.  Tolerance and dependence can occur with the use of Xanax. You may experience withdrawal symptoms if you suddenly stop using the drug or reduce the dosage too quickly.  While both drugs can have a sedating affect, Ativan tends to cause sedation more often in patients.  You need to discuss with your doctor which medication would be beneficial in your case.

    "content": "I am not familiar with whether or not these pills can be cut in half.  If so, you can adjust your dosing accordingly.  If not, you'll need to discuss this with your doctor.  Your local pharmacist should be able to tell you whether or not you can cut the pills.  Luvox is in a category of medications known as SSRI or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.  They are used to treat depression and occasionally anxiety.  It can take SSRI's 3-4 weeks to reach full effect, so it is important not to interpret no response soon after starting the medicine as a medication failure.  If symptoms are not under control in 3-4 weeks it is reasonable to try to adjust the dosage upwards.  Generally, dosing increases are made in 3-4 week intervals to give the new dose a chance to work.  There is a maximum dose that can be used.  I would recommend that you discuss with your doctor about how to increase your dosages.  Often there is a physician that is covering for the doctor when he/she is out of town.  You may be able to talk with this person to get some more specific answers.  I am unable to give you any specifics as I do not have access to your chart and have not examined you.  Hopefully this helps a little.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I was prescribed Geodon the other day.   I was prescribed 40 mg/ 2X's a day and in 1 week increase to 80 mg/ 2X's a day of Geodon. I simply want to verify that it is okay to start at such a high dose and increase to the maximum dosage within one week of starting the medication. I read the Geodon manufacturer website and found that it is recommended to start at a low dose and gradually increase the med to an appropriate level (with 80 mg/ 2X's a day being the maximum dose), so as not to cause an irregular heart rhythm which can result in sudden death (although I read this hasn't happened since the release in 2001). Is there any problems associated with starting this med at this dose? If so, what should I watch for? Can starting out at 40 mg/ 2X's a day and increasing within a week cause this irregular heartbeat? I wouldn't worry so much except I have had plenty of bad experiences with psych meds. I don't want to question my doctor, but I need to know from a professional that this dosage is ok.   Also, I have a history of \"passing out\" spells, which I have learned are caused by severe anxiety attacks. Will this have an affect on the medicine's side effects?  Thank you very much for your time!\n\n",

Since you are not in the hospital, I presume, 40 mg twice daily is a good way to start out.  When Geodon (ziprasidone) was first on the market, we did always start at 20 mg twice daily, but people seem to have more side effects when it is done that way.  About the irregular heart rate the manufacturer warns about, you are 26 years old, and as long as you are healthy, and have no pre-existing heart problems, I would not expect any complications.  I hope it works for you.\n\n",

If it isn't working for you and you are concerned about side effects, let your doctor know this also.  There may be a different treatment for you that may have less side effects.  Weight gain is a common side effect of this medication.  Unfortunately, there really is no way of knowing for sure who will have certain side effects, but people who already have a tendency to gain weight are more likely to experience weight gain as a side effect.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

They were not able at the drug store to tell me what were the medications used because they keep the record only for 3-5 years. The DIN number is 00999822. I also have the prescription number if this can help. Anyone can find out what medications were used for the preparation of that cream with the DIN number ?  Thanks,  Jack Real.\n\n",

Maybe it's a different type of Fungus than what I had in 1996 and in 1998 but I'm a bit surprised that back then, I was given a presciption that was mixed at the drug store and now, in 2006, I'm given something that is available over the counter.  Tomorrow, I will go at the Infectious Disease Clinic to get some bood test. Hopefully, they will be able to confirm if I have Candida and wich type it is; Albicans or other. I'm not a doctor but I have those fungus since September and I really feel I'm being under treated with too many delays and too little medication.  We'll see.  /Jack Real.\n\n",

    "title": "PRILOSEC - Long Term Use Problems?",
    "content": "PRILOSEC - Long Term Use Problems?  I have found PRILOSEC, a miracle medicine (at least as far as I am concerned).  I am going to place my question here, at the beginning, in case you do not need the history below.  Simply put -- I want to take Prilosec forever.  It works.  It's the only relief I have ever had.  But the box states no more than 14 doses (2 weeks) in a 4 month period.  It works while I am taking it, but the symptoms return when I stop.  At this time, I have used the recommended dosage of 14 days, approximately three times in the four month period, plus took a pill here and there occasionally in-between full treatments.  I want to take the medication at least every other day, or once every 72 hours from now on, because when I stop for a couple days, the symptoms return in full.  But I have found that every other day, rather than daily, is sufficient for me on doses.  What are the long term side effects if I choose to take the medication continually from now on, doses of every other day or every three days?  I want to weigh the benefits versus the long term effects.  I have been to a number of doctors over the years to treat acid reflux and a hiatal hernia.  I have had prescribed just about every ulcer medication on the market, and tried every type of antacid and acid inhibitor or blocker.  Some worked for a while, then quit working, and most did not really work at all but simply reduced the aggravation for a few moments at a time.  Some of the symptoms I experience frequently (daily or more often) are heartburn, stomach fluids that roll up into my throat whenever I recline - even a little bit, and some foods do not seem to digest all the way like hamburger (which becomes a nasty heavy fluid in my stomach that rolls up in my throat when I fall asleep then slide down on my pillows, which causes me to feel like I'm drowning, coughing horribly, and throwing up).  I know ... very unpleasant, huh?  I have to sleep almost sitting up.  Prilosec allowed me to sleep lying down for the first time in 20 years.  Like I said, I've seen doctors about this repeatedly, and over the past two years, I got discouraged, just gave up, lived with it and treated the symptoms as best I could.    When I read about Nexium, I immediately went to my doctor.  My doctor said Nexium will not cure my problem but it can give me relief.  I received a prescription that my insurance will not fill.  I cannot afford $200 a month on my own.  Prilosec is $28 a month, and IT WORKS.  I have been diagnosed (by doctors) with hiatal hernia, supposedly caused by hyper emesis during several pregnancies (I lost 80 pounds during each pregnancy).  I have also been told that I produce full meal stomach acid all the time instead of regular amounts.  I am unable to obtain surgery for this condition.  I am allergic and/or have severe reactions to all anesthetics and most pain killers.  When I broke my arm, they used a blood cuff that stopped circulation in the arm to place the pins, rather than anesthetic.  I do not receive any anesthetic for dental work, I just endure it.  I even tried an epidural for my tubal ligation after my last child was born, and I had a bad reaction to that.  So surgery is not option.  I hope you can help here.   Valerie\n\n",

    "content": "In long term (2-year) studies in rats, omeprazole (e.g. prilosec) produced a dose related increase in gastric carcinoid tumors. While avaliable endoscopic evaluations and histologic examinations of human biopsies have not detected a risk from short term (8 week) use, further research and longer follow up is needed to find out the risk of developing that kind of complication in humans.   One other concern relates to a theoretical risk of atrophy of the stomach lining because of the long-term suppression of acid secretion by stomach cells, but this has not led to complications in patients so far.   That said it should be known that proton pump inhibitors (e.g. omeprazole) drugs have now been available for about 10 years and have been used even longer in clinical research studies. To date, no severe long-term side effects have been detected. Thus, it is considered safe to take PPI medications indefinitely at this time.  Take a look at this article on The Doctors Lounge which describes the possible complications and when to seek urgent advice in cases with GERD.  Click here!\n\n",

The warning for the limited 2 week per four month use, was not explained.  And no where did it say why there was a limit on the usage.  I do not plan to use it daily.  I asked two doctors, and they said they were not sure, because they prescribed similar prescriptions for daily use.  I take one every 48-72 hours, and many times I skip several days until the syptoms return.  I am willing to take the risk in order to have restful sleep in which I no longer wake up drowning and throwing up from the stomach fluids.  Thank you so much.\n\n",

I've quit smoking and really cut down on my alcohol intake. I take Prilosec once, sometimes twice a day. I've been taking it for about 6 months now.  I've had tests done, but they all came up empty. I'm pretty sure I have an ulcer, though. The Prilosec works great, but I also have to watch what I eat and when. Beer, wine, hard liquor, and all that stuff really rips my gut up.   I hope there aren't huge long term side effects because I plan to take Prilosec twice a day for the next 6 months to let my ulcer heal. I'm also going to stop drinking completely (no more of this \"just one drink a week or month\" crap because it's not working). The Prilosec keeps the dull ache I get at bay. Usually I'll get a nasty ache or pain in my gut after eating a lot of food, especially spicy food.  Nothing really helps except Prilosec. Let me know if taking it for a long time has proven to give people serious health problems, though. I have enough problems.\n\n",

    "title": "Long-term use of Prilosec",
    "content": "I am a 46 year old female who used Prilosec for approximately 10 years due to over-production of stomach acid.  I thought it was wonderful - it greatly improved the quality of my life for all those years.  I too was unable to stop taking it -- whenever I would try, within 3 days my symptoms would return.  Last year I started going through menopause, and at the same time I suddenly noticed that I can now stop taking my Prilosec.  I have been off it for one year, and none of the stomach-acid-related symptoms have returned.  However, I just found out that I have Osteoporosis (T-score of -2.6), severe arthritis in my hip, and bursitis.  All this despite being only 46 years old!    The reason I am writing this here is because I recently read on a holistic site, that if your body does not have ENOUGH stomach acid it cannot properly use the calcium it takes in, and bone and joint problems can follow.  That site suggested that long-term use of medications which prohibit the production of stomach acid can contribute to this.  I'm not certain of anything at this point, but I do plan to check to see if my long-term use of Prilosec might have led to my current bone and joint issues.  Regardless of what the answer turns out to be -- having been someone who knows exactly what you mean when you say that longterm use of prilosec is the only thing that seems to help -- I would in retrospect, go to all lengths to find a natural solution.  I am just now finding that they do exist, and I can't help but believe that they are better for your body in the longrun.\n\n",

Only problem is that I get a little spooked myself when reading up on the drugs.  For example: it says about the HALOPERIDOL-tell your doctor if you have bipolar disorder AND the medicine should not be used if you have Parkinson's disease (she doesn't, but has been prescribed the BENZTROPINE  to help with the LITHIUM tremors) I'm 99% sure that the doctors know all of this and have her on the right combinations of medicines, but a little more reassurance wouldn't hurt.

    "content": "My boyfriend started taking Wellbutrin less then six months ago. He and I broke up when he started taking it because he turned into an asshole.  Well, now we're back together and he doesn't  take it regularly. It makes him agitated and moody. He wants to get off of it but his parents and his doctors won't let him. Because he's a minor he has to listen to them. He told them about the side-effects and they won't listen. One of the worst side-effects that it has is premature ejaculation. As you can imagine, this is a really horrible side-effect for a high school boy to have.    It's even worse for me, his girlfriend. We've been trying to research this drug and get as much info as possible but none of the information we find says anything about premature ejaculation. I'm almost positive it's a side-effect from the drug because before he took it this never happened. Somebody please help me. I'll take any info I can get. Thank you.\n\n",

Some of the side effects that may be experienced are decreased sex drive, decreased volume of ejaculate, trouble attaining or keeping an erection, breast tenderness. Keep in mind that less than 2% of men experience symptoms. Now as for pregnancy and birth defects. The recommendation is, women who may become pregnant or that are pregnant must not handle crushed or broken tablets as this medication may be absorbed through the skin and is known to cause birth defects in the developing male fetus. Again, this is applied to women handling crushed or broken tablets. Here is some additional information regarding this medication from the Merck website.  Click here!

    "content": "Dear Ali,  Although your body mass index is normal, may be it is not a bad idea to lose a few pounds. If your weight becomes 110 pounds, your body mass index will still be normal.  Weight (like everything) is a balance between intake and output, so if you want to lose, increase output and decrease intake and vice versa.  i don't have a personal experience with such products and the product that you mentioned is said to make the person who takes not feel hungry after eating a small amount of food (decrease intake) and at the same time burns more fat (increase output) so the person loses weight.   It does not contain ephedra, so it should be safer than other pills but there is nothing without risks and side effects. The problem with some of these products is that one is not sure whether or not they are fda tested or approved and i think that the companies that make them are not required to report any side effects that arise from these products. And i am not sure if they keep track of any side effect that arise or not.  Regarding other diet pills, the ones that ephedra free are the ones that should be used.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

I'm not talking a few strands at a time....I am talking hundreds of hairs in my hands every single time I washed my hair!!!   I was frantic!   Asked four doctors, and two pharmacists if possibly Singulair could cause it.  Was told no.  I checked the internet, the PDR and the Pill Book to see if hair loss might be listed as a side effect....it isn't.   No one would agree with me.  I stopped taking it three weeks ago.  Two weeks after stopping I have not seen one single hair come out no matter how vigorously I shampoo.    Yep...I have hayfever back....but my hair isn't falling out! Just thought anyone who takes this med might want to know.  Maybe I am just unusual and it doesn't happen to others.  Bats\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you so much for sharing your experience! I have been taking Singulair for only 6 months and was noticing so much hair thinning that I went to the dermatologist. He did hormone testing (don't have results yet), but I think that you are ABSOLUTELY RIGHT about this med so I stopped taking it yesterday. It was the only medication I was taking and I had no issues with my hair prior to taking it. I went on Merck's website and other websites and none of them mention hair loss as a side effect of Singulair. It could be that this side effect only impacts a small % of users, but I think that people need to be made aware of this and Merck needs to test more/disclose. So, thank you again.  BTW, you mentioned that your hair loss slowed about 2 weeks after you stopped using the drug, but did it ever grow back in the places where it had fallen out?\n\n",

    "content": "I have had over 200 emails from people all over the world telling me their stories about their experience with hair loss and every one of them was taking Singulair.  I have written Merck many times asking them to list it as a side effect and of course no one has ever responded.  I guess they have bigger fish to fry.  It took several months before I noticed my hair completely stopped falling out.  At first I noticed it had stopped completely but then I noticed some was still coming out even two, three months later.  My hair was so much thinner so I watched my scalp carefully over a six month period and did notice some was growing back.  It's been 8 months since I stopped taking that medication.  I cut my hair real short, started taking Biotin 10 mg at the suggestion of my dermatologist and have now finally noticed my hair is thicker and almost back to the way it was before the medication.  I've let it grow again and went back to getting it highlighted (which I had stopped out of fear it was making things worse).   In my experience, it took about 6 months to gradually stop falling out, each month better than the last.  And it has taken upwards of 8 months for me to notice a difference in thickness.    I think the hair loss is a side effect for many people based on the emails I have received.  The people write me back after they stop taking the medication, and VOILA....their hair stops falling out.  I am so glad you found this message board.  I would definitely find another allergy drug if I were you.  I get hayfever and asthma somewhat now since I am off the drug....but I am resorting to other remedies. Good luck! Donna\n\n",

Drugs are better combined that are different enough in the way the body breaks them down and gets rid of them, and different in the case of drugs that might have side effects in larger doses.\n\n",

Well that was 3 months ago and I still have the pain, which I NEVER had before. What is this? Is is arthritis; just a reaction? Will it ever subside?

Prior to this medication I had tried Prozac and Zoloft and both did not help.  My problem is that I have tried to get off of Effexor twice within the past year (with the help of my doctor) by tapering off the dose (150mg), and both times the withdrawal was severe\u2014disrupting work and my day-today life. I had disturbing dreams, tingling, nausea, horrible moods (crying, hostile), dizziness, in fact, standing up for too long was awful. Both attempts ended in my throwing in the towel after a week because I physically could not take it. My body was so stressed that my moods suffered terribly. Can you let me know your opinion as to what may help me to safely get off this medication?   I really do not like the fact that my body has become so dependant on something. Thank you.\n\n",

I have assiduously avoided placing myself in situations that could lead to personal addiction.  It seems that  my distorted, depressed thinking led me to an addictive medication.  I made it perfectly clear to my physician that I wanted to take medication only as long as necessary.  I have been busy putting other supports into place including therapy and Al-Anon.  I have made decisions about how to live my life that are finally good for me.    I didn't stop the Effexor on my own.  I went to the doctor.  I tapered off.  I should have found your site first.  I have all of the physical symptoms of withdrawal mentioned in this forum.  So far, no rage but some crying.  If I continue to lose sleep, rage is guaranteed and crying will increase.  Feeling I had little control over my life led me to depression and Effexor and now, here I am again with no control over these physical ills.  If I can stand the withdrawal symptoms, will they taper off on their own?  Is there any consistent consensus on how long that might take?  I will try the \"open the capsule\" method if need be.  I am angry at myself for not doing my Effexor homework.  Thank you for your site.\n\n",

    "content": "Vioxx has been recalled. The vioxx recall followed a number of studies in which the potential dangers of the drug were illustrated. Although Merck had already carried out its own recent trials the company claimed that there was not sufficient evidence to justify a vioxx recall at that time. However, the results from subsequent tests appeared to prove beyond a doubt that the drug posed sufficient danger to warrant a mass vioxx recall, and with the assistance of the FDA Merck began the task of pulling the drug from the market.   This was voluntarily withdrawn by Merck, but the FDA has come under major fire for not doing something earlier.  All of this is well-documented throughout the Internet.  I hope you were able to find this information before any possible damage was incurred by you.\n\n",

    "content": "My 7 year old son goes to his mothers house every other weekend, and when he is there he experiences nausea, then vomiting.  He goes on Friday and feels nausea by Saturday, then wakes up early Sunday and throws up.  He feels better after taking a nap, but then feels sick again on Sunday night after coming back home, then wakes up early on Monday morning and throws up at least 2 more times. This only started after she moved to a new house and she recently had it tested for mold and air quality and they found nothing.  After starting to notice the pattern, I contacted his school and found that he had missed 6 days and everyone was a Monday after being at his mom's house. He must be alergic to something, for he feels better by Monday afternoon and is back to his normal self, wanting to run and play. He is scheduled to go this next weekend, but I would like more answers.  When he does throw up, it is violent and painful and I do not want to cause him any long term damage. I am lost for answers and was hoping someone else had some insight as to what might be wrong.  Our family Physician does not want to test for alergies, so another dead end.\n\n",

Spent thousands of dollars pa with every conceivable medical treatment inc Chinese acupuncture, Harley Street/London doctor-every test known to medical science-nothing!! Currently back on a new Chinese regime of 84 tablets per day. Chinese doctor says it's my \"K Meridian\" that is blocked.\"  Improving, but new medication often improves short term. I have no medical background, but 25yrs experience of dealing with my skin! It is my belief that my problem centres around blood flow or more accurately blood consistency. The acne type markings will \"flow\" from my chest to my head to my back dependant on how much Chinese medication I take. The severity of the marks is totally in correlation with the blood flow. eg; sometimes marks will bleed with ease. Sometimes will not bleed but bruise horribily. Can take weeks for the bruising to subside. I have no known medical conditions such as diabetes etc. Taken years of antibiotics (for skin) & Prosac but all years after skin originally flared up. I understand that the new drug Exansa uses the snake venom method of thinning the blood. I am repeatedly told that thinning the blood will not help my case, but I would be interested (very interested!) in your professional comments. Thanks in advance.\n\n",

Now, abuse of the drug is one thing, but if i take it like it says to and do not abuse it, is there any major risks involved? I know the substance works, but is it really a risk I should be taking? Also, is there an alternative route. Thank you.  I am 5'6, 145 pounds, I played a fall sport and in good shape despite only running occasionally. I am very healthy.\n\n",

    "content": "Many adverse effects from creatine use have been reported and include; muscle cramping, diarrhea, abdominal pain, kidney dysfunction and dehydration. The potential for numerous other side-effects exists but have not been studied with long-term use. If you are considering using creatine consult your doctor and discuss its use before making a decision. Nothing takes the place of dedication and hard work in training for your sport and the results you can obtain in performance.  Now whether these adverse effects were caused directly from overuse, normal use or purchase of low quality creatine is unknown.  Always let your physician know about any supplements you decide to take just in case something does go wrong, so they'll have a clue where to start for causes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi. I'm 19 yr old female.   I have been getting migraine like headaches daily, between 2 and 15 a day, averaging at 8.  The pain is around 5 to 8 on a 1-10 scale, though a few times a week I get 9's.  My doctor has put me on Amitriptyline which I am about to start.  However, when I came home and shared what happened at the doctor with my parents, Dad (who used to be an air force medic) was not happy.  I was told that Amitriptyline can cause drowsyness and I want to know to what degree.  I know I have to take them to find out to what degree it will affect me but can you give me an idea of how bad it could be, and any other side effecys of the medication.  I am a serious university student and don't want it to effect my studies.  It is really just seeing whether I should put up with the headaches or be drowsy.  Thanks for your help.\n\n",

    "content": "Five years ago, at the age of 21, I had severe acne and used a lot of topicals and took a lot of pills.  As a result, my face became all rashed up.  I had eczema ever since I was a baby, but it was contolled at the age of 12 and you couldn't even tell I had eczema.  After the acne, my doctor prescribe a 1%hydrocortisone to stop the itching and I've been using it since.  But now, it doesn't work anymore.  Eventually, the rashes are not only on my cheeks, and between my eyes, but also on my forehead and ears, and back. I asked another doctor and they prescribed a clobatesol prop. It was too hard on my face after 2 weeks so i went back to the hydrocortisone.  H them suggested a mosturizer which clogged up all my pores.  Then all of a sudden, I developed a lot of acne.  I am very thirsty no matter what I drink.  I went to a dermatologist and she said I had rosacea.  I had a lot of blackheads and whiteheads.  So is it still possible it's rosacea?  She has currently prescibed a novo-minocycline and .25% hydrocortisone because the rosasol cream she prescribed caused my skin to crack and bleed.  The rashes and acne don't seem to go away.  Am I using the right type of creams and antibiotics?\n\n",

Steroid cream, such as hydrocortisone, should not be used on any area - particularly the face - for extended amounts of time as it can cause breakdown of the skin leaving it susceptible to scarring and other skin problems.

    "content": "Hi.   I am 19 years old male.  I was looking thru the web a while ago and i realised that i have a condition called Gynecomastia. It is, indeed, very embarassing.   My chest/breasts are big and im very embarassed and hence i only choose to wear looser and bigger shirts so as to hide my \"disablitity\". It is also embrassing to walk against the wind or run.   I have this condition since a very young age, and i reckon it is a genetic thing passed down from my mum's side of the family, of which a few of my cousins are suffering from the same condition.   Other possible causes of the condition might be that im asthmatic and had taken Ventolin and Volmax when i was young. Whether or not they contributed to the condition, i cant be sure.   I am 168cm in height and 78kgs in weight. I have just signed up for a gym-program which includes aerobics and other activities and I have decided to go on for 6 months. However, i just discovered Gynecomastia might not be cured by exercise and it led to me worrying that if my fat around my body is reduced, my \"breasts\" would become more apparent than ever.   I am so depressed right now. Could you tell me what are the things i could do to reduce Gynecomastia, apart from going under the knife (operation)? I came across this medication on the internet called Nolvadex. Is it safe to have it? Does it mess with my hormones? I wanna stay the person that i am, minus the embarassing chest. Thanks.  Please reply as soon as possible.  Thanks.   Embarassed85.\n\n",

Nolvadex is a hormonal treatment it has both estrogenic and antiestrogenic properties. It is primarily used in the treatment of breast cancer and has been associated with increased risk of deep venous thrombosis and endometrial cancer in women. I would prefer if you could consult your physician because it seems that what you have is increased fat on your chest due to generalized obesity. Do not take tamoxifen - it wont make you any better.

Dr Anthony Solomon MB BS DTM&H DIP.VEN FRSM Consultant Physician, Tropical & Genitourinary Medicine   Oh! ! Dr. Solomon!! I'm so glad you posted that. I had a feeling my doctors had me on Xanax much too long.  I am not prone to psychological dependence but unfortunately because I have suffered from what is probably complex PTSD triggered by a car accident 3 1/2 years ago they have had me on Xanax since about 6months out when the emotional numbness wore off and I started to have anxiety attacks.  Recently I have been worried that my dosage was too high (6mg/day) given 1. I felt taking it for more than 2 or 3 months would cause a physiological dependence  2. I'm not sure but doesn't Xanax actually over extended periods cause depression to get worse even though it eases temporary acute anxiety?  3. I am taking Topamax for migraine prevention & Gabitril for insomnia & muscle relaxers for neck pain & I'm concerned about CNS drug interactions  because I've had difficulty breathing but my Psychiatrist doesn't buy 4. When Neurontin went to generic my insurance stopped coverage so my Dr. switched me to Gabitril & I noticed that at around 20-24mg it helped my anxiety (because my insomnia was better I dropped the dosage and the anxiety came back   )   To sum it up.  My Neurologist is the one who put me on Neurontin for Insomnia because he felt like it is such a safe non habit forming medication.  Since Gabitril is basically the same chemically and is so benefical for my anxiety would it not be better to ditch the Xanax and control my mood and anxiety with Gabitril? It seems much more safe to me but then I am no Dr. & Gabitril is expensive.\n\n",

    "title": "Medication Side Effect - Benign or Serious????",
    "content": "First of all, I want to apologize for the length of this e-mail but I felt it necessary in order to fully display the appropriate information as well as my ongoing concern.    In 1999-2000, I was diagnosed by an American Medical Association (AMA) Board Certified medical psychiatrist with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).  Upon my diagnosis of ADHS my psychiatrist opted to initiate a stimulant medication regime (Adderall) that initially consisted of 10mg two-times daily.  This dosing schedule lasted for approximately three months upon which my psychiatrist switched my stimulant medication regime to 20mg two-times daily.  Since that time, approximately four to five-years, I have been on my psychiatrist\u2019s prescribed stimulant medication regime of 20mg of Adderall two-times a day. Approximately two years ago, in 2003, I began to have continuous chest discomfort (a feeling of tightness/pressure that is located a majority of the time on the left-side of my chest and occasionally on the right-side of my chest, below my nipple line) accompanied by left arm tingling and shoulder pain (localized in origin and sharp) as well as occasional bouts of shortness of breath. Unfortunately my chest discomfort/pain continued to persist, which manifested to numerous amounts of return trips to the same as well as various other local ER\u2019s. The physician informed me that CT scan showed normal cardiac vasculature but the echocardiogram revealed several abnormalities of interest.  In receiving this information, I requested the cardiologist's paperwork concerning his interpretation of my echocardiogram in order to ascertain detailed clinical diagnostic information from the test.  The cardiologist\u2019s interpretation of the 2D Doppler Echocardiogram was that I had a mild atrioventricular wall motion abnormality of the LV with a reduction in EF 40 - 45%. His final diagnosis was mild left ventricular hypokinesis with reduction of EF of 40-45%.  After this diagnosis, I was referred to a cardiologist who performed a standard bedside cardiovascular assessment, which he said was unremarkable but he said that in consideration of the abnormalities that were described in the results from the echocardiogram, he would like to perform a cardiac arteriogram in order to ascertain a more invasive clinical picture of my heart.  At the time, I felt that this was in my best decision and opted to have the procedure performed on that same day.  After the procedure, I was informed by the cardiologist that I was in excellent cardiovascular health and that there was nothing wrong with my heart.  He told me that he thought that I may have been experiencing side effects of my ADHD medication (Adderall). After receiving this information, I proceeded to inform my psychiatrist of my diagnosis and was told that the medication was more than likely not the cause of my symptoms. At that time, I requested to be placed on a different kind of medication for my ADHD and after a meeting with my psychiatrist to discuss this possibility; I was convinced by my psychiatrist that my current stimulant medication regime was in my best interest and that I should not worry about my ongoing symptoms. Well, it has been a little over a 1\u00bd years since the arteriogram as well as cardiac consults and my symptoms continue to persist.  Furthermore, since the results of my echocardiogram, I have spent numerous hours researching my associated symptoms as well as the potential causes, specifically side effects-related to my Adderall medication.  In doing so, I learned that upon being prescribed Adderall a thorough physical examination of the patient should be performed, including a careful examination of the patient\u2019s blood pressure, heart rate and overall cardiac fitness. To date, my psychiatrist has not performed any such medical examination and I am unaware of whether or not his has requested my medical files-relating to my previously mentioned cardiovascular tests. Moreover, during my research, I found out that one of the side effects of my medication (Adderall) is \"cardiomyopathy after chronic use.\"  I also understand that Adderall is considered an indirect sympathomimetic and that that symptoms that I am experiencing are more than likely due to the pharmacokinetics of the drug. I realize that I was informed, after the my arteriogram, by the cardiologist that my heart was fine and I have also been informed by several other cardiologist that an echocardiogram is not 100% sensitive or specific and that the results of the tests are highly weighed on the skill, experience and overall ability of the physician interpreting the echocardiogram.  But, in my research concerning the topic I found that as far as the sensitivity and specificity of cardiovascular diagnostic tests concerning heart kinetics, the echocardiogram was considered the \u201cgold-standard.\u201d   1.Therefore, in consideration of my research indicating that the echocardiogram is considered the \u201cgold standard\u201d for accurately determining cardiovascular kinetics, does that make the results of my arteriogram less valid (Note: Several research reports have indicated discrepancies with respect to diagnostic abnormalities yielded on echocardiograms suggestive of amphetamine-induced coronary vasospasm-related ischemia yet showing normal coronary vasculature upon cardiac arteriogram procedures)?   2.Should I continue to be concerned about my persistent chest tightness and occasional left arm and shoulder pain?    3.Do my potential echocardiographic abnormalities and/or ongoing symptoms reflect previously observed amphetamine-induced cardiomyopathies and/or amphetamine-induced myocardial infarctions previously documented in medical/scientific case studies, case reports, literature and/or journals?  4.Considering that my symptoms completely subside during occasional drug-holidays, am I just experiencing a benign yet aggravating side effect of the medication itself?   5.Are any of my previous diagnostic tests and/or current ongoing symptoms related to what was observed in previous reports of Adderall and Adderall XR-related sudden unexplained deaths (SUD) found on the Food and Drug Administration website, in particular the documentation of sudden unexplained deaths (SUD) correlating to an abnormal build-up of the drugs steady-state in some individuals?   6.Are there any current ongoing or recruitment of clinical trials relating to Adderall/Amphetamine-related side effects?           Basically, my concern is two-fold; I am currently a medical student and therefore truly feel that the medication is warranted in order for me to perform the associated necessary tasks of school but I am unsure whether or not my aforementioned symptoms are or are not currently compromising my health status.  If at all possible, in consideration of my aforementioned ongoing symptoms as well as the research information that I have found, I would thoroughly appreciate your professional advice concerning the aforementioned information and questions.\n\n",

    "content": "Amphetamine; dextroamphetamine combinations are contraindicated in patients with symptomatic or structural cardiac disease including advanced arteriosclerosis, coronary artery disease, and moderate to severe hypertension. Based on preliminary reports of sudden unexplained death (SUD) in patients with or without cardiac structural abnormalities, the U.S. FDA issued an alert in February 2005 that amphetamine; dextroamphetamine products not be used in any patient with structural cardiac abnormalities. Patients with even mild hypertension should be closely monitored while taking amphetamines.  Isolated reports of cardiomyopathy ]have been associated with chronic amphetamine administration.  the information you have researched is all correct, as i my self had come across them, i truly recommend that you talk to your psychiatric about this cardiovascular problems that you had. Many times in pharmacy clinical practice, if we think that an offending agent is causing the problems, one would remove the offending agent, and wait to see improvement in symptoms. if the offended agent is removed and symptoms persist, one could then conclude that the side effect you are experiencing is not drug induced.  Finally remember that if the physician decide to discontinue  agent, these drug should be removed slowly,meaning tapered down slowly, otherwise sudden discontinuation of the drug might result in rebound symptoms.  thank you\n\n",

    "content": "Creatine monophosphate is a dietary supplement similar to the natural compound creatine phosphate, which is an essential component of the energy-building system in muscle cells. Phosphocreatine is a nitrogen-containing compound found naturally in meats and fish. Creatine is also synthesized endogenously by the kidney, liver, and pancreas from arginine, glycine, and methionine. Normal dietary needs of creatine are suggested to be approximately 2 g/day to replace catabolized creatine.  Many sports nutrition experts believe that the majority of world-class athletes use creatine. It is also widely used at the collegiate level.   In general, manufacturers of creatine report that commonly used doses of oral creatine supplements are well tolerated. Weight gain is the most frequently reported adverse event. During short-term creatine supplementation, weight gain may result from fluid retention. Weight gain during long-term creatine supplementation (combined with resistance training) may be due to increases in lean body mass, however, more data are needed for confirmation. Anecdotal reports of adverse reactions have included anxiety, atrial fibrillation, diarrhea, dyspnea, fatigue, migraine headache, myopathy, nausea/vomiting, nervousness, polymyositis, rash (unspecified), and seizures. It has also been suggested that creatine may cause an increased incidence of dehydration, muscle cramps, and muscle strains/pulls when exercising in heat, however, studies have not supported this. Data are scarce to support an association of the use of creatine with renal side effects. The effects of long-term creatine supplementation have not been determined.  Creatine should be used cautiously in persons with pre-existing renal disease that produces renal impairment or renal failure. Creatine loading generates large quantities of the metabolite creatinine, a nitrogenous compound that must be eliminated by the kidney. In diabetics with already-compromised renal function, excessive concentrations of blood urea accelerates the decline in renal function. Although both creatinine and urea are nitrogenous compounds excreted renally, generally, it is not thought that creatinine contributes the same osmotic damage that urea can. The long-term effects of creatine loading on the renal function of subjects with normal renal function are currently unclear.  as far as for your son, since you have stated that he does not have currently any major health problems, no need to worry, however, keep in mind the above mentioned side effects based on the clinical data available for us.  thank you\n\n",

    "content": "Hi  Rntdj, Thanks for your help and soory for the long post, but I really don't know what is important for you to know and what is not.  I'm a 30-year-old female. I learned about 3 months ago that I have high blood pressure (only diastolic-benign according to my doctor). Since then I started taking Triamterene/HCTZ 37.5/25. I had a few side effects in the begining and after one week I was ok. After about 15 days taking this medicine, I had a numbness sensation coming from my forehead, all my face and neck (left side), it was gone after a matter of minutes. I had it three more times and went to see my doctor. I had a blood test (for neurological problems)-which I didn't have acces, but seems that everything came normal, a catscan from my head - I checked the report - normal, and a MRI-head - checked, normal.. Nobody blames the medicine I'm taking, and the neurologist mentioned that it could be psicologic (?????). I consider myself a happy person, happy with my personal and professional life, with no major concerns... No debts, a really stable job, a happy marriage... The symptons are getting worse, after my face start tingling, close to my left eye I feel a funny sensation all the time, and now, I frequently wake up with my hand and forearm tingling (and I checked, I wasn't sleeping on my left side), my left foot and my lip are tingling as well. Some times it happens on my right hand and foot, but not so intense and frequent What it could be?? Now I'm starting getting depressed, anxious,. I know one of the side effects of triamterene/HCTZ  is what I've been feeling (numbness and tingling), but I had some questions, like should I feel everything in only one side of my body??? The blood tests  came normal because I was having sporadics relapses and I was in between then?? Please, help me out with this, I've been really disappointed with my doctors and trying to find other options and waiting for appoitments, but if I can get some clarification I think I will feel better and have more arguments to talk to my doctor. Thanks so much.\n\n",

I read the ingredients for all of the pain medication i take for that time of the month and they all contained the same thing except for the two medications that caused these blisters, and that ingredient is pamabrom. I know it is a duretic but the two medications are the only one that contain this and the only two that caused this reaction. can Pamabrom cause this type of reaction?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, For about the past week i've been waking up with itchy welts on my skin. I thought it was a spider bite at first, but i have too many to be coming from a spider. My boyfriend seems to think they are stress hives, but i've looked up info on hives and i'm not sure. They are about the size or a nickel and very itchy. but they're really spread out randomly on my body. I have one on my hand, 4 on my feet, two on my back, one on my arm, and one on my ear. From what i read of hives, they should be grouped more than mine are, and also go away within a day. Mine have been here for 3 days and are just starting to not itch and go away. I have no idea what it could be, but it's driving me crazy!!! (which i'm sure won't help, if they are from stress....hehe) But anyways, does this sound familiar to anyone out there? I have no history of allergies or hives or anything. Please help!! They look like mosquito bites, large ones. ~thanks sooo much!\n\n",

Does the injection affect me getting pregnant afterwards?  is it harder to become pregnant afterwards?  i would like to know everything (good or bad) that anyone has on these two things.  i recently had a miscarriage where i had to receive the D&C surgery and i do not want to go through that again.  however, i do not want this to affect me getting pregnant later, or whenever i decide to.  please reply on this subject.  thank you.[/b]\n\n",

    "content": "Mini-Pills are progesterone-only birth control pills. Mini-Pills come in packs of 28 pills and one is taken every day. They have a synthetic form of the progesterone hormone and no estrogen. The Mini-Pill affects the mucus around the cervix and makes it harder for sperm to enter the uterus. It also affects the transport of the egg through the fallopian tubes. In these ways, the Mini-Pill prevents fertilization. Mini-Pills are more than 95% effective, slightly less than regular birth control pills. The most common side effect for women using Mini-Pills is irregular bleeding. While many women on Mini-Pills have normal periods, others may have irregular periods, spotting between periods or no periods at all. If you do not bleed for 60 days, call the clinic to arrange for a pregnancy test but continue taking your pills. Other possible side effects of the Mini-Pill are mood changes, headaches, and lowered sex drive.  Some of the typical side effects of regular birth control pills, such as nausea, and breast tenderness, usually do not occur with Mini-Pills.   Depo Provera is a hormone injection that lasts for 3 months to prevent pregnancy. The injection contains synthetic progesterone and no estrogen. It is usually given in the arm or rear, delivering a high level of progesterone into the body. Depo Provera stops the ovaries from releasing eggs. Depo Prover causes the cervical mucu to thicken and changes the uterine lining, making it harder for sperm to enter or survive in the uterus. These changes prevent fertilization. Depo Provera is a very private form of birth control because it cannot be seen on the body and requires no home supplies. It does, however, require a clinic appointment every 3 months. Depo Provera is 99.7% effective as birth control.   Studies released in 2004 show that Depo Provera is associated with the lost of bone density resulting in an increased risk of osteoporosis. The bone loss appears not to be reversed when the woman goes off Depo Provera. Depo is not recommended for long term use and especially not recommended when the young woman is still growing her bones. Women on Depo are advised to exercise and take in plenty of calcium. If you have taken Depo Provera for more than two years, it might be a good idea to get a bone density test.  Some women have allergic reactions to Depo Provera.   If a woman becomes pregnant while using Depo Provera, and continues her pregnancy, there may be an increased risk of premature birth.   The effects of Depo Provera on breast cancer are still unknown.  70 % of women using Depo Provera gain weight. Almost half of the women using Depo Provera gain more than 5 pounds after one year of use. Many women gain more than 10 pounds.   Irregular, heavy, or no bleeding are common side effects of Depo Provera. After a year of use, many women stop having periods. Lack of a period becomes increasingly common with longer use.   Other side effects of Depo Provera can include headaches, nervousness, mood changes, bloating, hot flashes, decreased interest in sex, breast tenderness, acne, hair loss, and back ache.   After the last shot of Depo Provera, it can take over 6 months for the drug to leave the body. Side effects may linger until the drug is completely gone.\n\n",

At your age, it is not recommended to use Depo-Provera for the following reasons:  * reduction of bone mineral density which you do not want at age 18  * likelihood of menstrual disturbances including the absence of menstruation for long    periods. * potential for a delay in return to full fertility which may occur after discontinuation of         treatment (there is no evidence of permanent infertility).

The critical time for loss of contraceptive protection is when a pill is missed at the beginning or end of a cycle (because this lengthens the pill-free interval). If you forget a pill, take it as soon as you remember, and carry on with the next pill at your normal time. If you are 12 hours late for a combined pill, the pill may not work. If you are more than 3 hours late for a progesterone-only pill, you are not protected. Continue normal pill-taking, but you must also use an additional method, such as the condom, or not have sex for the next 7 days. If you used a condom and are sure that you took the missed pill within the time intervals I have described above, it should be safe.   Dr Anthony Solomon MB BS DTM&H DIP.VEN FRSM\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  For those reading who don't know, Zyprexa is an antipsychotic medication that works by changing the actions of chemicals in the brain. It is used to treat conditions such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and can also be used for other things as determined by your doctor.  Anytime you alter the dose of a medication you have the possibility of overdosing. That's extremely dangerous, especially with Zyprexa.  You should avoid consuming alcohol during treatment of Zyprexia  Overdose includes drowsiness, agitation, aggressiveness, slurred speech, increased heart rate, vomiting, chest pains, trouble breathing and convulsions (seizures)  CONTACT YOUR DOCTOR IMMEDIATELY or seek medical attention if you experience fever, sweating, severe muscle stiffness (rigidity), confusion, fast or irregular heart beats. These could be symptoms of a potentially fatal side effect called Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS).\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for your response!   Further checking I learned that when I was diagonosed with vocal cord cancer in 2004, a  panendoscopy (camera into throat) was done during which a spray containing cocaine was used.  Then regular urine test (required for all patients receiving pain meds)ordered by PCP.  This was at a VA hospital, and my primary care doctor failed to go back & see why someone with my history & age (70) would have shown positive for cocaine.  She had cut back on pain meds (Tylenol #3) & used that as a reason, and I will take further steps to insure test was ONLY reason cocaine showed up .  Also requested consultation with pain mgmt specialist since I live with continous pain due to several compressed discs, hip replacements, many bone fractures & severe arthritis & heart transplant.  Extreme frustration with all this; despite being on constant morphine for 6 months while awaiting new heart I never experienced any withdrawal or desire for the drug.  I am not a drug abuser and no one should have to live like this!\n\n",

    "content": "I had 4 wisdom teeth removed 5 days ago and was prescribed Tylenol 3 and Ibuprofen for pain management. I took the medication as directed for 2 days with no ill effects.  On the third day, after taking the pills, I had acute abdominal pain that felt like my abdomen was being constricted (like a really bad, stitch over a greater surface area). I initially attributed it to being unable to adequately chew my meal but avoided medication thereafter. Tonight, however, (day 5) I took the medication again to deal with residual pain and awoke in the middle of the night to the same severe, constricting abdominal pain that made breathing laborious but was located primarily below the chest area in the abdomen.  It subsided after pacing around for a half hour, having something to eat and a drink of water... I cant help but think this must be related to the medication, despite having taken it for the first few days with no effects of this nature. Any advice would be very much appreciated.\n\n",

By the way, many oral surgeons recommend the use of a tea bag (soaked in cold water with the excess water squeezed out) and applied where tooth extractions have been done after the initial use of gauze. The tea has a natural anesthetic and actually works exceptionally well in alleviating pain  Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "content": "My sister told me about a new weight loss supplement called  Woman\u2019s Ultra Slim.  I was wondering is you could give me some advice about it, I know that the best way to lose weight is just to exercise and eat well but maybe this supplement will help to enhance my metabolism.  The website is  http://www.instatrim.com/homepage/tour1.php and it says that the ingrediants used are green tea extract & citrus aurantium.  Please help with this or let me know what is safe to use to increase my metabolism or a way to increase it.  Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "There is no supplement that will burn fat; you have to do that yourself through excercise.  These \"supplements\" are nothing but caffeine (green tea) and other stimulants.  They are not proven safe, in fact dangerous with certain health conditions.    Between regular aerobic excercise and eating SMALL (nutritious) meals 4-5 times per day, you will speed your metabolism.  If you don't eat enough, you will slow it down and make losing weight difficult to impossibe.  Don't waste your money on these things, balanced diet and excercise are healthy, free and work forever.\n\n",

Does anyone know if there are any studies or findings that show any adverse effects from taking this medication for an extended period of time?  If you've had an upper GI, and it showed no ulcers or other damage, and you continue to have acid reflux, is it safe to continue taking prilosec indefinately?  The doctors have given me a few things to do to help with the acid reflux (elevate the head of my bed, lose some weight, watch what I eat, etc), all of which I have done or am working on....but in the meantime, I'm concerned about continuing the medication.

I read that sometimes small changes in stomach cells have been seen. But I would think it would be better then the possibility of esophageal cancer which is a very aggressive cancer due to changes in the esophagus from chronic acid reflux. If you are overweight, that would be the first step to take. Being overweight causes excess pressure on the stomach that causes reflux into the esophagus. If you have really bad acid reflux and medicines do not help there are surgeries out there that can help correct the problem. One of the doctors responded to this same question the next page over. Check it out. Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 58 year old woman with an unnamed \"platelet problem.\"  I hemorrhaged after surgery, requiring a blood transfusion, and nobody has every been able to figure out why this happened, except that I was taking vitamin E at the time.  I bruise easily and have a history of heavy, long periods, and bloody noses.  I also have IBS.  Two years ago, I developed high blood pressure and was given Maxcide.  Within a week, I had developed a huge bruise on my arm and was bleeding with bowel movements.  The gastroenterologist did a colonoscopy at that time, and all that was found was some internal hemorrhoids.    Since my BP was marginally high, I stopped taking the Maxcide, wasn't prescribed another medication for the BP, and didn't have any more bleeding.  Occult blood tests have been negative.    Now my BP is clearly high, I've developed mild aortic insufficiency, and I need medication.  I took Toprol XL, but developed really bad diarrhea, amongst other things.  So I was switched to Norvasc.  I continued to experience loose, frequent bowel movements, and within two weeks of taking it, I began bleeding rectally again.  The bleeding this time is heavier than with the Maxcide.  Although I've stopped taking the Norvasc (it's been a week) and the gastroenterologist called in a suppository, I continue to bleed.  Can this be thrombocytopenia brought on by the Norvasc?    Thanks for any insights.\n\n",

I have not found in any research of this particular medication that it actually induces thrombocytopenia. My question for you since this seems to be a long standing problem, have you been referred to a hematologist to identify the cause of the platelet dysfuction? If not, I would suggest an evaluation by this specialist to identify the anomaly. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "content": "Hi RNTDJ,  You know, I did go to a hematologist a couple of years ago, after my hemmorhage.  he did a lot of tests, but couldn't come up with a name for what I have.  I was taking estrogen at the time, so they couldn't be sure about Von Willebrand's.  The best the doc could do was say that it's obvious to him I must have something wrong with my platelets; he couldn't give it a name.    At the time of my hemmorhage, I was taking both vitamin E and Verapamil.  I have since discovered that abnormal bleeding and bruising are listed as side effects for the Verapamil.    Since Amlodipine is also a CCC, it seemed logical to me that it might be the culprit this time, so I did extensive searches on the web.  I came up with a few items supporting the possibility.  The Norvasc website lists thrombocytopenia as occurring in .1% of patients taking Norvasc.  A February 2001 article in Evidence-Based Gastroenterology, volume 2 (1) is titled \"Calcium Channel Blockers and Hospitalization for Gastrointestinal Bleeding,\" and describes a study which associates CCCs with a significant risk for GI tract bleeding.  Finally, there's an article entitled \"severe thrombocytopenia associated with amlodipine treatment,\" by Usalan et al. in Annals (of )Pharmacotherapy, 1999; 33: 1126-1127.  I couldn't access it online since I don't have a subscription.  I think you're right.  Maybe I do need to return to the hematologist to ask for guidance in how to handle what may be a problem with all the BP drugs, since I clearly had the problem with Maxcide and Verapamil and maybe, now, Amlodipine.

    "content": "I was started on Topamax (100 mg daily, titrated up slowly from 25 mg) to deal with chronic daily migraines about two months ago and I've been ridiculously emotionally labile over the past few weeks - crying for little/no reason, frustrated at nothing, and deeply depressed (I've dealt with a major depressive disorder and serious anxiety in the past) for little to no reason that I can ascertain.  It's starting to seriously impinge on my relationships with friends and family and my life... I'm wondering if it's possible that Topamax might have something to do with it.  I've looked it up but haven't found any research on whether it's correlated with psychiatric problems as well as cognitive - especially not at as low a dose as mine(fortunately my cognitive function is just fine).  Not having migraines every day is a wonderful thing - I don't want to stop taking it if it's not going to make any difference to my affect - especially since it takes an entire month to titrate back up to an effective dosage.  But if it is to blame for making me this miserable I want it out of my system... Any thoughts on whether it could be?  Thanks...\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Neugebaj,  Topamax can cause either side effect but very rarely.  From your profile, i found out that you were prescribed estrace at the same time and actually estrace can cause hypertension in patients as some kind of an allergic reaction but was not found to be a consistent side effect in the major clinical trials.  To diagnose hypertension, blood pressure should be found to be high on at least 3 different occasions during the same week.  Please, check your blood pressure on 3 different days during the same week and if found to be high, contact your doctor about this and see what he/she has to say.  i am not in a position to tell you to stop the topamax or the estrace but you can call your doctor and ask if this can be done.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.  Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

In most people, they quickly add up to too many carbs (they contain a little more than 1/2 the carbs than an equal amount of table sugar.) Because of U.S. labeling laws, products containing sugar alcohols (as well as other simple sugars such as fructose, lactose, maltodextrin, isomalt, etc.) can be labeled \"Sugar Free.\"  Sugar alcohols available in the U.S. include Mannitol, Sorbitol, Xylitol, Maltitol, Maltitol Syrup, as well as hydrogenated starch hydrolysates, are found naturally in berries, apples, plums and other foods. They also are produced commercially from carbohydrates such as sucrose, glucose and starch.  Hope that answers your question.\n\n",

We took him to the pediatrician on Monday for his 5year old check up and they said he was getting another ear infection.  (he also had a fever of 99.1 and started a loose cough 5 days prior)  Augmentin was prescribed.  When we went to get the prescription, the pharmacist said he was concerned with the dosage:  600mg-2 tsp in am and 2 tsp in pm- for a total of 2400mg a day.   He said that this was higher than the adult max dosage.  He called the doctor and they confirmed this dosage.  We are concerned about this.  TRuthfully, I am giving him less than 2 tsp each time.  I feel a little guilty about it, but after 3 days, his cough is basically gone.  I feel that the doctors just wanted to knock this out of him once and for all and that is why they gave such a high dose.  Am I doing a bad thing by reducing the dosage to 1 tsp or 1 1/2 tsp each time?   thanks Jenny\n\n",

So the dosage prescribed is slightly higher than normal. My suggestion would be just make sure that all the medication is taken until finished. Another suggestion, if the ear infections continue to recur, inquire about a referral to an ENT specialist. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

For almost 2 years I have been to my doctor, other doctors, eye doctors, have been on various medications and have had numerous tests all unconclusive.   I have pressure that seems to be behind my eyes and in my forehead constantly.  I feel light-headed, off balance, nauseous (but not vomiting).  Every day I have to fight with my eyes.  My eyes get a \"pull\" to them.  Once my eyes just voluntarily crossed but when I looked in the mirror my eyes were facing straight.  Just a couple of days ago I looked at something to the right of me and both my eyes pulled.  This happens alot and I try to close my eyes and breathe but it doesn't help much.  I am afraid to move my eyes because I can feel it coming on.  Sometimes I get blurred vision all the way around my pupil, then my eyes feel pressure.  This always last anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour and sometimes more than once a day.  I always feel a headache but more so before and especially after my eyes do that.  I also get headaches after I eat.  Right now I feel a faintness with pressure in my eyes and head.   I have had an MRI, cat scan, have been on migraine medication (which only made me feel worse), ulcer, blood and allergy tests, my eyes were dialated as well as other tests and medications. The only diagnosis that came over the last 2 years is my cholesterol and sugar is a little high. At this point I don't know what kind of physician or treatment to seek. Thank you.\n\n",

I took the MRI exray scans to a Nuerologist and my doctor...nothing.  My doctor sent me to have my sinuses exrayed...nothing.  I didn't do to an ENT surgeon because the exray of my sinuses showed nothing and my doctor doesn't think it is necessary especially after the MRI and CAT scans.  I had my eyes dialated through an optometrist.  He saw nothing that could be causing my symptoms.  He suggested I am having opticular migraines but I don't feel that is the answer.  Stress was suggested but I do not feel stressed or depressed and I am not overly anxious.  My doctor already tried Xanax and Buspar and Meclizine-maybe-all that medicine just made me sleepy and didn't help anything else.  I do not feel normal.  I feel like a guinea pig with no answers.  I don't know what other doctor to see.  I heard that no matter what kind of doctor you go to...you'll leave having something that doctor specializes in.   When I was 14 or so I had the operation for scoliosis.  I have harrington rods, wires and pins in my back and my spine was fused (lower back).  Could this have anything to do with my symptoms?  For over 20 years I have only had lower back pain and muscle tightness but nothing else.\n\n",

    "content": "For the average healthy adult, the maximum recommended dose of acetaminophen over a 24 hour period is four grams (4000 mg). In recommended doses, acetaminophen is quite safe to use. Acetaminophen is toxic to the liver in high doses; a single dose of 7 to 10 grams of acetaminophen can cause liver damage in the average healthy adult.   It seems that certain individuals are more prone than others to develop acetaminophen-induced liver damage. Doses as low as 3 to 4 grams in a single dose or 4 to 6 grams over 24 hours have been reported to cause severe liver injury, sometimes even resulting in death. People who drink alcohol regularly appear to be especially susceptible to acetaminophen liver damage. Therefore, a person who drinks more than two alcoholic beverages per day should not take more than two grams of acetaminophen (equivalent to four extra strength tablets) over 24 hours.  Please stick to the recommended doses. Consult your doctor to prescribe a different pain killer if you feel your dose is insufficient for your pain. Thank you.\n\n",

    "title": "Bad Reaction To Doxepin HCL",
    "content": "Hello. I recently received a prescription for Sinequan (Doxepin) from a gastroenterologist after undergoing an EGD upper GI. The results for that test were negative, although I have been taking Protonix for the last 5 months for continual bloated/upset feeling stomach and heartburn. I have been diagnosed by my family doctor with GERD. I am also hypothyroid and have been taking levothyroxine 50 mcg for the past couple months.  Anyway, my stomach has not been feeling better even with the Protonix. That's why my family doctor ordered the EGD test. Like I said it came back negative. I did not get to speak with the doctor after the test. The attending nurse gave me the prescription for the Sinequan after I awoke from the procedure. I took the drug that night before bedtime as prescribed. Within 20 minutes to 30 minutes, my left side chest felt like someone was stabbing me with a knife. I noticed my heartbeat raiasing and lowering in succession. This all lasted for around 30 minutes and subsided. I did not take the drug again the next day. The following day I decided I'd give it another try and took the pill before bedtime. Same thing happened..........my left chest felt like something was stabbing it and my heartbeat was abnormal (in my opinion).   Now, I would like to tell you that I first started going to my family doctor about 6 months ago with a feeling of tiredness, general feeling of something not being right, heartburn, stomach upset, strange tingles all over my body, hot flashes, lightheadedness, AND A PAIN NEAR THE OUTER PART OF THE LEFT SIDE OF MY CHEST THAT WOULD COME AND GO AND WOULD FLARE-UP AT WILL.  I guess my question is................since you are doctors and you know the \"actions\" of the medications and how they work, isn't there some indication that you can make from my episode with the Doxepin causing my left side chest to hurt so bad and near kill me with pain and relate it to the pre-existing pain I have been having there for so long? I have researched the side effects and the contraindications and the adverse reactions of Doxepin and nowhere does it say anything about severe chest pain. BUT I SURE GOT THEM!! Is it known or can it be surmised that Doxepin can cause an escalation of some certain, underlying condition or injury and make it thirty times worse? My pain was only a 1 - 3 on a normal pain scale but felt like a 12 after taking the Doxepin. Needless to say, I don't take it anymore. I don't even know why I was prescribed that, especially from a gastroenterologist. I haven't had depression or anything like that.   I have had 2 EKG's and multiple blood tests and my doc has ruled out heart problems and MS (tentatively). Those tingles I was getting all over my body subsided when she upped my dose of levothyroxine from 25 mcg to 50 mcg. My level is now in the normal range again. I tried to go without the Protonix and made it just over 2 weeks, but had to go back on it because of heartburn and upset stomach. I just had a bunch of other bloodwork done and all was normal EXCEPT for kidney function indicators. My serum creatine was 2.0 mg/dl. I have to repeat the test and go from there.   Do any of the drugs I'm taking (levothyroxine 50 mcg, Protonix 40 mg, GlycoLax 17 g) damage my kidneys or cause an increase in my serum creatine level?   I posed the same question to my family doc about the Doxepin and the reaction I had with it and whether it could help to pinpoint why the side of my chest hurts. After taking the Doxepin and my chest started killing me, I could not lay on my left side at all because it made it worst. I rode it out for the half hour on my back until it subsided. This happened 2 times with that pill and I really think something could be gained from that experience. It should suggest something to someone. My doc hasn't pinpointed why my left side chest is hurting me, yet. That pain has been there for well over a year now.  Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks so much for the info on Doxepin. I did read the side effects and adverse reactions carefully. I guess it would point to an adverse reaction to the drug with an irregular heart rhythm and chest pain(although not listed precisely). Whatever it was, it was from the drug, just about killed me with pain, and was not normal. I did stop taking it after the second time, notified the doc who told me to quit taking it, too. I will never take it again and I feel I don't need that type of medicine anyway.  I also asked about any drugs I'm taking causeing an increase in measured serum creatinine levels? Mine was 2.0 mg/dl. I did some reasearch on my own, which I do often, and found out from a nurse friend on mine that Protonix can do just that. Right out of the nurses's drug guide book it says under adverse reactions:  GU: elevated serum creatinine level, interstitial nephritis  I gonna stop taking this one, too. I've been on it for about 5 months and from what I've discovered, the normal course of treatment is only 8 weeks with another 8 week course to be considered if healing does not occur or if symptoms persist. If I get stomach problems, I'm gonna stick with the tums or Maalox or something else. I think long term implicattions for this drug are not so good. I'm better to get off of it if I can. I do not understand if my serum creatinine level that was measured is a type of \"false positive' because of the Protonix or if it is an actual measurment in which case could daamage my kidneys if they are not already damaged or damage them more. I don't want that regardless. There is absolutely no reasons for my kidneys to be bad as I do not drink at all and do not have it in my family. At least that's what I think. If they are it's from the drugs or at least one of them.  Thanks for your input.  Tony_Ohio\n\n",

    "content": "I have done a lot of research on the tattoo removal topic! I just recently started scrubbing my tattoo with apricot scrub and then rubbing hydroquinon (2%) over the tattoo. I then cover it with plastic wrap & place an ace bandage over it. I do this 2x a day & wear it all day & while sleeping. I took several digital pics before I started my self-treatment. It does seem to have lightened very little. My question is on all of the \"laser\" information I have found no informationin regards to hydroquinone as a treatment for getting rid of tattoos. However there are a couple of companys with \"fade away\" creams. (which hydroquinone is the active indgredient). Do you know if hydroquinone will over time lighten a tattoo? I know it removes pigmentation so will it remove ink? I am hoping to go to a dermatologist and get a prescription of 7% hydroquinone. Any information you have on this subject is appreciated?\n\n",

Forever in other words. And lots of other medications are the same i think. Also if your grandmother mentioned her concern to the doctor and he still says she should take them even after 11 years, then he probably has a reason. Has he even explained anything to your gran? Or atleast said why she should still be taking them after 11 years?  As for reporting him, i don't know sorry, im not a doctor here on the forum or anything, but i think most of the doctors here are from the USA so they might not know. But i know you can get a number from the phone book of NHS Direct. They have been helpfull to me in the past in telling me where to get a prescription made up after midnight and who to speak to about certain medical issues and stuff like that. They would atleast be able to give you a second opinion on the 11 years and they might say thats normal or confirm that its too long or whatever.  Goodluck.\n\n",

    "title": "head injury",
    "content": "Hello Vxvemovxv,  Anytime a person has a loss of consciousness for over 4-5 minutes, awakes confused and can\u2019t remember what happened it is an emergency. The human brain fits tightly within our skull with a small amount of cerebrospinal fluid flowing around it. If a traumatic brain injury causes the blood vessels to rupture inside the brain or between the brain and skull this causing a pressure to build up within the brain compartment and forces the intracranial pressure to rise, which can cause severe brain damage or death very quickly. Bleeds can happen quickly or slowly over a period of time causing the pressure to build. The brain can\u2019t move and the skull doesn\u2019t expand (unless it\u2019s fractured) in the adult so as the brain swells and herniation takes place, the brain is permanently damaged and the person dies.  She may already be complaining of headache, nausea, may be vomiting, memory loss, blurred vision, neurological problems, seeing spots, difficulty walking, light headed but watch for the following as well.   Seizures or Unresponsiveness - she's already had both of these. Her brain has shown signs of injury right here. She could have permanent damage already. You need to take her to the hospital. Pupil response \u2013 both pupils should respond appropriately to light and at the same rate as each other. If one is unresponsive or doesn\u2019t move as fast as the other or if neither responds appropriately this isn\u2019t good. Level of consciousness \u2013 keep asking her questions like, what time do you think it is, where are you, what happened, what\u2019s your name. See if her answers change or if she can\u2019t remember the answers she gave before. As her brain swells her level of consciousness will change. Respirations \u2013 count her respirations for one minute. If they start getting shallow and fast, this is a sign of possible increasing intracranial pressure. Keep track of all times and numbers for the hospital. Combativeness \u2013 as the brain has pressure put onto it the person becomes combative and their personality changes. Do not let her sleep, keep her awake so you can watch changes in her until she can get to the hospital.  Cerebral hemorrhages kill people every single day, it MUST be recognized as a DEADLY INJURY. I can not overemphasize how important it is to get her to the hospital! Don't let her take aspirin or any more cocaine, this will increase any bleeding. Cocaine is a stimulant, it causes your body temperature to go up, your heart to beat faster and your respirations to become irregular, all which cause your blood vessels to dilate which causes you to bleed faster which means the brain swells faster.   I have skipped over lots of details and symptoms but you get the idea. Thank you so much for being brave enough to ask someone for advice.\n\n",

I can't loose this job because it is me and my wife's only source of income and we are already late on a lot of bills and will be kicked out on to the streets if i can't keep working.  I scheduled an appointment with my doctor.  My question is that if i explain my situation, and ask for his help. Will he give me 3 or 4 days worth of Librium, Methadone, or Ultramine.  Also something to help sleep, for sickness, and anxiety. Or a combination of some of them.  Or will he say that he can't help me.  I only ask because i can't afford to pay for an appointment if he can't help.  Please give me any information about this question or who i should talk to to perscribe me something for at home detox.

I wonder if it is realy true,that the above contraindication (hypocaloric diet) is missing in US ,and if someone knows about a possible background to this?   I know their are many studies suggesting their is only very little ,if any ,risk to LA  with metformin when prescribed  as labeled.   My background to this is that I\u00b4m on a low carb diet since three weeks now , which lowered my BG from over 200 to around 140 now without further medication.  Nevertheless I thing it is to high ,and find strong arguments that I could benefit a lot from  a (maybe low-dose) medication with metformin. This kind of diet and its benefits are not yet very well known over here ,in fact the absolut opposit (eat 60% carbs and low fat) is told to the diabetes patients . I have problems in getting metformin prescribed, for the doctor assumes that the low  carb diet is hypocaloric ,where in fact it is hypercaloric.    Kind Regards, Michael\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Metformin decreases the absorption of carbohydrates through the intestines and it reduces the production of glucose by the liver so if you aren\u2019t consuming enough carbohydrates your body can\u2019t get them and we need carbs to make energy to live. You can see the whole break-down if you look up \"carbohydrate metabolism\" online. Blood and kidney function tests need to be done periodically to make sure the liver and kidneys aren\u2019t being damaged. Metformin is mostly expelled by the kidneys so in some cases LA levels may raise with the use of Metformin (Glucophage) in people whose liver or kidneys aren\u2019t working well, who have multiple medical problems, congestive heart failure or take multiple medications.   Lactic Acid is an acid produced by the cells during a chemical process in the body that does not require much oxygen. It is the result of the breakdown of carbohydrates for energy when the oxygen level in the body is low. Too much lactic acid causes muscle cramps.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Well, I'll try this, we'll find what you need if we keep looking.  Ketones are what are produced when the body breaks down fat for energy; this is converted over in your liver. When your body is producing ketones and using the fat for fuel it is ketosis. Ketones are acidic molecules and your body doesn\u2019t like acid so it dumps it into your blood to be disposed of out your kidneys.   Diabetics can have too much sugar in their blood. This causes the blood to become acidic and ketones to build up causing a condition called Ketoacidosis. This is a very dangerous state to be in. You can use a ketogenic diet to lose fat weight but you need to be monitored by your Health Care Provider and your sugar levels need to be kept stable.  Metformin is excreted through your kidneys; if they aren\u2019t working right or are diseased you will have a build-up of medication, ketones, lactic acidosis and urea in your blood.  Maybe the Physicians Desk Reference has more information in it for you.\n\n",

Now, I had bloodwork at the onset, thyroid, diabeates, liver, cbc, anemia, strep, etc. everything came back normal.  I have been to 2 MD's, an allergist and dermatologist.  The allergest thinks it's a food allergy, the dermatologist thinks, latex, or virus.  Now, I have not been eating anything different or using any different ANYTHING.  For 4 weeks now I have watched everything I eat and seem to get them randomly or not get them whenever I eat food.  Here is what I'm thinking now, I was taking Motrin for about a week and a half to two weeks, for headaches (first week) then toothache (second week).   I have been taking Motrin for many years with never a problem.  However, it was about a week after I finished with it that I started with the finger peeling (1st) , then the hives.   The hives were bad for about 2 weeks, then got better.  I have tried Motrin again, and didn't really notice anything one way or the other, then I tried it a week later and right now it cause what hives I have to get bigger and more to come out.  Now, based on all of this, what is your best guess?  Is the Motrin making them worse, or did I sensitise myself to Motrin?  Also, I can find no info on food allergies causing peeling skin.  Thank you, your help will be greatly appriecated, as I am just about ready to go nuts with this!!\n\n",

A person can ingest a medication fine for years and then all of the sudden begin having reactions to that particular drug. It is my suggestion that if you noticed this particular reaction after taking Motrin, discontinue its use and see if the problem resolves. If it does then you can attribute your reaction to this medication. However, if it does not resolve, continue to follow up with your physician. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

It certainly still sounds like you are having an allergic reaction to something......have you changed any substances, for example, dishwashing liquid, powder, anything that you can think of?

If you don't like the way your medicine is making you feel, tell your Doctor, don't change anything without consulting him/her FIRST.

Your friend was feeling tired from her medications (see below) and is very lucky nothing happened by abruptly stopping her doses. I would not have advised that.  meclizine = histamine receptor blocker(antihistamine) and used to treat nausea, vomiting, vertigo, dizziness associated with motion sickness and purposes other than listed as prescribed by your Physician. May cause drownsiness, dry mouth and rarely, blurred vision. Alcohol, sedatives and tranquilizer can increase the drowsiness of the meclizine.  butalbital = tension or muscular headache treatment. May cause drowsiness, lightheadedness, dizziness, sedation, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, & abdominal pain. Alcohol and other centeral nervous system depressants may produce an added depression and should be avoided.  clomipramine = tricyclic antidepressant used for OCD or as directed by Physician. May cause drowsiness, dizziness, lightheadedness & possible falling. Alcohol and antihistamines may increase drowsiness & dizziness and should be avoided.  BuSpar = anti-anxiety medication or as directed by Physician. May cause drowsiness, fatigue, dry mouth, increase in dreams or nightmares. Alcohol, antidepressants, antihistamines, pain relievers, anxiety medicines and muscle relaxants will increase the effects of drowsiness.  Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Libby, I am sorry to hear about your troubles. I researched your question because Phyche is not my speciality. I had always thought that tardive dystonia and dyskensia was a serious side effect of taking meds not from stoping them. I found a great site and this is what they said. Drug-Induced A large numbers of drugs are capable of causing dystonia. In most cases, people develop an acute dystonic reaction resulting after a one-time exposure. The symptoms are usually transient and may be treated successfully with medications such as Benadryl.   Another type of drug-induced dystonia is called tardive dystonia. Tardive dystonia and tardive dyskinesia are neurologic syndromes caused by exposure to certain drugs, namely a class of medications called neuroleptics which are used to treat psychiatric disorders, some gastric conditions, and certain movement disorders. The amount of exposure to such drugs varies greatly among patients. Tardive dystonias and dyskinesias may also develop as a symptom of prolonged treatment with levodopa in some Parkinson's patients.   Drugs belonging to this class of neuroleptics include: (trade name listed in parenthesis): Acetohenazine (Tindal\u00ae), Amoxapine (Asendin\u00ae), Chlorpromazine (Thorazine\u00ae), Fluphenazine (Permitil\u00ae, Prolixin\u00ae), Haloperidol (Haldol\u00ae). Loxapine (Loxitane\u00ae, Daxolin\u00ae), Mesoridazine (Serentil\u00ae), Metaclopramide (Reglan\u00ae), Molinndone (Lindone\u00ae, Moban\u00ae), Perphanzine (Trilafrom\u00ae or Triavil\u00ae), Piperacetazine (Quide\u00ae), Prochlorperzine (Compazine\u00ae, Combid\u00ae), Promazine (Sparine\u00ae), Promethazine (Phenagran\u00ae), Thiethylperazine (Torecan\u00ae), Thioridazine (Mellaril\u00ae), Thiothixene (Navane\u00ae),Trifluoperazine (Stelazine\u00ae), Triflupromazine (Vesprin\u00ae), and Trimeprazine (Temaril\u00ae).   The term tardive means 'late' to indicate that the condition occurs after drug exposure, and the terms dyskinesia and dystonia describe the types of movements involved. These symptoms may develop after weeks or years of drug exposure. Both tardive dystonia and tardive dyskinesia typically involve (but are not necessarily limited to) the muscles of the face. Symptoms may also include muscle spasms of the neck, trunk, and/or arms.   The movements typical of tardive dystonia are generally slower and more sustained than dyskinesias, though the presence of a dystonic tremor in opposition to the main dystonia movement may cause a more rapid appearance of movement. Dyskinesias are usually characterized by quick, jerking movements that may include grimacing, tongue protrusion, lip smacking, puckering, and eye blinking. The arms, legs, and trunk may also be involved. Movements of the fingers may appear as though the individual is playing an invisible guitar or piano.   Both syndromes can occur simultaneously, and the frequency and pattern of movements may fluctuate. If both syndromes are present, the predominant condition will usually dictate the course of treatment.   The treatment of drug-induced dystonia will usually include a gradual withdrawal from the offending medication. If neuroleptics remain a crucial element of an individual's health, a class of newer, \"atypical\" neuroleptics (such as clozapine, olanzapine, and quetiapine) may be a suitable substitute. Anticholinergics (such as trihexyphenidyl and benztropine) and muscle relaxers used to treat other forms of dystonia may also be helpful. Baclofen and clonazepam are also sometimes used to treat tardive dystonia. Botulinum toxin injections to a particular muscle group are an additional option for treatment.   Like the treatment of tardive dystonia, the treatment of tardive dyskinesia is very specific to the individual patient. The first step may be to gradually minimize or discontinue the use of the offending medication. Substitute drugs may be recommended to replace neuroleptics. Other drugs such as benzodiazepines, adrenergic antagonists, and dopamine agonists may also be beneficial.   Researchers have yet to fully understand the causes and subsequent treatments of tardive dystonia and tardive dyskinesia. In many cases, discontinuing or lowering the dose of the causative drug will ease symptoms. In some cases, the symptoms will persist after use of the drug has been terminated but with careful management, symptoms may improve and/or disappear with time.   The National Institutes of Neurological Disorders and Stroke conducts and supports a broad range of research on movement disorders including tardive dystonias and dyskinesias. The National Institute of Mental Health is similarly committed to preventing further cases of drug-induced movement disorders in individuals who benefit from neuroleptic treatment.

    "content": "I know you asked about this in January but I'm going to answer you just incase you still are wondering about HGH - First of all, real hGH is Human Growth Hormone produced by the pituitary gland located in the center of the brain, it is made up of amino acids. hGH secretion peaks during adolescence stimulating our bodies to grow and than slows down as we age but we still get some of it while we sleep. I don't know a lot about hGH, an Endocrinologist could really give you the details about it but I'm sure that isn't what your talking about anyway, you want to know about the tablets, right?  Your answer would depend upon where you get your supply from. Lab created HGH is made from all kinds of sources - animal gland extract (YUCK), ground up antlers, homeopathic ingredients, synthetic ingredients, impure pharmaceuticals, fake junk, amino acids and stuff I don't even know exists. Basically, the smell, color and taste will depend upon what is in the capsule, tablet or liquid. If you are going to be taking supplements on your own, you need to make sure it doesn't have anything added that is going to hurt you or mix with medications you may already be taking causing an adverse reaction. I would advise guidance through a Nutritionalist or Physician who is knowledgeable in natural medicine to review the product before taking it, especially if you order it from somewhere. There are some REALLY WEIRD things out there (like bull testicle juice and worse). A lot of our prescription drugs are products of herbs, if you start mixing herbs together it could really hurt you and they aren't being controlled by anyone, just be careful.\n\n",

Ketoconazole may cause fatal liver damage. There is a risk of developing hepatitis  if given for longer than 14 days. I do not prescribe this drug.  Because these two drugs affect liver function, it is advisable not to combine them. From your post, it would appear that the diagnosis of intestinal candidiasis was not made by a physician.

The baseline was normal a few months before I started taking colchicine .6mg twice a day and 2g of Acetyl-l-carnitine daily.  Now it is 60 and 80 for the two tests, above the high end of the normal range but not twice the high end.  My dilema is this...the colchicine or ALC is helping me maintain use of my hands and feet comfortably.  But am I destroying my liver in the process?  My primary care doc says 2-3x is \"acceptable\" levels of elevated liver enzymes.  What does this mean?  I have read that it is common for colchicine to cause elevated liver enzymes.  Does that mean the levels don't mean damage is being done?  Do you think lowering the dose will help?  I see it says you need to drink 3 quarts of water daily with it which I haven't - could that help?  What will happen to me if I stay on the drug and have elevated enzymes like this?\n\n",

However, keep in mind that you may want to try drinking plenty of water (as you should already be doing) to help the kidneys excrete the metabolites from the medication as well as the excess uric acid. You should be following a low purine diet. Recommended foods are high in complex carbohydrates (fiber-rich whole grains, fruits, and vegetables) low in protein (15% of calories and sources should be soy, lean meats, or poultry) no more than 30% of calories in fat (with only 10% animal fats). If you follow the above suggestions and your liver enzymes would continue to increase (as they should be closely monitored) then there would be more concern. I hope this information is helpful.

I am now drinking lots of water and am discussing reducing the dose but am not sure if my condition will be stable with a lower dose.  So my question still is this...if enzymes are elevated but not over 2x the high end, is this not serious damage to worry about or given time will this cause me serious problems?  And now that I am drinking significantly more water, is this going to help lower the enzymes in the liver or just prevent kidney problems (which were fine so far in my tests).    Thanks.  I am just torn between a debilitating disease and damaging my liver - neither is a pleasant option.\n\n",

The water intake should help with clearing the metabolites from this medication so you may want to have your ALT repeated after a short period of time to see if the levels are lower.

As long as levels are closely monitored and they are not significantly out of range and acceptable by both you and your doctor then it would be appropriate treatment. Again my apologies for the misunderstanding. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

What does this mean, is this condition dangerous or is it normal for extremely active athletic person? I am planning to make rest one mont from taking GH MAX releaser, but I must continue with protein powder (RealGains - Universal Nutrition) and multivitamin because they are the essential nutrients.  II) I never took steroid hormones before, but I've heard that many athletes use Deca-Durabolin (Nandrolone decanoate) to strenghten joints, and that it increases fluid flow to joints and connective tissue. Is this true? I know that there are many risks and side effects of steroid hormones, and that they are illegar in some countries for usage in sports, are legal in my country. As a doctor would you suggest me some minimal dosage of deca or other potant substance to heal my joints or not? Or will HGH or IGF-1 help me?  I've heard that there is natural IGF-1 extract from New Zealand Velvet Antler, is it effective in raising IGF levels really? Can it help strengthen my connective tissue?  I've tried every single, and combination of supplements for strengthening connective tissue and joint support, but, no one helped me. I followed the instruction, doctor advices, how long to take, tried different products, but none of them helped. I have general connective tissue laxity, and I eat very good quality food, take suppleents (proteins, vitamins...).\n\n",

    "title": "Damaged Liver & Pancreas with a UA on Opiates & Meth",
    "content": "I was diagnosed with acute Pancreatitis in March, 1992. This condition went from acute to chronic, and as a result I developed Type II Diabetes in 2001. My sugars generally run between 125-175. Sometimes they are a little higher or lower depending on my diet. I have Glyburide 10mg tablets if necesary.  OKAY, my question is kind of long so please bear with me.  Basically my doctor and my gastroenterologist want me to have a partial pancreatectomy. They say that my pancreas is just burned out and my enzymes (amylase and lypase) always look normal. But I still have that same excruciating Pancreatitis pain and nasea. In the past my enzymes always  skyrocketed out of control. But considering I have had pancreatitis for 13 plus years, this is somewhat the norm my doctor's say. Also, my liver enzymes have been a little high. Now, the way my doctors are treating my condition is with pain meds. I have been in and out of the hospital for those 13 plus years and they always give me Demoral or Diladid and Phenergan.  Either in shots or PCA pump. And I probably have been admitted into the hospital 200 times, plus another 200-300 ER trips, and 99% of those times I was given 2-5 shots of Demerol or Duiladid. When I go home, they always give Percocets. Then about a year ago they began prescribing me Methadone and percocets. My dose quickly went up and up. I now take 40 mg of methadone, 3 times a day and usually a couple of percocets, too. Last month, I ran out of my pain meds 4-5 days before my next visit to my doc to get my medication refills. During that time the pain in my stomach spiralled out of control, and I started withdrawing from the Methadone, as well. Anyway, I went to the ER the night before my normal doctor's appointment. They gave me a couple of pain shots; specifically, 2 shots of Toradol 30mg and one Reglan 10 mg shot and a 4 mg dose of Zofran. This was kind of unusual. The following morning, I went to my regular doctor, whom I have a narcotics contrct with, and she gave me a UA (urinary analysis). I have never had any probems with them because I do not use any illegal drugs and I take my medication. Every now and then I may run a couple days short. Usually this no BIG DEAL. MY doctor told me that my UA came back with no narcotics in my system and that makes me look like I am not taking my medications. Even though at 11:30 pm the previous evening they had given me several pain shots at the ER. My appointment with my doctor was at 8:00 am the next morning---8 and 1/2 hours after my last pain shot in the ER.   FINALLY, my question.  Is it possible that my damaged liver and pancreas may shorten the duration that an opiate or methadone stays in my system; specifically, my urine?  I know that Methadone's 1/2 life is 8-10 days and the last dose I took was 5-6 days prior and the last Endocet I too was 1 to 1-1/2 days before my UA. Now my doctor (and the rest of the doctors at the clinic, I'm sure) are  threatening to take me off my pain meds, even though they know how much I need them, and that alone will kill me. It will send me to the ER every other damn day, too. Please help, I am awaiting my SSI & Disability, so I have NO health coverage. Please help ASAP, as I need an answer prior to 2/10/05 at 7:00 a.m.---EST. I have another appointment with my doctor at 8:30 a.m. on 2/10/05. I do have the medical records from the ER visit the night before I took that last UA. Thanks. Bill\n\n",

    "content": "Methadone's half life elimination is between 15 to 29 hours. It requires hepatic metabolism. It is excreted in urine 10% unchanged and the rest in the metabolised form. The time to steady state is 5-7 days. Drugs administered at fixed intervals or by continuous infusion will accumulate in the body until steady state is achieved.   Methadone can be detected in urine for 2-4 days after adminstration.  Please note that just because your enzymes are high does not imply that your liver metabolism of drugs is significantly affected. You must first establish through other tests that your liver function is indeed affected.  I think a better option for your pain would be celiac ganglion blockade. Please discuss this option with your physician.\n\n",

And they worked great for me for a short period of time.  Now, as for the Methadone, my Doctor seems pretty insistent that it will remain in my urine for 7-10 days after administration. And the last dose I took before my UA was two days before the test. Thank you for your response. Bill\n\n",

    "content": "Hi wmblank1, Generally speaking, according to the typical drug detection clearance time charts that I'm familiar with, the minimum time for methadone is 2 hours and the maximum is 2-6 days. Chronic use of high potency drugs by individuals will place the clearance periods at the higher range. No drug test, regarless of method (urine, saliva, blood, etc. except for forensic hair analysis, can determine the exact amount of time a drug has been in the system thats the reason for the broad estimates in range. I can understand your frustration on the amount of time it takes to have posts answered and I will respond to you as I have to others in the past. Please keep in mind that not one post on this forum is any more or less important than another and they are answered to the best of everyones ability. I do hope this was somewhat helpful. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "content": "Thank You Nurse Rntdj and everyone else. Well, it happened just as I thought. They booted me from the clinic, so I have nothing to control my pain after my two week supply runs dry. They said that I did not have any Methadone nor Opiates in my Urine, even though I was given 4 doses of 4mg diladid 8-10 hours prior to my UA. I had the evidence in my hand, and they didn't even want to see it. So I suppose I have to have the partial pancreatectomy. They know how sick I am without the meds, but yet they do thisw to cover their butts. I'll try to get another physician, but I have never gotten meds like these anywhere else. How do you go about getting the dose you were on from another doctor? I may also consult an attorney. How can they just stop prescribing you a medication so powerful (120mg Methadone a day plus four 5/325mg Percocets a day ), just with the snap of their finger when you've been on it for over a year with no other problems? I'm scared because I'm first going to feel the brutal, chronic pain of pancreatitis. But it doesn't end their because I'll be throwing up and nausiated; then, I'll start going through a terrible withdrawel that could possibly kill me. The combination of everything I mentioned is enough to want to shoot myself and end it all. That's no joke, either.\n\n",

A doctor wrote him a prescription for pain killers (hydrocodone).  He filled the prescription as well as the allowed 3 refills.  He feels he needs more medication (I don't think he's really abusing them, he's just in a lot of pain.)  He says he's going to call the doctor and say that he never used the prescription the doctor wrote a few months ago - that he lost it.  He feels it would be easier than asking the doctor to write another prescription and have to explain why he's using so much of the medication.  So, if my friend tells the doctor that he never filled the prescription, will the doctor know that this is untrue?  I think the doctor would know.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Yorker,  Not only am I a registered nurse student, I am a former pharmacy technician. I can tell you that the your friend is taking a huge risk of possible criminal charges if he decides to take the step of being dishonest about his Rx. All pharmacies keep the hard copy of prescriptions filed away. If your friend used the Rx, but says he lost it, all the doctor needs to do is call the pharmacy to see if the script was filled there. Not to mention that Hydrocodone is a controlled drug. I am sure that the doctor would be suspicious from the get go if your friend tries to do this. So tell your friend that honesty is the best option. If he is still having pain and needs a refill tell the doctor. It is not worth getting caught up in the lie. Charges for fraud related to prescription drugs can be very serious. Trust me, I have been there when many customers have been caught. And suprisingly most of time if was for Hydrocodone!

    "content": "Hello Leslie, The potential toxicities of cough and cold medicines vary with their composition. Many products contain multiple substances including a decongestant, cough suppressant, antihistamine, and/or antipyretic/analgesic. Pseudoephedrine and PPA are sympathomimetics that reduce nasal congestion by stimulating the -andrenergic receptors on vascular smooth muscles. Clinical toxicity presents with central nervous system (CNS) stimulation, hypertension, and tachycardia with ephedrine or pseudoephedrine ingestion, and bradycardia with PPA ingestion.10-12 CNS stimulation can manifest as extreme agitation, restlessness, insomnia, psychosis, and seizures.   I would suggest using a product that does not contain Pseudoephedrine or PPA. Some people are more sensitive than others. I hope it helps.\n\n",

Generally speaking, these are not in sufficiently high enough amounts as in oral antibiotics to change the normal flora of the stomach which is what activates the birth control pills. In my opinion and to my knowledge, it would not make the pill less effective but if this is a concern for you use additional methods of birth control until you complete your current regimen.

The hospital said I could never take penicillin again or I would be in trouble! Next time I needed anti-biotics my doctor said the only one that would be safe would be Erythromycin. I was so ill on this he told me to stop taking it two daysinto the course. I am now in need of another course of antbiotics for a tooth abcess and the doctor said I would be ok on Cefalexin as it had no penicillin in it, BUT I have done a search on this and there is always a warning that if you have had a reaction to amoxicillin then you should avoid the cephalosporins. I am now terrified of taking the first tablet - should I go back to the doctor and ask for something else? Is there anybody else in the same boat who could tell me what alternative to penicillin they have taken without a reaction. I don't want to die!\n\n",

You are correct in what you researched with the warning to avoid cephalosporins if you have an allergy to penicillin. For example, I have a penicillin allergy and I can take erythromycin, tetracycline, zithromax, etc. but just because I can take them (safely so far) the next person, since everyones body is different, may not be able to take one of those. I hope that makes sense. I would suggest you contact your physician and request a different medication since there are available medications that are not in the penicillin drug class.

It's completely unlike his normal body odor. It comes and goes, staying sometimes for months and sometimes for just a few days.

It just makes me more nervous and aggitated, so I decided to stop taking it.  I didn't take Cipralex for 3 days now, and I sure feel a bit better. Not that tense anymore. Although I feel better, my depression is still lurking underneath the surface. Is it \"OK\" to stop taking this medicine this abrupt ? What are the risks ? Should I ask for another antidepressant ? If so, which one ?  I read that stop taking older depressants like Prozac this abruptly could be dangerous.  Ps. I stopped taking Sobril and Mogadon aswell, my doctor said that this was OK, i sleep fine and after I stopped taking Cipralex 3 days ago, my nervousness went away aswell.  Thanks in advance !\n\n",

Anti-depressants should be tapered off slowly and not stopped \"cold turkey\". It would be difficult to say which anti-depreesant would be the best for you since what works well for one person may not be effective for another. It is sort of a trial and error method to find the best one, depending on the symptoms of the person and exactly what is needed for better mental health. I would suggest that you contact your doctor, tell him/her that this particular medication has not been helpful and see what other options are available. I hope this helps.  Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

About 1 year ago she found what she calls a \"miracle\" given to her by her doctor. it is called a medrol dose pack or also known as methylprednisolone pak. It come in this package and you are supposed to take 6 pills on the first day, 5 the next, 4 the next and so on until you finish. Well it was prescribed because she gets chronic bronchitis from smoking and then cries to the doctor that she wont be able to sing. so he gave it to her and said her voice would come back. So her voice came back like never before and she loves it! Now she wants it all the time and he gives her tons of refills on it. She doesnt even take it the way it was prescribed. she will have sometimes 3 on a day she sings and if she realy loses her voice she will have 6 on another day and then just stop and take some more a few days later when she needs to sing again. How can this be right? Im looking online for info on this drug and cannot find stories on anyone who has done what she is doing. I think she might be the first. Also what are the dangers. I can honestly tell you she has gone through over 15 paks in 2004 alone! Please help and by the way...i need to show her some evidence of what she is doing is wrong cause she refuses to listen. she says it not bad because her doctors says they are only 4mgs each and she only takes a little as needed.

Methadone does not give the same high as heroin does, so sometimes people  take other substances to get high. Though it is not true of all patients - some patients stay very clean on methadone. The symptoms a person might have will depend on the type of substance they are abusing. You might be able to tell if someone is abusing cocaine if they have 'rabit-like movements', are very confident, talk rapidly and have enlarged pupils (if they are high) and alternately fatigued and sleep for long periods if they are using a lot. They might also be low during the comedown.\n\n",

Lately, I have been breaking out in hives in the morning after getting out of bed.  I have to end up taking benedryl but it makes me very sleepy.  I went off my 5 mg prozac for 3 days thinking it maybe could be that.  I'm still breaking out .. We had a problem with wet/soaked carpet in our bedroom about 3 weeks ago, and the repairmen noted they put some sort of anti bacterial agent on the rug after air drying it for 2 days..  I'm wondering if i should ask them whats in it ? It seems every time I sleep in my bedroom i wake up like this.. If I sleep in another room it doesnt happen.  I washed all the blankets, sheets etc but I still broke out.. One morning my lower lip was swollen, so I am concerned.   I've never heard of breaking out from meds a person has taken for years, but then it could be stress related too.  HELP !  I need some advice !\n\n",

I thought that when I grow older I will also grow out of my silly complex which I cannot change...however Im turning 23 next month and Im still really self conscious about my height. i don't leave the house without really high heels although I know that they are bad for my back and knees.  so i am really desperate try one of these products but at the same time Im worried that they are plain liars who want to steal peoples money. In fact I read a website which says that there is no product that can change ones height and if a website claims that they can then they are mostly likely liars who want to steal money.  The site also says that many people have complained that after the product they purchased didnt work, the company didnt keep its \"money back guarantee\" promise.  here is the website:  shortsupport.org  I am hoping that this website is not completely true and that there are some products out there which can help me.  only 2 inches would do wonders for me.  i wouldnt have to wear heels that much anymore and i would be so much more confident about myself.  so can any doctor help me and perhaps tell me that if a product contains such and such ingredient then it might work but if they don't contain a certain ingredient, the company is lying?  can anyone give me any hope or is my case hopeless?    thanks in advance...

If you are concerned about her addictive personality and the possibility of her actually being addicted to the prescription medications, make a telephone call to her doctor and discuss your concerns with him/her about your mom. You may want to also ask about any sort of physical therapy and pain control clinics. As for the rehab, I'm afraid that this is something that she would have to first admit that she has a problem with and be agreeable to entering , otherwise it probably will not work. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Dr. Thanks for answering my questions with patience earlier. My father is 68 yrs old , He is scheduled to hv a bone marrow biopsy next week cause his Hb and platelets are goin down very fast. His current platelet count is 28000,  monocytes 51 ( doctors say it could be myelodysplastic syndrome).he has undergone angioplasty last month and was on plavix and aspirin. The doctors hv stopped aspirin adn plaviz since 26th sep (4 days).  He is experiencing severe pain at the medial borderof scapula since last 1 1/2 month, we took him to ER  on 25 th sep and the doctors ruled out heart abnormality. His cervical spine x ray show densities at the level of C3, C4 AND C5, Sir what do u think this is causing. Is it the spread of leukemia or is is artritis by its own. He has next appointment with the primary care physician on 14th and teh discharging doctor told me to ask the primary care physician  for CT scan or MRI.  Don't you think it is going to be too late. or do we need to take some action soon, the doctors don't do any thing soon. My question is does Tylenol decreases the platelet count?  My father is hesisitant to take TYlenol , even though the doctors hv told him that he can take 2 tabs every 6 hrs. can u tell me how much dose can he take in 24 hrs. Thanks\n\n",

    "title": "Question about the Mesalamine family",
    "content": "I am taking 400mg Asacol for Chron's disease. When I was first prescribed it in 2001, I had asked the pharmacy to give me the generic. Well, I wasn't told at the time there wasn't a generic but was given Mesalamine instead of Asacol, which lead me to believe it was the generic. I had insurance at the time under my ex-husband and paid about $20-30 dollars for about 180 pills. Then about a year and a half later, I had my own insurance, a different doctor and received another prescription for Asacol and I actually got Asacol and not Mesalamine. That was when I was told there wasn't a generic for Asacol but doubted the Pharmacist because I still thought Mesalamine was generic. Again it cost me about $30 and since my insurance was new I didn't think it was picking up part of the cost if any on the prescription. Well now I don't have insurance anymore since I moved out of state and have learned that Asacol is extremely high! Considering I'm suppose to take 2 pills 3 times a day. Well after doing some research on the internet tonight, I found out that Asacol, Pentasa, Rowasa and Mesalamine are all basically the same medication. My question is how do they vary in their effectiveness and price? Or is there any difference at all? With no insurance, I can't afford to take Asacol as it's prescribed to me, 6 pills a day, so I usually take 1 a day or sometimes 1 every other day or so; and I can only get the prescription for 10-20 at a time. The only other medication for my Crohn's that I've taken is Sulfasalazine and it doesn't work at all or if it does it isn't very effective. What other options are there for Crohn's other than the Mesalamine family and the Sulfasalazine. I saw a website about Remicaide but figured it would be to costly.\n\n",

Fluid buildup (effusion) from blood, infection, or joint fluid (synovial fluid).  It is possible that this is a herniation of the synovium. You need to go to your doctor as diagnosis and treatment are usually very simple. Even in the event that surgery should be required this is usually accomplished quite easily with endoscopy (arthroscopy) using microscopic techniques.\n\n",

She was admitted on Monday with suspected inflamation of the ovaries and told she would need to stay in hospital for 10 days.  I felt that this was rather strange as I would have expected a course of antibiotics or something similar to be prescribed and a hospital checkup after a few days.  As it is, and although she has felt fine since Wednesday, she is being given anything up to 12 various injections per day (she has not been told what they are for) and has today informed me that she is also being treated for \"blood stagnation\" by having blood drawn from her arm and then injected into her buttocks.  Apart from the fact that she tells me it is very painful, this strikes me as rather barbaric and I cannot see what possible benefit there could be.  I am also extremely concerned that the procedure may actually be detrimental to her health.  I have voiced my concerns to her but she tells me that many of the women on her ward are being given this same treatment.  Could someone please advise?\n\n",

I know that oral antibiotics can make oral contraceptives not work...but do topical antibiotics do the same? Here's my story. I'm taking Yasmin for my oral contraceptive...I take it correctly AT THE SAME TIME every day (10:00 PM sharp). But recently my doctor prescribed me a topical antibiotic called Clindamycin 1% Gel to clear up my skin. I apply a thin layer every morning and wash it off at night. So far it has been working great; my skin has cleared up some. BUT, I worry that it might reduce the effectiveness of the birth control pill. I mean, small amounts of the topical antibiotic are absorbed by the skin and get into the bloodstream, I'm assuming. Anyway, this is driving me insane. PLEASE answer my question.\n\n",

    "content": "DHEA or dehydroepiandrosterone as you probably know is a precursor to testosterone. The risks associated with taking this drug are not clear as the safety and efficacy profiles have not been clearly established in clinical trails. As any steroid hormone, they interact with other hormones in the body including the body's own DHEA, insulin, estrogen and many others.  All the advice I can tell you is that like most of the above hormones when taken as replacement, it is better if they are not stopped abruptly. That usually results in a major disruption of body's hormonal system. So tapering the dose over a period of time is better. I don't recommend you continue taking DHEA for long periods I also see no basis for your intake of clomid. Please visit an endocrinologist as soon as possible.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Although there is an interaction between these drugs, it is not contraindicated to take both together. Topamax decreases the levels of ethinyl estradiol in blood by speading up the breakdown of the hormone in the body. Thus popular low-dose combined oral contraceptive pill which has a relatively small amount of estrogen (less than 35 micrograms) will not be enough to protect you becoming pregnant. You may need contraceptive pills with higher doses of estrogen, and even then, there is a risk of unexpected pregnancy. It is a good idea to use barrier methods (a diaphragm, spermicidal cream or a condom) in addition to the contraceptive pill.  Best regards,\n\n",

If you do not get your period within five days of taking the last active pill, check with your doctor or healthcare professional to be sure that you are not pregnant. Treatment should begin within the first 24 hours of your period. If you do not start the birth control pills within the first 24 hours of your period, you should use non-hormonal back-up contraception for the first 7-14 days of use.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Rara4444,  i don't have that much experience with people who use clenbuterol but i think that the best way to go is 2 weeks on and 2 weeks off.  Since clenbuterol acts on beta receptors, it is going to have side effects of all supplements that contain ephedra.  These might include: - Tachycardia. - Nervouseness. - Elevated blood pressure. - Headache. - Flushing. - Sweating. - Tremors. - Inability to sleep.  You have to watch for these side effects and it is not a bad idea to tell your doctor that you are going to be taking this supplement so that he may take a look at you before you start taking clen.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello DjHnd,   The main active ingredient in the supplement you bought is Yohimbe.   Yohimbe is a tree bark containing a variety of pharmacologically active chemicals. It is marketed in a number of products for body building and \"enchanced male performance.\" Serious adverse effects, including renal failure, seizures and death, have been reported to FDA with products containing yohimbe and are currently under investigation.  The major identified alkaloid in yohimbe is yohimbine, a chemical that causes vasodilation, thereby lowering blood pressure. Yohimbine is also a prescription drug in the United States. Side effects are well recognized and may include central nervous system stimulation that causes anxiety attacks. At high doses, yohimbine is a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor. MAO inhibitors can cause serious adverse effects when taken concomitantly with tyramine-containing foods (e.g., liver, cheeses, red wine) or with over-the-counter (OTC) products containing phenylpropanolamine, such as nasal decongestants and diet aids. Individuals taking yohimbe should be warned to rigorously avoid these foods and OTC products because of the increased likelihood of adverse effects.  Yohimbe should also be avoided by individuals with hypotension (low blood pressure), diabetes, and heart, liver or kidney disease. Symptoms of overdosage include weakness and nervous stimulation followed by paralysis, fatigue, stomach disorders, and ultimately death.\n\n",

Recently, the doctor has increase the dosage of the antibiotics.  Its a cloxacillin 250mg, and it has to be taken 4 times a day , 2 tablets each time, and it has to be taken for a month before our next appointment. My grandmother is 76 years old, I am wondering if there is such a need to take the long course of antibiotic. I've checked the net and most has stated that antibiotic should only be taken if there's infection, otherwise, only daily dressings are needed.  I am not sure if taking such a long course may be detrimental to my grandmother's health. Any input is greatly appreciated.\n\n",

And another medicine call glibenclamide 5 mg, 2 times a day, 2 tablets each. Both medicine is prescribed to control her sugar level for the purpose of faster wound healing.  I am not sure what is our next course of action. The doctor has mentioned that we are able to go for a body checkup to see if there's liver damage or other illness that may be caused by the medicine.  This worries us, as we sure do not hope that a leg ulcer would lead to bigger problems due to unnecessary use of antibiotics due to her age and condition. Kindly please advice us on our next move, whether to continue the medication.  Thanks a lot for the advice, it really helps.\n\n",

    "content": "Diabetic ulcers are very dangerous especially if they appear in the leg. The fear stems from their ability to progress to systemic infection or gangrene.  Culture-based antibiotic therapy is cost-effective. Indications for hospitalization and intravenous antibiotics include progressive cellulitis, lack of response to oral therapy, systemic signs of infection, abscess formation, or osteomyelitis. Becaplermin, a topical gel containing recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor, has been approved by the FDA as an adjunctive therapy for diabetic ulcers.   During this period she should be placed on insulin and her blood glucose control should be optimal.  If the ulcer fails to heal, the diagnosis should be reevaluated. A biopsy may be necessary to exclude unusual causes of ulceration. In addition, it may be helpful to test for antinuclear and anticardiolipin antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, protein C, protein S, antithrombin III, cryofibrinogen, cryoglobulins, factor V Leiden, and rheumatoid factor.   Taking long periods of the same antibiotic will be associated with complications especially in diabetics. Maybe you should take your grandmother for a second opinion to another diabetologist.\n\n",

Actually we've seen 3 doctors. 1 GP, an orthopaedic, and now we seeing another gp in a govt hospital. They did not refer us to any specialist in the current hospital.  The ulcer is located at her buttock area, and it was caused by burn before this. Most of them has mention that its not that serious, but i am not so sure. They are sign of improvements, but the process has been slow. I am not too sure where else to go as most does the same thing, that is to clean the wound everyday till it recovers. But i have been going back to the 1st GP for 2nd opinion all this while, and she is the one that mention that there's improvement, as she was the first to see her, and recommend that we continue our current treatment.  The only thing i'm worried about at the moment is the use of prolong antibiotics. I'll refer to her again on wednesday, if its not too late. Or should I go and look for a diabetologist for another opinion?   I havent seen any such specialist at the moment in my country (Malaysia), should I go look for it?  I have seen the wound, it does heal, but its pretty slow. Should there be any sign that I should monitor?

It's usually related to the menstrual cycle. It's so bad she just lays on the bed and can't do anything. It's so bad she vomits because of the pain. The only thing that helps is cafergot. It helps cooling down the migraine, but this stuff is really bad. The next day after taking it, her hands, face and feet are swollen and she feels like a wreck. She tried diffrent medicine, but this is the only stuff that is strong enough to temper the migraine.  All this makes me worry. The damage that the migraine and the cafergot does to her. My mother is at the age of 47 now, so the risk of heart attacks and stuff like that is something to keep in mind. Is there any alternative to this medicine that works? Is there any treatment possible for migraine this bad?  Just how bad is this Cafergot medicine? Or am i worrying for nothing?  Thanks in advance,  -Dick The Netherlands\n\n",

    "content": "Bluesman, I am sorry to hear about your mother's condition. You are right to worry about your mother especially that she is approaching that age where the risk of stroke and coronary heart disease is higher. That is why this medicine is usually not used in the elderly or those with an increased risk of developing ischemic disease.  Since she is approaching that age she needs to make sure that her weight,  cholesterol levels and all other risk factors are under control. I would suggest that you discuss these issues with her neurologist. He would also be the best to suggest which alternative drug to take if a change is necessary. Of particular importance is the swelling she has after taking the cafergot. Cafergot is usually associated with localized edema but not a generalized swelling.\n\n",

I recently purchased a refill, and the pharmacist said they had changed distributors so the pills were a different shape. When she opened the pill bottle she noticed a bad odor. It smells like kerosene or gasoline. I called and he said the whole bottle smelled the same but it was not out of date and not to worry about it. I guess I need reassurance that its okay for her to take the medicine. Thank you for your advice.\n\n",

    "content": "Phentermine is one of the prescription drugs approved by the FDA for weight loss. These drugs are not magic pills, they don't work unless you make dietary and exercise changes. FDA approved the drugs only for use with calorie-restricted diets.  Phentermine should be used only for a few weeks. Also, these drugs should be used only in people who are obese--not people looking to lose a few pounds.  One reason for using these drugs for a limited period is that the drugs are addictive and have the potential for abuse. Another is that the drugs have serious side effects, including high blood pressure and sleep disturbances. Also, certain drugs are not advised for people with certain medical conditions, such as phentermine for people with heart disease or high blood pressure, and fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine for people taking certain anti-depressants.

    "content": "Dear Reagan,  Phenergan is a medication that has many action.  It can cause some tissue irritation sometimes. Where is it that you feel the numbness and pain in your leg exactly? Is it at the same spot that you had the injection or at some other place? Is the pain and numbness getting better or worse or the same?  i can not really tell whether this is secondary to have hit a small nerve or not. But if a nerve is damaged and its covering sheath (the one required for its regeneration) is permanently damaged, regeneration is possible but the time frame is unpredictable.  You might be having a small hematoma at the site of infection, but after more than a month, i think it would have been gone. May be what you are suffering from is something different the onset of which concided with the injection.  i guess your leg, has to be examined since you are still having the same problem for over a month.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

It has curtailed activities for me, and I cannot walk briskly, run, or jump without experiencing excruciating pain. Pain worsens at night.  I am positive it is linked with the injection of Phenergan.  What can I do to help nerves regenerate? What are possibilities for me?  Thanks, Vicki\n\n",

    "content": "Ecstasy (party pill) is known as 3,4-METHYLENE-DIOXYMETAMPHETAMINE (\u201cMDMA\u201d). It can be traced in urine and blood. It is commonly sampled in urine and has a half life of 6-8hrs. That would mean that there will be less than 1% remaining in your body at 72 hours.   However, this is only one step of the calculation as far as how long MDMA is detectable in urine. MDMA is metabolized into a variety of other molecules including HMMA, MDA, and HMA. Respectively these have half-lives of approximately 11, 25, and 37 hours. MDA triggers the standard Amphetamine urine test, while MDMA itself will trigger a Methamphetamine urine test. We don't have any information about whether HMMA or HMA metabolites will trigger the amphetamine/methamphetamine test in a urinalysis and whether the quantities present from MDMA metabolism are sufficient for such a trigger.  There are also many factors which go into determining how long a substances is detectable in urine. The specific metabolism of the person being tested, the amount and frequency used, the method of administration, fluid intake, amount of exercise, etc.  Traditional urine tests are somewhat unreliable at detecting MDMA use with an Amphetamine test, but there are several new test designs out which are supposed to be quite a bit more reliable.   At this point and to conclude this discussion it is believed that MDMA is detectable for approximately the same duration as Amphetamine/Methamphetamine (3 days average, up to 5 days with heavy frequent use), but there hasn't been conclusive data on this.\n\n",

If they contain other drugs then each drug would be detected seperately and each of these would have its own half life and method of analysis. However, i haven't heard of any such combination drugs.\n\n",

However, if you do not remember the missed dose until the next day, take the missed dose at that time and reschedule your every-other-day doses from then. It is important that this vaccine be taken exactly as directed so it can give you the most protection against typhoid fever. Typhoid vaccine must be stored in the refrigerator at a temperature between 2 and 8 C (35.6 and 46.4 F) at all times. If the vaccine is left at room temperature, it will lose its effectiveness. Therefore, remember to replace unused vaccine in the refrigerator between doses.\n\n",

I have been bleeding off and on for the last two weeks (but I'm not scheduled to start my period for 2 more days).  Sometimes I could classify the bleeding as \"spotting\", but other times it has been quite heavy (with small clots).  Is this bleeding normal ( I know spotting can occur when beginning bcp's) or could the herbal supplements I am taking be clashing with the bcp's somehow?  Should I contact my regular gynocoligist?

    "title": "Re: Sarcoidosis",
    "content": "Dear Emad,  Sarcoidosis is a disease of unknown cause that causes small inflammatory growths called granulomas mainly in the lungs and the lymph nodes of the lungs but it involves other areas as well.  Its course is variable, it can range from being an asymptomatic disease with spontaneous resolution to progressive disease with lots of complications ending sometimes in death.  The lungs are the most commonly affected organs.  Diagnosis of sarcoidosis relies on clinical picture and other investigations. The main invetigation used is chest and thoracic imaging mainly by x-rays and ct scans. There are many blood tests that could be used but none of them has proven to be either highly sensitive or specific. The ultimate diagnostic tool is a biopsy of the affected place to look for the granulomas that the disease produces.   If the clinical picture or the chest x-rays are so typical, some doctors think that a biopsy is not needed to estabilsh diagnosis.  Treatment of sarcoidosis is usually carried out by using steroids, other medications include methotrexate and hydroxychloroquine.

    "content": "Chere Francine,  There are pain medications that you can take that do not cause stomach problem. Or you can make sure to take your pain pills that cause you stomach problems after you eat.  Some of the medications that don't cause stomach problems are over the counter and some of them are prescription medications that you will have to see your doctor for in order to get them.  The over the counter is mainly tylenol. The  prsecription medications begin with newer generations pain relievers and ending with narctoics.  There are other local treatments as well that you can apply to the affected joint.  Also, special exercises directed at strenghtening the muscles around the affected joints will make it easier to use those joints with less pain.

I was asked to take one before lunch and another before dinner. I was told by people that after having Xenical, i would have oily stools and fat *leaking* without me even knowing it. That freaked me out. So it has been 2 months now, and i have not even started taking them. Should I take them (bearing in mind the fact that i have a BMI of 29 - not sure whether or not thats severe)? Would everyone using Xenical be suffering from the aforementioned side effects?

    "title": "Re: Xenical",
    "content": "Dear Darren,  Thank you very much for using our website.  Orlistat or xenical is a drug that is being used recently to help obese patients lose weight and then maintain their weight. It has to be given in addition to a low fat diet.  Your body mass index according to the information that you procided is 28.6 kg/m2. You are not obese, you are overweight but towards the high side of being overweight. Have you tried any thing else to help you lose weight like dieting or exercising?  If you don't have any other diseases such as diabetes or hypertension or high cholesterol, then there is no indication for xenical till you become obese. It is indicated in patients with body mass index > 30 kg/m2 or body mass index > 27 kg/m2 in the presence of the above mentioned conditions.  This drug works by making the body not absorb fat, and in the clinical studies it caused primarily gastrointestinal symptoms including oily stools, oily spotting and increased flatus and defecation. During the studies, about 9% of the patients taking orlistat stopped taking it because of these side effects. Not every body developed the side effects and not everybody who developed these side effects stopped taking the drug as the side effects were not so severe in their case.  In your case, if you want to take the drug, you can start taking it and see if you develop any of these side effects, if you develop side effects and if those side effects are so severe you can stop taking the drug.  Once more, thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "I was given a penicillin injection in the upper left leg many years ago, after that I returned to the hospital complaining about my pain in that leg, they sent me away 3 times, then a few days later I went to get out of bed in the morning and couldn't stand, my baby was crying and all I could do is ask my young child to make the bottle for him, it took me forever to get to the phone to call for help, I was admitted to the hospital, crying out for pain killers the staff did nothing, about a half an hour of waiting and crying they watched and my legs filled with welts and bruises. For a week I was in that hospital, my legs covered in bruises and welts, my arms covered in sores, I saw so many student doctors and had photos taken as well as a scraping of a sore off my hand, for 5 days I couldn't walk, I asked repeatedly if I had a penicillin allergy and no one would answer me. So now I say that I do, as I'm not going to take that chance again, but often wonder if I was given the wrong medication. Since that day I have had pain in my left knee, it was only in winter or when it rained, now today 20 years on the pain is constant, with no relief. X ray shows nothing and have an appointment at the Orthopaedic Prince Charles Hospital. I am a young 48 years old and yet at times when I try to stand up I feel like I'm 80. Could this be a penicillin allergy and why would my knee hurt so much, what effect would it have had on my knee?\n\n",

    "content": "I received nothing from the hospital when I left as I said before they took photos of my legs, took scrapping off my hand and had so many student doctors come through looking at me, poking me and asking questions the only thing that was discussed on my release was if I would return after the weekend so more student doctors could see me, they never gave me a straight answer to my question. It was though I was a item to be looked at, I felt like I was used the whole time I was there, in the end they decided that there was no point in me coming back after the weekend as the bruising and welts were fading....I was no use to them any more.  Since then I've always told my GP that I am allergic to penicillin and they accept that, only ever complained about the pain in the knee, only one GP has ever made a comment that it sounded like I was given the wrong medication.  For me it was a troubled time, children services took my children as I was taken to hospital, my husband was too lazy to stay home a look after the 3 children and because they had chickenpox they were placed in the children's hospital....I could not walk at all and no one could tell me why or if I would ever again....I had no family living close.....btw the children were returned to me on release.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi!  I am not aware of a penicillin allergy of 20 years ago to affect chronically on the knee joint like you have right now. It is true that medical patients are put on display for study so that the young doctors can get to learn. Getting treated in a teaching hospital entails the patient to such submissions, which are not always pleasant experiences. But for the cause of disseminating knowledge and skill to a future generation, such methods become inevitable. But 20 years later, today, the patient's rights have been overhauled in such a way that only the least discomfort would the patient be put to in order to teach young doctors.  When was the last x-ray of your knee taken, and what are your current medications? What is the opinion of your last orthopedician as to your ailment?  bill\n\n",

Since then I've lived with the slight pain that I did have, but through the years it has been worse and now unbearable. I take 1 Celebrex a day with meals, but been strange on them, not sure if it was a bug I picked up last week, was at work and suddenly I got the cold sweats, dizzy, felt sick in the tummy, my doctor said to hold back on the meds till I was rid of the bug. My doctor only sent me for a x-ray, no blood test, even when I asked him what can be done, he said nothing, I said so I'm expected to live with the pain and he said yes. The X-ray showed the bones with a good gap between them so doesn't that rule out Osteoarthritis?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi!  Yes, I suppose the x-ray finding does rule out osteoarthritis. So, if the doctors you consulted were not orthopedicians, why don't you consult an orthopedician or a rheumatologist? And it would be deemed bad practice for any doctor to have lend such a remark to a patient implying having to live with pain for the rest of the life. With the medicines at hand, no patient today should have to make the choice to live with pain. Highly intense cancer pains have been harnessed by present-day medicines, and I am sure that with the right tailored dosage and combinations of medicines, your pain would also be relieved. I am sure you will be able to find a pain clinic nearby to consult regarding this.  But during which, we need also to find a suitable 'diagnosis' for your ailment. You might want to discuss arthrocentesis or arthroscopy with your orthopedician to find that out.  Have you been regularly exercising your knee?  bill\n\n",

After about 2 or 3 days on the med I started having my headaches more frequently, and  now I am getting between 8 and 12 of these a day.

    "content": "About a year ago I discovered that I am allergic to Ibuprofen and Aspirin. Whenever I take either of these drugs or anything containing them (Alka-Seltzer contains enough aspirin to cause the symptoms) my sinuses clog up and I develop all the symptoms of a bad cold. The symptoms usually last for about 5 hours then disappear completely. I can eliminate the symptoms earlier if I take an antihistamine. I have also successfully prevented myself from getting the symptoms in the first place by taking the antihistamine along with the ibuprofen.  This combination takes care of whatever reason I took the ibuprofen, but I get really relaxed so I cannot drive or do anything that requires keen senses.  You might tell me to use Tylenol instead of ibuprofen or aspirin, but Tylenol has absolutely no effect on a headache for me.  Thankfully I do not get many headaches, and do not have much need for pain killers. I am planning to see my doctor about this, but it would be interesting to get other opinions too.  Thanks  FW\n\n",

Apparently Kynoselen (containing adenosine monophosphate also known as AMP) may have the potential to modulate parathyroid hormone receptors, this may ultimately inhibit osteoblast differentiation (at least in vitro).

    "content": "My question is about how medications are absorbed in a patient that has had RNY Gastric Bypass surgery.  Since there is a malabsorption of calories and vitamins and minerals are there also medications that would not work well for these patients as well. Keep in mind that with this surgery Y-shaped section of the small intestine is attached to the pouch to allow food to bypass the lower stomach, the duodenum , and the first portion of the jejunum. This bypass reduces the amount of calories and nutrients the body absorbs. There is very minimal digestive juices in the pouch. Should meds be taken differently for people that have had this done or does it depen on the medication that is being taken and how it is absorbed in the body?  If it depends on the medication I would be asking about Aderall and other stimulants used to treat Narcolepsy and Sonata and other sleeping medications.\n\n",

    "content": "Bypass operations are designed to reduce your capacity for eating and the absorption of nutrients. Typical problems seen in bypass surgery include fat malabsorption and food intolerances. It makes sense that if your nutrients aren't absorbed well, there is a possibility that medications may not be as well-absorbed as they would without bypass surgery.   Medication may need to be altered in terms of dosage or administration if possible (e.g. IM alternatives). Most of the times the doses will have to be altered according to the response of the patient since there is no way of telling how much is being absorbed. The only person that can do this is your doctor.  Best regards\n\n",

It's just after 2 to 3 days I have to take a whole pill, because the itching gets unbearable. I've seen my doctor, and he seems clueless.  And I'm seeing an allergist who seem just to want to wait it out. Easy for him to say. But I'm almost positive the tetanus vaccination did it, although my allergist doesn't seem to think so. But is there any way to speed the process of ridding the tetanus shot in my system? I've also been taking zrytec, but that only seems to help the itching.\n\n",

If symptoms worsen you will need to take more aggressive steroid regimens and other types of aggressive therapy which ofcourse carry with them more side effects. As you said earlier theoretically it could have been the tetanus vaccine that started it. It has nothing to do with the vaccine being in the body system. Its already long gone by now. The fact is that the vaccine \"turns a switch on\" to an immune process that lasts in the body for as long as it takes. Steroids help reduce the duration of this process as well as the symptoms.  If anyone else can add to this I would be grateful.\n\n",

    "content": "Grapefruit juice should not be taken with Atorvastatin (lipitor) as it may increase the serum concentrations of atorvastatin. Usually there are no or few problems that arise from lipitor \"toxicity\". There is probably nothing to worry about from one such event.   However, the increased serum concentrations may in rare occasions lead to an increased risk of rhamdomyolysis and myophathy (muscle degeneration diseases). Atorvastatin has been associated with liver problems.  Things to do: report any symptoms to your physician at once. get a serum liver functions test, kidney funtion test (if your doctor sees a necessity for it).  You can check this page at The Doctor's Lounge for more info on lipitor  Click here!  Regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Missed contraceptive pills guidelines:  1. If less than 12 hours late taking the pill  take the pill as soon as you remember. Take the next pill at the usual time next day. Additional contraception is not required.  2. If more than 12 hours late taking the pill  if a patient is taking the combined oral contraceptive pill and is more than 12 or more hours late then the pill may not work. The patient should continue normal pill taking as soon as possible. Additional contraception (e.g. condom) will be needed for the next seven days. If less than 7 pills are left in the current packet (or if using everyday (ED) pills, less than 7 active pills) then start the next packet without a 7 day break (or if using ED pills, without taking the 7 inactive pills)  I think you should use additional contraception as well as continue your regular intake of pills if you are taking the combined form. If the bleeding continues you should consult your physician.\n\n",

    "content": "mjs, There is no telling if the drug is better or worse. Theoretically they should be the same but that is usually not the case. The problem with generic drugs is that they don't go through the same rigorous testing by FDA as the original patented drug. The second problem is that the generic drug producer is not obligated to give full disclosure of testing and trail data regarding the copy drugs development. This allows the developers of the generic the opportunity to not report or hold back information that could require more intensive testing or slow the approval process by not reporting negative data to the federal investigators.

    "content": "It depends on several factors:   Long term risks add up for smokers  Most research has failed to show that as the years that you have taken the pill tot up, so the risks to your health increase (over and above any normal increase in conditions such as high blood pressure which occurs as you age).  But some studies have suggested such a risk, especially for smokers. For example, one study found that the risk of stroke among smokers increases with age and duration of use of the pill. Another suggested link is between the pill and cancer of the cervix, although many experts feel that if there is such a link, it is very small and related to other factors too.  The general advice is that smokers should think about stopping the pill after the age of 30, and must change to another method at 35. Looking at it another way, 15 years of accumulated use of the pill should be the absolute maximum for a smoker (and they should stop earlier if they have developed other risk factors from stroke such as high blood pressure). Women who have had an abnormal smear test may choose to stay on the pill but with extra care to look out for cancerous cells.  Women who don't have added risk factors such as these, and who are using modern low dose pills, may chose to continue until they hit the menopause.  There is no connection between how long the pill has been used and fertility problems.  Some women do find that when they stop, it can take some time to conceive. But this is simply because being on the pill has masked problems such as irregular periods, which would otherwise have become apparent much sooner.  Some women conceive within hours of taking their last pill - so if you do stop but are not yet ready to have a child, make sure you give some thought to an alternative method of contraception.The pill masks fertility problems, not causes them  By the way how are those red bumps doing?

I am being tested for arthritis.  The doctor seemed concerned about a possible allergic reaction but was unsure because the symptoms didn't quite display right for that.  I have had hives like this twice before and these appear to be the same (pressure to skin causes them) other than the length of time they have lasted (longer this time).  I was wondering what the typical length of time is when on a medication before you display an allergy to it.  I had one allergic reaction to med before (zoloft) and it displayed within four days.  I would appreciate any information  you can offer me.  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "kansascitygirl, Willbutrin or bupropion may lead to rash in 1-10% of the cases. The period of time and extent of the rash depends on many factors including patient factors (different patients have different immunity) the dose taken, amongst many other things. In most cases however, allergy appears within the first few days.  Some of the causes of urticaria or hives are: (a) Allergens: A large number allergens have been identified as causative agents for some cases of urticaria. It may be noted that urticaria is an individual hypersensitivity and the following factors may not cause urticaria in all urticaria-prone individuals. :: food allergens: Milk, cheese, egg, protein products, wheat, cereals, certain daals as used in India, peas, orange, fish, chicken, etc. Synthetic and natural food additives and artificially-flavored food articles.  (b) Environmental factors: Exposure to pollen, house-dust, buffalo dander, fungi, change in temperature, etc. are known exciting factors. Extreme cold, heat, pressure may also induce urticaria.  (c) Drugs: Man made drugs is the major cause for urticaria, such as antibiotics (Penicillin), anti-inflammatory medicines (aspirin, indomithasin), vaccination and foreign sera, etc. Hormonal preparation, contraceptive pills, etc. Animals treated with penicillin excrete a small amount of it in the milk sufficient to cause urticaria in sensitive individuals.   (d) Infections and infestation: Insect bites, Fungal, protozoal, frequent bacterial Infections (Urinary tract), viral infection (Hepatitis), Helminthiasis (worm infestation, such as round worms), etc. Domestic contact with the pet animals should be examined, which are known factors causing urticaria.  (e) Synthetic products: Use of personal products such as deodorant, perfume, and talcum powder, cosmetic products, animal derivatives, and similar synthetic substances may induce this disorder.   (f) Emotional factors: Especially in chronic, recurring cases of urticaria the role of emotional factors must be examined. Emotional stresses may directly or indirectly make on susceptible to develop a tendency to urticaria. The psychological factors may work as exciting, aggravating or maintaining cause.   (g) Systemic and general disease: Urticaria in some cases may present as a sign of other systemic or general internal disease such as hormonal disorders ( hyperthyroidism ), SLE, polycythaemia, reticuloses. In certain variety of malignancies (cancer) urticaria may present as a precursor.  (h) Idiopathic cause: No list of causation is complete without adding a paragraph of 'Idiopathic' which simply implies causes which are unknown!   Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Julie, Sorry to hear about your recurring ear ache. You should not use penicillin if you were known to be previously allergic to it. You could perform a skin test if you wish to make sure. As for which antibiotic, thats a question i would have to refrain from answering unfortunately, for many reasons. First, Not all cases of ear ache require antibiotics. Even if it is a bacterial infection, is it an infection of the external or middle ear?  Here is a list of antibiotics that can be used with otitis media. You would have to stay away from penicillins and cephalosporins (i.e. you would be left with the sulfa based and macrolides). I would suggest you take your pain killers and consult the nearest physician for proper assessment.  Antibiotics Labeled for the Treatment of Acute Otitis Media  ########################################  Penicillins Amoxicillin Amoxicillin-clavulanate (Augmentin)  Sulfa-based combinations Erythromycin-sulfisoxazole (Pediazole) Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim, Septra)  Macrolide/azalide Azithromycin (Zithromax) Clarithromycin (Biaxin)  Second-generation cephalosporins Cefaclor (Ceclor) Cefprozil (Cefzil) Cefuroxime axetil (Ceftin) Loracarbef (Lorabid)  Third-generation cephalosporins Cefdinir (Omnicef) Cefixime (Suprax) Cefpodoxime proxetil (Vantin) Ceftibuten (Cedax) Ceftriaxone (Rocephin)  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Dr. Majid, Although there are no drug interactions between the two, they both function in the same way as you well know. They both inhibit prostaglandin synthesis. They also both have similar side effects especially they are both known to be associated with the development of peptic ulcer and git bleeding.  Its a well known principle that its always best to use the smallest dose for the shortest duration when it comes to NSAIDs so as to avoid the side effects. Another thing is that there is nothing that two NSAIDs can do that a larger dose of one of them can't do. Meaning that if the patient is not responding well to one of them then maybe you should increase the dose or better yet shift or add a better drug. If they are being used as anaelgesics then you should maybe check the WHO pain management ladder. Although there is some contraversy around this subject it still gives a good idea of how to proceed for many common pain conditions.\n\n",

Its mainly used for the treatment of major depression, OCD, panic disorder and postraumatic stress disorder. Best to consult with a neurologist on this issue.   Best regards,\n\n",

It has been used for lots of things and has been studied for many years.   For diabetics, it was found that it can improve insulin utilization by the cells only if given intravenous. In europe, it is used for control of treatment of the symptoms of neuropathy as it was found that it improves the symptoms of the patients who have diabetes neuropathy.   In my opinion, patients can take it as it has not been associated with major side effects and the side effects that could happen is skin rash. Pregant women should not take it and if the patient is suspected to be thiamine deficient, thiamine deficiency should be corrected before it is given because of major side effects.   If you would like to take it, i suggest that you consult with personal physician to see what he thinks about it.

    "content": "Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for using our website.  Topiramate or tomapax is one of the new antiepileptic medications that have been used for treatment of resistant cases of seizures or epilepsy.  It is being used for other indiactions as well such as migraine headaches, some cases of pain related to nerves, bipolar disorder and eating disorders.   The fda has approved it only for seizures in adults and children after the age of 2 years. All other use is off-label.  One of its side effects is weight loss by causing appetite depression. Other alleged mechanism for weight loss was a diuretic effect (causes losing water like water pills).  In the clinical trials that were conducted on this drug it was found that weight loss was dose related meaning that if the dose is increased, your chances of losing more weight increase. The dose at which they found that more weight loss occurs was 600-1000 mg per day. The weight loss average that was found in most patients was about 7% of the total body weight before starting the medication.   In your case, i think that it depends on how  much weight you lost and the dose that you are taking (you said your doctor increased your dose from 3 to 4 pills), how many mg are you taking a day in total? Your dose getting higher does not necessarily mean that you are going to lose more weight but just that you might lose more weight.   Other side effects: 1. Neurological: dizziness, difficulty concentration and some speech and coordination problems. 2. Kidney stones. 3. Glaucoma.

    "content": "Dear Frank,  Thank you very much for using our website.  Taking both these medications together increases the risk of developing one of the complication of taking pravachol which is muscle damage. This muscle damage releases a certain muscle protein which can precitpitate in the kidneys and cause kidney failure if not readily identified and properly managed. This is a rare complication though. The safest of all the lipid lowering agents of the statin group is actually the medication that you are taking \"pravachol\".   There are certain drugs that increase the level of these medications in the blood and thus predisposes to a higher risk of developing this complication including gemfibrozil although this applies to some of the statins only. So, gemfibrozil does not actually increase the level of pravachol in the blood and thus is a much safer drug than the other statins in combination with gemfibrozil and other medications.  The symptoms that should prompt you to go seek medical attention are muscle pains and aches and may be change in the color of the urine towards the darker color.

After tea, I grabbed a bottle of eye drops - oops . it was Isopto Hyoscine .25%, which is also calle Scopolamine  My right eye has now been dilated for 4 days - is this still within the normal range of side effects?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Warren 747   Isopto Hyoscine or scopolamine eye drops are used primarily by the doctor during an eye exam. There are other uses such as to treat certain eye conditions, including uveitis (inflammation of the uvea, or the central portion of the eye) and posterior synechiae (a potentially blinding eye disorder).  It relaxes the muscles that control the lens and pupil. This prevents the lens from focusing and widens the pupil to allow the doctor to view the interior structures of the eye. Its duration of action can last sometimes uptil one whole week. Ofcourse you must not drive during this period.  Check with your doctor if you should experience pain in the eyes.  He can also save you alot of trouble by giving you an antidote.\n\n",
