    "content": "Hi, I know this is probably stupid but I was fingering a woman last Saturday night and I had a hangnail on my finger from were I had been picking at it.  The area was not bleeding, but of course did hurt if pressure was applied to it and it did burn a little from the contact of her fluids because it was still raw.  So basically I am wondering is this a possible HIV concern or is the likely hood of it so remote that it is not worth a second thought.  Thank you\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Exposure to a blood/body fluid borne pathogen is possible after: - A skin injury such as a needlestick or cut with a sharp object (percuteneous exposure) and - Contact with a mucous membrane(including exposure via sexual intercourse, especially if an ulcer is present or vaginal tissues are injured) or non-intact skin.  The risk of becoming infected from needlestick injuries is better defined than the risk of becoming infected from a mucous membrane exposure (mouth, vagina, or rectum).  When healthcare workers were followed after mucous membrane exposure to HIV, no cases of HIV were identified among those who had been exposed. However, no other explanation for HIV has been found in a few cases where mucous membrane exposure occurred in a healthcare work setting. This has led most experts to believe that the risk of acquiring HIV following a mucous membrane exposure is quite small, but the risk is not zero.  In a healthcare worker who sustains a needlestick injury  with a needle containing blood infected with HBV the chances of aquiring HBV infections is 6 -30%. The risk of HCV and HIV in a similar setting is 1.8 & 0.3 percent, respectively. This implies that 3 people in 1000 who are stuck with a needle containing blood infected with HIV may go on to develop HIV infection.  The risk of aquiring HIV following mucous membrane contact is estimated to be about 0.09%.The risk is perhaps higher for repeated exposures.  Therefore, for a pathogen such as HIV(in a situation where there is no definite answer) i would tend to feel that the concern is worth much more than a second thought! Avoid a similar activity in the future if you happen to have a wound in your fingers!  Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,The HIV Virus is a 'honest' virus in a sense that it spreads only via certain methods of transmission ie via sexual intercourse, through blood or blood products,maternal to foetal transmission and rarely occupational. Exposure to unusually large volume of blood,prolonged contact,and exposure to blood in end stage disease are certain things to be borne in occupational types of spread including direct entry near a large blood vessel.Rare cases following human bites have been reported. Also remember that for transmission to occur the secretion must contain the virus,and in sufficient quantity,and must enter the blood stream.In your case the current activity is not classified as risk behaviour and the chances of transmission are most unlikely and may represent a nil or extremely rare theoretical risk.All the same it would be a good practice like what Dr.Aroon kamath has suggested, to protect your self from any infection when there is local injury.

    "content": "Hello,Oral sex without condom ,inserter or receiver with or without ejaculation need to be tested for chlamydia,gonococcal infections,HIV,HPV,syphilis,Hepatitis Band C.Withdrawl before ejaculation would significantly help in reducing the rate of spread of infection. Presence of gum disease,ulceration,or recent flossing could potentiate infection if organisms are present. HIV virus can get transmitted by unprotected sex even by oral sex but less commonly so. You must know your HIV status since it can help in getting proper treatment,preventing infection to others,and also warding off life threatening infections. The test involves detecting antibodies which generally manifest about 3 weeks after exposure.Almost all people infected would have antibodies by 3 months.Rarest cases take 6months to develop antibodies. If ELISA test is reported negative the person can be told he is free from the disease after the window period.If found positive a repeat is done on the same sample.If it is again positive Western blot is done to confirm.If both are positive it is confirmed. Counselling is most important and pre and post are equally important. Best wishes.\n\n",

I have a raised thin line down the inside of both cheeks, and have been getting thrush like patches,(just 1 or 2 at a time) on the inside of my upper and lower lips.  Also, small red marks, on my legs, and a spot on my lower back, which are freakin me out cause they look like KS.

    "content": "Hello,If the tests were done beyond the window period you must consider yourself negative.This relates to only when you are not in a window period of 3 to 6 months 3 months being the normal window period for most of the population. Rapid testing or traditional ELISA have a high sensitivity and detects the antibodies with an accuracy of over 99%. Thus assuming that you have not engaged in activities that put you to risk to HIV,which may again put you in a window period if ELISA is negative there is virtually no chance that you have HIV and should consider your self HIV negative provided you have used the standard kits for testing. Suppose a person develops symptoms of seroconversion after a recent exposure to HIV,like a flulike illness,can get a viral load test in addition to HIV antibody test. The thrush and other conditions can be treated with ease by your doctor.Do consult your doctor for the same. With my good wishes.Cheers!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Doctor,  Let me describe my case directly. I had unprotected oral sex(mouth-penile for 1 minute only), protected vaginal sex and mutual masturbation with a commercial sex worker in Bangkok 19 weeks back. After that I tested several times:  1. ECLIA test at 6 weeks - negative 2. MEIA test at 9 weeks - negative 3. ECLIA test at 14 weeks - negative 4. Rapid HIV test at 16 weeks-inconclusive (1st and 2nd determinate - positive; 1st and 2nd Double Check - negative)  The nurse told me that she will send one blood sample to Thai Red Cross for NAT test,another sample to another lab for ELISA test and it will take 2 weeks to get the result. She also asked me to repeat the ELISA test after 2 weeks each time for 6 weeks. Next day, I also did another test (MEIA) at another hospital which came back negative. Report showed that detection of HIV-1 and HIV-2(including Group O) by MEIA method is 100% sensitive. NAT and 1st ELISA test came back negative. I gave blood for the 2nd ELISA test and I am waiting for the result.  However, I started having SWOLLEN NECK LYMPH NODES after 13 weeks (as diagnosed by an ENT). I had swelling just below my left jaw. It stayed for 10 days and then went away for a week after taking antibiotics as prescribed by the doctor for sinusitis. Again, it came back and lasted for a week or so. Then I was well for 15 days until recently I started having swollen lymph nodes behind my left ear and below my left jaw. I am concerned whether these are symptoms of HIV infection, because I have heard that people have ARS symptoms within 2 to 6 weeks not after 13 weeks and the symptoms are not recurrent. I do not have any other physical condition like flu or rashes by date. Can you please tell me about  my symptoms and whether they are HIV related.  Now my questions are:  1. What is the window period for HIV?  Do I need to test so many times for ELSIA or are my 16 weeks NAT negative and 1st ELISA negative considered conclusive and definitive? Do I need to test further?  2. What are my chances of contracting HIV from one minute of unprotected mouth-penile oral sex and protected vaginal sex? Is mutual masturbation safe?  3. Does NAT test by b-DNA method look for both HIV-1 and HIV-2 or just HIV-1? How much reliable is a negative NAT by b-DNA method after 16 weeks?  Please give me your kind suggestions. Sorry for posting a so lengthy. I hope you can understand my current mental status. Looking forward to your reply. Thanking you in advance.  Please help me.Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,Window period in most is 3 months but in extremely rare may be up to 6 months.Since you had taken proper precautions during the genital sex the oral sex part of it would be of low risk. The ELISA tests and the rapid HIV tests are very accurate and a negative result after the window period of 3 months means a negative status and counselled accordingly. Though these tests have higher sensitivity they have a slightly lower specificity in that false positive reactions do occur sometimes with minor other viral infections. If you are reported negative by the rapid tests or ELISA after the window period and did not have any risk behaviour for HIV in this period you should consider youself HIV negative. Confirmatory tests like WesternBlot are done with test showing positive ELISA as a routine. Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I tested positive for HIV antibodies a few weeks ago. After three of four repeat blood tests after (they kept calling and asking me to come in again, \"results were indeterminate\") I've finally been told that I don't have HIV. Despite having HIV antibodies. My doctor said \"it appears you were in contact with HIV at some point\" but was rather vague as to my current condition.  I was somewhat stupefied in the doctor's office after hearing this, so I didn't follow up with enough questions like \"Wtf?\" and \"Might I still have it, albeit in very low concentrations?\" and \"Might the antibody tests have been inaccurate?\"  I didn't even think to get the names of the tests performed.  I read somewhere that people using Acyclovir (which valacyclovir turns into in the body, and I am taking for herpes simplex-1) can set off HIV antibody tests.  I also read that the viral load tests can detect as few as 40 viral copies, and there is a related yes/no test that can detect only one copy. I need to determine which tests have been run. I'm assuming a decent spread, given that I had two vials drawn about four times.  My physician said he wanted another viral load done in six months. Any other tests I can take, or resources to study?  I need as much information as possible. I am abstaining from all sexual interaction for now, but I need to know for a sense of conclusion as well as sexual reasons, am I HIV positive?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,While I am not sure what tests have been done as confirmatory tests.But then your doctor must be right and he knows perfectly well,and you must trust his decision. Do you have an history of exposure of unsafe sex,transfusions,or IV drugs?The history is very important and as to how many weeks had elapsed after the last exposure.This is a general query and would not affect your results. It is possible that a Western Blot Test was done in your case and reported as indeterminate since the bands did not qualify for positive bands. Most indeterminates ultimately turn to be negatives as in your case. Do practise safesex always and do follow up with your physician.Best wishes.\n\n",

For the case that a HIV+ person and a HIV- person have healthy diet habits, practice safe sex and never use drugs, should the HIV+ person have to take any extra advice than a HIV- person against protecting from Hepatitis, beyond the HIV+ immunologic system status?

Afterwords, I had learned that she had been raped about a month prior. I am extremely concerned about contracting HIV, and she refuses to get tested. Do I need to worry, or am I just OCDing?

    "content": "I had an encounter, unprotected one night stand (pulled out though), with a girl on June 7th, 2009. I had asked if she had been tested and she said she was 2 months prior which was obviously negative. I just moved to Colorado from Arizona 2 weeks ago and now I'm sick with flu like symptoms and possible swollen lymphnodes in my neck, located along the eustatian tube just behind my lower jaw. I had a fever of 101.3 at its highest a few days ago with chest congestion and now no fever at all still with minor chest congestion and now stuffy sinuses and a slight night sweat from my neck when I sleep. The area where the lymphnodes feel swollen, I cant say for sure that they are since I don't feel around there much although it is a little sensitive, but the only time I can feel them is if I cock my back, then they pop out slighlty enough for me to feel them. Like I said, not sure if they're actually swollen or if theyre supposed to pop out when you can feel them if you do that, otherwise they're not bulging out of my neck like I see in pictures. I also understand that climate changes and elevation changes can make a person sick too, but my main question is is it likely to develop the 'Flu like symptoms' of hiv 20 weeks after exposure or is it typically within the first 2 - 12 weeks? I havent been tested yet because I'm unsure how Im going to handle a positive test result so Im still trying to prepare myself for the worst. I would just like to walk in to the testing room knowing my odds so Im not a wreck while in the middle of being tested. So is it likely that the 'flu like symptoms' im having now are the symptoms of early hiv infection?\n\n",

The kissing was closed mouth kissing and I believe we may have done minimal open mouth kissing as well, but it didn't involve deep french kissing.   My concern is that I had a gum boil from a root canal that was healing at the time so I don't know if I need to be tested because of this or what I should do.  I don't know if this caused a significant risk or not.  Kissing was the extent of the activity, other than some touching and grabbing of the genital area with our hands.

    "title": "Unusual symptoms",
    "content": "Hello, sorry this is so long...I just wanted to know if it sounds like HIV/AIDS could be behind these symptoms.  Around late September I began experiencing tongue pain, and it appeared that some of my taste buds were inflamed (they were bigger than usual and white, with the surrounding area a little red).  The inflammation has gone down considerably (as has the pain), but small white bumps are still present on the top of my tongue, and the top seems to have a whitish color to it, at least more so than the sides or underneath (and it does not scrape off), and is more red at the tip.  In addition, there are larger red bumps on the back of my tongue, that seem to be somewhat in line.  I've also noticed a few tonsil stones from time to time also.  My tongue seems to get better (normal color with just a few small white bumps) to worse (a generally white color, more coating in the back and some discomfort - sort of a burning sensation) - it seems like it cycles.  Besides this, I have sweat in my sleep a little bit (not enough to change my clothes or sheets, but enough to notice) about 4 or 5 times over these past couple months.  No other symptoms of illness, such as fever, sore throat, swollen lymph nodes, weight loss, loose stools, etc. are present however.  As a side note-a day or two before the tongue problems began, I experienced mouth trauma by accidentally gouging my gum with my fingernail pretty badly.  The wound was infected and turned into a cancer sore, all around the same time as the inflammation of my tongue.  I saw a doctor and he seemed to think it was connected to the mouth trauma. He only told me that it wasn't very impressive and that I should rinse my mouth with salt water (which I haven't done by the way), but that was before I began to entertain the idea of HIV, so I hadn't even thought to ask him.  That was nearly three weeks ago, and yet these small pin size bumps are still here.  I feel fine other than my tongue, and I'm not in a high-risk group for the virus, but I'm still at a loss as to why my tongue hasn't seemed to return to normal, and as to what this is.  It resembles no description of any oral manifestations of HIV or any other disease that I can find.  I would go to the doctor again and explain my fears, but I'm a recent college graduate and I still have no health insurance (and doctors visits are quite expensive), so any advice you could give me would help a lot.  Thanks so much!\n\n",

    "title": "ORAL CAVITY DISEASE AND HIV",
    "content": "Your main complaints are an oral cavity disease and occasional night sweats. You wish to know if these symptoms by themselves are suggestive of HIV disease.  You claim you are not in a high risk group which implies that you have not had blood transfusions, multiple sexual partners, a history of STDs, and intravenous drug use. You also claim not to have any of the major signs of later stage HIV such as weight loss, chronic diarrhoea and prolonged fever.  The mainstay of a diagnosis for HIV disease is a positive blood test. Your mouth disease alone cannot be diagnostic of HIV infection unless the lesion in your mouth is a condition called Oral Hairy Leukoplakia which occurs almost exclusively in HIV-infected persons. In short, Oral Hairy Leukoplakia has not been seen outside of HIV disease.   However, oral cavity diseases are extremely common in HIV disease; especially in those persons with a CD4 cell count less than 300 cells per cmm. The list of oral diseases associated with HIV disease include:  Oral Candidiasis  Oral Hairy Leukoplakia  Kaposi\u2019s Sarcoma  Gingivitis Aphthous Ulceration Intraoral Warts.  HIV-positive patients with these lesions have a high rate of progression to AIDS.  You describe the lesions on your tongue as coated and white. You further state that the whitish coating cannot be scraped off. I shall therefore confine my response to those diseases from the list that can be described as such. The only two from the list that produce a whitish coating are:  Oral Candidiasis (OC) and Oral Hairy Leukoplakia (OHL)  As mentioned earlier, OHL has not been seen outside of HIV disease (very rare cases occur in cancer and organ transplant patients). It appears as vertical, parallel, corrugated, white lines on the sides of the tongue which may be flat or raised.  The lesions cannot be removed by scraping with a tongue blade. It is not troubling to patients and sometimes regresses spontaneously. In your description, you admit that the sides of your tongue have some whitish coating but less so than the top. Your description is unclear,  therefore I cannot comment or confirm. A physician's examination would be helpful.  Oral Candidiasis (OC) occurs very commonly in HIV-infected individuals. Although the presence of OC strongly suggests HIV infection, it can also occur in diabetes mellitus, cancer, pregnancy and in those on broad-spectrum antibiotics and corticosteroids. However, the presence of OC in an HIV-infected person predicts progression to AIDS independent of the CD4 cell count.  OC may appear in 4 different forms: ** tthick white plaques anywhere in the mouth: tongue, buccal mucosa, palate,  gums and pharynx. Unlike OHL, the lesions can be readily scraped off with a tongue blade. ** patchy redness on the hard palate, or smooth areas on the tongue. ** cracking and redness at the corners of the mouth, known as angular cheilitis ** very rarely, non-removable white patches that can be differentiated from OHL by the absence of the typical parallel vertical white lines on the sides of the tongue.  I strongly recommend that you subject yourself to a physician\u2019s examination as definitive diagnosis cannot be made online.  Thank you for contacting our website.

    "content": "Thanks so much for taking the time to address my concerns.  Through my own research I had deducted that of all the oral manifestations of HIV infection, and that the only two that are similar to my own condition are OC and OHL.  However, I should have been more clear because the \"white coating\" on my tongue is NOT present on the sides or underneath.  It stops rather abruptly as it approaches the sides of my tongue, and doesn't resemble any pictures of OHL that I've seen, so I feel confident in ruling that out.  My symptoms don't match any of the 4 types of OC that you've described either; the white area is not made up of plaques (it's more a coating, as you'd see from not brushing your teeth all day), no cracking or redness at the corners of my mouth, and no patchy redness on the hard palette, etc...  In any case, my primary complaint is not the white coating of my tongue, it is the small white bumps on my tongue and the rough/burning sensation that has been with me throughout these past couple of months.  The bumps are pinsized, not immediatly noticable, only present on the top of my tongue, and mostly towards the front.  The rough/burning sensation is elusive and mild, but bothersome nonetheless.  I cannot find any description of any disease that matches my symptom, and that's what is driving me crazy.  I think my question is, what could be going on with me?  Have you ever heard of anything that sounds like my problem, or a symptom of anything that resembles mine?  In the later stages of HIV infection, when T-cell counts drop and opputunistic infections begin, wouldn't an individuals overall health decline?  or could he/she have an isolated symptom like thrush and feel 100percent healthy besides?  And lastly, if my symptom is not an oral cavity disease normally associated with AIDS/HIV, then could it just be a complication of the mouth trauma and infection that I suffered a couple prior to the onset of these symptoms?  I'm sorry to ask so many questions, but none of the answers that I've found seem to explain what I'm going through, they only seem to make more questions.  Thanks again for your help and your time, I really appreciate it more than you know.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello again,  It appears that by your own inspection and self-examination, you are confident that you do not have Oral Hairy Leukoplakia. That should be reassuring to you, because as I stated earlier, the condition appears almost exclusively in HIV disease.   In your previous note, you stated that your doctor commented that the state of your gums and tongue was not impressive. What was his diagnosis? Is your dental hygiene satisfactory? Are you a chronic smoker? Are you on any long term medication?   The descriptions you give of \u201csmall, hardly noticeable, pin-sized white bumps on your tongue and a burning sensation\" are insufficient for any doctor to arrive at a diagnosis. A good history and examination are mandatory, preferably by an oral surgeon, who may decide to conduct some tests. It is unethical to attempt a diagnosis without examination.  As we state on this site, the information we provide is designed to support, not replace, the relationship existing between a site visitor and his/her physician.  I note from your correspondences that you have done an extensive research on HIV disease and viewed several clinical photographs. I am of the opinion that you are very worried of the possibility that your complaints may be HIV-related.  You are right to state that in later stage HIV disease when opportunistic infections develop, an individual\u2019s health will decline to an extent that it is apparent.  In your own case, you maintain that your general health is satisfactory. Since you claim you have no risk factors and are generally in good health, a negative HIV test will be reasuring.  It is not unlikely that you are suffering from a benign condition termed glossodynia. This condition is characterised by burning and pain of the tongue which may occur with or without an inflammation of the tongue. It is associated with diabetes, use of certain medications, tobacco, xerostomia, candidiasis and nutritional deficiencies. Once again, I advise you to consult a physician for diagnosis and reassurance.    Thank you for coming back to our website with your questions.

    "content": "Wow, I'm amazed that someone has the same exact description of their tongue as I do. What the doctor above said seems helpful, but none of those description measure up to what my mouth is like. My tongue gets progressively whiter toward the back. The front of it looks pretty normal, but towards the back of it looks white and frankly as if it is just decaying, because the surface is slightly uneven - that is kind of curdly, I think similar to the protrusions you described - hardly noticeable, except on close inspection. the main thing that stuck me is that you also said towards the back there are red regions that are kind of lined up. It's the same with me. At the very back in the whitest area there are breaches of the whiteness that are red. the difference between you and me is that I have not experienced any pain or soreness. Another very striking thing exists, however. Where my throat and mouth converge, on the sides, where I believe exist some glands (some tissure that bloats out a bit). From that tissue, from time to time comes some solid white stuff. This has been going on for several months continually. Anyways, I'm working on becoming a scientific researcher, partly so that I can do my own research if necessary to find out what in the world is wrong (I've been to doctors over several enigmatic symptoms including these. I know they add up to something, but have no idea what). I don't blame the doctors though, there's a lot of weird things that can go wrong with people. If either the original poster or a doctor comes up with any eurikas I'd be glad to hear about them.\n\n",

I got to the restroom about a minute later where I washed of the entry point with water and then realized I had hand sanitizer and applied that as well.

    "content": "Im a 25 year old female in generally very good health, aside from having chronic Hepititis B (but my latest test results say it's not currently active so no need for antiviral therapy just yet). I have never been sexually active. The Hep B was diagnosed when I was around 5-6yrs old. I just recently got engaged to a man who I found out is HIV+ which was a huge shock. Once things sinked in and I found out that it's still possible to be healthy and happy in this kind of relationship, I realized that I love this man no matter what and want to be with him, but don't know where to turn for help in finding out more info and dealing with my situation. I've done a lot of research on my own already, but still have a lot of questions.   My fiance and I have not had sex yet and I know that using condoms is still the best form of protection against HIV (and we intend to use them), but there's still risks. With him being HIV+  and me with chronic Hep B, if we get infected from each other... what are the possible outcomes? Where can I connect to couples in similar situations? Also, before I found out my fiance is HIV+, I had the Mirena IUD inserted worrying only about unwanted pregnancy, but now I know we must use condoms, but my question is whether or not I should retain the IUD (which I know does not prevent HIV transmition, but at least it could serve as backup anti-pregnancy protection in case the condom breaks).   I've already read up a lot on HIV through the net, but don't always get consistent information. Im not comfortable discussing my current situation with my doctor at this time. Any information or additional helpful resources you could provide for me would be extremely appreciated! I thank you ahead of time for your time, consideration and any help you may provide!\n\n",

    "content": "First let me give you my heartfelt sympathy for the situation you are both in.    Now, you both run a risk to some degree of course by continuing this relationship and going into marriage.  But it sounds as if you are truly in love and will simply face some obstacles most couples do not.  The HIV virus is somewhat more fragile than the HEP B.  Meaning that it has been shown in studies that the Hep B is transmitted more easily than HIV.  By NO means am I telling you that you are not in some kind of danger here.  HIV and HEP B are both transmitted by the same modes.  This means blood and body fluids.    Condoms are probably the very best line of defense you can find at this point to prevent the transmission of either virus during sex.  So by all means use a condom every single time you are active.  As far as the IUD, no need to actually get rid of it.  You can use condoms and the IUD without any problems there.  Of course the risk of the condom is the fact that it CAN break and/or leak if a very small area of the latex is not intact.  This still runs risk of exposure to both viruses.  However, it is much better than no protection at all.  Also even if the HEP B is not really actively affecting you, it can still be transmitted.  Just as the HIV virus.  So be very careful.    Also be aware that this marriage may have to be childless unless you adopt.  Of course please consult a physician on this matter and all you have discussed here.    Debra Van Ness RN\n\n",

Everyone with HIV struggles/fights differently, as does their body, meaning, what happens to one person if he is infected with HepB vs what happens to another is completely up in the air. My honest opinion is that your best bet is to see a doctor who can talk with both of you about this. Obviously, the best thing you can do is use condoms and be careful, and hope for the best. However, something for you to keep in mind (since you have said that you're more worried about your fiance's health than your own) is that contraction of your virus to him is less likely than you being infected with his HIV, since you are female.  Best of luck,  X\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  While neither disease is related directly to HIV/AIDS, almost anything is more likely to show up as AIDS develops and progresses. A compromised immune system, which is what takes place with AIDS, and while mostly infections are the problem there are also autoimmune issues which arise that are peculiar to AIDS or at least seen more often with AIDS. If any autoimmune skin disease or disorder might be attributable  to AIDs it won't show up because of HIV, but having either psoriasis or some other dermatitis is always possible and could happen at any time prior to the development of AIDS, and with or without HIV.   I hope I've clarified this. The two are essentially separate issues that can of course overlap, and anything that can be \"caught\" is more like to be once AIDS has developed. During HIV+ one is still able to develop or contract whatever one might normally. There's no correlation there.  Good luck to you.\n\n",

I immediately went to a sink and washed all the blood of with water (and I think soap but I'm not sure) After washing the condom off I took it off and washed my bare penis with soap and water.

This was about a week ago and it has completely consumed my thoughts since then but Its too early to get accurately tested so I cant do anything about it. I'm so scared.

    "content": "Hello, I would say the risk is not great since you did use a condom.  Of course if she truly was infected; not just at high risk, your risk would be greater too.  But condoms are quite effective at reducing risk so blood on the outside of the condom would not be too risky for you.  It is in the exchange of deep body fluids that infection occurs.  You need to be tested three months after exposure and some prefer to follow up with a test at six months as well since sometimes it takes that long.  Typically, if you're \"clean\" at three months you can mostly relax.  Of course you will have this stress anytime you have sex with someone at risk for HIV so be careful.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello. What can cause bilateral cyst in parotid glands in male?  How LONG does it take to develop such symptoms after an HIV exposure ?  Actually around 2nd November 2008, i ( 24 yrs M) had a haircut in a saloon and had got a cut with their(saloon's) razor.At around 10th NOV 2008, i felt a small swelling near beneath my ear.it was first ignored, but on 19th Nov 08, went to doc. He said it was lymph node enlargement. CT reveals one cyst in each parotid gland. Discrete Jugular lymph nodes swollen in the jugular region bilaterally. Lymph nodes are not palpable from outside.  HIV test was done on 3rd December 2008, found to be negative.  RAPID done on 5th January 2009, found negative.  FNAC negative. Will take a test in mid February 09 again. i am very worried. Please can u tell me what is the cause of this?  Thanks for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  Your concern is understandable, and certain types of bilateral parotid cysts are sometimes associated with HIV, but there are a lot of things that need to be done to clear this up, and the odds, so far, are that this is not the case this time. Here's why: Your potential exposure to HIV (and it's only a slim possibility, statistically) wouldn't have had time to develop clinically yet. While  this casts  some doubt on your initial tests, at least they were negative, which is a plus. Also, you woudn't have had time for HIV, if it were the result of the razor nick, to show itself, so it's hardly been time enough to cause telltale pathologies like the cysts you seem to have. There is also some other lymphadenopathy, which argues some other etiology.  What needs to be done now is to determine if these cysts are actually  papillary cystadenoma lymphomatosum (PCL, or Warthin's tumor, a benign phenomenon); this should be done via bloodwork to study CD4 and CD8 cell counts. A biopsy could, if indicated, rule out HIV. If it's neither of these two things, there are a lot of other infectious processes that can cause this sort of problem. So long as HIV isn't a part of the picture the approach is pretty conservative, although with PCL sometimes the cysts become large enough to warrant surgical removal, which is relatively easy and atraumatic.   The follow up HIV testing will be helpful in determining what needs to be done next, but so long as the razor nick is your only possible source of exposure, this seems extremely unlikely from a statistical angle.   Even if this were the result of HIV, that is no longer the catastrophe it once was, although understandably no one would want to have it. It's definitely unilikely given the facts as presented by you, so try to not lose too much sleep over this, but by all means follow up, since the cysts can eventually become enough of a bother to require removal, IF they are PCL-related. If not, you'll need more lab work done to find out just what is causing this problem with the lymph glands and manage the problem appropriately.  I hope  this is helpful to you. Best of luck to you and please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "thank you very much for your kind advice and the time you have give me.  i took a  RAPID test  again on the 20th of January 2009. it was the 80th day after my presumed exposure. the results were negative. the doctors say that i don't need to worry.  though that was  a little reassuring , just  the day after i had loose motion, but i would like to believe it was due to the  spicy food i have had  since a couple of days. i still feel a little feverish ( sometimes) and have little cough and cold.  and i don't know if it is psychosomatic or not ,i felt a little irritation in my armpit and  groin too. my doctors say , it is due to anxiety and the tension i am in and nothing more.  i have visited a dental surgeon too, he said that the cysts in the parotid glands have no connection with HIV.   my question is , does this have anything to do with serroconversion?   i got tested on my 80th day after the incident, the reports say Negative.  when does serroconversion take place , both minimum and maxmimum time ? is it possible to have serroconversion after the 80th day ?  thank you for all the support and good work and may God bless you all for the dedication and wonderful work that you are doing to relieve people like us.\n\n",

    "content": "I think while you may have something going on (there almost has to be an underlying cause for this), it's apparently not HIV-related, and you'd probably be wise to allow yourself to be comfortable with that finding and start enjoying life again.   The loose movements were very likely due to food you ate, and would be unlikely to be related to anything HIV-related anyway, but you've been emotionally traumatized by the possibility that you might have been exposed and now, even though the evidence is convincing that that's not the case, you're sensitized to things that seem \"wrong.\" It's understandable.  The seroconversion \"window\" is, according to several sources, between 45 and 60 days, so while it's probably technically \"possible\" for it to take place after 80 days, it would seem extremely unlikely and statistically out of the question.   I hope you'll be able to let this go now and move on with your life. There may be some relatively innocent underlying cause for the cysts, but overall it seems the HIV concern has been eliminated. Enjoy that fact.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there --  So sorry this happened. The laboratory standard for statistical certainty for HIV is 90 days. I'm sure there have been variations (most likely due to failure of patients to maintain proper scheduling of lab visits), but at five months or five years the result should be about the same. Beyond three months you're unlikely to get a different or more accurate reading down the road. The homeopath is, as they are wont to do, making judgements and statements unsupported by medical science, which, of course, is the risk inherent in dealing with someone who isn't bound to abide by agreed-upon medical standards.   By now you are most certainly in the clear by any recognized standard.\n\n",

    "content": "At this point you've pretty well eliminated even a remote chance of HIV infection, but you apparently do have some sort of less worrisome infectious process going on somewhere, and it's causing you a lot of worry and has probably escaped diagnosis because so much attention was focused on ruling out HIV. This lesser thing is causing problems, but should be manageable with proper therapy, once it is identified.   No, I think it's safe to say you don't have HIV. Now you need to figure out just what it is that's causing the swollen glands and apthous stomatitis (mouth ulcers). This could be caused by herpes simplex, although usually it's of no known etiology and has to be treated symptomatically. It goes away -- and comes back and goes away again.\n\n",

    "content": "You can't get a much more negative (\"positive\" in common parlance) result than that. I'd say you are pretty much 100% in the clear regarding HIV. That's very good news.  If you've had the ulcers all your lie then you fall into a subset of people unlucky enough to suffer from this really annoying problem, but they at least have no known connection to anything else. They are just a royal pain.  When a cold (or what acts like a cold) becomes chronic it is usually either allergies, a sinus infection, or a combo of the two. Just like apthous ulcers, some people have all the crummy luck and just have these problems for no particular reason, and have to treat them symptomatically. This is the time of year, in the northern hemisphere at least, when both flourish, too, as well as common colds, which can be repetitive due to the almost infinite number of viral strains out there to be shared. Not something to be overly concerned about, just, as with the mouth ulcers, a fairly constant source of annoyance.   Sounds like you are as normal as most of the folks I run into in \"regular\" life. Sneezing, mostly right now. It also sounds like a pretty good kind of annoying. Just stuff. Nothing horrible. Good deal, I'd say!\n\n",

I've read that even in cases where PEPs don't inhibit the transmission of HIV that they can greatly reduce the viral load during the acute phase.  If this is the case, would the fact that I'm taking Truvada increase the likelihood that the HIV antibody test at the 3-week post-exposure mark would return a false negative?  In other words, would a newly infected person taking Truvada  produce detectable amounts of antibodies at a later date than someone who was infected but wasn't taking Truvada?  I'm wondering if I should assign much credit to the results of the 3-week antibody test.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  While I am unaware of any studies which specificlaly address your question,  it does stand to reason that antibodies would become reduced as the viral load is reduced (assuming the virus is even present), so it does become somewhat of a puzzle. Since HIV takes a good six weeks to develop significant antibodies anyway, the early test is essentially a baseline test, so not too much can be taken away from it unless one has already been infected for some time.   The follow up test should be far more telling, so long as the PEP has been discontinued for a few weeks before testing. It's a difficult and anxiety-producing situation at best. Hopefully your follow up test will be negative, and that will be a far more reliable exam.  Good luck to you. Please update us as things unfold.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Waiting time before you can get an accurate HIV test read?",
    "content": "Hello -  Here's the thing about HIV testing: a negative on the first round test may or may not be accurate. A positive is a postive always, so if your first test is negative, statistically it puts you way ahead, although you do still need at least one follow up to be reaonably certain. It takes HIV about 60 days, on average, to cause antibodies to form, so you're more than ready to be tested -- and generally when there's a known exposure the practice is to do one immediately, for a total of three. In your case you've pretty much put yourself at step two already, so by all means get yourself tested at once, since it takes a few days to get the results on these anyway. At this point you may not need the additional test done. Regardless of the result you should know with reasonable certainty at this point. Statistically you're still very unlikely to have contracted HIV, because the virus is so fragile and dies in minutes (or less) when exposed to air. And you're not certain you were even incidentally exposed, apparently, but only may have been. I know -- this is not reassuring. Still,  it's fact. While  you're at a very low statistical risk right now, and also are well within the window for any antibodies to be showing up if they are present, only getting tested will ease your mind -- or the other thing, if that somehow turns out to be the case. Either way you need to know, and your test now should be accurate.   I hope this is helpful. Please follow up with us as needed,  the very best of luck to you, and please do update us.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, You will probably feel better about the potential for transfer of infections if you talk to your childcare provider to see what measures they take to protect the children from diseases.    Also, HIV is not easily transferred through saliva.  It almost always requires deep body fluid exchange, as with blood or sexual contact.    Other infections are much more prevalent in the day care setting and regular cleaning of toys with a bleach solution helps keep this concern at a minimum, along with good handwashing techniques and separation of diaper changing areas from other areas of the center.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I recently had a sexual encounter with a high risk woman of unknown sero status. It included Protected vaginal sex and unprotected cunnilingus. I have a wisdom tooth that is a little sore and secretes something like puss at times(not very noticably). But im really worried about the possibility of being infected with HIV. I Developed a sore throat the day after the incident with mild pain. The pain went away completely in 5 days but there is still some swelling in my throat after 15 days. Is it possible for HIV symptoms to appear so soon? Could it be any other STD? (im pretty convinced its an STD) Could i be over reacting? This is the first time i had a casual sexual encounter. Please reply. Im worrying myself sick.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: HIV Oral transmission/Sore throat symptoms",
    "content": "Hi there -  First, HIV itself rarely has symptoms and when there are symptoms they usually resemble a relatively mild, passing virus (like a \"touch\" of flu); AIDS is where the symptoms show up, and they can be virtually anything, but there are some characteristic ones that seem to be far more common.  However, even this, if it were to show up at all, would take 3-6 weeks to manifest, as the body begins to form antibodies to the virus.   Statistically, odds are against your actually having contracted HIV via the route you traveled, but you're certainly right to be concerned anyway; Why run the risk?   It is always possible to contract an STD or just some random infection (almost anything can be  sexually transmitted -- even the common cold; some things, however are most often or only transmitted that way). Again, you're right to be concerned, and hopefully you'll draw the most useful lessons from this experience. (Unfortunately, a lot of people, regardless of the risk they run, once they discover they've \"survived\" it, gain confidence in taking risks, which is extremely unwise).   For your peace of mind and general health, you should be tested for HIV now that this encounter has taken place. The infection you have could be an STD or could be a random viral or bacterial infection contracted from your partner or just from being out and about at this time of year. Either way,  it will  likely require the taking of a culture and perhaps treatment, if only symptomatic. The  reason I say \"anything\" could be contracted this way is that people who are indiscreet are often also careless about personal hygeine, which means the problem, if it is something that was actually \"caught\" from your consort, could  simply be  the equivalent  of having licked the bottom of a shoe. You don't  know where it's been, and anything could be on (in) it.  So go see a doctor or go to a clinic. Get yourself tested for HIV, just as anyone who's had an unprotected and relatively anyonymous sexual encounter, and have it followed up at the recommended intervals, since it usually  requires more than one test to be certain, as the disease develops rather slowly.  Then,  during that same visit, have your throat cultured for whatever might be growing in there. If there's nothing then it's a random virus and if so, treat it symptomatically. You could get away with something as simple  as strep throat or the flu. If  it's an STD, find out exactly what, and if it's one that will be  staying with  you (herpes is one of those), please be considerate and either let future partners know about it or at the very least take precautions to protect others  as well as yourself.   As for HIV, statistically it's unlikely in this case, but it's  still up there with Russian roulette in terms of the consequences. Get tested, be careful, take care of yourself and look  out for others as well. Not a sermon -- a health issue.   Please follow up with us as needed. I hope this is helpful.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Chris -  Statistically minuscule to start with, your risk of certain specific things, had you actually touched the blood, and had it somehow come into contact with a break in your skin, would still be extremely low. Of course the risk would depend, to some  degree, on what disease you'd be most worried about. I think the majority of people would probably consider HIV the worst case scenario. Again,  it would have to meet all the criteria above, plus have been on there less than a few seconds before you came into contact with it. Even then the risk would be remarkably low.   I'm not going to tell you it's impossible to have caught something, but it's so close to impossible (less than improbable) that you really can relax. You did all the right things, the exposure, if it even happened, was infinitesimally small and brief, and if you had no open and exposed cuts on your hands, well, that would just about render any risk nil.   This isn't intended to suggest we shouldn't make every effort to keep our hands (and everything else) clean, or at least avoid contact with blood and other bodily fluids in uncontrolled situations, but in this case in particular you should definitely relax. There's just no reasonable way you could have contracted anything from the theoretical exposure.   You do get major points for washing your hands, however.\n\n",

    "content": "I was diagnosed with MRSA about a month ago due to large boils that I had on my rear end.  I was on Cipro and completed the full 2 week round of antibiotics.  The boils were treated with Altabax and have healed normally.  The boil sites are still there with a hard scab that is still in the healing process.  I have not done anything since diagnoses to irritate the boils, because I don't want them to come back.  My dermatologist said that is normal and they will eventually be completely gone.    I am wondering if MRSA ever goes away, and how do I know if it was cured with the antibiotic.  I have no other symptoms of boils returning on my body.  But after the round of antibiotics were finished, I was not tested again for MRSA in my nose.  2 days ago I got flu like symptoms including chills, sweats, coughing and drainage.  I have had the cold/sinus infection symptoms for about a week before it worsened.  I have woken up with a tight chest, feeling like there is a lot of goop in there, and a puffy face, contributed by a sinus headache.  It does not hurt to breathe, or sound wheesy.  And I am not short on breath.  But when I cough hard the back of my throat hurts under my chin, but farther back, on the top before my espohogus.  I've never had a pain there before.  My fever started at 100 and is now up to 102 between taking Cold & Sinus medication to reduce the fever and inflammation.  Is this just the flu or could MRSA have something to do with it?   My concern is that I know that MRSA can deeper effect organs in the body.  And with recently having it, could my flu be caused by MRSA and be something more serious than what I think.  I was not going to go to the doctor right away and was going to see if the symptoms improve.  But having remembered that MRSA can cause flu like symptoms if it causes pneumonia, I have become concerned.  What are the chances that Cipro did not cure the MRSA, and should I be tested again?  I may be overanalyzing, but I appreciate the help!  Thanks in advance.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Azza21,  Most people who get MRSA skin infections are actually colonized with MRSA.  Typically it can be found in the nose.  MRSA is prone to causing skin infections because when it gains the genes to become drug resistant it also tends to activate genes that help it evade the immune system a bit allowing it to cause infections a bit more prevalently than its more sensitive counterpart.    It is unlikely that a 2 week course of Cipro would cure the carrier state.  The carrier state can be cured sometimes but typically it requires a nasal ointment and a topical skin wash done simultaneously for about a week.  MRSA can cause pneumonia and sinusitis although the more typical causes are still more common than MRSA.  I would recommend you see your doctor for an evaluation of your symptoms to see if there is a particular treatment you may need.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello angelpie545,  With all antibody tests for HIV, there is a \"window-period\" during which it is possible to test negative despite HIV infection.  This is because the tests work by detecting antibodies to HIV, and it takes time after infection for the body to make enough antibodies to be detected.  The amount of time necessary varies, many people will have measurable levels of antibodies about 20-30 days after exposure; in others it may take 6 months before antibodies are detectable.  The practitioner who concluded that you did not need any further testing after your negative oral fluid test result likely based this decision on your history and risk factors.  If you had a history of significant recent risk factors, the practitioner would likely recommend a repeat test in, say 3-6 months.  If you had no risk factors in the six months prior to the test, it is very likely that your negative result was accurate. If you are concerned that you may be infected, please get tested again.  If you are infected, it is essential to know so that you can be treated properly and to prevent infecting others, and if you are not, I think you would feel much better having confirmation that you are okay.  The oral fluid test is quite accurate, so you can feel comfortable using that method again.  Good luck to you!\n\n",

I don't know if the person has any disease, but I don't think they do.  They had already used the lancet, so i assumed that there was a chance of contacting something, but I wanted to know how likely it was.  The lancet was sterilized with a lighter and alcohol.

    "content": "Hello 220095,  In general, the risk of transmission of a blood born illness such as HIV or hepatitis is significantly less with solid needles, such as a lancet, than it is with a hollow needle, such as injection needles; however, the risk is not zero.    Your risk is probably fairly low since these viruses are not particularly strong and the heat/alcohol will help destroy them.  I would still recommend against sharing needles, including lancets because even with the best of sterilizing techniques there is still a small chance that an infection could be spread.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: purple spots on or just under skin",
    "content": "Hi Mike19856,  Often, when people describe purple spots I am suspicious that they may be a collection of very small blood vessels (capillaries) just below the skin called a capillary hemangioma.  If the spots come and go I don't typically think of HIV right away.  A typical presentation for an acute HIV infection is to have flu-like symptoms initially.  Unfortunately, HIV can present with atypical symptoms or no symptoms at all.  If you were positive, treatment regimens now are very tailored to the individual patient.  Some patients get very aggressive therapy very quickly while others get a milder treatment regimen.  Treatment by an infectious disease physician or physician experienced with HIV is important to help guide therapy.  I would recommend that you have these spots evaluated.  If you are not comfortable testing for HIV at this point then you can always wait to see if your doctor suggests these may be from HIV or explain your situation to him/her to see if an appropriate treatment plan can be arranged.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, About  2.5yrs. back someone i know told me that one of their relatives needed blood so i went with them to this blood bank in this hospital. The technician took my blood for blood group and matching and they used a new syringe, as soon as they penentrated my artery in my left cubital fossa i helf a chilling sensation in that area few like 5-10 seconds. i gave 1 pint blood. later that evening say about 5-6hrs later i started having headache, swollen, tender submandibular lymph nodes, sore throat and low-grade fever. ive always had problems with my tonsils meaning they are prone to infection (since i was a kid) so i knew what the symptoms were. The headache, sore-throat, painful lymph nodes went away in a few days, just like they would in tonsillitis, and ive been living normally since then.  Now its been more than 2.5yrs and iam very healthy, athletic, play soccer regularly,  HAVE NO SYMPTOMS AT ALL. iam more fit that most ppl. my age around me. i do have bleeding gums when i brush my teeth sometime but that ive had since i was a child since aslong as i remember, iam 27 right now.  My question is that: 1) the sign and symptoms ive described were they due to something like strep. aureus infection that could have penentrated my skin during that process, or something else or more dangerous. 2) could i have a chronic disease something like HIV??  although i come from a country which has very low HIV rates, also iam not into IV drugs, or unprotected intercourse. We can rule those 2 out.  i don't have any medical problems, but its just curiosity thats driving me to ask my question. pls. do let me know what u think.  Awaiting ur answer, Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Its highly unlikely that this occurred as your symptoms seem to have been localized more to the area of the head and neck. If a doctor examined you and diagnosed tonsillitis then you do not need to look any further. Tonsillitis would not occur 5 hours after a blood stream infection. Bacteremia in a healthy patient is also very unlikely. HIV and other infections would only be contracted if the needle was used with someone else - very unlikely. When people mention transfusion related infection they are mainly referring to infection in the transfusion that is received by the patient. Since you are on the donor side and not on the receiving side, transfusion related infections are not a concern.  Good luck and stay healthy!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there  I am a 31 year old male who had recently split from his wife and had a brief enounter with a woman (sexual health unknown).  We slept togther (vaginal only) and for the first 15 mins or so we did not use protection, I then deciced being a bit more responsible to put a condom on which remained intact.  After about 6 days I started when on holiday in another country to feel ill, flu like symptomes aches etc and this went in about 4-6 days and then I was fine and my family who I still live with became ill as well at the sames time with similar type effects.  All the same I got an STI check and negative for everything but I did not have the HIV test as it was too early and I knew I was clear 100% up until this 1 enounter.  About 5 weeks later I had the flu jab.  Then 3 weeks after this (8 weeks since exposurer) I got a common cold type effect, cough and running nose etc.  This has mostly passed apart from a sore throat which has a few white spots on it (not burst though).  I am 9 weeks past exposurer and have today had the HIV test.     I feel fine and well apart from a sore throat.  Does this sound a cause for concrern?  It just hurts a little when I swallow and I have a build up of mucuas on chest.  Thanks for your help and look forward to peoples comments?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Needguidance,  Initial symptoms of HIV infection can be a flu-like illness.  However, since your family was also ill it is more likely that these initial symptoms were caused by another virus that is contagious through other, easier forms of contact.  However, sometimes the symptoms of initial infection are  minor and not recognized.  Being tested is advisable to be sure.  With most HIV tests, the test does not detect the virus.  Instead, they test for antibodies to the virus.  These tests become positive starting as early as six weeks but it may take up to three months to be positive.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I can not get my other post to open, it hangs...fortunately I had this one typed up in Word to repost incase the doc was having the same prob.  I have a long scenario, which I will try to shorten so as to not take too much of your time.   I've been married for 11 years to the only person I had ever had sex with. We seperated and on June 29 I had protected sex (vaginal) with a man and gave him unprotected sex. I have good oral hygene, however I had cryptic tonsils, which might be a passage for transmission.   Two weeks later July 11th, My tonsils swelled together (no pain) and I began having horrible night sweats. I was on my period so I contributed the night sweats to PMS maybe.   I went to the doc and they took mono test, strep tests and CBC - all were negative. Prescribed Antibiotics and sent me to an ENT who removed my tonsils, biopsy revealed no cancer, just a bit of amoeba like bacteria. They were 3X3X7 and 3X3X8 CM.. huge :) EBV test revealed a past infection, not a current one.   Continued having horrible night sweats nightly, low grade Fevers all day, red (flushing) skin on my face and arms, intermittent diahrea.  On August 15th (6 weeks after the sex) the guy and I both took rapid HIV tests, and they were both negative. This was 6 weeks past our sex, but I don't know who he had been with prior to me.  My doctor took an ANA(lupus) test, which came back normal. Sed rate was taken 3 times over 3 months - went from 8 to 26 to 8. CBC is always normal. At my doctors suggestion, I have taken HIV tests all the way out to a rapid one on 11/26 - which is five months past sex with this guy. HOWEVER  On 11/1 I came down ill for one day with a high Fever, sore throat and aches. The next day all of my nodes were hurting and enlarged. And today, 12/1, they continue to hurt like crazy - an intense burning ache in the ones in my collarbone, shoulder, both sides of my neck, between my breast on the right side, under both arms, on the crease of one of my elbows, both sides of my groin, down the inside of my thigh and behind my knees. It's ALL DAY pain that never goes away - and nothing helps to releive it. and I still have horrible night sweats 2 to 3 times per night.  I have congestive Heart failure (peripartum Cardiomyopathy - my body attacked my own heart - sort of an immune issue) and take Toprol for the last 6 years. My heart is doing fine.   My questions are simple:  1) If this was HIV, would it have shown up in one of the 9 tests taken, especially in the one taken at 4 months and 29 days?  2) Is it possible to have a strain in which the body can not produce antibodies for?  3) Could this just be a very long seroconversion process?  4) Antibotics are of no help, my family has never come down sick from me, and my CBC does not indicate infection. Aren't these things all consistent with HIV?  5) Could the guy have been in his window period and thats why he was negative?  6)What else would cause these types of symptoms. My doc is at a loss and I feel like death warmed over.   Now that my husband and I have reconciled, we'd like to have intercourse, but are very scared. I won't deny that I'm an anxious person, but I simply can not make up a Fever and pain (ripping and burning sensations) in my nodes, the ones in the collar bone and neck hurt the very most.   Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Naero,  Your symptoms certainly seem to be from an infection.  The hard part is determining which infection.  I would recommend you see an Infectious Disease specialist.    HIV testing, including the quick test, don't test for the virus directly.  Instead, they test for antibodies against HIV.  Usually by 3 months, most have developed antibodies.  If there is concern, there is another test that looks for HIV DNA. This test can become positive within a week in some cases and is very reliable by one month.    Persistence is key.  Following up with your doctor is important.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Shortly after my last time, I became constipated for about a week, having to eventually take laxatives, which worked. It's been a long while, but I think I also had a sore throat. Since then I have had anxiety (off and on) about whether or not I had been infected however, negligently, I have not had any sort of testing. But I have two questions, 1. Is constipation a normal symptom of initial infection?  2. Can Anxiety of whether you have HIV, cause you to believe you have the virus? I have had a history of worrying about having diseases (I first learned about AIDS in elementary school and began to think I had AIDS - of course, then they were saying one could contract the virus by way of a mosquito bite). I many times, narrow in on one of my physical and health aspects and believe it is a result of having HIV (ie, believing my cheeks are sunken in, having dental problems like rotting teeth, cuts that take a while to heal,  going through spells of depression, etc.)  I'd appreciate any helpful info...

    "content": "Hi, I'm a 20 yr old female. What I'm about to say is even ridiculous for me to think that I did. I in no way would do it again, and has caused me months of worrying.  In September 2006 I had unprotected sex with a guy I knew and was scared I could possibly get pregnant. Very, very stupidly I took 6 birth control pills after my friend told me that more birth control acts similar to the Plan B. The next night I had horrible night sweats, an achy neck, a very high temp. Scared I went to the doctor the next morning, but all my symptoms seemed to have disappeared. In November I had a complete HIV/STD test, and all negative. In March, I had sex with one guy that I knew (without a condom) and one other guy that I didn't know so well (with a condom). About a month later I had sex with the guy that I knew again without a condom and he accidently ejaculated inside me. Earlier that night we all were playing in the rain. The next morning,I was so scared, so again ridiculous as it sounds, I took 6 birth control pills.I went out that night and had I'd say about 7 beers. When I went to bed that night I started to get night sweats bad, and a high Fever. The next morning I woke up and my throat was incredibley swollen. I felt horrible. I went to the doctor and the mono came back negative, and the strep was negative, the CBC for my WBC was 15. My temperature was almost 104. I had a chain of 3 Lymph nodes swell in what they said was the posterior chain on my right side. They did not hurt and were not warm to touch. They gave me Antibiotics and sent me home. I remembered that alot of these sypmtoms, such as the night sweats, achy neck, and Fever, were associated with the last time I took the birthcontrol. Within a week, My throat stopped hurting and I felt much better, no Fever, not even low grade. My tonsils however were still swollen and the Lymph nodes were still there. I went to my Family Doctor about a month later and he did another CBC (which came back with a WBC count of 7. 4) and another strep test (which came back negative). He said the nodes were nothing to worry about. and that the tonsils might never go back to normal size if the infection is bad enough. He felt no other enlarged nodes anywhere.  So, I made the mistake to research on the internet about HIV and then got so so so very worried that I might have it. Just because of the Nodes in my neck and the tonsils. I had no other symptoms till about a week ago when I had a rather painful feeling in my armpit. I felt around and it was a tiny little node enlarged and it hurt so bad. In about 4 days it was gone. Then, I got another one in the same armpit, just as painful and the skin slightly red. It went away in about the same time. My tonsils are still slightly swollen, and not red. I usually have alot of drainage though, so it's confusing.  I have not lost any weight (if anything gained some), no Diarrhea, no night sweats, no abnormal head aches, no rashes, nothing but the tonsils and nodes.  I was just worried because I didn't know if those nodes could be related in anyway. And if this means I have HIV. I haven't had any sexual encounters since the last I told you, I'm just scared to go have the test done, I know that this is ridiculous. I've just been tormenting myself with worry and am scared of getting the results back.   So, I guess I'm asking if this could be HIV or sounds something like HIV, what with the birthcontrol issue and playing in the rain added in there. I'd appreciate any help. I am going to get the test, I just wanted to see what you had to say...  Oh, and in June I was diagnosed with High Risk HPV, my Gyno said it was nothing to worry about because almost everyone has it at some point in their  lives...\n\n",

Not because I think you are infected but because if you are not, it will give you peace of mind and hopefully cause you to be careful in the future.  If by some chance you are infected, early detection can be helpful in keeping the disease under control.  To go back to your encounter, it is highly unlikely that if you did get exposed to HIV that you would have symptoms the very next day.  It takes a little while for the virus to reproduce in your body, then your body starts to fight it and it would be at least a couple of weeks before a test would even pick it up.  So, whatever was going on with you was not likely HIV-related.  Besides, you did get tested and it was negative.  The response you had to the birth control pill overdose would not be typical (fever) but it can cause nausea and vaginal bleeding.  My guess is that the next episode was also just an infection.  Sounds like you kind of abused your body that night!    So, get the testing done and resolve to be more responsible with your sexual encounters in the future.  This kind of stress and worrying could cause anyone to feel very ill.      Good luck.\n\n",

So, the lymph nodes in my neck arent really anything to be worried about? because that's the only place they popped up and they are still there. I am informed about \"shotty nodes\" and I feel that's likely what they are. but, I was just wondering if it was HIV they nodes would likely be generalized, correct? I know that the virus takes a few weeks to reproduce and cause any symptoms at all, i was just worried because a few weeks before i did have sex with someone although there was a condom used. I think that's why I feel so worried in the first place. That and the fact that the internet can lead anyones mind to wonder and make a diagnosis on their own. So, if you could just answer those quick little questions I would appreciate it. I am going to get the rapid test done tomorrow so I will know for sure. I'm just pretty scared right now, even though it all will work out one way or the other. Thank you for your time!\n\n",

At some point, it helped me, coz the symptoms disappeared. Im really scared for this. I even tried testing myself for HIV, with the use if HIV testing kit, and the result wa still negative. Not sure if this is 100% accurate. I know that i have a high risk of getting HIV because of the recurring symptoms, i really need help!\n\n",

I can't be sure on this as I tried to look it up but couldn't find the information.  If the test positive a second, different test is usually done to confirm.

I believe deep down this is not the case but I have had severe anxiety attacks that include insomnia, stress, headaches. I just need reassurance and unforunately live in a country where I cannot get tested for HIV without risking jail! If I had in fact contract HIV what sort of symptoms would I have experienced, and can I rest easy in knowing that my exposure was low risk and if I haven't experieced any symptoms 6 months post to the encounter that I am safe? Is there an alternative test, besides a blood test, that could confirm I am fine? I just need reassurance, please understand that. Thank you. I sincerely appreciate your patience.\n\n",

    "title": "Precautions for small children with HIV family member",
    "content": "I just recently found out that my children's grandmother (their fathers mother) is HIV positive.  I by no means want to eliminate her contact with her grandchildren, however I do believe that a basic understanding needs to be established before hand.  Their father and I can not seem to agree on the matter at hands and instead it's causing huge disagreements.  Our children are ages 4 and 1.  So needless to say, they are active, they fall, they constantly are scrapped and scratched.   My 1 year old is a typical toddler --putting everything in her mouth, etc.  They're just normal children.     I have asked that the children not be left alone with her.  For one, they are just not old enough to understand and should something happen (she has epilespy as well for example), not be able to take the precautions needed.    I've also asked that they not eat or drink after her.  She's famous for 'sharing' her drinks with the kids, but as mentioned, they're typical kids, and whose knows the cuts they have? Not to mention the cutting teeth of my youngest.  I've also chose to dress them in pants and to make sure they have socks and shoes on when at her house.  This is in effort to protect their banged and scratched knees, etc.  (I didn't ask this, but I just chose to do it...because so much turmoil started just with the first two above mentioned request)   Am I (if possible) being too cautious? Their father is now accusing me of being heartless and cold.  He's accusing me of pouring salt into a wound, so to say...not caring about his mother, but causing her more hurt.    I just feel like I can not be safe enough, nor do I think I've asked for anything above and beyond. I am actually offended myself, that HE as the children's father is not just as concerned as I am. I'm also dumbfound that their grandmother wouldn't want to protect her grandchildren as well.  Even if the risk are slight...isn't it still worth it to just be safe??  I don't believe I've been unfair in my request.  Am I wrong?  Are  there other things that I need to take precautions with or watch for?  Please advise!!\n\n",

    "content": "Well, I'm no doctor but I have done tons of research on HIV since I once thought i was positive (I'm not though thank god).  You are right to be cautious. How horrible would it be to have your children get infected at such a young age (or any age)?   Now, as far as the sharing of drinks go, I wouldn't worry so much about that. It has been shown that HIV is not transmitted through saliva, and that the only way for that to be possible is if there is blood in the saliva and the children have cuts in their mouth, but remember, this method or transmission is highly unlikely to occur, the chance of it happening are essentially zero.  You need to keep this in mind, HIV is an incredibly fragile virus, unless you come into contact with wet blood almost immediately, there is little to no chance of contracting the virus. According to the CDC, up to 90-99% of the virus is inactivated once the blood is dry, and that was under laboratory conditions in which concentrations of HIV were 100,000 times higher than those found in real life.  Now, you may be pouring salt into the wound, but with good reason. I don't know how she contracted it, but regardless, you must remain cautious. If she cares about the kids, then she will agree that these measure's are in the children's best interest.  If you are still worried or unsure of what to do, please visit the CDC's website and look up the HIV/AIDS transmission fact sheets as provided below.  Good luck:  http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/resources/factsh ... ission.htm\n\n",

    "content": "I kind of already asked this but never really got a good satisfying answer. Since then, I've done more research, and from what I've found, it's unlikely, more like, impossible for me to have gotten HIV.   Anyways, about 2 months ago I got an unprofessional tattoo done. 3 weeks before I had my tattoo done a girl with HIV had the inside of her lip tattooed (meaning that saliva was touching it, and from the research i did, most credible sources said that saliva inactivates 90% of all hiv). Now, the guy who did mine, while unprofessional, DID seem to know about cleaning procedures. I saw him open a brand new needle right before my eyes, but someone told me that if they don't clean the ink tube (the needle sits in this ink tube), you could get hiv because the needle can suck trace amounts of blood in.   ok, so lets say that even though he DID use a new needle, lets say he hadn't cleaned the ink tube in the 3 weeks that passed after the HIV girl got her tattoo. (oh by the way, he gives at least one tattoo every day, so ink would be constantly in and out of the ink tube). Wouldn't the blood dry inside the tube and become inactive? If you're unfamiliar with the tattooing process, an ink tube looks like the tip of your pen (not the part where the ink comes out, but the plastic cap that goes around it, you can usually unscrew it). So the ink tube is NOT air tight.   My question is, even if there WERE trace amounts of blood wouldn't they have: 1. Dried over night? 2. Wouldn't the ink have killed the HIV? 3. Since it was in her mouth wouldn't the saliva have deactivated some of the HIV? 4. Could HIV some how get all the way from the ink tube, down to the tip of the needle and then in to my skin? (seems unlikely).  Then, i looked on the CDCs website, and they said that there's NEVER been a reported case on HIV from  a tattoo. I highly doubt I'd be the first then.  I'm just wondering though because I cannot get it out of my head, it's driving me crazy, do I have anything to worry about? I REALLY don't want to get tested if there's no reason.   Ps: Supposedly he DOES clean the ink tube. I just can't verify it.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Gordan1x2,  There are a few different types of HIV tests available.  Some test directly for the HIV DNA (actually testing for the presence of the virus itself) while other tests look for the antibodies that the body makes against the virus.  This antibody method uses an indirect method of testing for the virus rather than testing for the virus itself.  Based on your report results \"anti-HIV\" negative you had a test that looks for the antibodies.  These are referred to as \"anti\" meaning directed against HIV.  So \"anti-HIV negative\" means the test did not detect the HIV antibodies.  This either means that you do not have HIV for the body to react to (i.e. you do not have HIV) or that the body has not had enough time to begin making antibodies to the HIV.  Generally by 6 months after exposure the antibody tests are reliable but can become positive much sooner than that.  If it has only been a few weeks since your possible exposure I would recommend you have a repeat HIV test done in the next few months just to confirm the negative status.  If it has been over six months you should be safe in saying this is truly negative.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Doctor,   I (25 year old male) have a question concerning an event 7 weeks ago when I had protected sex with a girl. The problem is that, while I was pulling out my penis, the condom came off, however at this moment it was still covering the head of my penis. But then I tried to insert my penis again which didn't really work as it wasn't hard enough anymore. However I am not sure whether the head of my penis came in contact with some vaginal fluid at this time. All I can remember is that I only tried to insert my penis once and - if it came in contact - it was no longer than 5 - 10 seconds!   After this incident, four weeks later I took a PCR RNA HIV 1 test in combination with an ELISA antibody test, both were negative. Another half a week later (5 1/2 week after exposure) I took an Oraquick test, also negative. Again one week later I took another Oraquick test, again negative, so this time 6 \u00bd weeks later.  I was told by my doctor at the medical center in Boston where I live, that the 6 1/2 week test would be conclusive, but I am not sure about that. I read that the CDC tells everybody to wait at least 3 months.  So what to do think? Would you recommend further testing? The doctor also told me that in my situation there wasn't a real infection risk. On other sites in the Internet I read however, that there is always a risk when the head of the penis is exposed to vaginal fluids.  One more question: Does the fact that I have an allergy (hay fever) alter in test results? Do I have a suppressed immune system?  Please help me as I am really freaking out.... can't hardly sleep!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Nexus,  The PCR test is accurate fairly quickly,  generally by a month.  The oraquick and Eliza are tests that look for antibodies.  These may be positive fast; however, it is generally recommended that these tests be repeated if they are done before 3 months.  Overall, your risk sounds like it is low.  However, all tests do have an inherent false negative rate.  As such, if you are concerned it is reasonable to be retested at 3 months.  A negative test at that point would be even more trustworthy.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I am really worried about this situation and and so sorry because it may sound silly, but I would like to know whether I am at risk of contracting HIV.  I was making out(open-mouth kissing) with a guy 2 months ago, and we have both been drinking before that. It was really dark so I could not see clearly. We engaged in some mutual petting, and he ejaculated on my hand...and I think he got a small amount of his semen on his fingers. He then continued to stimulate me vaginally using his fingers.  I realise that it was extremely foolish of me to engage in such a risky behavior , but now i am petrified that I could have contracted HIV. I tried contacting him to ask whether he had gotten tested...but have received no repsonse...please help me.  I really appreciate you taking the time to answer my question, it would really help me to plan what i should do...  thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Your risk of contracting HIV this way if fairly low but not zero.  I think it is very unlikely that you would have contracted HIV for the following reasons:  1) it takes a significant amount of virus to cause infection.  The small amount of semen is unlikely to carry enough virus.  2) the risk is higher when there is trauma to the vaginal mucosa allowing some bleeding to occur.  This is slightly less likely to have happened without intercourse (depending on how aggressive his fingers were).  If you are concerned it is very reasonable to be tested just to be sure.  A negative result will ease you mind.  If, by chance, it is positive it is important to find out soon.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "The answer to this question depends a little on which test is being done.  The most common test currently is an antibody test that looks for the antibodies to HIV.    These antibodies develop anywhere from 1-3 months after exposure, generally.  So, being tested at 3 months is a relatively certain test.  If it is negative and there is still concern, repeat testing can be done at 6 months and 1 year.  Newer tests actually looking for the virus can be done sooner and are generally reliable by about 1 month.  The lab that is doing the testing should be able to tell you what type of test they use and when it is generally considered accurate.  Best wishes.\n\n",

The HIV virus is not a particularly strong virus so it takes a fair amount of virus to be able to cause infection.    A kiss such as you are describing would have essentially no chance of passing on the infection unless you both had open sores on your lips.  Even then, the amount of exposure that could occur with a quick kiss would likely not be enough to cause infection.  It is more likely that you coincidentally got a different viral infection.  If your symptoms don't improve you should see your doctor for an evaluation.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I think you can feel very confident because it appears that only non-infectious components of the virus are present in saliva.  In order to transmit the infectious virus, it must get into the blood stream (as with a small cut or sore).  This seems to be the only real risk with kissing since there could be open sores, allowing blood contact (as opposed to saliva only) which could occur, especially with deep kissing. To give further reassurance, it takes a sufficient quantity of the infected fluid (blood) to infect another person, and this is very unlikely in the example you have cited here.  In answer to your worst case scenario, it is unlikely but not impossible since there could be sores you are not aware of.  But, this is a remote possibility.  Studies have shown that AIDS is a difficult disease to get except where blood, semen, and breastmilk (in the case of an infant) are involved.  You will likely be able to get peace of mind if you get tested for AIDS now and then again in six months.  If nothing is present then, you will be able to relax and stop worrying about this isolated incident.  Chances are you don't need to worry even now but I know that you are concerned.  For future protection, avoid situations that put you in a compromised situation.  Alcohol intake can contribute because it may affect your ability to reason and make good decisions, using reasonable judgment.  You are wise to be cautious.  Good luck and take care.\n\n",

    "content": "I think it is very unlikely this has anything to do with the kiss.  Perhaps you have some mild allergy, resulting in throat irritation due to drainage.    You might look for free screening clinics that are sometimes offered through public health agencies, health fairs, etc.  Once you are screened you will probably feel better, so you might watch for such events.  They could be in conjunction with a hospital or other agency.  Call your local health jurisdiction and ask if they are aware of any screening clinics.  This would be confidential as there would not need to be any insurance billing, etc. that might make you worried that someone will find out about the testing.    I suspect you are going to worry over every symptom you have until you are able to get this asurance so it might be worth your while.  Getting routine health screenings is not necessarily a red flag for high risk behaviors - just responsible health care.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "This is a difficult question to answer because there is always an element of unknown factors.  For instance, when dried, the virus becomes essentially inactive so if the contaminant was dried, chances are it would not infect another person.  When that drying actually occured would depend on other environmental factors.    Basically the AIDS virus does not survive well in the environment.  It depends on a host with the right conditions in order to flourish.  For this reason, it is not as easily spread as some people think.  But, in the case of sexual activity, needle sharing, etc. where deep body fluids can mix, the virus can be transmitted.  The virus does depend on a host in order to reproduce so theoretically there would need to be a fairly short interval between the syringe use from the infected person to the one being infected by it.  I don't know if anyone can say exactly the time frame because laboratory testing is not the same as person to person exchange.  Hepatitis B on the other hand is transmitted more easily and a person at risk for AIDS is typically also at risk for Hep B (and much more likely to contract it) so if you have not been vaccinated for this virus, I would recommend it.    I hope this helps, even though I realize you had hoped for some more specific times.  I wish I could be more helpful.\n\n",

My last sexual partner was in 2003 unprotected.  I was pretty active, outdoorsy and didn't really experience any symptoms.  I was tested in 2003 before my last sexual partner, and tested again in May of 2006.  Both times I was negative.  in the past few months I have had excessive gas at times, not all the time but a lot, plus diahreeah(spelling?) a lot, not everyday but a lot.  I eat a lot of spicy food, but it does not neccessarily conincide with the times I do eat spicy food.  I have had tender lymph nodes frequently.  Not everyday, but enough that I have noticed a change from before.  I had a cyst a few years ago behind my right ear, that was preceded with a rough flu and fever.  a month and a half ago I had another cyst in my groin area, didn't hurt but was uncomfortable.  It was gone in a week.  The latest symptom is a bunch of small bald spots in my facial hair around my chin.  They appear almost perfectly circular, each being a couple mm in size.  When they first appeard it was a small group and I thought they were zits.  when I popped them a thick white material came out.  but now they are more numerous and now no white center, just smooth bald spots.  I don't grow facial hair except a shadow on the weekend, most of the time I am clean shaven, but it still bothers me.  Are these signs that I need to be tested again?  Thanks in advance.

I have been a little stressed and very inactive, averaging 4-5 hours of sleep a night except on the weekend, the move has caused some stress, just in case this is causing some symptoms. thanks again. analystchem wrote:I am 29, M, No past diagnosis, no surgeries, unkown family history, no medications.  I have had two sexual partners, one was my ex wife.  My last sexual partner was in 2003 unprotected.  I was pretty active, outdoorsy and didn't really experience any symptoms.  I was tested in 2003 before my last sexual partner, and tested again in May of 2006.  Both times I was negative.  in the past few months I have had excessive gas at times, not all the time but a lot, plus diahreeah(spelling?) a lot, not everyday but a lot.  I eat a lot of spicy food, but it does not neccessarily conincide with the times I do eat spicy food.  I have had tender lymph nodes frequently.  Not everyday, but enough that I have noticed a change from before.  I had a cyst a few years ago behind my right ear, that was preceded with a rough flu and fever.  a month and a half ago I had another cyst in my groin area, didn't hurt but was uncomfortable.  It was gone in a week.  The latest symptom is a bunch of small bald spots in my facial hair around my chin.  They appear almost perfectly circular, each being a couple mm in size.  When they first appeard it was a small group and I thought they were zits.  when I popped them a thick white material came out.  but now they are more numerous and now no white center, just smooth bald spots.  I don't grow facial hair except a shadow on the weekend, most of the time I am clean shaven, but it still bothers me.  Are these signs that I need to be tested again?  Thanks in advance.

Periodic testing for AIDS should help you to have peace of mind.  Be completely open and honest with your doctor so he/she is aware of any risk factors.   Stress can contribute to many health conditions so it certainly won't hurt for you to take stress-reduction measures.  Increasing physical activity with even a daily walk can do wonders to improve your health and sleep patterns.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, i am a 27 year female. I went to have an HIV test done at a clinic which used the insti tm test where they collected blood from my finger and analysed it. i had the test done as i was worried about some episodes which happened some 10 years ago. Anyway it game back negative as i thought it would. Unfortunately now i wish i never went as after opening the kit on the counter the nurse brought it over to the examination bed . She dropped the little plastic instrument which is used to absorb the blood from the finger after it starts bleeding. I never thought she would use that on my finger i thought it is to absorb solution from the little containers she had. Anyway she used it on my bleeding finger and now i am worried particularly about HIV, i can deal with anything else. Thing is this is a clinic where people with STDs go. She dropped it on a towel which was lyeing around. I didnt see any blood drops on the towel but what if there were any other body fluids on the towel such as sperm or vaginal fluid? My immagination might be overworking but nothing is impossible. Would it be possible to catch HIV like this? I have red hundreds of websites full of info but didnt come acros anything similar. My finger was obviously with non intact skin, it was bleeding and after i was pressing tissue over it to stop bleeding so i can just hope that the HIV virus does not get into the body this way. Please help i am really worried and cannot sleep anymore. Kind regards\n\n",

    "content": "Contracting HIV from the method you have described would be incredibly rare if not impossible, for a few reasons.  First, HIV is not a particularly strong virus and dies quickly after leaving the body.  This is a major reason why the virus is spread only in a limited number of ways.    Also, it takes a fair amount of viral exposure to contract the disease.  The amount of virus that could be picked up from such a mechanism would almost certainly not be enough to cause infection.  Lastly, if the tube is as I'm imagining it is designed to pull fluid into the tube so the blood flow would actually be away from your finger.  I hope this helps ease your concerns a little.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I have a problem with uncontrollable ejaculation. The slightest sexual stimulation makes me get aroused, the merest brush or sight of an attractive female. This comes from 10 years of violent sexual repression after a rape. Now I'm in a fulfilling, sexual relationship, but my problem still remains. So, as I've done for the past five years, I wear rubber balloons around my penis when I'm in public. This is unpleasant, but it keeps my pants clean. However, when I go to use a restroom and take off the \"cock socks,\" as I've affectionately named them, I often notice a ring of raw flesh which is sometimes bleeding. I have to cut my CS just so, so they stay on, but don't chafe. My question is: If I'm in a public restroom and bleeding, even if only slightly, is there any chance of coming in contact with HIV-infected blood under the toilet seat or along the rim of the bowl itself, that I might accidentally brush against, thus infecting myself, should I accidentally make contact with my bleeding member?  Should I bother being tested?  I mean, 10s of thousands of folks with bleeding hemorrhoids use public restrooms every day, and 100s of thousands of women, bleeding from menstruation, use restrooms, and you never hear of any of these people getting infected, but it's better to ask and be safe, as a precaution, right?  Thanks and thanks and thanks again!\n\n",

I felt maybe 10 times worse than i had before that night. After suffering for about 5 days I went to the doc, was prescribed pennicilin and motrin and it cleared right up.   All of this happened about 3-4 months after having a questionable encounter, of which i had unprotected vaginal sex for roughly 5 minutes and was not fully erect (less chance of transmission without precum presesnt?).  I havent felt anything resembling the \"typical\" AIDS symptoms and its been 4 yrs since the encounter, in fact i have actually gained 20 lbs in that 4 yrs of time. I suppose I am loking for some reassurance to help ease my anxiety before i get my blood test results back in a few days, but my anxiety is mostly due to that bad cold/flu and the rash I developed.  So is it possible to have ARS after so many weeks?\n\n",

This generally happens around 3-6 weeks after infection.  Some do not experience any symptoms after infection.  Actual AIDS symptoms may develop after only a few months or may not develop for decades.  If there is any concern for HIV infection you should be tested as HIV infection does not have any absolute symptoms that can be used to evaluate for infection.  Any intercourse can lead to infection.  As you would expect, longer exposure time increases the risk of infection short exposure times also carry a risk.  Best wishes.\n\n",

The reason is that all equipment used in surgery or any invasive techniques are sterilized before the next use, and HIV virus is a very weak virus that can be easily killed with antiseptic techniques.  Routine HIV test is done for those who will donate their blood or any other organ.  Recently, CDC recommends that diagnostic HIV testing should be done as a part of routine clinical care in all settings including urgent-care clinics, and  inpatient services (patients should be notified).  Hope this information is useful. Keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,   HIV is commonly transmitted through an unprotected sex with an infected partner.  The risk increases when there is an ulcer or skin abrasion in the genitals or the oral cavity (in case of oral sex).  The only way to confirm infection with HIV/AIDS is to be tested for HIV infection.  Many infected individuals with HIV do not have any symptoms for years, thus you can not rely on symptoms. Your symptoms are very unspecific and may occur to all of us during this season with unstable weather.   Infection with opportunistic organism that infect only immunocompromised people raises a suspicious towards HIV/AIDS infection, which is not the case.  It is however, a correct step to go for HIV test as well as venereal consultation. HIV antibodies reach detectable levels in 1 to 6 months following infection.   If your results come out positive for HIV, which means you carry the virus causing AIDS and does not mean you have the disease AIDS.  There is no cure for AIDS uptill now but it does not mean you will die of the disease, since many opportunistic infections that commonly causes death in such patients can be controlled with increased life span and quality of life.  Health care centers which provide screening of HIV can advise you for proper management.   Best regards.\n\n",

The association with HIV is not completely understood but it is postulated that seborrhea may be do to a fungal skin infection.  Those with AIDS are at increased risk of infection, thus yielding more incidence of seborrhea.  With a negative HIV test, HIV is less likely.  If there is still concern, you can have the test repeated.  Regarding the test before surgery, they likely did not run an HIV test unless you specifically requested it.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

Normally i bench over 200 pounds now, I find it hard to lift a monitor at work. I am extremely weak. I went to the doctor already she claims she thinks that I'm experiencing depression, because I have a mental background. But this time, I'm not buying it. I WENT AT DID A RAPID HIV-TEST ON JAN 15TH, AND IT WAS NEGATIVE, THEY USED BLOOD THEY DREW THERE.   My urine stays yellow no matter how much water I drink. Also, last night, I noticed I had night sweats, and the room was set on the regular temp. I don't know i'm soo scared. I JUST KEEP THINKING OF WHY I'M HAVING SUCH SYMPTOMS   \tALSO, I FRENCHED KISSED THIS GIRL LAST NIGHT (ANOTHER GIRL ONCE AGAIN), BUT NOTHING MORE. WE SLEPT MY BED FOR A WHILE, BUT I FELT UNCOMFORTABLE SO I CHANGED TO ANOTHER BED. LONG STORY, I WOKE UP THIS MORNING, AND SAW CUTS ON THE SIDE OF MT MOUTH. I'M TAKING LOADS OF VIT C. AND IT SEEMS TO BE HEALING A BIT.   BUT I'M WANDERING, CAN THIS BE YET ANOTHER SIGN OF HIV? OR FROM THE KISS?  I KEEP OBSESSING AND THIKING OF THE MISTAKES I'VE MADE AFTER MY MAJOR NOV INCIDENT.  HELP!\n\n",

    "content": "I'm 17, I recently bought a knife from a thrift shop. I opened it up and accidentally dropped it on to my leg. It broke the skin, but it wasn't deep...it barely went in. It took about 25 seconds to start bleeding (it went through my jeans). Is there any chance that I could get aids? I mean, it's from a factory in china, but still...? Also, I used to cut my arms with paper clips and safety pins. Typically, I'd scratch myself and like 30 seconds later, they'd bleed. Any chance of getting HIV?\n\n",

    "content": "Regarding cutting yourself with paperclips and safety pins, the risk of contracting AIDS  is zero from this as long as the objects were not previously used by someone who had HIV.    Regarding the knife.  It is very unlikely to contract HIV (the virus that causes AIDS) in this manner.  We've learned from studies that solid objects (such as a sewing needle) are much less likely to spread the virus than are hollow objects (such as an injection needle).  This data should transfer to knives as well.  In addtion, someone with HIV would have needed to cut themselves with the knife causing their blood to be on the object.  Then, you would need to cut yourself in a relatively short period of time as the HIV virus is not a particularly strong virus once it is exposed to the environment and dies quickly.  Having said that, if you are concerned you can request an HIV test.  There are several clinics that can do this test anonymously if you so desire.  The testing centers can discuss with you when to be tested as the timing varies depending on the test they use.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "A hyperaemic pharyngeal wall is indicative of pharyngitis which may be due to infective or non-infective causes. If by the terms \"risky unprotected intercourse\" you meant  unprotected oral sex with a suspicious partner,  you definitely suffered from an infective pharyngitis.   Infective pharyngitis is generally streptococcal, less commonly infectious mononucleosis, but oral sex may transmit some sexually transmitted diseases to the pharynx causing gonococcal, chlamydial or herpetic pharyngitis.  In infective pharyngitis, the person is acutely ill and may present with or without a fever, sore throat, pain on swallowing, enlarged tonsils and swollen lymph nodes on the neck region. Therefore, a sore throat, fever and swollen lymph nodes cannot be used as diagnostic criteria for HIV disease.  The mainstay of diagnosis for HIV disease is a positive test.

I still remain undeniably hyperemic along with the swollen nodes. Local docs say it may be because of a recurrent post-nasal drip.  I've had recurring drips since childhood, but this is the first time I've encountered this hyperemic condition. No pain, but there is some sort of a dull sensation along the walls. Also noticed quite a few odd bumps on the corners of the tongue along the walls.  Any thoughts on what this could be? and how I might try to remedy it?  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi blitz, Apologies aren't necessary. Transmission of HIV is typically by certain types of contact with an infected person. For example, sexual intercourse, sharing needles/syringes as in IV drug use, exposure to blood or body fluids, etc. So in answer to you question, can you contract Aids by hitting a wall, no you can't. If your state of mental well being is at question it would be advised to seek the care of a therapist/counselor. Fear of illness, situations, or conditions is produced by the unknown or lack of knowledge on a particular concern. Knowledge is essentially power, therefore decreasing fear of the unknown (if that makes sense), I hope this has been somewhat helpful. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

I was given oral antibiotics fucidin and ciprofloxacin,my blood count came back to normal but i still had low grade fever upto 99 in evening.My bone healing was slow as per orhopedic surgeons.They kept me under observation as i had very low grade cellulitis in my fractured leg but ortho surgeons thought that its only metal reaction as my CRP and X ray showed no infections in leg/Tibia  By 7th month when i was able to walk with stick..i met some girl with whom i had sexual encounter and soon after that within 2/3 days i developed acute viral infection,pus like discharge from back of throat,sore throat,thrush ,pinheads on pelate,post nasal dripping etc.I went to my physician screened me for TB,anti-dsDNA ,LFTs ,Chest Xray,Acid fast sputim culture,Every thing was fiine except Mantoux skin test which was 15mm andALT which was 164.My Gamma GT were also high.But Chest Xray and sputim culture were all fine.He thought i had crypogenic TB n precribed me anti TB drugs and checked my ALT levels again which came down to 74 from 164 after taking anti TB drugs for 10days,he thought i had tb in liver.But my ALT level again staarted to elevate and reached over 200 by 2nd month after initiating TB therapy Consequenly he stopped my medications and sent me to infectious desease specialist who who ruled out the possibilty of TB and screened me for HIV,HCV,HB,ceruloplasmin,ANA,Copper,VDRL,Infectious mono and TB DNA by PCR all reports at that time were negetive/non reactive.But my WBC were still andd neutrophils were still very slightly high.Blood culture and sensitivity test did not find any pathogen so he treated me with moxifloxacine for 15 days .my low grade 99 C fever which i had for months since my tibia surgery went away .But my sorethroat,thrush,post nasal drip,brain fog and flue like symptoms were still there.He screened me again for HIV and HCV after 6 and 8 months but they were non reactive.I wrote you an email after my test on 8th month post sexual contact with the girl who also had thrush and post nasal dripping and u said that might be unresolved sinus only.

It is reassuring that HIV, HCV, Infectious Mononucleosis and TB tests are reported negative on more than one occasion.  Two important investigations are missing in your post: 1. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the paranasal sinuses and  2. Fasting blood glucose level.  Pus-like discharge at the back of the throat (known as exudative pharyngitis) may be caused by various other conditions such as diphtheria, gonococcal and streptococcal infections, and infections with adenovirus and herpes simplex.   I would advise further investigations along these lines.    Dr Anthony Solomon Consultant Physician, Tropical & Genitourinary Medicine\n\n",

This may be related to the exudation (pus-like discharge) you are experiencing at the back of the throat (oropharynx).

Those who do not have the above risk factors are of course considered low risk. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

I had an HIV test in both Nov, and Dec. Both can back negative. Recently my glands in both my neck and under my arm have been bothersome(JAN). Now my girlfriend has a gland in her throat in the same place as me swollen. I have began to think. I am concerned that maybe the test did not have the right specifications or soemthing like that .

    "content": "The tests commonly used to detect HIV infection actually look for antibodies produced by your body to fight HIV. Most people will develop detectable antibodies within 3 months after infection, the average being 20 days. In rare cases, it can take 6-12 months. During the time between exposure and the test.  You will be coming up on the year mark in May.  If you have not engaged in any risky behaviour since May of last year at that time.  You will be in the clear in May.  It is highly unlikely that you are infected with HIV but is still of a concern.  See your doctor about your swollen glands, you may have an underylying disorder that has not yet been tested for.  Hope I have answered your questions.  MaryAnnRN\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I am extremely worried about the possibility of having contracted HIV.  I know I am absolutely stupid for what I have done, please do not talk about that as I am on the edge, I know so much that I have made a mess of things.  If nothing else I have learnt!   I had unprotected oral sex with a high risk lady, there was no other contact other than this.  I am fairly certain that I had no cuts in my mouth at the time.  Before this even actually happened I did have a strange tingling sensation around the edge of my tongue.    However after 3 weeks or so I caught a bit of a fever, nothing huge just a minor flu type.  I also started to get a very sore tongue, mainly on the tip and around the edge, it felt like someone sticking pins into it.  I used chloraseptic and after a period of perhaps 2 weeks the pain subsided.  I also had a bought of irregular (not diarrhea) but broken loose stools for about a month from the flu episode.  After all this cleared up I seemed to have a bit of a fungal infection on my penis, after a week or two this seems to have gone.  I also then had an itchy rash down my legs from my thighs down to about my calf muscles, after a week or so of Hydrocortisone cream I manged to clear this up.  I am know feel ing OK.  However I am more worried than can be described about the possibilities of infection.  Please can you give me an idea as to whether these problems could all be caused by stress or something else.  I will go for an HIV test however I would appreciate any opinions on the symptoms before I go so that I can best prepare myself.  Please offer some helpful advise so that I can summon the strength to get tested.  Thanks for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Big Boy,  No one  here is going o lecture you.  However, I must stress how important it is for you to go for a HIV test.  Now, if the first one is negative you still need to return in 3 months for a repeat test.  Reason being why it can take some persons up to 6 months from the last date of exposure to develop the antibodies for detection of this virus.  HIV testing is anomyous and most likely free if you visit your county health department.  Who ever you visit it is confidential.  As for your symptoms, I would see a doctor to rule out any other disease processes in the mean time.  One last thing, quit beating yourself up, we all make mistakes.  MaryAnnRN\n\n",

Not only is HIV a risk with dirty needles but other bloodborne illnesses as well, such as Hepatitis B and or Hepatitis C.  Bottom line make sure your piercer is using brand new or properly steriziled equipment.  Ask them and observe, if they refuse find someone else to do the piercing.  MaryAnnRN\n\n",

    "content": "My girlfriend had a general sexual health screening a couple of months back and a HIV test proved to be inconclusive. Five weeks later she had another test and the results were inconclusive again. The consultant said that she should take it that she was clear and that the tests were inconclusive because of a certain element of her blood. The thing is, five months ago i had unprotected sex with some one else and continued to have sex with my girlfriend. When she got the news of the first inconclusive tests i started to feel strange and developed what i think are painful lymph nodes that are still giving me grief, although do not seem swollen. I also had some muscle pains for a few days, and some flu symptoms. But i would normally get that this time of year anyway. Now i'm putting all these factors together and i'm thinking we both have HIV, or could it all be coincidential. My g/f had the tests five and ten weeks after the first time we had sex following my encounter. I know the only way to find out is to get tested but i'm so scared as to what the outcome will be because i will be devestated if i did this to my loved one. Are there any other conditions with similar symptoms. Is there any way you can reassure me, or does it look like we're doomed??\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I was exposed to hiv when I had condom failure about four and half months ago, I have tested negative at 6,8,10,12,14,and 16 weeks, a combination of ELISAand rapid tests, the last one being Abbott's Determine HIV1/2 assay. my worry is I have since the exposure noticed palpable lymph nodes in my neck and armpits, and possibly in the epitrochlear region, and also I have intermittent pruritus.  my question is, should I continue with further HIV tests,since the last one was at four months and was negative?Thelymph nodes and the pruritus are what have me really worried. Please, somebody help me with advice, because I really need it. Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Thanks for your advice. yes, I did consider pcr, but it's done at only one lab in Accra, and as you can guess, it's very expensive, so it's not an option for me at the moment.I am planning on testing again at five months, and then God willing, it would be negative, and then I hope I won't have to test again at six months(if I can resist the impulse). You are right though, I am obssessed about it, especially on those days that i itch. I convince myself that the four month negative test is conclusve, since most people seroconvert between 2 to 8 weeks, but to allow for individual differences, the three month post exposure window period. then I get a day or two of pruritus, and I am convinced all over again that I must have it.Of course, the lymph nodes are always there.I am so scared, and it's almost ruining my life, the worry, I mean.In Nairobi, what is the window period?\n\n",

    "content": "There's no need to worry about shortage of oxygen making you more susceptible to HIV.  Blood does not carry enough oxygen to be a big factor in killking germs.  This idea may have started because in some people with a poor blood supply to their feet, infections are more likely to start, but there is in that case a serious oxygen shortage and fewer white blood cells to fight infection. Your immune system tends to stay healthy if you are not malnourished and have a balanced diet.  So don't worry unless you only eat junk food or fast food.  Often having more than one or two alcoholic drinks also has a negative effect on nutrition and the immune system. It is much more important to follow other measures to decrease the chances you will have intimate contact with other people's blood.  You can't tell is someone has a sexually transmitted disease, but watch for sores, don't have sex unless you are comfortable enough to talk about sexual history.  People who seldom change partners are safer.\n\n",

    "content": "hi druv, presently Im doing a research on HIV infected patients and have gathered lot of knowledge and information on them and their medications too.. have also met a lot of HIV infected people and collected a lot of valuable information from them too. A few of them told me and were in favour of combivir which actually does not cure AIDS and do not prevent it from being spread to others, but they do help to slow down the progression of the disease. This may help to delay the development of problems related to AIDS or HIV disease. The recommended dose for adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older is one tablet  twice daily. For adults weighing less than 50 kg, children below 12 years of age, and people with reduced kidney function, it is recommended that lamivudine and zidovudine be taken separately so that doses can be adjusted as needed.  Many things can affect the dose of medication that a person needs, such as body weight, other medical conditions, and other medications.\n\n",

I do not have any inflammation of the lmyph nodes. But i do have tonsilitis..but i have this problem since childhood...its perennial for me. I had diarrhoea twice but for just a day or 2. But that i guess was due to eating outside in a restuarant.........can u pls tell me if i really have HIV or is it just my fear.am i a classic example of a hypochondriac\n\n",

It is illegal to test for HIV without patient consent so if you did not sign a paper saying you would like to be tested for HIV/Aids, most likely, you were not tested for it.  If you have concern that you might be infected & do not wish to wait, there may be a chance that the tests that were run were in the appropriate tubes that the lab can \"add on\" the test for you after consent is obtained. If not, ask your doctor to reorder you the lab test so you can go.   Best of luck\n\n",

Well, normally aids is givin to a child by its parent on birth, but there is a drug or somthing that prevents this.   But if, by the age of 1yr it tests negative it could most likly be so. Even though aids takes a while to develop I am not sure how long in a child...  If the child hasn't been born yet i suggest trying that drug that I mentioned. Somthing...\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there,  I am a little confused given all the information that is available on the net these days.  The thing is, in July 2003 I met a man and had unprotected sex with him twice. Then shortly thereafter I found out that the girl he was with before me slept around.   I then met my current boyfriend in November 2003 and we started a sexual relationship which was and still is unprotected. Then in December 2003 my boyfriend was diagnosed with glandular fever (he actually went into hospital and they did blood tests). Apparently, one month before this his friend also had glandular fever but he was never physically close to his friend as they are both male and hetrosexual so I am not sure whether my boyfriend could have contracted it this way. I am just so worried that the glandular fever he was diagnosed with is more sinister, i.e. HIV. I have read that glandular fever symptoms are more or less the same as the onset symptoms of HIV. Could it be that even though he was diagnosed with glandular fever it could be HIV?   I am just so worried. We have discussed it and are taking the test sometime next week. However, in the meantime, I was wondering whether somebody with expert qualifications could shead some light on the subject.  Many thanks.\n\n",

Therefore, it is not unlikely that your boyfriend could have contracted the disease by droplets of saliva from his male friend, assuming of course that the disease was accurately doctor-diagnosed for his friend.  Yes, acute HIV infection, (as well as CMV infection and toxoplasmosis) may be indistinguishable from infectious mononucleosis. Blood tests would have been helpful in exclusion of the various causes. Was your boyfriend tested for the various causes of lymph node enlargement when he went into hospital?  Due to the history of multiple sexual partners and unprotected sex, both of you have made the right decision to take the test. Ask to be examined for HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies plus p24 Antigen. This combination testing allows for earlier detection of HIV disease from Week 4 after contact and provides reassurance.

I think his friend was actually diagnosed with glandular fever, however, I am not sure as to the extent of the tests my boyfriend had, all the hospital told us was that he had glandular fever and should just take asprin.  Before going for the tests at an actual doctor's surgery/hospital, we purchased two HIV tests from an internet site, these are manufactured by Tysonbio.  We did both tests and both tests came out negative. I am not too sure how accurate these are but it has certainly made me feel better about going to see the doctor which I am due to do soon when I go to my family planning doctor for repeat contraceptive medication.  Again, thank you for all your help.\n\n",

That was my first sexual experience in my life. I don't know the status of that guy I had sex with. He seems to be \"playing\" all over the place. So I am really really worried that I might get infected with HIV. So I got tested on 4 weeks mark, ELISA test, and it was negative. The doctor told me that I do not need anymore testing. According to him, the risk was low and that I am healthy. But I got scared again, so I got another test yesterday (6 weeks mark), OraQuick 20 minute blood test, and it was negative too. The guy (not sure if he is a doctor or a nurse practitioner) told me again that I do not need anymore testing. I read that in order for the test to be conclusive and definitive, it has to be taken on 3 months mark. But two professionals have told me that I don't need the 3months-mark test. Can I trust them? I just want to get over my worriness. Also, is the oraquick test reliable? Thank you\n\n",

This all started after working at a daycare.  I have had 3 CBC tests done and all of the blood work has been fine, although I know this does not mean I do not have HIV either.    I am going to make yet another dr. appointment next week and try to work the nerve to ask for a HIV test (the dr is a family friend and I am terrified of the results).  I have had casual sex with a few men, but none that I'm aware that had HIV, which of course does not bring any peace of mind.  Does this sound like it could be HIV or is it an incredibly persistant gland problem.  PLease tell me if anyone has any ideas.\n\n",

The aspect of being \"afraid\" to ask your physician for the test verses having that ruled out will alleviate you emotionally in the long run.

    "content": "The mainstay of diagnosis for HIV disease is a positive test. Prompt diagnosis of HIV infection is important for several reasons. Treatments are available that slow the decline of the function of the immune system; these therapies have been associated with substantial declines in HIV-associated morbidity and mortality. HIV-infected persons with altered immune function have increased susceptibility to infections for which preventive measures are available. Because of its effect on the immune system, HIV affects the diagnosis, evaluation, treatment, and follow-up of many other diseases and may affect the efficacy of antimicrobial therapy for some STDs.  Finally, the early diagnosis of HIV enables health-care providers to counsel affected persons, refer them to various support services and help prevent HIV transmission to others.

Then, roughly two weeks ago, I recieved unprotected oral sex from another girl.  What has me worried, is that once I started reading about possible HIV symptoms, I started getting paranoid, and now feel like I have some pain under my right (and only right) armpit. No pain in the neck. I spoke to the first girl again today, she stated that she had recently been tested for STDs AGAIN, and was still negative for everything.  Regardless, I am going to see a doctor to get tested. My mind tells me my risk for HIV is not terribly high, but I think that my paranoia is making me see symptoms that aren't there. Any thoughts, just to ease my mind a little, and perhaps make it a little less nerve-wracking to go get tested?\n\n",

However, if you read my post well, you would have noted that I advised combination testing for the p24 antigen, in addition to the HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies.  The polymerase chain reaction you recommended is currently available as HIV 1 Proviral (Cellular) DNA by PCR. It is recommended from Day 10 after contact. It does not detect HIV 2 although it is more sensitive than the combination test for HIV 1. The cost is prohibitive in the developed world - about $290 compared with about $45 for the combination testing.   If you were in this person's position and wanted reassurance, which would you opt for, as a preliminary test for both strains?  While you are entitled to your own opinion on our message boards, it is  misleading to state that \u201dHIV is incredibly difficult to vector heterosexually\u201d.

    "content": "I am a 32 year old male and I am terrified that I have HIV.  I am hetero, and had one partner in 1993-1995 who thought that they may be at risk from a former lover who had been an IV drug user. We were both tested in 1994 and the result was negative.  I asked the first girl directly in 1999 if she was clear, and she thinks yes, but was never tested again. She had a baby 5 months ago and they both seem to be in good health.  Through the years, I have had recurring folliculitis, often in my scalp, but mainly on my beard and upper arms. Sometimes on my chest where I am quite hairy and a little bit on my legs.. I have also had sort of tingling lips and when I wipe them there is some pale moistness that comes off my lower lip (Candida?) but never seen any thrush growth in my mouth like I see on the typical example pictures.  My tongue also has a white coating on it all the time now, but it does not scrape off like I think thrush does...  I have also recently been bothered with sore, itchy eyes and a headache. I feel mainly fine in the morning, then from noon onwards the headache and eyes creep in to be worse.  I have had a persistant dry cough and chest pain lasting more than three weeks and my doctor has diagnosed it as Asthmatic Bronchitis. Then he prescribed Betamethasone, a systemic steroid. My worry is that if I was suffering from some OI, that the steroid would just lower my immunity further and open the door to even moew problems. I did have a chest x-ray and lung function, blood gas test, which probably would have shown up something like PCP right?  Is it possible that I am having some/all of these symptoms as a result of stress and worry? I cannot describe the level of panic that enters me when I think that I could have HIV. I am now married and my wife is pregnant and I have not discussed any of this with her out of fear. I have to say that the panic I have is almost incapacitating at times. My wife had an HIV test as part of the normal pregnancy course and it was also negative. Since we have been together for 7 years, during which time I have not had unprotected sex with anyone, I could take this as a clear sign couldn't I?  I know the sensible thing would be to go and get tested again right? But I have to say that the experience of the test is so terrifying to me I really can't bring myself to do it... I have already been tested negative right?\n\n",

    "content": "You need to discuss ALL of this with your MD. Let him/her know what your fears are, and why you have them.   The symptoms you describe could be any number of things, and don't necessarily point to HIV infection. The white on your tongue could be from yeast overgrowth due to antibiotics. Folliculitis can be from something as simple as using an irritating soap.  Quit trying to diagnose yourself. Do yourself a favor and GO GET TESTED. No amount of reassurance from anyone is going to truly give you the peace of mind that a test result will. If it's negative, then you can relax and some of your anxiety issues may resolve. If it's positive, then you can begin treatment, as well as do what you need to do to protect your wife from contracting it, which you should be doing already if it's even a concern.  Please go get tested.  Good luck to you.\n\n",

You're going to be anxious either way, it seems like, so just go get it. At least your anxiety will be for something that is going to give you results instead of worrying about possibilities.  Here's something I found on \"white tongue\" with one search on Google. It's a listing of things that could cause oral thrush:  Respiratory infections  Dentures  Poorly fitted dentures  Dental appliances  Diabetes  Poorly controlled diabetes  undiagnosed diabetes  Certain viral infections  Mononucleosis  Dry mouth (type of Dental conditions) - and the various causes of dry mouth  Sjogren's syndrome - causing dry mouth  Xerostomia  Thyroid disorders  Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (type of Candidiasis)  Chronic hyperplastic candidiasis  Vaginal yeast infections - may spread to the mouth of an infant.  AIDS  Immunocompromise diseases  Immunodeficiency  Cancer  Corticosteroid treatments  Antibiotic treatment - thrush can occur as a side effect of antibiotics, particularly in infants.   Do you see that HIV is only one of many things??  GO GET THE TEST.  (BTW, my personal opinion is that your risk seems to be low... but I am not a doctor. Go see yours and GET THE TEST.)

    "content": "First off, please relax   Now even if a person had unprotected sex with someone who was HIV+, they would NOT develop symptoms of HIV \"the next day\" - that's just not possible at all.  Maybe this girl had a cold and from kissing and such, you contracted just that - a cold?   Have you had unprotected sex with anyone SINCE that time 9 months ago?  What about before her....................?  If your HIV test way back then was negative..........and your 2nd one was negative............assuming you haven't been participating in any risky behavior (unprotected sex, use of IV drugs) between those 2 tests, I wouldn't think you need to worry about HIV.  Generally if a person contracts HIV, the longest period of time it's going to take to be detectable in the blood (the antibodies to HIV), is 6 months.    So you're saying your last test for what you feel is \"thrush\" still in your mouth - was negative (it's very easy to detect), then maybe all you're seeing is just a coated tongue?    I get the feeling that you're just very upset about having had unprotected sex with a stranger.........and maybe you're \"looking for\" symptoms of HIV?    It sounds like your doctor has done proper testing.\n\n",

ANSWER: Yes.   Or it could be a sign of about a million other things.  The only REAL SIGN of HIV is an anti-body blood test which is returned by lab with POSITIVE.   Today, there is no excuse not to get this quick, effective, reliable, and easily available test done.  Why would you think it's HIV? Are you prone to being overly concerned about HIV infection, or your health in general..?  I'm NOT a Dr, but my guess would be that your symptoms have nothing to do with HIV, and we would need to know a lot more before making a better guess, and then again, why bother when it is such a simple blood test to take.  Your background, risk groups, suspected infection event, and much more could be used to give you a better idea until your results come in.  Whatever it is, HIV is a VERY manageable (albeit serious) condition and you should find out sooner rather than later to improve your quality of life and longevity.  Be well...Michael\n\n",

    "content": "You sound like there is a lot going on inside, which usually means there's a lot going on outside your body too.  Are you allowing stress and anxiety to rule the choices you make?  Have you considered just getting an HIV test to rule out the possibility that your symptoms are related to HIV exposure..(Doesn't sound at all like they are HIV specific to me), BUT, I am NOT a Dr, so you should consider seeing one.  It's so simple. There are so many reasons today to get tested. There's no reason to drive yourself crazy guessing. The simple, easily available HIV test is the GOLD STANDARD for determining if you have been exposed.  Ten years ago, I was a firm believer in NOT getting tested, but today, there's no excuse.  The symptoms you mention are very general. Have you thought about having a full physical to test for all possibilities..?   It sounds like it could be something as simple as anemia, thyroid function, or one of hundreds of other very treatable conditions. Some things to specifcally mention are the stomach soreness. The sleep \"jerking\" I believe is totally normal...We all have it, and there is a ton of info on the web about it by doing a search.  Urine and bowel condtions could be ANYTHING. Certainly stress can easily cause these things, but anything from a simple case of food-poinsoning, to a drug side effect, to the foods you eat, possibly an allergy, or even a UTI. Certain viatmins, suppliments, or ingredients (ie: sugar free gummy bears send me straight to the bathroom .  Speaking of vitamins, are you eating a healthy, balanced diet? Are you on a weight loss diet of any kind?  SO -- Tip Number One: Go get tested for HIV (anoyomously if you like). A negative test will do wonders for your stress level and I'll bet reduce some if not all of your \"symptoms\".\n\n",

This is the same drug that you refer to as TMP/SMX protocol, so the doctors in the rural hospital are administering the right treatment.  For patients who cannot tolerate this drug, or who have not responded to it, pentamidine isetionate is an alternative. However, this drug is potentially toxic because it can cause severe hypotension. An adjunctive treatment which can be life-saving in those with severe PCP is corticosteroid therapy that should ideally be started at the same time as anti-pneumocystis  therapy.

I am in a committed, monogomous relationship with a person who has also tested negative (past a three-month window period) since we've been together.  About six months ago, I was getting ready to go to a wedding with other members of the wedding party. One of the other people (HIV status unknown to me) was shaving. He filled the sink with warm water to rinse his razor. I proceeded to shave next to him, using my own razor but on occasion dipping it into the water.  I do not remember bleeding but since I often nick myself while shaving, it's possible I did. I don't recall if he bled either, although for arguement's sake let's assume he did.  I understand HIV is a weak virus which does not live outside its host for long and based on my limited knowledge, I would classify this incident as low-risk but for whatever reason I am quite worried about it.

    "content": "Hi. I've had a small, pea-sized lump in my armpit for over a year now. (It protrudes from the sking) I've been to two doctors: one told me it was a swollen lymph node and prescribed me antibiotics, and the other told me it was an ingrown hair, but both told me it was due to shaving irritation. I haven't had any other weird symptoms (i feel hotter but i have no chills, it might be the warmer weather or my anxiety). I'm scared I might have HIV or hodgkin's disease. Is it plausible to think that, or am I probably freaking out? I suffer from anxiety and depression (if you couldn't tell), so I feel like I'm worrying myself to death. I know I should get an HIV test done (though I don't have any evidence of being exposed to it) but every time I start to go I panic and don't go. I know that's really bad and stupid, but I can't. Do you think I have reason to worry, or is my doctor probably right? Sometimes my armpit itches. I have stuff on the sides of my tongue, but I constantly bite my cheeks, so I think that may be what it is, because it doesn't quite look like the pictures of hairy leukoplakia, and it looks like there are teeth marks etched into it. I know I'm probably freaking out, but what do you think? The only medication I take are vitamins and ortho-tricyclen. Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Sometimes HIV/AIDS can lay dormant for years and the person remains asymptomatic unaware they have it. Some of the many, many symptoms of HIV/AIDS that you couldn\u2019t miss would be weight loss, frequent fevers that would register on a thermometer, thrush in the mouth caused by a yeast infection, severe vaginal yeast infections, chronic herpes sores in the mouth, genitals and anal areas, long periods of continuous coughing, increasing shortness of breath, chronic skin rashes, and more than one gland would be swollen.  Lymph nodes help the body\u2019s defense system fight infections and localized swelling usually indicate infection in the area. Swelling of only one gland for a year isn\u2019t the usual response of the lymph system. Your gland may be plugged or have a tumor in it. You didn\u2019t mention if it hurt you, painless swellings are important to tell your Health Care Provider about again. You may need to have it tested for a tumor or cancer.\n\n",

    "content": "Well, I'm somewhat relieved, but I'm still going to get tested just to be sure, as well as talk to my doctor about my anxiety! As for whether or not the bump is painful, I didn't notice it until one day I just felt it (I used to have this weird habit of touching my armpit while watching tv, weird, yes, i know). It not painful, but it does seem like it (and sometimes even the armpit itself) feels tender or tingly sometimes, but nothing extreme. Sometimes it itches, but it might be my bra rubbing against the skin or even other irritation.I had just started taking birth control (maybe a month) when I noticed it, so I thought maybe it was lumped breast tissue (since they swell and all that). The two doctors I saw both said it was related to shaving and told me to use just deodorant, but I'm just concerned since it's been here so long. One also said that it was a swollen lymph node, but my regular doctor said it was merely an ingrown hair-are they ever permanent? Do you recommend having a biopsy done, or do you think that I should just forget about it? I'm driving my mother crazy and I'm sure it's nothing, but I still feel uncomfortable not really knowing what it is. Thank you very much. I'm sure it's not always fun work responding to hypochondriacs, and so I commend you:)\n\n",

I immediately thought of the possibility of HIV, but I didn't want to say anything to scare him if I were jumping to conclusions.  My question is, should I tell him my concern or would the doctor perform a thorough medical evaluation on his girlfriend if she presented a rash on her shoulder for more than a month?  I was consumed with anxiety during my worry, and I don't want to put either of them through that if it's unnecessary.  Thanks for your advice!\n\n",

    "title": "Question for Dr. or anyone with knowledge of HIV-2.",
    "content": "Doctor,   This question might be out of your area but since you ve been helpful to me in the past I agreed to ask.   I was speaking recently to a close family friend of ours, who does not have internet access, about this site, and she asked me if I would post a question on her behalf.   She is concerned about having contracted HIV-2 from a sex toy (dildo) she borrowed from a friend some years back. Apparently she had found it in a friends home and used it on herself without a condom. This happend 7-8yrs ago, so she does not recall all of the details expect for a few. She noted the dildo looked clean, with no visible blood or other bodily fluids present, she recalls washing it with hot water before using it. She may have used alcohol and/or soap but she cannot recall. Again, she found the toy in a drawer, she did not use it immediately after someone else. She is still friends with this person but never told her about what she had done. She notes that her friend appears healthy and has never known her to have sex with an african man.   She's (my friend) had 2-3 HIV tes'st since then, all have been negative. Her concern is over the fact that she was only screened for HIV-1 not HIV-2.   I have some knowledge on the subject so I told her that HIV is very sensitive and cannot survive long outside the body and since the dildo was lying in a drawer for a time, drying of bodily fluids would kill the virus, if it were even present, and that hot water would kill it as well. I also informed her that HIV-2 is much weaker that HIV-1 and less transmittable, and that it had less of a viral load. I also mentioned that it is very rare in this country and primarily found in western Africa. I told her that while most HIV exams in this country only test for HIV-1, they can detect HIV-2 in 60-90% of cases.   What propmted her concern was the fact that she had gotten sick twice in the last month (she recoverd from bronchitis only to get a cold 3 weeks later) something that has never happend to her before, so she became worried that there was something wrong with her immune system and naturally feared HIV. I told her that colds and bronchitis are commone during the winter months, and that if she had been infected it would take longer than 8yrs to develop AIDS and even if it didnt, AIDS symptoms (opportunisitc infections) would be much more severe and include things like weight loss, constant fever, pneumonia, kaposi sarcoma, meningitis, numbness and other rarer infections, not a cold. So basically I told her not to worry, but she's sort of a hypochandriac (like me) so she wanted to get a doctors opinion.\n\n",

    "title": "FEAR OF HIV FROM SEX TOY",
    "content": "Hello,  Your close family friend has zero percent chance of contracting the HIV virus from the sex toy, taking into consideration the precautions she took before using it. In addition, the fact that the item was lying in a drawer for some time, apparently unused, makes the possibility very unlikely.  No mention is made of unsafe encounters with sexual partners, which also works in her favour.  Could this be one information she has not disclosed to you, or is it possible that one of her partners has recently been diagnosed with HIV disease?  The comments you made about the HIV test must be inaccurate. I am very familiar with the HIV test kits. For several years now, all HIV test kits check for both strains of the virus.  However, while some kits can test for both strains and identify the specific strain that is positive (1 or 2), other kits will test for both strains and deliver a positive result if either strain is positive, without necessarily identifying the particular strain. Any positive test is usually subjected to a confirmatory test.   The mainstay of diagnosis for HIV disease is a positive test for either strain.  As your  friend is worried, she should consider having another test done to alleviate her fear. Unfortunately, you have not stated the date of her last test.

To my knowledge none of my partners has ever been diagnosed with HIV disease. As I have only had 2 in all my 28yrs, it was easy to figure this out.  my last HIV test was in 2/2004, one year ago. My \"encounter\" with the toy in question was  a few years before that.   Whenever I've  had an HIV test done, its always been part of an annual physical, using the same blood sample the lab uses for CBC and the like.  This is was what may last lab report in 2/2004 read:  HIV-1 AB, EIA non reactive HIV-1 AB W/confrim., NY  (this was blank, I guess due to the nonreactive EIA)  Because the report made mention specifically of HIV-1 I didn't think they tested me for HIV-2.   Also, as emmy stated, I may or maynot have used soap and/or alcohol to clean it.  I do recall washing it with hot water and that it was in my girl friends drawer and it \"looked\" clean. am I still ok, without the soap and alcohol, do you think?  thanks so much for your help, what a great service, i seriouslly have to get my internet up and running again.  please respond to this post, as emmy will check it for me.  thanks again,\n\n",

    "content": "Yes, you are right when you state that you were only tested for HIV 1 AB. I am really surprised to note that this was as recent as February 2004.  I do not know the reason, but I know that most laboratories all over the world test for HIV 1 & 2 AB when an investigation for HIV disease is conducted.  To alleviate your fears, I suggest that you undergo combination testing of HIV-1 and -2 antibodies and HIV p24 antigen. This method allows for earlier detection of HIV infection.  Washing with hot water, combined with the apparent non-use of the sex toy by its owner just before you used it, should still be regarded as safe.   Please update me with results of your test if you decide to go ahead with it.  Dr Anthony Solomon\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 27 year old female and about 3 months ago I received oral sex. A couple days later I started feeling like I may be getting a bladder infection or a herpes outbreak (which I was diagnosed with about 7 years ago). I also was having inflammed hemrroids which I often have problems with. I went to the doctor and he said my hemrroids were inflammed but I also had an infected vaginal gland in the area between my vagina and anas, (not sure if this is a bartholin gland). He prescribed me antibiotics (flagyl) and it cleared up right away. Now I am wondering if I should be conceerned about HIV. A couple weeks before the oral sex I was having some problems with my period and they had done a pap smear. Now I am concerned that I had open cuts from that and my hemrroids which may have allowed salive to enter and caused my infected gland and may have caused HIV infection. I did not come in to contact wirh semen at all. When reading other inquires I noticed you said HIV has been spread through receptive fellatio and incertive cunnilingus. What does this mean? IF I donate blood will they tell me if I have something and is 3 months too early to test? Should I be concerned at all? Thank you for your prompt response.\n\n",

    "content": "Please note that the first response to your mail was not posted by a member of the medical crew at this website. I shall give you the possibilities in respect of the questions you have raised.  You received oral sex (cunninglingus) from a partner at a time when you had bleeding or infected lesions around the anogenital region. You wish to know if you should be concerned about the possibility of contracting HIV.  Technically, in cunninglingus, it is possible to spread HIV to the receptive partner if your partner is HIV positive and had a bleeding lesion in his mouth or tongue which made contact, directly or through blood-stained saliva, with any open or bleeding lesions on your genitalia or anal region.  You should be concerned if your partner\u2019s HIV status is unknown and he had a bleeding lesion in his mouth or tongue which made contact, directly or through blood-stained saliva, with any open or bleeding lesions on your genitalia or anal region.  Blood, semen, and vaginal fluids of infected persons contain HIV virus. The virus in an infected person\u2019s saliva is usually in very low quantities not enough to infect another person and evidence suggests that saliva has protective factors that inactivate HIV when the virus comes into contact with it.  It is possible that HIV could be transmitted by saliva in the absence of bleeding lesions, but available statistics and studies suggest that it does not happen. The degree of risk is determined by the amount of saliva and the presence of open or bleeding lesions as stated earlier.  If you are worried, a blood test for HIV is the mainstay of diagnosis for the disease and will give you peace of mind. Three months is a good interval within which to undergo the test, but you must request for it or give your consent.

The mainstay of diagnosis for HIV disease is a positive blood test. A negative blood test will provide reassurance.  The swelling you had under the skin adjacent to your ear is suggestive of an inflamed lymph node which, according to you, has disappeared with self-administered antibiotics. It is possible that  the painful sensation you had on swallowing was related to an upper respiratory tract infection (infection of the tonsils or pharynx) which could have caused  lymph node enlargement at the angle of the jaw (which you described as \u201cunder the ear\u201d).

Through my own research I had deducted that of all the oral manifestations of HIV infection, and that the only two that are similar to my own condition are OC and OHL. However, I should have been more clear because the \"white coating\" on my tongue is NOT present on the sides or underneath. It stops rather abruptly as it approaches the sides of my tongue, and doesn't resemble any pictures of OHL that I've seen, so I feel confident in ruling that out. My symptoms don't match any of the 4 types of OC that you've described either; the white area is not made up of plaques (it's more a coating, as you'd see from not brushing your teeth all day), no cracking or redness at the corners of my mouth, and no patchy redness on the hard palette, etc... In any case, my primary complaint is not the white coating of my tongue, it is the small white bumps on my tongue and the rough/burning sensation that has been with me throughout these past couple of months. The bumps are pinsized, not immediatly noticable, only present on the top of my tongue, and mostly towards the front. The rough/burning sensation is elusive and mild, but bothersome nonetheless. I cannot find any description of any disease that matches my symptom, and that's what is driving me crazy. I think my question is, what could be going on with me? Have you ever heard of anything that sounds like my problem, or a symptom of anything that resembles mine? In the later stages of HIV infection, when T-cell counts drop and opputunistic infections begin, wouldn't an individuals overall health decline? or could he/she have an isolated symptom like thrush and feel 100percent healthy besides? And lastly, if my symptom is not an oral cavity disease normally associated with AIDS/HIV, then could it just be a complication of the mouth trauma and infection that I suffered a couple prior to the onset of these symptoms? I'm sorry to ask so many questions, but none of the answers that I've found seem to explain what I'm going through, they only seem to make more questions. Thanks again for your help and your time, I really appreciate it more than you know.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello again,  It appears that by your own inspection and self-examination, you are confident that you do not have Oral Hairy Leukoplakia. That should be reassuring to you, because as I stated earlier, the condition appears almost exclusively in HIV disease.   In your previous note, you stated that your doctor commented that the state of your gums and tongue was not impressive. What was his diagnosis? Is your dental hygiene satisfactory? Are you a chronic smoker? Are you on any long term medication?   The descriptions you give of \u201csmall, hardly noticeable, pin-sized white bumps on your tongue and a burning sensation\" are insufficient for any doctor to arrive at a diagnosis. A good history and  examination are mandatory, preferably under an oral surgeon, who may decide to conduct some tests. It is unethical to attempt a diagnosis without examination.  As we state on this site, the information we provide is designed to support, not replace, the relationship existing between a site visitor and his/her physician.    I note from your correspondences that you have done an extensive research on HIV disease and viewed several clinical photographs. I am of the opinion that you are very worried of the possibility that your complaints may be HIV-related.  You are right to state that in later stage HIV disease when opportunistic infections develop, an individual\u2019s health will decline to an extent that it is apparent.  In your own case, you maintain that your general health is satisfactory. Since you claim you have no risk factors and you are generally in good health, would a (negative) HIV test not give you peace of mind?.  It is not unlikely that you are suffering from a benign condition termed GLOSSODYNIA. This is burning and pain of the tongue which may occur with or without an inflammation of the tongue. It is associated with diabetes, use of certain medications, tobacco, xerostomia, candidiasis and nutritional deficiencies. Once again, I am advising you to consult a doctor who specializes in diseases of the oral cavity for diagnosis and  reassurance.    Thank you for coming back to our website with your problems. Merry Christmas!   Dr Anthony Solomon MB BS DTM&H DIP.VEN FRSM Consultant Physician, Tropical & Genitourinary Medicine\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Dwebmaiden,  i think that there is a debate about when to start treatment. There is a recommendation to start treatment as soon as possible to arrest the viral replication with more than one drug.  The medications have side effects and the patient has to agree to be compliant with the medications and never stops taking the medications unless agreed to by his doctor as not being compliant with the medications or stopping taking the medication and then start out of one's own mind means that the virus will soon be resistant to the medications and that a different regimen will need to be found and sometimes this is not easy.  Certain antimicrobials will be given for prophylaxis against certain infections if and when the aids infection becomes advanced.  This is link to guidelines for treatment  This is a link to the nih info page on aids  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.

I was seeing this girl for about a month or so...we never had sex...but there was a couple of times we had unprotected oral sex (from her to me and me to her) and during those couple of times niether of us ever came. I did finger her on a few occasions as well...and it should be known that I am a habitual nail and \"skin around the nail\" biter...so sometimes there are little cuts and pieces of skin missing around my fingernails. I'm almost positive i wasnt actually bleeding when I did this. Anyways...I found out later that she had herpes. 11 weeks later...I developed a fever that lasted 10 days...with shaking chills for the first 3....and some phlegm towards the end. I went to the doctor...had a chest X-ray and was diagnosed with pneumonia...got antibiotics and it cleared up. 6 months later...I have alot of phlegm I'm continually hacking up from my lungs. My doctor put me on avelox and there was no help from it. I went back...had a CBC...it was normal...and another chest X-ray...which came back negative for Pneumonia. I am taking decongestants and a ADVAIR inhaler...and it seems to be helping significantly.   I am 27...and was smoking marijuana regularly for about 5-6 yrs...and at times...almost ever day. I quit after getting over the pneumonia...and have been clean for 6 months.  I was wondering was my \"risky\" behavior with that girl is worrisome for HIV...or are these aliments in response to the marijuana?  Thankyou for taking the time to help me out  Jim.\n\n",

I am too scared to find out that I might have HIV, because I did have an accident with a guy who\u2019s sexual behaviours are suspicious.

Here is what happened and I just want to know if I should be worried. About two weeks ago I ran into an acquaintance and she and I ended up spending much of the evening later on privately. First things first, we did not engage in sexual intercourse.  I did however engage in prolonged stimulation of her genital area. This was through her underwear, and I did not feel any real moistness, but the contact was prolonged.  I DO NOT BELIEVE that I had any cuts on my fingers, and of course for infection to occur she has HIV to begin with.  I find the possibility unlikely as among other things she just recently got out of a year long relationship. Granted I am just assuming that she is in a lower risk demographic, but she does come from a strong family, and is not an intrevenious (sp??) drug user, and is quite obsessed with her physical well being.  She is a fitness model, and we did not engage in intercourse because neither of us had a condom.  So I am assuming that she takes care of herself. Basically, I am wonderring how concerned I should be over the risk of HIV exposure. I have had a recent blood test that came back negative.  However, I do know that it takes about three months for the antibodies that are indicative of infection to show up.  I do plan on getting retested in two and a half months. Should I be worried, or am I being paranoid?? Thank you very much in advance.\n\n",

    "content": "I am going to try to keep this short.  I am a British citizen living in Thailand.  Not unlike many men living here I met a Thai woman who quickkly became my girlfriend.  We have been together for nearly two years.  She recently fell very ill and went home to her family and was hospitalized.  I took time off of work to go and see her.  I queried the doctor as to her condition and he told me (after consulting her), that she had \"Cryptococcol Menigitis (viral) and Phnuemonia\" (my spelling is probably wrong, sorry).  I looked up all the applicable information on that stuff.  Anyway, I was sitting with her and a friend comes in speaks with her in Thai.  I speak a bit of Thai and was intrigued by some of the conversation; as it implied something I didn't already know.  Seeking out the friend later and with a short conversation I learned that my girlfriend has HIV/AIDS and had not told for fear of me deserting her.  I do not know how long she has had the virus (at least two years, I presume).  My question is what is the prognosis of someone who has HIV/AIDS for more than two years who is now ill with the aforementioned illnesses?  It would seem quite dire.  I know that many reports say 10-12 years after infection AIDS sets in, but this is average and not applicable in all cases.  I would assume that if she has these illnesses now that she has reached the stage of AIDS and recovery from these illnesses, if it happens, will only be temporary before re-infection, correct?  Ultimately it is these opportunistic diseases that casue the death of an AIDS patient right?  And as I queried, if she has them now it can't be good right?  Am I kidding myself in thinking that she may live another 5-10 healthy years?  I have been tested for HIV as part of a routine physical recenlty and was negative.  I only have protected sex with my girlfriend.  I know I should be tested again in six months and I will.  I could really use some guidance on this.  I think our sexual relationship as boyfriend/girlfriend is obviously over, but I would like to beleive that I am good human being and will remain there for her during this time that she needs someone most.  I am onviously hurt that she lied to me and kept the truth from me; but that is more social, and I will let you guys stick to the medical stuff.  Many thanks for your thougths on this in advance.\n\n",

Cryptococcus is a fungus and infection in AIDS patients is an opportunistic one. 90% of those with cryptococcal pnemonia also have cryptococcal meningitis.  As you suggested, up to 80% of deaths among AIDS patients are a direct result of an opportunistic infection other than HIV. So the prognosis is rather grim.   To prevent recurrence of these infections if they are cured, patients will have to be placed on antifungals for life.  Please refer to this abstract of an article published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1990. It is concerned with the prognosis of AIDS patients with cryptococcal infection receiving different therapeutic regimens.  Click here!

I was just wondering the risk of me having caught HIV from it.  A  month or two later, I was tested for all the other STDS except HIV....I went to a clinic to get tested, I fainted after the speculum thing(testing for the reg STDs not including HIV) and they wouldn't draw blood from me becuase they feared I would faint again. I think I fainted because I was so nervous! It all came out negative. ANyways, I worry everyday about how I could have it...I'm so afraid to get tested or anything. Basically, I just wanted know if oral sex was a high risk activity...and how I could know if I am infected. The friend didn't ejaculate or anything, and I didn't swallow during the entire time. I don't know if this matters...but right now I have a throat infection and was very weak last week, but it's clearing up. Sorry I wrote so much, I am just so worried. Thanks in advance.\n\n",

    "content": "Oral sex is a much less efficient mode of transmission of HIV than is receptive anal intercourse. However, This does not mean that oral sex, particularly among homosexual men, can be proposed as a form of \"safe sex\". This is a dangerous approach, as there have been several reports of documented HIV transmission resulting solely from receptive fellatio and insertive cunnilingus. The association of alcohol consumption and illicit drug use with unsafe sexual behavior, both homosexual and heterosexual, leads to an increased risk of sexual transmission of HIV.  Hence the risk of contracting HIV through oral sex is not high. The only way to rule it out is to have a blood test.\n\n",

    "title": "Risk of HIV transmission",
    "content": "I was wondering if someone could answer my question.  Misguidedly, I recently got quite drunk at a party and had protected insertive anal sex with someone I had never met.  We french kissed and had anal sex, and I received oral sex, nothing else.  I am worried because I had a sore inside my lip at the time and I have no idea if this person is HIV negative.  Should I be worried? It would make me feel more comfortable if I heard it from someone who knows what they're talking about.  Thank you so much for your help.\n\n",

The association of alcohol consumption and illicit drug use with unsafe sexual behavior, both homosexual and heterosexual, leads to an increased risk of sexual transmission of HIV. In a 10-year prospective study in the United States of heterosexual transmission of HIV, male-to-female transmission was approximately eight times more efficient than female-to-male transmission. Those are the figures. The only way to rule out AIDS is by doing a blood test.\n\n",

    "title": "HIV in neonates",
    "content": "Dear Diana, There are several ways to test for HIV. Some of these methods rely on the detection of antibodies to the virus in the blood, while other methods directly detect the virus (e.g. PCR). In the neonates the first method would not be possible because the mothers antibodies readily cross the placenta into the baby's blood and remain there for upto 18 months. This if tested would give a wrong impression of HIV positivity (the baby may not have the virus but have the mothers antibodies). After 18 months the baby starts producing his own antibodies if he has HIV.  Hence, it is difficult to diagnose a neonate with methods that rely on antibody production. The best way to test for HIV in a neonate would be by PCR and this can be done immediately. Actually there has been some experimentation done on the sensitivity of PCR in diagnosing HIV in blood taken from the umbilical cord (that is while the baby is still in the uterus).  Ideally, to allow early intervention in the HIV-infected neonate, DNA PCR testing should be performed at birth and weekly for the first month of life. Careful follow-up of both positive and negative newborn test results, with repeat studies that include viral culture for confirmation, will increase the accuracy of diagnosis of HIV infection in the newborn.\n\n",
