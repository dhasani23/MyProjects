    "content": "Hello,While retinal detachments remain the most important factor to be ruled out with a patient complaining of flashes of light,mechanical factors like what you mention are also well known to produce flashes of light.Example is rubbing of eyes causes entropic images.Posterior vitreous detachments are commoner in older people.Thyroid problems,transient ischemia, migraine all can cause such symptoms.While in your case may be it is due to mechanical causes yet would need an ophthalmic examination since you have myopia in addition.

    "content": "How common are large optic nerve discs that are physiological and not pathological for glaucoma?  This is a 58 year old caucasion woman with no history of glaucoma in her family.  The pressure in her eyes are 13 right and 14 left.    Would she be considered a 'glaucoma suspect' for the rest of her life?  If she continued to test normal for visual fields and there was no change in the optic nerve, at some point would the doctor determine that her nerves are physiological?  Would it help to have records from a previous exam from about 5 years ago with another opthalamologist?  Nothing was said about the size of the optic nerve at that previous appointment.  Thank you for your response.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Large optic nerves suspicious for  glaucoma",
    "content": "Hi, You have not mentioned her disc size. However, i have provided some information that may help you to comprehend the reasons why interpretation of this measurement is so complex.  Vertical elongation of the optic cup is a characteristic feature of glaucomatous optic neuropathy. Interpretation of optic cup sizes and determining their relevance to glaucoma is highly complex and not fully understood.  The optic disc and optic cup dimentions vary widely in the normal population. The vertical cup to disc ratio (VCDR) is a simple, and fairly dependable indicator of glaucomatous loss of the neuroretinal rim. Unlike other measures of optic nerve morphology, such as rim area, clinical estimations of the VCDR are commonly performed by most ophthalmologists and do not require multiple measurements or additional imaging equipment. However, a large variation within normal populations, as well as significant overlap in VCDR between normal and glaucomatous eyes has been observed, thereby limiting its usefulness.  The 97.5th percentile for vertical cup to disc ratio (VCDR) has been proposed as a useful tool to assist in the diagnosis of glaucoma in population studies.  The size of an optic disk image depends on factors such as, - the magnification properties of the eye (axial length, ametropia and   corneal curvature),  - instrument magnification, - the measurement technique, - race, - gender etc.  There are many techniques available for measurement of optic disc size. Some of which are,  - Slit-lamp biomicroscopy,  - Planimetry, and  - Confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (CSLO)  Direct measurement of the optic disc size can be done only during vitreoretinal surgery or histologically.  African-Americans have been noted to have larger disks than individuals from other races. However, based on the measured values using a variety of methods, estimates of the mean disk size in African-Americans range from 2.14 mm 2 to 3.75 mm compared with 1.73 mm to 2.63 mm in Caucasians, and 2.46 mm to 2.67 mm in Hispanics, and 2.47 mm to 3.22 mm in Asians.  The high prevalence of glaucoma in individuals of certain African and African-Carribean populations (2.8% to 8.8%) combined with the presence of larger optic disks compared to the Caucasian population has led to the hypothesis that large optic disks might be more prone to glaucomatous damage than small disks. It is possible, that various other factors may be involved in the higher rates of glaucoma seen in African-Americans. These may include genetic susceptibility to Primary open-angle glaucoma, higher prevalence of comorb conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and systemic hypertension, or thin corneas.  Disk size between genders varies slightly(males>females), but not to the extent of being statistically significant. No studies have directly evaluated whether sex and disk size influences the susceptibility of glaucoma. Age does not appear to be associated with disk size. No evidence for a relationship between age, disk size and susceptibility to glaucoma has been reported yet in humans. Myopia (worse than 5 diopters) has been seen to increase the odds of having glaucoma while hyperopia has an opposite effect.  I hope this information is of help. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, At the outset, i must stress that a consulation with an ophthalmologist is the right thing for you to do.  However, i will discuss a condition which can cause the symptoms such as yours, which is not often in the limelight- the entity known as  \"Subnormal accommodation\".  Weakening of accommodation does exist and is known to cause persistent & annoying symptoms long before the presbyopic age.  It is so easily overlooked because, - its relative infrequency, - near-point of accommodation and its range are not routinely tested as part of refration testing.  Subnormal power of accommodation is a not an infrequent cause of asthenopia in young persons and may be seen more often in members of the same family. It remains a distinct condition only in the young individuals & after middle age it is difficult to distinguish from presbyopia. Headaches and defective near vision are the chief complaints.  Other symptoms which may occur are.. - conjunctival irritation, - blurred near vision,and   - difficulty in performing close work.    Diagnosis: The only way perhaps is to test the range of the accommodation - sadly, often a much neglected procedure.  Trust this information may be of use to you.I am unable however, to explain the transient nature of your experience. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "I'm not sure if I'm posting this in the right section, but my eyes are the only constant pain that I have so I figure I might as well.  About a week ago I started experiencing ear aches that would almost take me to my knee's, and the top left side of my head is sensitive to touch, and when it's touched it hurts pretty bad. I get these random ear aches that feel like my head is going to explode and then they just stop, and might not happen for another day, or might happen 10 minutes later, they are completely irregular.  As of a few days ago my eyes are beginning to swell and because painful to touch. Everytime I blink it's a sharp little pain and it feels like both of my eyes are starting to black. It started with my left eye and I just figured maybe I bruised it and it would go away, well today my right eye is also experiencing the same problem.  I have no pains in my neck, back, or any other region in my body. Just the top left side of my head when touched, left ear aches, and my left eye hurting which turned into both of my eyes bruising.  Also, the sensitive skull has been something that would come and go for months now, the ear aches were the same way but they weren't as painful. Neither was the sensitivity of the skull, not sure if that means anything but I thought I would just express it regardless.  Hopefully someone can just tell me that it'll go away soon and not to worry, ha.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Eye's Blacking and hurts to blink",
    "content": "Hi, Your description strongly resembles the signs and symptoms of Giant cell arteritis (GCA)- (variously known as cranial arteritis, temporal arteritis and granulomatous arteritis).  Etiology: Not known.Following factors may be involved: - genetic,   - environmental, - infective?  Epidemiology:  2-3 times more common in Women.Typically seen in female patients >50 years of age.   Vessels involved: Although it usually presents with involvement of the superficial temporal arteries, this inflammatory process has been found to involve medium and large-sized vessels, (arch of aorta and its branches).Cranial and visual symptoms are due to involvement of the ophthalmic, posterior ciliary, and to a lesser extent,the central artery of the retina .   Pathogenesis:  endothelial injury --- activation of cell-mediated immunity --- release of cytokines ---- damage to internal elastic lamina, intimal hyperplasia, transmural inflammation, & eventual stenotic occlusion.  Presenting symptoms:  - Constitutional symptoms (fever, anorexia, weight loss, malaise, impaired memory and depression). - cranial symptoms: new-onset headache(usually temporal), severe scalp tenderness, facial pain, earache, jaw claudication,  toothache, pain in the tongue, palatal pain and odynophagia. - visual symptoms: blurred vision, diplopia, and loss of vision.  - polymyalgia rheumatica symptoms may be associated (approximately 50% of cases).  Signs: tenderness over the course of the temporal artery is the most typical sign( but, not always present).  Labs:  - high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), - elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) (even in patients with a normal ESR),  - Complete blood cell count (CBC) may reveal anemia, leukocytosis or thrombocytosis.  Complications:  The most devastating complication of temporal arteritis is irreversible vision loss, which can be - unilateral,or - Bilateral.  Diagnosis: Temporal artery biopsy in all cases of suspected GCA must be done.In a  few patients biopsies may be negative(explained by  \u201cskip\u201d lesions).If biopsy is negative,the other side must be biosied. Ultrasonography, CT scans,angiographic examination,and high resolution MRI and position emission tomography (PET). may be indicated in some cases.  Treatment: Mainstay is Glucocorticoid therapy.Daily doses preferred.Relapses may occur.Relapses may necessitate increased dosage or prolonged steroid treatment. Addition of methotrexate is controversial. So,the routine addition of methotrexate to glucocorticoid therapy is not recommended.   Other drugs such as dapsone, aspirin, antimalarials, other cytotoxic drugs, penicillamine, and etanercept are being investigated.  You should consult your family doctor so that he/she may be able to decide on the course of action in your case. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: loss of vision due to optical nerve in right eye",
    "content": "Hi, From the history provided, some possibilities need to be considered. - Congenital eye disorders(congenital optic atrophy,congenital cataract,and congenital glaucoma), - an 'Early onset' macular degeneration &  - Retinitis pigmentosa etc.  What ever the cause, management of these children with with low vision continues to be challenging.    There is no consensus as yet on the ideal management for these children. Some studies have reported that children with severely impaired contrast sensitivity function showed lower reading speeds compared to those with the same near visual acuity, but better contrast sensitivity function.Even a small reductions in contrast were noted to reduce reading performance in almost all low vision patients tested, hence they need higher magnification for reading.Other studies have disputed this.  Several studies have shown that low vision aids were very effective in helping 90% of the low vision patients to read normal size prints. Also distance telescopes were found to be effective in improving visual performance both indoors and outdoors. As far as the compliance is concerned, some studies indicate that about 90% of children remained users of their telescopes(both far vision and near vision aids) at 1 year and abot 50% at 2 years with improvement of visual function.  In conclusion, one may (based on available evidence) derive that low vision, which has a wide-ranging impact on the behavior of children and adolescents can be helped considerably by vision rehabilitation with the use of optical vision aids,which have been found to be very helpful in minimizing the impact of low vision and in improving their overall performance.  Based on the available evidence, i feel that your child will be certainly benefited by the low vision aids & should be given a chance to use them under supervision of an ophthalmologist.

You do mention a bit of heaviness in the eye when you get out of bed in the morning.  You indicate that your right eye is a 'lazy' eye.Do you mean that you have a squint((strabismus) or just amblyopia?.  Based on your history, i would not like to hazard a guess, as eye disorders always need to be assessed by an ophthalmologist.  I would only list some of the theoretical possibilities for your symptoms. - chronic eye strain, - amblyopia in your left eye(the good eye), - glaucoma, - dry eyes: People with dry eyes may experience strain while using the eyes for focusing tasks like watching the TV, knitting, and other activities.Some persons wearing contact lenses are at risk of dry eyes. - rare conditions such as cat scratch disease may present with pain in eye balls.  Please contact your ophthalmologist for a full assessment. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Dry eyes, sensitive to light, change in iris color",
    "content": "Hi, Thank you for your post and the attached image. Most eye-color changes have been reported in the Caucasian populations with hazel eyes.  Heterochromia iridis/iridum is a color change that occurs in the iris. This can be of two types based on whether there is loss or addition of pigment as: - hypochromic & - hyperchromic.  They may also be classified based on the extent of surface area involved as: - complete heterochromia, wherein one iris is of a completely different color from the other & - sectoral heterochromia(partial), wherein part(a sector) of one iris is a different color from rest of the areas. Complete heterochromia is much more common.Sectoral heterochromia  is mostly associated with autosomally inherited disorders like Waardenburg syndrome and Hirschsprung's disease.Sectoral type can also occur post-trauma.  The color change in the iris can be of many types which include - central (close to the pupillary margin), - peripheral - nodular - trabecular network (such as in leukemias)  - stellate etc.  Glaucoma can cause iris transillumination defects, trabecular patterns as well as concentric rings in the iris.  Latanoprost-induced pigmentation: Lantoprost is an antiglaucoma medication      (a prostaglandin F2 alpha analogue), which can cause increased growth of eyelashes (hypertrichosis) & iris pigmentation.  One particular study in patients with brown eyes had shown occurrence of concentric hyperpimentation. ( Wistrand PJ, Stjernschantz J & Olsson K. The incidence and time-course of latanoprost-induced iridial pigmentation as a function of eye color. Surv Ophthalmol 1997; 41: 129138.).  You may refer to the following link as well. ( http://www.doctorslounge.com/forums/vie ... 90&t=43584 ).  Solar damage also is known to cause pigment changes in the iris.Also, anterior segment dispersion syndrome is known to cause concentric transillumination defects in mostly teenagers.  The diagnosis in your case may be arrived at only after consultation with an ophthalmologist. Best wishes!!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Ciprofloxacion Ophthalmic Solution for a stye",
    "content": "Hi, Styes (hordeola) are infective conditions of the eyelids usually by the organism Staphylococcus aureus.   They are of two basic types: - Hordeolum Externum: which is a suppurative inflammation of one of the glands of Zeis or Moll, located anterior to the lash line(more superficial) & - Hordeolum Internum: which is an inflammation of one of the meibomian glands(or tarsal glands)of the eyelid (situated deeper).  One other condition affecting the eyelids is a chalazion. This will not be discussed further here.  Predisposing factors for hordeola: - seborrheic blepharitis, - Uncorrected Refractive errors,  - Poor lid hygiene, - Low resistance to staphylococci & - Diabetes Mellitus.  Hordeola are usually self-limiting, and generally spontaneously resolve within a couple of weeks.  Medical therapy for hordeola includes  - eyelid hygiene,  - warm compresses  - massaging of the lesions for 10 minutes 4 times a day, and  - topical antibiotic ointments,if the lesion is already draining, or if there is associated conjunctivitis.  Systemic antibiotics may be indicated if complicated by preseptal cellulitis.  A number of topical antibiotics have been used in the management of hordeola notably, - chloramphenicol, - tobramicin & - Quinolones (Ciprofloxacin, ofoloxacin).  One may use ointments or drops, but ointments are preferred by some(especially when associated with blepharitis).  Ciprofloxacin has shown comparable efficiency compared to chloramphenicol and tobramycin in the treatment of conjunctivitis and blepharitis. Safety profile also appears to be similar.   Some workers had observed the appearance of a white precipitate as the only potentially adverse effect in the cases treated with ciprofloxacin. The precipitate resolved sponteneously in all patients and did not appear to cause any scarring of the cornea.This precipitation has been explained by an alteration in the pH of the eye-drops as they mix with the tears. ( http://www.pharmj.com/editorial/2000031 ... tics2.html )  Thus one may conclude that topical antibiotics are not indicated in all cases of hordeola and the decision as to when to use them be preferably left to the ophthalmologists. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Changing Iris color",
    "content": "Hi, Subtle changes in the color  of the irides occur throughout life and with disease. In some individuals, changes in iris color from 6 years of age to adulthood is seen.  Iridiseumelanin (a type of melanin) which is synthesized by melanocytes,is responsible for the color of the irides. Different colors exist in the population due to  - the density of melanocytes and - the variations among the eumelanin.  Color of a given iris is usually not uniform, as different parts of the iris contain eumelanin variations. These differences in color are not very perceptible in uniformly colored eyes like gray eyes, but is more noticeable in people with hazel eyes, as they have more variations in color.  There are a host of conditions where changes in color occur, which, to a lay person's untrained eyes, may simply look like a color change, but to an ophthalmologist it may mean - a change in color, - a defect in the iris, - 'transillumination' or transparency, - iris nodules, - freckles, - iris nevi, - iris cysts, - iris tumors etc.  Iris color change may be unilateral or bilateral.  There are certain instances in which permanent change to the iris color does occur. This may be due to injury, the increased production of melanin following birth, exposure to the sun, certain eye treatments for glaucoma, etc.  As the list of causes of changes in iris color are too many to discuss in detail, i will try to present some of the more common or interesting ones:  - Heterochromia is a color change that occurs in the iris. This can be of two types:- complete heterochromia, where one iris is of a completely different color from the other & - sectoral heterochromia(partial), wherein part (a sector) of one iris is a different color from rest of the areas. Complete heterochromia is more common.Sectoral heterochromia  is mostly associated with found in autosomally inherited disorders such as Waardenburg syndrome and Hirschsprung's disease.  - Anterior segment dispersion syndrome:causes transillumination defects in mostly teenagers. - Lisch nodules: these hamartomas consisting of melanocytic cells containing varying amounts of pigment. These are pathognomonic of type 1 neurofibromatosis (NF1).They are likely to be seen in 90-100% of NF1 patients over 6 years of age. - inflammatory uveitis of sarcoidosis. - iris freckles and nevi: - congenital: congenital sectoral melanocytic hypoplasia, in which involvement is seen as a brown sector on green iris or a brown sector an a blue iris.May be associated with neural crest anomalies, Ex; Hirshprung's congenital deafness and poliosis. - Darkening of the iris colour is an increasingly reported side effect of  prostaglandin analogues, such as latanoprost and isopropyl unoprostone1. - trauma induced color changes(including surgical trauma). - tumors (both benign and malignant) of the iris: of the benign tumors, melanocytoma needs mention. Mosttly occurs in African-Americans, & have a very low risk for malignant transformation. Among malignant tumors, primary ocular melanoma is the commonest. Best wishes!\n\n",

I went to a doctor, and she, after a very quick examination, prescribed antibacterial eyedrops.  That was about four days ago, and things haven't improved since then.  I also have a soar throat, a cough, and a swollen lymphnode in front of my left ear, all of which leads me to believe that I have viral rather than bacterial conjunctivitis.  Does this seem likely to you?  If so, how long should I stay home from classes and avoid contact with others?  I've heard that viral conjunctivitis is very contagious.  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "I am 15 years old and within the last half year I have experienced, maybe 5-6 times, fairly long-lasting (30mins-1 hour) fuzzy,gray/clear streaks appearing in mainly my right eye on entering a bright room. Unlike the normal spots or streaks that you get in your eye after a camera flash, these seem to move about in an odd fashion, almost like the flowing of water and they do not go away after a short period of time. They also do not occur after sudden bright flashes of light, such as from a camera, but more after entering a brightly lit building or room. These streaks, as mentioned above, appear mainly in my right eye, making it difficult to focus on things, therefore difficult to read. However, closing the right eye does not help, as these streaks then seem to appear in the top right corner of my left eye, as if flowing from one eye to the other.  Closing my eyes has never helped solve this problem, as the streaks are there when my eyes are closed, shining more of a yellow color. What once helped was putting on a pair of sunglasses, or focusing in on an area that was not flooded in the lights of the room.  I have never experienced any pain while having this problem, however once it did leave behind a minor headache once I had successfully gotten rid of it.  The first time I had this problem, was walking into a supermarket in Spain. I was already inside a normal shopping mall, but somehow the main building of the mall was not lit in the same way as the supermarket and my eyes did not react well to this change.   What could this problem be and what could it be caused by?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello.  For the past 6 months to a year, I have had continuous eye issues.  It started last fall when I had relocated from Michigan to Missouri, and the skin around my eyes began to constantly dry out.  I changed my eye make up remover to a sensitive - moisturizing non-comedigenic brand, and also decreased the amount of eye makeup I wore.  I have always had allergies, but have never had skin allergies before.  I also changed my night time eye cream to a sensitive formula as well, in hopes that it would moisturize the skin and not irritate it.  It seemed to subside for a bit, but would flare up every now and again.  Lately it has gotten considerably worse, I am currently using a completely orgranic eye moisturizing cream, a fragrance free moisturizing eye make up remover, and am still using the same brand of make up I have been using since I was 18 (so for over 15 years).  Now my eyelids are swelling, the skin is still dry, flaky, and tight, my eyes are watering, and I am sensitive to light, especially on my drive in to work each morning.  I also have developed a small red rash on the outer area of my right eye - directly above my cheek bone - which is VERY itchy.  I am at a loss right now how to get this to go away, would a cortizone cream work?  Or some sort of allergy eye drops?  I currently take Zyrtec each day to treat my other allergy symptoms.  Any help you could give me would be appreciated!  Thank you so much.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I'm a 27 y/o female and have had a broken blood vessel in my left eye since I was 18.  It only began to bother me last year as I found an older picture of myself and noticed it had grown a lot larger and begun to \"branch out\" to more than just the one vein.  It currently goes from the inside corner of my eye all the way to the iris (was about halfway to the iris and a lot thinner in the picture I found). I went to an Opthamologist who did some tests for a few weeks and found that I have high pressure in that eye (28 the first time and 27 the second time).  I wasn't put on any medication and was supposed to go to a six month follow up a few months ago (I lost my job and don't have any medical insurance, otherwise I'd have gone).  So, my questions are:  Is it the high pressure that's causing this?  Is it going to keep growing?  Is there anything I can do to reduce the appearance of it (or even get rid of it all together)?  Medicine, surgery, etc.  Oh, and not sure if it's important but my mother and grandmother have high eye pressure.  Thanks to anyone who might be able to help me!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, first of all, get the cause of the dry eyes treated if there is any, instead of symptomatically treating the dry eyes. Avoid too much of oily and fatty stuff in the diet, including junks, fast foods, spicy foods and non-veg. Drink plenty of water everyday and use lots of raw vegetables and fruits. Use protective goggles when you go out and avoid direct air, smoke and a/c blows into the eye. Tobradex is a steroid containing drops and I don't suggest a long term use . Try some preservative free moisturising eye drops or instead 'gels' whatever is locally available at your place, which will have  long term effects. Take care. Regards, Dr.Ramamurthy M G\n\n",

He's taking it for arthritis and here are the syptoms he is experiencing:  clock hand going backwards  ice cycles on stove  seeing white lights similar to christmas tree lights  double vision  page going blank while reading  We've read that there are side effects from this medicine and you need to have checkups if on it for long periods of time. However, he went to an eye doctor recently but did not tell him he was taking this medication or the symstons he was having. I'm thinking specific testing has to be done that may not be noticed with a regular eye checkup.  He also has a neurologist appointment soon if it's not his eyes.

    "title": "Re: Twitchy Eye for 3 months",
    "content": "Hi, Twitching of the eye lid/lids alone is usually called as 'Myokymia'.This is due to what are called as 'fasiculations', which means involuntary contractions of a small group of otherwise normal muscle fibers.Seen usually in conditions of stress,fatigue,and excessive caffeine or alcohol consumption.   If these involuntary contractions of the orbicularis oculi muscle of the eyelids are associated with contractions of muscles in some part of the face, conditions such as 'Blepharospasm'. hemifacial spasm etc will need to be considered.  Blepharospasm is known to be associated with irritation in the eyes,tearing, vague ocular pain and photophobia.  It is possible that you might not have observed some other part of your face moving during the episodes.Blepharospasm needs to be excluded in your case.I suggest that you should first consult an ophthalmologist who will be able to guide you better after examining you. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I am a 24 year old generally healthy female, and I have an eye problem that I would like some insight on.  For the past three days, I have been seeing a flash that very persistently will not go away. It is in my left eye, slightly above my direct line of vision. It is small and shadowy-blue, like a camera flash only not as intense, and it's not really obstructing my vision, but it's not going away. I've had slight headaches at night recently, but not serious. I've also had a slight pain under my eye in my cheekbone area that comes on for a few seconds and disappears.  I do not have a history of eye problems, although I do wear prescription glasses that are not very strong. I have been diagnosed with having \"acute inflammatory arthritis\", although I am confident that the type of arthritis I have is palindromic rheumatism. I am not on any medications.  I went to my optometrist today, and the doctor told me that what he could do is rule out problems with my retina. And he ended up telling me that my retina was fine, and told me to come back in 4 to 6 weeks if anything changes or gets worse. He said that the problem could be in the very early stages, and therefore undetectable as of yet.   Tomorrow will be my fourth day seeing this flash, and I am wondering if it would be a good idea to go to the hospital. I don't want to wait 4 to 6 weeks, as I have read multiple sources online that say this could be serious, whether it is retina related or not, the problem needs to be detected early. I have done quite a bit of searching, and have not found anyone else describing the same problem. Thank you for your help.\n\n",

'Punctate inner choroiditis' (PIC) is another condition which should be excluded.  'Punctate inner choroiditis' presents with bilateral (inflammatory) choroidal lesions of the posterior pole of the eyes.Pathogenesis is uncertain. It occurs mostly in young, otherwise healthy, myopic women.Generally carries a good visual prognosis if diagnosed and treated promptly( oral and regional steroids).  Ofcourse,your doctor was right in first excluding more serious conditions such as posterior vitrious detachnment and retinal detachment etc. Best wishes!\n\n",

Last night I had them unevenly dialted for a few minutes last night then again when I first woke up.  They go away within a few minutes and do no return.  I have absolutley no other symptoms.  This happened about 8 months ago.  I also remember it happening about 10 years ago at the opthamologists office, but he took note but was not concerned at all.  It only happens in artifical light too.  Should I be concerned or is this a normal response for some people.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: unequal dialated pupils",
    "content": "Hi, Unequal pupils are termed anisocoria are due to a variety of causes. Anisocoria may be physiological or pathological.   Yhey may also be classified as neurologic and others non-neurologic.  Physiologyic (non-neurologic) anisocoria: \u2022 occurs in about 20% of the population \u2022 response to light and near testing is normal \u2022 The difference size between the two pupils is less than 2mm \u2022 inequality of the pupils depend on either the amount of ambient light or the time of observation.  It is possible that your description may indicate a Physiologic (non-neurologic) anisocoria. Only an ophthalmologist after fully examining you would be in a position to come to a final conclusive diagnosis. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Last night I had a sudden and intense pain behind my left eye. It burned somewhat and my eye watered quite a bit but then as sudden as it had came, it went away. Then it continued to happen about 10 minutes on and 10 minues off for a few hours. I fell asleep thinking it had gone away but then it has been going on all day on and off. When an episode starts it will last anywhere from 5-10 minutes and then suddenly go away again for 5-10 minutes.   I have looked into different things this could be but nothing sounds quite right. I don't have any nausea or vomitting, I can see just fine, but the pain is extremely intense and my left eye is a little red and waters everytime it flares up. Any idea as to what this could be or what I can/should do about it?  Thank you\n\n",

    "content": "I cannot figure out what's going on with my eyes. I've went to 4 ophthalmologist, and they all tell me that my eyes are healthy and don't need corrective lenses. They don't understand why my vision is so poor.  Here is some information on myself: - Female - 25 years old - 115 lbs. - No previous eye disorder, 20/20 vision - Good health - Lived in Bellingham WA when symptoms started - Currently live in Los Angeles.  When the symptoms started, I thought it was just a side effect from stress and anxiety. At that time, my house had a Hobo Spider infestation, I was being interviewed for graduate school and I was planning my move to California. The symptoms were (from what I remember): - Red Eyes lasted for 3 days (that i used OTC drops for) - Blurred/ shadowed vision that was severly worse at night - Dry eyes when I woke up (as if I left my eyes open all night) - My right eye had it worse than my left.  My symptoms now are: - Severly dry eyes in the morning - Terrible light sensitivity - Poor Vision: Can't read street signs unless I'm standing directly in front of it, shadowed vision, seems like I have a \"dreamy/hazy\" filter on my lens - Feel disoriented - Eyes feel very strained, tired and heavy after 2 hours of continuous use on one task. - Occasional sharp pain in the back of my eye - Headaches in the back of my head and temples.  If you have ANY idea that I can suggest to my ophthalmologist, please post. It's been 3 months since I can see clearly. It's been taxing on my life I feel like depressed sometimes. I really would like my life back.  I would also like to add that I used to wear plano contact lenses, and found myself leaving them in when I slept. However, if there were any damage, I'm sure the 4 ophthalmologist would have found something, right?\n\n",

    "content": "For the last two days, I've had swelling on my upper eyelid of my left eye, and there's some pain on the left side of my eye/eyelid as well. The pain doesn't seem to be on the eye itself, so much as to the left of it. The pain is felt more when I close my eyes. The eyelid swelling is not red (it's skin color), and I don't see any defined bumps (so it doesn't seem like stye/chalazion, at least from what I've read of them).   I wear contacts (not since getting this condition, though), and I was wearing a wig for Halloween, and the hair did touch my eyes several times. The condition showed up the next morning.  What do you think this is, and what should I do about it? The pain isn't crippling by any means, but it's uncomfortable and I think it's also giving me a headache.  Thanks.\n\n",

After a week, it was still red so I went to go see a school Physician who said it was most likely nothing.  The physician still prescribed me antibiotics and anti-inflammatories.  I used the antibiotics for a week straight with no results.  After another week I used the anti-inflammatories also with NO results.  During this time my eye became to itch real bad and I would try not to rub it.  I am on my third week and now my RIGHT EYE has become red also, both presenting itchiness.  I started using Visine two days ago and the redness went away for only two hours at a time.  I know this is only temporary relief but because Visine actually worked, does this mean I have allergies or do I have an infection?    -Thank You\n\n",

Ive been prescribed so much drops such as Vigamox, omnipred, optivar, bacitracin ointment, patanol, and artificial tears and none of them seem to work. i just wanted to know if you could give me the name of any medications i can recommend to my doctor that you know can help my situation. Also i would like to know if you know anything i personally can do to help my eyes get better. lastly i would like to know if this can even be cured or treated so that i don't have to take drops everyday, because drops are really expensive and i don't have insurance. sorry for the long comment and thanks in advance. any information is greatly appreciated.

    "content": "Hi, if it is an allergic conjunctivitis, there is no need for so many drops and ointments, other than anti allergics like patanol and may be artificial tears. Diagnosis need to be confirmed. It might be associated dry eyes also. The real cause needs to be treated rather than the symptoms. Avoid the things to which you are allergic to. Protect yor eyes with goggles when you go out. Have a gentle eye wash once you come back. Avoid peeling mucous from your eyes, since the secretion becomes more and more if you continue to peel. Drops are fine, but the cause?. Probably you sholud stop everything and continue with artificial tears  and may be only patanol for a while, incase if you have used medications beyond one month. Take care. Regards, Dr. Ramamurthy M G\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,   I had LASIK on Aug 15. Doctor put me on TobraDex 2 Drops every 2 Hours for the firs day. Second Day he reduced the dosage to 4 drops a day but I mis understood & but 2 drops in each eye 4 times a day. After a week the doctor measured My eye pressure & noted it was a little high. He gave me Alphagan 2 drops a day to control the IOP and asked me to take the topradex 4 times a day for 1 week (one drop each time), then gradually reduce the dosage by one drop every week. By the end of the 4th week I started to have blurred vision & went to see the doctor.   My IOP was 40-Right Eye 42-Left Eye so he told me to stop the Tobradex immediately (I`m a steroid responder which we never knew before)) and gave me TIMOPTOL 2 Drops a day & increased the Alphagan to 3 drops a day.   After 3 days he measured my IOP & it was 10-12. He also noticed the I have developed Uveitis in both my eyes. He said I must take FLUCON 6 times a day to heal the Uveitis & keep taking the other medication to reduce my IOP.   IS this the right course of tratment? is there any other medications (Non-Steroid) to use instead of FUCON? Will my Uveitis take long to heal with this medicine? Will the high IOP for a few weeks cause Glaucoma? The doctor checked my retina & says its OK for now but will it get damaged while I use the steroid?  Thank you,\n\n",

Ok Like I said before I see black dancing dots when  waking up, due to not work im on the computer 24/7 searching for work, also there is a how should say like \"throbbing\" sensation around my forehead, its not a headache it just like Aces. I do have high blood pressure and anxiety, also im Overweight. I also do not eat right due to financial reason, we can buy very little food for some reason when there is 3 people who work in my family and I never eat until Dinner. and Last week for 3 to 4 days there was no food at all only water...so Im not sure if not eating right is causing it or something. Its kinda hard to say because there is personal issues within the family that's causing a lot of stress.\n\n",

    "title": "Monocular Diploia/ Possible Keratoconus",
    "content": "Hello. What are some common causes of vertical monocular diplopia/polyopia that is apparent only when there is bright contrast? I am 18 years old, and have never had any previous eye problems, and I have better than 20/20 vision. This is also accompanied by slight redness/bloodshotness of the eye as well as mild, temporary, reoccurring pain, as well as very large numbers of floaters, and is occurring in both eyes. It was first noticed/triggered when a mild, ph neutral odour eliminating solution was sprayed and rinsed out of the eyes, which caused the eyes to go really red at the time, but they quickly improved in appearance, and the other symptoms started to set in. This occurred about six weeks ago. Also, the symptoms haven\u2019t responded to a three times daily tobradex (0.3% tobramycin/wide spectrum antibiotic and 0.1% dexamethasone/corticosteroid) treatment after a week. My guess is keratoconus. The eyes have so far only been examined by a simple flourescein/blue light and slit lamp apparatus (as far as I know). Any help in identifying this unsettling condition is greatly appreciated!\n\n",

    "title": "blocked tear duct becomes un blocked",
    "content": "Hi, I am a 24 yr old female that has had a watery eye and yellow discharge for about a month now. I went to see my eye doctor and she said it was a blocked tear duct so, she put some numbing medicine in my eye and tried to probe it. As she was probing it I could feel the pressure almost like it was moving up to to top of my nose. She said the probe didn't work so, it was time for surgery which we scheduled for the second week of Sept. A few days went by after my probe and the pressure was intense and I started feeling tremendous pain. I called and spoke with a nurse for the eye doctor because, she was gone for the day. The nurse said it could be from the probe and to try some artificial tears and motrin and see if that helps to ease the pain. I got off the phone and put the artificial tears in and suddenly felt something that I haven't felt in a month. A runny nose. My nose had been stopped up since my duct had been clogged. I blew my nose and seconds later felt something drop into the back of my throat. I don't know what it is but, it's a peice of something gray with white around it maybe like infection. Sudenly the pain and pressure was gone and my eye completely stopped tearing!!! As discusting as it is, I think that was the problem and I saved it in a ziplock incase the doctor wants to see it. My doctor is out for the week so, I just wanted to ask if anyone knows what in the world this could be? I have searched my heart off on the internet and can't find anything about it.                                                Thanks!\n\n",

    "title": "My left eye has been getting stuck.",
    "content": "Hello,   I posted this is neuro about 5 days ago but since it'snot been posted I am guessing, I shoudl have come to the eye section first.   I am a 37 year old woman in good health, I do smoke minimally (about 3-4 a day). I do not drink, nor do I do any drugs other than Motrin a multi vitaimn and prescription when prescribed. In late Jully 2007 I started having some unusal pain behind my eye and a bit on my forhead. My left eye felt slower to move and was not tracking as the right was, a few days after that when I wold move my eyes to look up, that left eye just kinda stuck, it didn't move and if it did it was very minmal movement. When I would focus again, it would feel like it was shaking but if I put a bit of pressure on the eyeball through the lid it stopped. After 2 days of having my eye stuck, i went to see my dr, he had no idea and sent me to an opthomologist. By the time my appt time came round the issue had resolved itself and he was unable to see the problem. from what I described he thought I had thyroid orbitpathy, after reading the symtoms on google, none of the symptoms of that matched me at, no bugling eye, normal orbits, normal thyroid tests. When it went away that first time things were great, than it hit again in may of 2007, again by the time I was able to get into see the dr it had resloved, had another ct scan again all normal. had another episode in February of this year, didn't last as long that time maybe 5 days. Another episode in April, lasted about 11 days. This past episode I called teh eye dr again and they couldn't get me in for 6 months (small town, drs shortage etc etc), so I went to the emergency dept where my family dr was on call, he prescirbed me prednisone 50mgs for 7 days, 24 hrs after taking that pain was gone, eye is moving well. I feel great. This time was just to painful to sit and wait for 6 months and since they 'attacks\" are getting closer together I got really scared.   I have been doing some research on my own as to what it might be, but really all I can find are 2 things, Tolosa Hunt syndrome, and 3rd cranial nerve palsy, but it isn't my entire face, it's simply my eye. my head does hurt bad with this but I think it's b/c my eye isn't focusing great so it adds the strain causing the heacahe.  I am unsure if I should be seeing the optho or a neurologist, I am a single mom to a 6 year old girl and plan on living for years to come. He is the only optho guy in our area and to travel outside would mean 4-6 hr travel time, otherwise I would request someone else.   I do have photos of what's happening and you can clearly see that teh left eye is not normal during these outbreaks. All i want to know is what could be going on? Do I have a rare disease that no one has ever heard of? Do I have a brain tumor thats causing this? Am I going to lose my sight?  The prednisone worked great and I am inclined to ask to continue on it for the suggested time for tolosa hunt pts, but don't want to do that if I am way of base on the issue, I am not a dr, I did not spend years in medical school, so really my research probably means nothing. Can you advise me on what to do? Is there a secific test i should ask for, I don't wantto override the optho but I just think he is way off base with the tyroid eye disease.   I appreciate your time in taking the time to read this. If you are interested in the photo's I can post them as well, i am just unsure of the rules for posting pics.\n\n",

As you requested here are the photos. neither are for the squeamish lol, both are kinda scary to look at and when this happens I tend to waer sunglasses so nobody is aware that my eyes are messed up lol.   the first Photo is an \"episode\" in April.   The 2nd from May the last \"episode\" I had, it seems that this last eposide in May was much worse in the paralysis, and the pain was more intense. 24 hrs of predinose and all was well, totally normal. The last few times I have been to the dr my blood pressure was a bit high but he wasn't concerned, saying that if my body was in pain it can cause an increase in pressure. I do wear contacts/glasses and wear them faithfully, there have been no vision changes except this time when they did a eye chart with me, I was able to see the letters great individualy, but when they made me use both eyes at once it was hard, no idea what that was about, seems to me both eyes would work better than 1, but who knows lol.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi!  I've had chronically watery eyes for about six years, and there is actually something you can do about it if it sincerely bothers you. The root of the problem could be a blocked tear duct (which is why it is only occuring in one eye, unlike allergies which would affect both). An opthalmologist could check this by inserting a small plastic syringe into the tear duct and trying to squeeze a little water down. Most likely it will be blocked and the water (like your excess tears) will run down your face instead of down the drain. It took me two years, but I have an excellent opthalmologist who performs a surgery to create a new tear duct, bypassing the old one if the syringe irrigation does not fix the problem long term. It's called a dachryocystorhinostomy, or a DCR surgery. It's an outpatient procedure that I have had, and the recovery time is just about a week. Do some research, maybe talk to your opthalmologist, but definitely look into it if it bothers you! I'm very, very glad that I did.  Feel free if you have any questions!\n\n",

I have very light blue eyes, but sometimes it is so bad that the only part of my iris that can be seen is a thin grey line around the pupil. I have never taken any type of recreational drug, I don't drink, I've never been sexually active, and I'm not on any kind of prescription medication. The strongest medicine I ever take is Tylenol for headaches, and that's only when if feels too bad to wait out.   I don't know if this is relevant, but it seems to take me longer to adjust to light in the morning when I first wake up or if the lights are turned off quickly than others and I've worn glasses since I was 11 and am currently wearing - 6.00 strength.   The dilation isn't really anything new, it's something that people usually comment on immediately, but I'm not sure if it's just something that I was born with that's harmless or if it could be potentially serious.

    "content": "ok this happened a few months back so its probley something and nothing as the saying goes ok just a quick history i am short sighted in both eyes,4.25 in one and 4.50 in the other,ive no idea what that means now theres been two separate incidents where i am thinking is this my brain or is it an early warning sign  first incident i was at my dads getting some food and suddenley i went totally blind,i couldnt see a thing,it lasted seconds and my eye sight came straight back second incident i was up town shopping.when i started feeling sick.now think of a room with a light in it and theres  a dimmer switch.that can keep the light on but can control its brightness.thats what was happening to me,slowly the room i was in was getting darker as if someone was turning a dimmer switch to my eyes,that time i didnt go blind and my eye sight came back to normal again but slowly.so imagine the rooms slowly going dark but doesnt go dark then slowly comes light again but while its becoming light again.everything seems surreal  thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I am a healthy 35 year old female.  About a year ago, I started to occassionally get wavy vision in the corner of my right eye.  It happened every few months.  Within the past few months it has increased to almost weekly with wavy vision and lightening like bolts through the vision.  Only twice it appeared in my left eye with less severity, once it showed in the left as a blacked out area.  After researching it myself and going to my general prac. it was concluded that it was optical migraines but my doctor suggested I go to a opthamologist as well.  There was about a months time in between doctors appointments and in that time the right eye really started bothering me with fuzzy vision and floaters throughout the day (I did get hit in that eye during this time period) and I also have occassional dizziness.  The opthamologist also concluded that I am experiencing optical migraines and that the recent fuzzy vision with floaters might be the result of the hit in the eye loosening the gel in the eye.  The only thing the eye exam found was that my left eye is severely near sighted and the right eye is fine (both eyes used to be better than 20/20).  The doctor said he doesn't see a need for glasses since I am seeing fine and didn't even notice the nearsightedness.  My question is as follows: could the poor vision in my left eye be straining my right eye, causing all these problems; and, is there any reason for concern that I am having such frequent trouble with the right eye?   Is a second opinion necessary?\n\n",

This went on for several minutes, but then went away.  My right eye was fine.  For the past couple months my left eye has felt tired, but I figured I just needed to get new glasses (my left eye is near-sighted).  Also, it usually feels exceptionally fatigued just after I wake up.  Also upon waking, though only a handful of times, my vision has been more blurry than usual.  Any idea what might be going on?

    "content": "Hello --  While the other symptoms are more vague, the jarring seeming to cause unilateral vision loss for a moment each time strongly suggests a loose retina possibly at one corner. This can only lead to eventually detachment, so exam and, if needed, repair would be good sooner than later, with less indisposition and less risk of complications. See an opthamologist ASAP and meanwhile avoid jolts, jars, etc., as this could make a loosened retina worse. If everything turns out okay then other explanations will have to be sought, but the major symptom, along with those others, really does sound like an impending partial detachment.   Hope this is helpful. Good luck to you and please keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm going to defer to Dr. Ramamurthy on this one, as I'm not certain whether the term TIA can be properly applied to a vascular eye problem alone, and don't know what \"distinct never branches\" may have to do with the symptom either. The fact that an ophthomologist (at least I am assuming that's what you saw, given the name of the practice) saw no evidence of retinal detachment is a good thing for sure, but the odd diagnosis does raise other questions I don't feel qualified to comment on. Hopefully Dr. Ramamurthy will be notified of this post as well. Good luck to you. At least things seem to be fine now.\n\n",

Problem is, I don't really realize, how long it's been like this. I did notice the first time, after having Lasik eye surgery in 2000, when taking the eye test at the local DMV.  The eye doctors said that my eyes are healthy and could see nothing that would cause it, however they did say there was an outside possibility of my pituitary gland could be putting pressure on my optic nerve, causing the peripheral loss. They wanted me to take an MRI. However the MRI, involves receiving an injection of fluid, which is dangerous in some cases, and my insurance wasn't covering enough of the bill anyway.  Is there another way, like a CT or something, that can determine if my pituitary is OK?\n\n",

Although the right degree is double the left one, it still has blur vision when i close the left eye and see with the right eye only. I believe the degree for the right eye has become 275 or even 300. I am very worried about this much difference in degree. Please advise me doctor. I am 25 years old this year. I wonder if the degrees will lessen on its own.  Thank you very much.\n\n",

We have come across cases where one eye can be zero deg. -normal and other eye being high myopic or hyperopic upto 20D also. The difference can come down if the other eye catches with the high myopic eye. Use proper corrective glasses or contact lenses and that is sufficient. Regards, Dr.Ramamurthy M G\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there --  I can't imagine what an opthamologist could fit into a two hour session with a 16 month old for this problem, and I do believe this is likely more a neurological than opthamolgical problem, so will recommend, pending the outcome of this visit, consult with a neurologist, since it seems most likely something that would be caused by an injury or inflammation of the facial nerve. That being said, I will also refer this to the resident opthamological team to see if a member there can throw any light on this. Meanwhile, if you've now had the opthamology visit, please update us as to what, if anything, has come of it.   Good luck to you, and please check back here both to update us and to see if the opthamology team has anything to add that I might be missing.\n\n",

At the clinic they will be assessing the baby for all eye movements, amount of the ptosis, and visual loss if any, for which they might take so much of time.

He advised me 'Refresh Liquigel' drops (6 times a day) and also asked me not to wear contact lenses during this time.   What are these spots?  Can they grow in number?  Can they affect my vision?  Can it lead to any complication?  What are the dos and donts I need to follow? Can I have head bath, take  steam inhalation?\n\n",

Use wet tissues to mop your eyes instead of peeling. May be you can have occassional GENTLE eye washes. Use ointment base which has long term actions rather than drops, especially before you go to bed. Regards, Dr.Ramamurthy M G\n\n",

    "content": "I have noticed a blood vessel that is quite pronounced on my right eye.  It seems to collect attention and I become distracted because of it.  It is  movable if you lightly move the lower eyelid.  My question was whether it could be moved to a lower location, about 3mm down in order to keep it from being as visible.  Possibly by cutting a pocket in the conjunctiva and moving it downward out of sight and then sewing the conjunctiva back.  This seems much easier than other surgeries such as a pterygium surgery.\n\n",

I switched from glasses to contact lenses and i noticed that i see halos and sunburts in lights. Headlights, lamps, streetlights, even the moon. I went back to where i had my eye exam done mentioning the halos and sunburts and was told that glare was normal for someone who wore contacts. When i said that the halos and sunburts were  giving me trouble driving at night i was told that it was normal for people who wore contacts not to be able to see at night to drive from the glare. Also, that it is normal for people who wore contacts to prefer to wear the contacts during the day and glasses at night for driving due to the glare. I was also recommended to get a pair of glasses with my new perscription for night driving.i don't understand the glare aspect between glasses and contacts and how that causes to show halos and sunburts.\n\n",

You are so right the doctor told me excactly what you said that it might be Just a Transient Ischaemic Attack, Where There Is A Tempory Loss Of Blood Supply To The Eye Nerve-or Migraine Attack. So he did a ECG scan on my heart..what showed up on that was my lung disease.COPD..so i guess the lack of oxygen in my lungs could trigger lack of oxygen to my brain. so he put me on what he called mild asperin i have to take one a day to keep the blood flowing. he is also sending me to an eye specialist. to rule out any eye disease. as for my lung disease ,it has worsened..COPD. I an quitting smoking tomorrow morning..I am going to go on the smokers patch .step down. i am praying and hopeing it works for me..i will be 38 years old in june. i want to stop being sick all the time. I really thank you so much for your time..and so pleased and relieved that i got the same answers from two different doctors..i feel it is always good to get more then one opinion. i thank you so much for yours. and that it matched the doctor i seen tonight.  i went to the doctor and then when i got home and my head calmed down a bit i decided to check my email and that's when i noticed that i have recieved you answer..my goodness i can't thank you enough..now i know what i have to do to make things healther for myself.  sorry if i am just blabbling on..you take care and have a great day..your are great thank you\n\n",

    "content": "A couple of years ago, I was struck in the head with a large rock, which caused a gash in my head. Within a couple weeks, my eyes started really bothering me I never had any problems with my eyes prior to this. I didn't go to the doctor right away, because I figured it would go away, but it never did. I have just dragged through life ever since. My eyes hurt all of the time...Alot of the times, they sting and are watery. They are sensitive to wind and light..They feel better after about 10 hours of sleep, but they start bothering me again within 5 minutes of waking up. When I wake up, my eyes usually feel kind of puffy. I went to a general physician, I told him about being hit with the rock, but he didn't think it was related. He thinks it is dry eyes, although my eyes don't feel like there is something in them and my eyelids don't stick to my eyes. He referred me to an eye doctor, and he also said dry eyes. I tried dry eye drops...they don't help...I have tried refresh tears, systane, and a bunch of others..I have tried putting in gel eye drops before bed, sleeping ten hours, putting in drops upon waking, and using drops every half hour, but it still didn't help...I have tried alaway drops and zyrtec pills in case it was allergies, with no luck. I went to an optometrist, and he said my eyelids were inflamed, but said that my eyes themselves were healthy and he didn't see any problems with them. He thought the inflammation was from allergies. He prescribed me Alrex for the inflamation and Patanol for the allergies. These drops have provided no relief. I think this doctor was quite possibly right about the general problem...I think it is inflamed eyelids, although I don't think it is allergies, but I'm not sure..I do not have insurance any longer, so I don't have money to waste going to the wrong kind of doctor or buying unhelpful medications. What I am looking for is: 1-If anyone knows what my problem might be? 2-What kind of doctor should I go to now- general physician, go back to optometrist, opthamologist, or someone else? 3-Any medication I could recommend to the doctor that will be effective? Any help is appreciated...My life is pretty unbearable right now...All I do is go to work, and then I sleep with any extra time because my eyes bother me so much Thank you for any help\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I am a 45yr male who was recently diagnosed with suspected glaucoma. Suspected because a GDx scan revealed that my optic nerve was very thin. At that time my intra ocular pressure was 12 in both eyes. I had a normal \"white light\" vision field test and was sent to a specialist. A more sensitive field vision test came back abnormal and my pressures were 18 and 23 in left and right eyes. I was started on xalatan drops and a follow-up in 6wks. During my visit the Opthamologist dilated my eyes at approx 3:30PM. It took until the next morning for my eyes to be able to focus. At that time I noticed some near and far vision changes. The next day I started the xalatan. Five days after my visit I attended my childs school musical and couldn't see from my seat in the middle of the auditorium (usually I sit in the back). I went to my Optometrist 2 days later and he informed me that I had a significant change in vision since my vist there 4 months ago. New glasses are being made now. My question is, can drops to dilate your eyes (I assumed it was atropine; I didn't ask) cause permanent vision changes and has xalatan been known to cause permanent vision changes. Also, might my vision continue to worsen. By the way; I also have monocular vision due to amblyopia and am concerned about xalatan causing cataracts. Thanks in advance for any help you can give me.\n\n",

One should know its proper usage. I suggest you update your glasses and you should be fine. Have a regular follow ups related your glaucoma. Regards, Dr.Ramamurthy M G\n\n",

Sometimes i have to manually pick the mucous out of my eye or else i will not be able to see. I am 100% sure this isn't pinkeye because my eyes aren't pink at all. Do you have any idea what this might be, and if so do you know what can correct this. I even made the basketball team for my school, but i had to quit because of this. PLEASE ANSWER SOON!!! This is really bothering me and i have been dealing with it for a long time. Thanks in advance.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I could see your post today only. Sorry for the delayed reply. First and the foremost don't keep on fishing out the mucous coming out of the eye. The more you fish it out more and more it starts coming, and you might land up having a problem called mucous fishing syndrome. Get the cause treated. It might be  a chronic infection, it might be allergic, it might be excessive secretion from the eye lid margin, anything. Untill and unless the cause is treated it never ends. Use goggles when you go out, drink plenty of water, avoid oily foods including junks to the maximum level. It helps. Regards, Dr.Ramamurthy M G\n\n",

I recently went to my pediatrician and he prescribed me something called VIGAMOX OPTH SOL 0.5% SOL (moxifloxacin hydrochloride opthalmic solution). It was really expensive and does nothing for me. I feel like this is a lose-lose situation for me because if i don't digitally remove the mucous it will accumulate causing me blurred vision. I looked this up online, and almost everywhere says this is a very difficult problem to treat. This is really ruining my life...i guess i will have to see an eye specialist...thanks Doc\n\n",

Normally it gets reduced over a period of time, once the eye gets used to the new lens in place. As of now using some tinted, anti glare glasses or polarizing lenses are the better options, if the haloes and glares are unbearable. In case the  if pupil is mydriatic which can happen in some people post cataract surgeries, the anti mydriatic eye drops can be tried to minimize the size of the pupil, after consultation with the concerned eye surgeon.

    "content": "Hello --  \"Normal\" is extremely relative, and a vast number of us have abnormal eyesight, which is within healthy, normal range of abnormality (that is to say, we are not severely compromised).  Use of the word \"normal\" needs  to be weighed carefully by  doctors. While it is extremely common to be nearsighted in one eye,  and this is what appears to be the case with you, it is not \"normal\",  and if it causes symptoms, such as headache or eye fatigue, then it may well be helpful for you to have glasses prescribed, at least for reading. This can help a great deal in some cases, and almost  never does any harm.   I hope this helps. You should see an opthamologist and if  he doesn't suggest glasses,  you should ask for them. This isn't at all unreasonable  and will probably help relieve most of your  symptoms. Good luck to you with this. Please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, it is not very abnormal to have unequal vision in our eyes. we come across cases, where in one eye might be just normal and other can have high refractive errors. The abnormal eye can be a lazy eye also, if at all not identified and treated in the earlier ages. Normally  it is not noticed since we tend to keep both the eyes open always, unless we have the habit of winking ???!! The abnormal eye needs to be treated with glasses or contact lenses to have a comfortable binocular vision if possible. I suggest that you contact your local ophthalmologist and take their advice, to avoid strain in the eyes related to continous work exposure. Regards, Dr.Ramamurthy M G\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I wanted to know if the new color iris surgery (which is performed to change the color of iris in the human eye to either blue or green) is a safe procedure. I contacted the facility in Panama and was told that the diaphram which is inserted in the eye to change the color of the iris isFDA approved and has been performed for years for albinos and the surgery is similar to cataract surgery.   Also, I wanted to know if there have been any severe effects or results from this surgery. I have been researching this surgery and have not found any information regarding severe or adverse effects/results.   Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, very sorry for a delayed reply. Normally these surgeries are not done in the normal eyes regularly. Any intra ocular eye surgeries have their own risks and issues, both short and long term. So untill and unless it is really required, in terms of the health, profession, etc we don't normally recommend ,unless the patient/customer insists. It is a reversible surgery .Basically a differently coloured iris diaphragm is kept infront of the normal iris to hide its colour, after making an opening in the eye ball, which might be a self sealing incision. The way the intra ocular lenses are put within the eye during the cataract surgery . If at all if you are interested to change the colour of your eye , you can go for colored cosmetic contact lenses, which are inserted  on the cornea everyday on your own. You can use different colours everyday as you like, matching your costumes. They need to be maintained well. Regards, Dr.Ramamurthy M G\n\n",

I would like the surgery performed in relation to my profession.  I am not sure which country that you are located in (I noticed that you spell the word 'colour' differently than the word is spelled in the US, e.g., 'color'), but is this surgery available in your country?

    "content": "My 8 month old son woke up this morning with a droopy, swollen eyelid. The doctor thought maybe he poked it during the night and was not concerned. However, my son fell off the bed when he was only a few weeks only and landed on the right side of his head. That is the side that has the droopy lid.   Is it possible that the drop caused problems with his eye/brain development and now we are starting to see the effects of lazy eye or amblyopia with this drooping lid? Is in fact a drooping lid a symptom of lazy eye or does the droopy lid cause lazy eye?  Should I schedule an eye exam to determine if one eye is weaker?  Thank you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Cause of sudden droopy eyelid 8 month old?",
    "content": "Hi, Sorry for a very delayed reply. Hopefully your child is better now. The droopy eye lids may be related to a an insect bite, mild trauma, or a mild infection, where it regresses on its own with treatment. If it is neurological, because of some head injury, as suspected, it needs to be investigated and can be treated. Regarding amblyopia, unless there is a  gross disturbance to the vision, because of severe drooping, there is no issue. Amblyopia cannot set in so soon. We need to assess the child around 3-4 yrears, subjectively and if at all any doubts, it  needs be treated. Untill the retinal neurological development is complete, say upto 12 years, there are good chances to treat amblyopia. Normally amblyopia does not cause the drooping, where as the severe drooping, untreated over a period of time ,might cause an amblyopia. As of now, if it is not regressing contact your family eye doctor, and take his advice. Regards, Dr.Ramamurthy M G\n\n",

I think because of the trauma he had , he would have had a small bleed outside the white of the eye below the conjunctiva, called sub conjunctival haemorrhage.

    "content": "Here's a chronology of what's been going on.  I\u2019ve included everything in case something is relevant that I wasn\u2019t away of.    Family history: *Aunt on father's side with diabetes and schizophrenia *Uncle on mother's side died at age 57 of heart attack *Brother has slight heart arrhythmia that does not affect his activity  Age 4: *Surgery due to weak muscle in left eye  Most of life: *Frequent double vision - seeing two of the same thing due to the offset between the eyes *Occasional fainting, usually from needles (getting shots or getting blood drawn); this happened a few times also from getting hit in the head.  MRI and EEG at age 10 do not indicate any issues.  1994 (Age 13): *Hands and feet become extremely swollen.  Doctor gives pills that I have to take for a week or else I get a lot of spots all over me.  Allergy skin-test a few weeks later comes up totally negative.  Cause for outbreak never determined.  1999 *Blood in urine after working out; ultrasound indicates no issues.  Summer 2001L *Moved to Europe for a year.  Began getting symptoms such as: (1) strong awareness of heartbeat, (2) shortness of breath (3) difficulty sleeping.  Doctor says this is stress.  After a month calms down to a manageable level.  EKG (while resting) is normal.  10/2001: *Was unknowingly hashish by friends; began shaking  like crazy and kept forgetting where I was - and thought something was seriously wrong with me.  I was mostly better after a few hours.  4/2002: *Wake up with very sore and tense neck, shoulders, and lower back.  Orthopedist  indicates that vertebrae in neck are straight when they should be arranged in a curve Physical therapy and acupuncture reduce problem but it is never fully solved.  8/2002 \u2013 6/2006 (In college): *Become sexually active, but never engage in activities of significant risk * After jogging, often feel mild chest pains that go away soon *In architecture school, am occasionally exposed to (1) solvents (2) fumes from laser-cutting acrylic, wood, and cardboard and (3) sawdust *Frequently get much too little sleep due to school  8/2007 (Age 24): *Enter graduate school for architecture.   *Get nervous because hairline is receding significantly even though no one in my family has hair loss; doctor says this is genetic.  I do not treat it. *Begin again to be occasionally exposed to (1) solvents for melting acrylic (2) fumes from laser-cutting acrylic, wood, and cardboard (3) sawdust (4) glues and (5) spraypaint *Begin again to frequently get much too little sleep due to school demands *Occasionally watch laser-cutter, which means I am looking at intense laser light, although it is not pointing at my eyes.  3/2008: *Travel to Asia for the first time  4/2008: *Sexual activity with somebody new; do not engage in any particularly risky activity. *For one week, get a few quarter-sized white bumps on hips each day.  Spots are in different location each day.  5/2008 *Notice shadowing double-vision on text on computer screen; this is different than my typical double vision because it is present in each eye individually (when I close one eye, there is still double vision).  This is present in each eye.  Scares me, but is gone in the morning.  6/2008: *Wake up and notice that one eye is very blurry.  Does not go away after an hour so I go see doctor.  They do exams on me but can't find anything wrong other than my pupils are abnormally large.  Bluriness eventually diminishes. *Begin to notice what I call \"spotiness\" in my vision: general inability to see clearly - it's a little blurry but more than that, colors are not solid colors but rather seem to be constantly overlaid with see-through, moving spots/areas that are dark on light colored materials and light on dark-colored materials.  I am not sure exactly how to describe this ; This is my biggest symptom that persists. *First appointment with optometrist.  Exam does not reveal any issues.  Says right eye is dominant.  Says I have mild astigmatism in both eyes, but that this wouldn't cause intermittent double-vision in each eye individually.  Optometrist gives me optional prescription for glasses that I never get because prescription is so mild.  Overall, says she sees nothing wrong with my eyes.  7-8/2008 * Problems continue as described earlier *Blurry vision persists; monocular double vision (especially for text) comes back occasionally; often just feel really out of it: kind of lightheaded, nervous, mild difficulty speaking.  Out-of-it feeling tends to come on suddenly. *Very obvious after-images on from computer screen in dark room *A few weeks later, feel even more out of it.  Frequently get winded from brisk walking and don't seem to become un-winded as normal.  Eventually feel somewhat better. *One night, get bad diarrhea; people say I look pale and out of it. *For a week, frequently get swollen ankles and hands and itchy spots on legs. *Ga new sexual partner and do not engage in any particularly risky behavior.  9/2008: *Blurriness in vision, \"spottiness\" continues.  Out-of-it feeling frequently returns. *Feel sensitive to light; eyes feel under pressure. *Go see ophthalmologist; says there is nothing wrong with my eyes and passes my on to my GP *Get MRI of brain; brain scan is normal although it shows a mild sinus problem.  ThisI rules out tumors and MS? *Blookwork done; bloodcounts normal.  Thyroid normal.  Cholesterol normal.  Everything is normal.  10/2008: *Notice consistent see-through dark-spot in far right of left eye's field of vision. *Go to allergist; diagnoses skin bumps as hives but can't find a source for them.  Allergist has urine and stool samples done, which are normal. *Resting EKG done, which is also normal. *Neurologist exam reveals nothing abnormal.  Neurologist thinks all of my problems are due to allergies and adrenaline (even though I have never had any allergies, have no family history of such, and don't have traditional allergy symptoms) and does not order an EEG.  The allergist is skeptical of the neurologist's diagnosis.  November 2008: *Am sick for a week.  Doesn't seem like a traditional flu or a cold.  No digestive problems.  Not much of a cough or fever.  Every  night I  had very significant shivering also sweat through my clothes and sheets. Had a very dry mouth for one day.  January 2009: *Begin new semester.  Spotty vision (which I described before as constant overlaying of mild, moving discoloration, kind-of like afterimages) and mild bluriness continues as before and seems to gets worse; I often feel slightly out-of-it and my vision makes it very annoying to read a book or work at a computer, although I can still do it.  I have been feeling a little lightheaded frequently.  I've been exercising less and frequently feel abnormally winded when I do exercise.  I sleep for long enough at night although I've been waking up frequently.  I've been feeling fatigued and rather lethargic most days.  I've been getting occasional mild chest pains and headaches.  Any ideas what could be going on?  Why do I have such significant vision symptoms but the opthamologist, neurologist, allergist, etc can't find anything wrong with me?  Is the neurologist's diagnosis of it simply being allergies and adreneline feasible?  I am getting very nervous - the vision is affecting how I am able to live to my life and is also impacting my optimism for the future because I am afraid it will get worse.  Because of these symptoms I continue to be afraid of brain problems, heart problems, and diseases.  Did I pick up some disease from vistting China or from a sexual partner?  Do I have an impending neurological disorder?  Did I look too long at the laser light from the laser-cutter (even though it was not pointing at my eyes)?  Did I inhale too many solvents (even though it hasn't been all that many)?  Thanks! -NB\n\n",

    "content": "hi,first and the foremost you look to be really worried a lot, I guess. Be relaxed, whatever is there, will be there and whatever is not will not be there. We need to take proper consultation and relevant treatment from proper specialists, which you have been already doing. You can always take a second opinion from the other neurologist if it is really required and if it is possible, with all your old reports. I do feel most of your problems are related to vascular system where blood supply comes into the picture, and which are mediated because of disturbance in the blood supply to various organ systems including eye. So, you can contact a cardiologist/ physician, who can help you out in terms of the investigations, related to vascular supply- like doppler studies? carotid doppler study? related to eye/ brain. It rules out TIA -Transient ischaemic attack, loss of vision, even though age is not favourable. Symptoms might be related to Migaine/Ocular migraine where one might have disturbance in the vision and visual field, during attacks.If it is a migraine the insighting cause/ trigger/s need to be avoided to get the relief/ attacks along with the treatment. Coming to the eye it might be the focussing problems, related to mild muscle weakness/ refractive error, continous near work, continous glare and bright light related issues, eye fatigue etc. Proper glasses with repeated relaxation has to be planned. I did not see any readings related to eye pressures-IOPS, which is also very important in your case along with the study of  angles of the eye. Relavant treatment needs to be started if found necessary. Raised IOPS along with narrow angles, can be one of the reason for your presenting symptoms.Hope the information helps you.

    "content": "Thanks for the reply!  That was helpful.    Here's an update:  Saw a neuro-ophthalmologist today.  He performed a thorough eye examination and told me my eyes are perfect and that there's nothing wrong with me.  He didn't seem interesting in any further tests like EEG or Doppler tests.  While this is great to hear, I feel like he was rather dismissive with me.  Despite my descriptions of my symptoms, he didn't seem open to the idea that something is going on with me that's not in my eyes but as affecting my vision.  Maybe the non-eye stuff is not his job to address, but he gave me no insights on what could be causing all of these symptoms that are very real to me.  The symptoms that persist most strongly are the flickering/overlay/spottiness, frequent headaches, frequent ghost-image text, and overall fatigue.  Maybe I should go talk to my GP again.  Or maybe just accept that the doctor knows that he's talking about and act as if I'm totally fine - maybe I can just live with these symptoms, if they actually are benign.\n\n",

Therefore, NEW blood vessel as oppose to INACTIVE blood vessels that get laser spots to fill up the retina.  I hope that doesn't sound confusing.  Thanks.  Will await a reply.

I understand now that one does not get laser just to fill up space in the proliferative area, unless there is a new blood vessel, or I assume around a blood vessel that broke that perhaps one could see through to laser around it to prevent further breakage or to cause one that broke to shrink.  If that is the case - no need to reply.  Just keep up the good work in helping us understand these matters! To: Dr. Ramamurthy M G From: jeansmithy sjs\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, in either of the cases, new vessel or normal vessel, the blood vessels are not treated directly with the laser shots, the sorrounding retinal area of the new vessels are treated, to indirectly regress the new vessels. In the pan retinal phto- coagulation the main trunks and branches are avoided while treating the retina and may be the tiny capillaries might get burnt in the process with the direct shots. The new vessels if they don't get regressed, even after treatment, might be occassionlly treated with the direct shots, at the end to avoid unnecessary bleeding. Before that  anti vascular growth factrors , steroid injections into the eye directly, can be given to address the issue. with regards, Dr.Ramamurthy M G\n\n",

    "content": "On the 10th of January '09, my 11 year old son was shot in the right eye with a bb gun (close range). The bb entered the white of the eye directly underneath the pupil. It did extensive damage and was lodged at the very back of the eye. He was taken into surgery and the hole was closed but the bb was not removed at that time. Two days later they removed the bb and tried to repair some damage. They scraped the cornea, removed the lens, and reattached the retina. My son obviousy has no vision now, but could detect some light after the first surgery. The doctors have said at best he may be able to detect some light and motion in the future, but that's it. The doctor said without another surgery, he will lose his eye. They are planning to do another surgery in a few days, to reattach the retina again (it has dettached for a second time). They are going to insert some fluid to hold the retina in place, and put a buckel around the eye. The surgeon has said that this is the last hope for saving his eye. There is a 10% chance of saving his eye with this surgery. Is there really nothing else that could be done at this point and if not why? Iv'e tried to do research, but I don't know where to start. They say his eye is severly damaged. If it helps, the procedures he's had done are: surgery lensectomy/vitrectomy/removal of copper bb, and what I have mentioned above. They said we have a two week time frame to do something, so I really would like some feedback if possible, and thank you in advance. He has no problems medically, is active and healthy. No surgeries prior to this, and no preexisting medicial conditions. Thanks\n\n",

Normally once there is an extensive damage to the interior of the eye with the forgein body, including the retina-the eye nerve, chances of visual recovery is little difficult. With the re-operations being planned for retinal attachment,  the remnant vision can be saved along with the shape and the size of the eye ball. He might have some sort of peripheral vision left with, to move around. Sometimes the traumatised eye needs be handled , treated properly and completely to save the other eye getting affected. Take care, have faith in the system. May be you can take a second opinion locally,If you feel.  Regards,  Dr.Ramamurthy M G\n\n",

Keep the cholesterol under control too, which is very much important as for as the blood circulation is concerened. The problem might be just a temporary episode, related to fatigue, lack of nutrition ? because of empty stomuch/ excessive eye strain, lack of sleep, etc. also. If at all the attack recurrs,I suggest you consult the ophthalmologist, and probably after detailed consultation with them, you can contact the cardiologist , who might ask for a carotid doppler study , which is very relevant for your age group, to  study the blood supply related issues.

The doctor gave me different eye drops (I put the drop info in my profile) and my pink eye went away, but my bottom eye lid was still not back to my normal color.  I went to the doctor a couple of days ago and he said my eyes looked a little irritated but that it would go away within 2-3 weeks (even though I told him it's been like this for about 10 weeks.)  I woke up with pink eye today (I have the runny eye, eye stuff boogers, red eyeball, red bottom lid).  Could this be something else?  I haven't worn my contacts since this whole thing started.  I only wear my make-up after my pink eye goes away, and I throw out my make-up when it comes back and buy new stuff.

    "content": "hi, as the history suggests, there is an on and off episodes of pink eye from  the past few weeks/months. Not all the pink eyes are infectious, it might be just the allergic reaction/ over reaction of the eyes, because of some irritation from the sorrounding climate. If it is an infectious pink eye, it might be a chronic infection now, which is not yet addressed properly, in terms of dosage, frequency, the type of the antibiotic/ anti viral. If required, the conjunctival swab can be taken and sent for microbial analysis, with which we might get the causative agent/s. If it is allergic, the causative allergic agent, needs to be found out from your local climate/ sorroundings, and the same needs to be addressed- to be avoided.If it is some chemical or local make-up related issues, again the same needs to be avoided. The over usage of  eye-drops can also lead to the pink eye with rough conjunctiva, which the doctors can find out, after detailed examination, where all the eye drops needs to be avoided and stopped.- conjunctivitis medicamentosa.

After a week, I was feeling a bit better but noticed my right eye was particularly red and had a dull ache. There was none of the usual \"gunk\", but I assumed it was pink eye, called my optometrist. He was unavailable so I made an appointment with the covering doctor but unfortunately he canceled. I decided to treat it with compresses, etc but several days after first seeing the redness, the pain increased. My eye doctor was back and saw me immediately, diagnosed conjunctivitis, prescribed  steroid/antibiotic drops. Also, a puffer test was performed and the pressure in the afflicted eye had gone from 15 in September to 23 in January (my other eye is fine).  Also, I am seeing halos around lights and vision seems a little fuzzy in the infected eye. Everything seems to point to glaucoma but I'm only 34. I'm seeing the doctor tomorrow but I'm worried. Any ideas?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Increase in Intraocular Pressure",
    "content": "Hi, I do understand your problem. First of all the pressure raise may not be very much and may be still within the expected range and may be transient. Other eye being normal , is a good sign and the problem  might be just the local cause of the right eye. Normally just the infection may not cause the pressure raise , unless there is an associated inflammation. Inflammation may be the result of associated infection in the right eye , may be because of respiratory infection- ? viral. So once the infection and associated inflammation reduces with the treatment , the pressure should automatically comedown. Your doctor will definitely put you on anti pressure medicines, if needed. Once everything settles down on the right eye , follow up regularly may be 1,3,6 months for pressure readings. just the raised pressure is not the glaucoma,- there need to be some associated changes also. Get both the eyes examined regularly, and even if the problem is found to be there, there is nothing to worry much as therem are good range of sophisticated, line of management  available. Hope these details help  you for further managenment. Regards, Dr.Ramamurthy M G\n\n",

I do understand, the left eye is very precious for you, for all your normal routine. Looking at the glasses reading available for the left eye, you might be high myopic on that eye with the cataract, having only 2 lines of vision. As long as the eye nerve- the retina of the left eye is functionally good, you will never be deprived of your assured vision on the left eye, post surgery. whaterver the vision you have now, should be definitely be reatained or it might improve post op., may be without glasses also. Sugery needs to be done very carefully without much handling the ocular tissues and you need to contact a good experienced sugeon of your  town. Have confidence in him/her. If at all if the cataract is left without surgical correction , even that might complicate the issue, if it becomes overmature, bursting inside , causing all the unwanted complications. I think you should discuss with your surgeon/s ,the pros and cons and have confidence in them and go ahead with their advise. All the best. Regards, Dr.Ramamurthy M G\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, basically the fluorescent lights are  generated with the help of argon, mercury and phosphorous which normally emit lights nearer to the ultravoilet range-400to 450 nm. First of all any continous exposure to  lights which are  very bright , glary and flicker are not good for the eyes as well as for general health of any individual. If at all, if the lights are nearer to the uv range which are not nearer to the natural sunlight spectrum, normally we are all exposed to is not advisable. Any of us might develop dryness in the eyes, focussing problems, visual disturbances, fatigue, headches, permormance problems, irritability ,disturbnce in body's regular bilogical clock and migraines, etc which might definitely affect our work performance. When the work output is really concerned the HR and the boss should  consider this very seriously and do the needful for the working staff. Untill the things are done I suggest you to wear some uv protective anti glare glasses  at the work place, take frequent breaks during working hours, relax and expose yourself to natural lights and climate outside. Take good amount of water during working hours and salads in the diet. Please don't keep  worrying about the working atmosphere -that might irritate you more. you can do some google- related search, regarding the fluorescent lights and discuss the same with your HR and ergonomics department. Hope this might help you a lot. Regards, Dr.Ramamurthy M G\n\n",

It can be more pronounced if the steet lights are not properly lit. The problem can be with the glasses- scratches, power etc. it can be with the wind shield of the car- fine dust, improper cleaning etc. or it can be with the eye- intolerance to light. So make sure that wind shield is always clean before you start driving in the night. Use proper powered scratch proof antiglare coated glasses, or switch over to contact leses.Light rays get scattered when they pass through different media-air, glass etc and cause an unwanted glare. Avoid driving in the night  if photophobia is the problem . Hope this information helps you even if it is delayed. Thanks and regards, Dr.Ramamurthy M G\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  This is very likely one of two things, and it should be checked by an opthamologist ASAP. It may be optical migraine, which is harmless in itself, or it may be a partially detached retina, which can be more of a problem. Optical migraine is usually something one just has to learn to deal with, and at least doesn't have the headaches that usually follow these auras. A detached retina needs attention promptly, so that needs to be ruled out.  There are other possible causes that are far less likely, but if neither of the above turn out to be the problem, then as unlikely as it seems, you'll need to have transient ischemic attack (TIA or \"mini-stroke\") ruled out. It really doesn't sound like that's what's happening, but it would show up further down the list if neither of the first two things proves to be the case. I wouldn't be overly concerned about that, but it has to be considered if there is no other apparent  cause. This can also be a more benign phenomenon (since you mentioned this started when you'd have your head tilted) in that some people can actually kink one of the carotid arteries by head positioning, sometimes because of a partial blockage,sometimes due to a simple anatomical anomaly.  I hope this is helpful. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I am a 27 yr old female. I recently had a baby 5 months ago, and I also work in a factory where i do have some exposure to chemicals or fumes, but not extreme. I have been there 5 years.  That being said, I have had several strange symptoms and cannot seem to find any explanation. They are:  All of these symptoms seem to be MORE prevalent at work. I will just be sitting there working, and my eyes will just kind of go out of focus (fairly regular, mostly throughout the second half of the day, after I have eaten), accompianied by dizzy or lightheaded feeling a lot. My eyes also feel strained a lot throughout the day as well as feeling nausea sometimes. After the baby, my first few menstrual periods were normal, and then my last one, which came at the scheduled time, there was hardly anything there! I checked two different times to make sure I wasen't pregnant. I also seem to be more sensitive to smell as well as noise - the loud noise hurts my ears more. Again, these are more noticeable at work. Any ideas? I am not really in the financial state to have anyone run a lot of tests, since I have such a variety of symtoms. Hopefully you can help! This has been going on for a few weeks now.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  My first thought is that we should know what sort of fumes you are exposed to at work. That could explain your problem. If you could provide that information it might help solve the problem.   Other possibilties, should that one not turn out to be obvious, are largely neurological, but then, so are the symptoms if they are caused by exposure to whatever you work around. At any rate, if it's not caused by those chemicals,  then what you describe needs to be evaluated by a neurologist, as there are several diseases that fall under that heading which tend to announce themselves in the way you describe. Some of them are more problematic than others (an example would be multiple sclerosis -- MS) and the earlier they are managed,  the better the outcome is likely to be. While the example (MS) sounds frightening, it is usually only serious when the early symptoms are ignored. It does require an MRI of the brain to help diagnose it, but this, I would think, would be well worth the  expense.   But again, it could be due to the chemicals you're exposed to at work, and it would be very helpful to know what that (or they) is (are?).   Please follow up with  us with that  information, and we'll go from there.\n\n",

    "title": "How to Correct Lazy Eye",
    "content": "My prescription is way out of date but my glasses still worked fine until the the frame snapped in half. I went to the eyeglass place with my prescription sunglasses and asked if they could pop up those lenses and put in the lenses from my broken eyeglass frame since they are identical frames.  And since my FSA account is now zero, I figured that this would work fine until January and then I would get a new prescription and new glasses.  The eyeglass place popped in the lenses and for the next two weeks my eyes hurt like hell and I just felt something was wrong because I was seeing double vision. I went to a different location and they said that they would swap the lenses on the other side of each other (my glasses have a bottom wire instead of a frame all the way around it).   Now I could see much better but I guess after two weeks my lazy eye is all jacked up. My eyes don't hurt anymore but the lazy eye just looks so bad.   I know I need a better prescription but I won't get one until January when there is money in my FSA account.  So are there any exercises that I can do myself that can help improve my lazy eye?  My strong eye is the right eye and my lazy eye is my left eye. Although I am totally ignorant about this, I assume that since the prism is in my left lense, that I really need to close my right eye so that my lazy left eye can get more accustomed to looking at the prism. And by spending more time doing that, I did notice that my lazy eye is starting to align itself to my strong right eye.  But any suggestions or ideas would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Left eye watering, stinging, red, hot, photosensitive",
    "content": "Hello -  Conjunctivitis, an inflamation of the cornea, can be bacterial, allergic, or even viral. Since in your case it goes away when the contacts are removed and the affected eye is medicated, the irritation subsides, and when a new contact  is placed in the eye the inflammation returns. This suggests this is not a bacterial infection, since it would almost certainly spread to the other eye, and definitely that the contacts are not contaminated, or both eyes would be affected. Therefore while it could be an allergic reaction, again the other eye would be affected also. What is most likely, therefore, I would think, is that you have a (relatively) deep corneal scratch which has become infected. These tend to seal  over, so when infection occurs as a result, it doesn't always spread to the other eye.  All your symptoms suggest this, rather than simple  conjuntivitis (or pinkeye), which usually responds readily to treatment and would be expected to spread to both eyes.    The sensitivity to light is what makes me believe you have a scratched cornea with a covered infection, although it also could be a viral lesion of the affected cornea. These are generally easy to spot, however, so it's less likely.  I think it may be time to see an opthamologist about this, so that the cause can be pinpointed and treated properly, both for the sake of relieving the instense discomfort and to prevent actual damage to the eye.  I hope this is helpful to you. Please follow up  with  us on  this.\n\n",

    "content": "Last friday, September 19th I woke up with some irritation in my right eye. It was a little swollen and itchy and burning. I flushed it with eye wash solution but as the day progressed so did the pain, scratchiness and burning to an intolerable state. I went to urgent care and he looked an saw no corneal abrasions of any sort, he gave me prescription antibiotic eye drops. Consequently, I have been on levaquin for three days prior (750 mg OD) for bronchitis. Let me preface this with I do not wear contact lenses and in my 46  years of life have never had an eye infection. By the next day the eye is even worse, I call the eye doctor and go in an see him, he gives me Tobradex which is an antibiotic drop with steriodal medication to help reduce swelling and tells me it should start feeling better by the evening. Two days go by and its Monday and the eye continues to worsen instead of improve, more redness and swelling not only of the eye but all around it and it's halfway closed now. I call the opthalmologist back, go in and see him and he tells me to wait three more days and if it's not better he's putting me on IV antibiotics. Well, that was yesterday, I have been up all night in severe pain not only in my eye but the whole side of my face and the inflammation is worse. I also have light sensitivity and blurred vision. My question is, should I see another doctor, why would this doc make me wait another three days if my condition hasn't responded in the time it should given this particular medication...what is he missing??\n\n",

If we avoided them all, nobody would have children.  Whether or not you feel you want children and can raise them well is a personal decision but I certainly would not avoid the joys that can come when you are ready to have a family based on this minor impairment possibility.  There are life-threatening conditions that might make me feel that way but not something as easily treated as this one.  Just follow up with good pediatric care so early intervention can be utilized if needed.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  This sounds odd but may be normal. I'd need some more information, however, to be able to say whether it sounds like a normal phenomenon or something really odd and out of my range. What I'd like to know is: Does this stripe run horizontally across the eyeball or does it encircle the pupil? The former is something I have never heard of or seen. The latter can be very normal (it's called arcanus senilus and is sometimes indicative of elevated cholesterol but often, especially in young people, is just an aberration). The only other thing I can think of is that if the stripe is horizontal that it may be an unusual way of manifesting some level of jaundice. I trust you're feeling well otherwise, so this seems unlikely.  Let us know the way the stripe runs and we'll go from there.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I assume it is an eye doctor you are seeing.  This can be a symptom of an underlying disorder, problem with pupil contraction, possibly even macular degeneration (among other possibilities).  I assume you aren't taking medications that have this side effect, but you did not specify one way or the other.    Light sensitivity can be related to migraines.  Sometimes it is not related to any disorder (it's just the way you are) and cannot be treated or cured.  In these cases it is important to learn to adapt to the condition.  You should get good, larger than normal, wrap-around sunglasses with UV filters (sometimes called solar lenses) and wear a hat with a brim to reduce glare.      You may also benefit from consulting someone who works with people who have sight impairment - people who advocate and assist the visually impaired, low-vision specialists, etc.  These folks can help you learn to adapt.  Good luck.\n\n",

It also may take a while to fully resolve though.  If you are not seeing improvement in the next week I would recommend you follow up with your ophthalmologist.  Best wishes.\n\n",

There are many causes of these types of muscle twitches.  One of the more common ones is an electrolyte deficiency such as not having enough potassium or calcium in the diet.  You may want to see a doctor about this for further evaluation.  Your electrolyte levels can be tested although this actually may not necessarily correlate well.  Taking a daily multivitamin may help if it is an electrolyte issue.  There are several other causes as well that your doctor can help evaluate for.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Inflammation in the eye can cause these symptoms and chances are this is transient.  Most spots and floaters are harmless and fade over time. However, the sudden appearance of a significant number of floaters, especially if they are accompanied by flashes of light or other vision disturbances, could indicate a retinal detachment or other serious problem in the eye. If you suddenly see new floaters, visit your eye doctor immediately.  Since you did go to an instant care facility, I suspect this is just your response to the irritation and will decrease in time.  It never hurts to have an eye exam however, just to be sure.  Everyone should have their eyes examined periodically, even if they do not need vision correction.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I know of nothing that can remove foreign objects from your eye.  If it is still bothering you it could be that it is scratched and will heal on its own but in the meantime it may feel like something is in there.  Try to rest your eye as much as possible.  If it still feels like a foreign body but you can't see it, the only answer would be the eye washing - regular water will do, but wash it for several minutes.  Aside from this you would have to see a doctor.  While insurance makes it much easier to get medical care, consider that not paying premiums also frees up some money to pay for a doctor visit.  So, even though it seems steep, the total of several months of insurance premiums can actually top that cost.  The savings you have realized may compensate.  I would recommend that an uninsured person try to put aside what might be spent otherwise to buy insurance into an earmarked account for medical needs.  I know it wouldn't cover something big like hospitalization and it's harder because it isn't done automatically through payroll, but it could help in these cases.    Best wishes and Happy New Year.\n\n",

My vision was normal all day until I took my contacts out and turned off the lights and I realized that suddently my vision had gotten worse. Whenever I looked at a light (the numbers on my clock, or the little green light on the smoke detector) in the dark, I saw circles like looking at a streetlight through a wet windshield, and I'd never had this happen with things so close to me before.  I also noticed I had to be startlingly closer to my clock in order to read it than even the night before. If I put my glasses back on, however, my vision is normal. Is this something I should be concerned about?  I am a 24 yr old female with no history of eye problems other than poor vision (about -6 in both eyes), and I am not on any medications.\n\n",

I have gotten eyedrops from my doctor,used stye medications, did the wash cloth thing for 4-6 weeks and nothing is working. My eyelashes are nearly gone where this lump is and now I have a brownish orange spot on the outer part of the eyelid where I have besicly no lashes. What could this be? I have never had any problems like this before. When I was younger I had a lazy eye and that was treated. Not sure if that could have a part in this. But any answers and thoughts are greatly appreciated. Thank you so much for any advice you may have.\n\n",

While at work the other day (my university's health science library) I was bored and started reading artcles in Pubmed about arcus many of which linked arcus to CAD and other disorders, and that when arcus is seen in patients under 40 yrs. old they should be evaluated for lipid abnormalities. Does it seem odd that she did not mention that too me or did not suggest following up with a GP. Both of the doctors I saw are said to be high up in their respected fields (the University of Utah).

If you have not had a general exam with lab work, it's always a good idea to know where your cholesterol, thyroid and other blood counts are.  So, consider a general exam.  You are right that the University of Utah staff are very competent, so perhaps there is a reason.  You can also approach this doctor about your concerns and find out why she did not worry about this.  Good luck\n\n",

It becomes worse when you think about it so the best thing to do is to try and relax along with getting plenty of sleep - even short naps periodically throughout the day.  Cognitive behavior therapies can help you learn to reduce stress which can also trigger this condition.  There is no known cure for this, though trials are being done now involving botox.

I did read of a case of an eye transplant in a small child which restored his vision.  This was in India.  This is not typical medical procedure so getting a transplant would be nearly impossible right now but perhaps not in the future.  Also, if your goal is not necessarily to restore sight, but for cosmetic purposes, it seems even more likely but I am speculating.  I am not seeing any sign of recent advances in this area.

    "content": "Hello,  When i was a baby both my eyes turned in. At about 18months old i had an operation on the right eye to straighten the eye. Then at 3 years old i had an operation on my left to straighten.   In the following years i was prescribed glasses and also used eye patches and eye drops. Then at 8 years old i was discharged by my doctor and told that there was no need to wear the glasses anymore or for any other treatment (although on occasion i still would wear my glasses when i had a headache, as wearing the glasses would make the headache go away). However i was told that in later life i may want a operation for cosmetic reasons.   In my later teens i noticed that my left eye would turn out whenever i was over tired, drunk, etc. Then when i was about 22 years old that left had turned out almost permanently. At 24 years old i had a operation on the left eye only, which was to straighten the eye. After the operation everyone told that the left looked a lot straighter, although i thought that it still turned out (but it was quite hard to judge as the eye had not fully healed/opened). Now 5 months after the operation the i have noticed that the left eye has turned out permanently.  So my questions are would another operation on the left eye be worthwhile? (as i have been informed it can quite often take two operations to get the eyes in alignmnet)  Would useing eye patches or eye drops be effective? (or am i to old for these treatments to work).  If another operation would prove effective and is the best option, would having the operation done privately be a good idea?   I have been told that going private for eye operations quite often produces better results (i mean no offence to the NHS). Mainly because there hospitals are specialised eye clinics, and there equipment for measuring how much the eye has turned out is state of the art and so more accurate.  Sorry if i have given to much information, and feel free to ask any questions if you need any more information.  I hope you can help. Cheers, mike.\n\n",

Once the eye pathways have fully matured the patching is unlikely to be effective.  If your vision is now good you may not need further surgery.  If you are having any double vision or eye problems, the corrective surgery may help some.    If your vision is OK and you are not satisfied with the  cosmetic results of the eye alignment further surgery may help also.  I would recommend you discuss the benefits and risks with an ophthalmologist to be able to make an informed decision.  Unfortunately, I cannot comment about the differences between private and NHS surgeries.  I do not have any knowledge of the specifics of this.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Ocular Herpes Simplex",
    "content": "I was recently diagnosed with ocular herpes. My eye had been infected for almost two weeks when the diagnosis of herpes simplex was made by an ophthalmologist. Prior to the diagnosis of ocular herpes, my primary care physician had been treating the infection with antibiotic drops.  Currently, I am taking oral Acyclovir and pred forte drops in the affected eye. Six weeks have elapsed since the initial infection and four weeks since I started the Acyclovir. I have been told by my ophthalmologist that I have not had an active infection for three weeks now. The Acyclovir dose was 5x400mg daily but I am now on a maintenance dose of 2x400mg daily. I have been advised to taper off the pred forte drops and should be off of these completely soon.   I continue to have mild symptoms in both eyes intermittently. Basically things feel funny from time to time. Sometimes there is a mild burning sensation. Sometimes a feeling that something is stuck in the eye. Sometimes a little tearing. I am also having sinus symptoms (runny nose, plugged up ears) which were quite severe during the initial outbreak but have become mild and intermittent since that time.  Is this typical of ocular herpes ? The initial symptoms of the infection were relatively mild (watering bloodshot eye) with very little pain so every time I experience discomfort in my eye, I assume that I am having another outbreak. Could there be something besides ocular herpes going on here ? My ophthalmologist has examined my eyes on a fairly regular basis and found no signs of acute disease in my eye but he has not offered any explanation for the ongoing symptoms expect to suggest that I ask my primary care physician about the sinus problems. I am very concerned that I may still have active infection.  1. Age: 38 2. Sex: M 3. Past diagnoses: None 4. Past surgeries: None 5. Family history: None 6. Current Medications: Ibuprofin + See Above\n\n",

However, there can be some nerve damage from the herpes virus that can cause pain for some time.  It may be that you are experiencing symptoms of this.  My knowledge of HSV eye infections is limited.  I strongly recommend you continue to follow up with your ophthalmologist as eye infections can cause significant complications if not followed closely.  Sorry I can't be of more help to you.

    "content": "Hi.  I've been having eye floaters with increasing frequency the past month or so.  It started with my right eye occaisionally, then my left eye.  Now, it's at the point where it's just repeated floating things over and over.  It's kind of annoying and worrisome since it's happening so fast with no explanation.  I went the eye doctor twice, he did a bunch of little eye tests, but he said he sees nothing except floaters.  Well, I believe there is an underlying cause to make them happen so suddenly.  What are some other things to consider, like other fields of study?\n\n",

    "content": "It is normal for people to get the occasional floater.  However, persistent floaters are an indication that something is going on until proven otherwise.  There are a few possible causes.  Retina problems can cause floaters to appear.  They may also be an early warning of an impending migraine headache.  Rarely, they may be seen with migraine headaches that do not actually have a headache.  They may also be seen in association with high blood pressure.  If your ophthalmologist is confident that your eyes are not the cause  and the floaters persist you should see your regular doctor for a full evaluation.  At that point, referral to a neurologist may be needed.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I am a 26 year old female. I have no past diagnoses except for a ovarian cyst last summer. No surgerys. I am on no medication. My family history is very clean except for my mother had breast cancer and my grandpa had prostate cancer (I know I don't need to worry about this one...lol) Well my question is this.  I have had perfect vision my whole life. But lately my vision seems clouded or foggy. I can see just fine but it seems foggy. My thinking process feels the same way. Just typing this seems different. I know where all the letter buttons are, but I keep messing up and needing to back type to fix things. Like I type a letter that I think is right and it isn't, sometimes its even on the wrong side of the keyboard. The eye sight is starting to make me nervous when I drive, like I said I can see just fine, but its foggy. So any ideas on what causes these symptons. I also have other problems too, don't know if they are in conjunction with eachother. I have been gaining weight for no reasons. I don't eat more, I only eat two meals a day (not a lunch eater.) I go walking with my kids frequently. I also feel very tired and weak lately. Just bathing my kids kills me, from being tired and also my back has been hurting. I also have been having headaches alot. I have had migraines my whole life (family curse) but these headaches are different. They are more in the back of my head and sometimes they feel more deep inside. I know alot of these has nothing to do with eye problems, but like I said, I don't know if they are in conjuction.\n\n",

Many years ago he had a motorbike accident and as far as i can gather,he injured his eye and had to have a false lens inserted? Anyway he has been fine since then excpet that in recent years he noticed a gradual decline in his quality of vision in this eye. Further investigation reveals that he has raised intra ocular pressure. His physician has been prescribing eye drops for some time now but the problem continues and he describes what seems to be a gradual loss of vison,like a shdaow,which is closing in from the periphery of his vision. I have urged him to seek a second opinion as i feel that he is worsening and yet perhaps nothing will be done until it is too late to save whatever sight he has left..any feedback appreciated.\n\n",

If your friend is getting worse even though he is taking his eye drops on regular basis, i think he needs to ask his doctor to change his medications, or seek a second opinion. Loss of vision from glaucoma (increased intracranial pressure) in most cases, should be preventable.  i am not an ophthalmologist but i think that there are types of glaucoma that are treated with surgery.  i think you should urge your friend to talk to his doctor about other options or seek a second opinion.

    "content": "Hello,  I am sorry to hear what your brother has just gone through. I am not an ophthalmologist but I can tell you that there are many causes for sudden unilateral loss of vision.   These include ocular ischemia resulting from atherosclerosis, emboli from various sources, arteritis, tumors and other conditions of the brain and orbit. It may also result as a complication of classic migraine.  In addition there are some reports of sudden monocular visual loss due to nonarteric anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) with the use of drugs such as quinidine, sildenafil (Viagra), vardenafil (Levitra), and tadalafil (Cialis).  I would think a good way to start searching for a cause would be an ophthalmoscopy and maybe an MRI of the brain and orbit or a carotid angiography.  Please note that he does appear to have a poor lipid profile making carotid atherosclerosis a possibility.  Best regards,\n\n",

Like I said Cardotid endarterectomy will not help the loss of vision but will help prevent him from getting a more serious stroke which could render him paralysed and unable to speak.  Like any intervention there is always a failure rate and a recurrence rate. If it's indicated in his case (according to his doctor) then he should do it.  Yes these medicines prevent stroke.

    "content": "Greetings:  My son was born 1lb 11oz back in 1995. As a pre-mature baby he suffered many surgeries and made it. However, he has optic nerve damage and he was diagnosed yesterday that he was legally blind. He does have scarring on both eyes. I believe the cornea but would have to make sure. Can you answer my questions below?  * Can he have an optic nerve transplant? * Will a corneal transplant help him? * How difficult or easy is it to get donors for this? * Is there hope that someday technology will give him sight again?  Sincerely, A desperate father  I understand from an article posted from your site:  \"Eye transplantation is more correctly referred to as corneal transplantation, a procedure that involves exchanging the cornea of a damaged or diseased eye with the healthy cornea of a recently deceased donor.  The cornea is the eye's outermost layer. It is the clear, dome-shaped surface that covers the front of the eye. The cornea must remain transparent to refract light properly so that we are able to see.  A corneal transplant can help someone who has greatly reduced vision as a result of injury, disease or infection of the cornea.\"\n\n",

    "content": "cgreenwell wrote:My son was born 1lb 11oz back in 1995.   Development of vision is a gradual process. First few years of life are too crucial.  If the light rays doesn't reach the retina for some reason or the other, the vision is hampered permanently. Either partially or fully. You haven't mentioned whether he had vision loss since birth or it diminished gradually. As a pre-mature baby he suffered many surgeries and made it. However, he has optic nerve damage and He was diagnosed yesterday that he was legally blind. He does have scarring on both eyes.     Scarring most likely suggests involvement of cornea. Again, if it is since birth, it hampers vision development as no light reach retina.  Also, optic nerve seems to be involved due to whatever reasons. Optic nerve carries visual signals from eye to brain.   * Can he have an optic nerve transplant?    No.  * Will a corneal transplant help him?    No. Even if Cornea is transplanted, the rays will ultimately reach retina. And from retina it will need an optic nerve to carry the visual impluse from the eye to the brain.  Also I am not very sure about the status of the retina. * How difficult or easy is it to get donors for this?    There are many who donate their eyes after the death. Getting a donor shouldn't be an issue as such. But point is, is it worth it? * Is there hope that someday technology will give him sight again?    Theorotically - Maybe.  Practically - No.\n\n",

    "content": "The ciliary body is the structure in the eye that secretes the transparent liquid within the eye (aqueous humor). It also contains the ciliary muscle, which changes the shape of the lens when your eyes focus.   Glaucoma is increased pressure in the eyeball due to obstruction of the outflow of aqueous humor; damages the optic disc and impairs vision (sometimes progressing to blindness).  Several treatment options are available that are designed to decrease the ciliary body's production of aqueous humor. These include medical as well as surgical and laser techniques. But before we get into any of that she should be examined and it should be established first whether she indeed has glaucoma or not. If its just the bleeding (hyphema). Blood usually reabsorbs, but the doctor must make sure the process is resolving itself. If intraocular pressure increases or if bleeding reoccurs, she may be hospitalized.\n\n",

I've noticed over the last couple of weeks that every now and then my eyes feel funny. Like my vision is distorted. It's not that i can't see clearly but almost like i have to consiously focus my eye. Almost feels like i'm crosseyed but i'm not. I've also had some light sensitivity some days to the point where my eyes water quite alot and hurt if i'm outside. I've had almost constant pain in my eyes espessially my right eye where it feels like the eye itself (behind the eye mostly) aches. Yesterday i woke with a really scratchy feel to my right eye and noticed it was very red and had a small lump on the white of my eye between the tear duct and the part of the eye that's colored (not sure of what the parts of the eye are called) My left eye has a small lump too in the same spot. It's smaller though and is clear. Looks a little like a blister. Today they're not as scratchy but are aching and my vision feels a little funny. Like i said i can still see properly. Its hard to explain the exact sensation. Like the inside of my vision in my right eye is a little fuzzy.  I know this is all probably a little vague but if you have any ideas on whether i should be worried or not would be great. I'm not sure who to see about it or if i should just let it pass.  Thank you for your time.  Karen\n\n",

    "content": "My 36-year-old daughter had a heart attack and lacked oxygen to the brain for several minutes. She can walk, talk, and perform many daily functions with little or no help. Her long term and short term memory is good. She has some cognitive lapses.  Her major concern is her vision. At times she can recognize colors, faces and objects around her. Then she says everything just goes away, like someone has closed her eyes.   She can look at a wall and see one or two items (e.g. a curtain) but not everything on the wall (e.g. a picture). She sometimes can see one person in a room, but not another standing next to the original person.   She does not always realize she can see and mentions something like \u201cit is raining\u201d when looking out a window. When asked how she knows\u2019 she is somewhat surprised and realizes and says, \u201d Because I saw the rain\u201d. And then the vision is gone. Many times she avoids items put in front of her, while other times she does not see them.  It does not appear there is one area or the eye that allows her to \u201csee\u201d, because when she \u201cexperiences vision\u201d it can be in front of her or to her left or right side.   She has had an MRI, which showed little damage, and no sign of what would be responsible for cortical blindness. She has also been seen by an optometrist and has no damage to the retina or optical nerve.   She remains in the hospital, but the doctors say they cannot explain her blindness and sometimes there are no answers to why the brain responds as it does.   Does anyone have a better explanation or suggestions for tests I should request? Barb\n\n",

    "content": "I was hit in the eye with a squash ball a week ago. I had blood in my eye and went to an optometrist. My pupil was also an oblong shape. I was given pilocarpine drops to constrict the pupil and maxitrol which I think was to clear up the blood.  The blood is now gone and my eye looks much better. The pilocarpine drops constrict my pupil to a tiny size. My problem is that when the drops wear off, my pupil is large, slightly irregular and it does not constrict or dilate. It stays much larger than my healthy pupil. Is that because the pupil may still be affected by the drops.  I don't understand why?The eye muscles seem to be working because the drops cause them to constrict. Could there be nerve damage? I am planning to go the optometrist again next week.  Thanks.

The pilocarpine was likely prescribed to reduce the ocular pressure in the eye. I would relate your symptoms to the injury itself and suspect a possible structural damage rather than the relationship of the eydrops themselves. It's good to know that you are going to have a follow up with the optometrist. Be sure to keep your appointment. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

The neck pain is also an extension of migraines sometimes.   When you get an aura, you should take whatever medication works for you at that point in time.  Something with caffiene is usually the best over the counter treatment, like Excedrin or a generic equivalent, provided you don't have a history of ulcers.  It has aspirin, Tylenol and a small amount of caffiene, about the same amount as in a cup of coffee.  It doesn't give very many people the jitters.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I had a rhabdomyasarcoma as a child behind my right eye. During the course of treatment, radiation and chemotherapy, I lost the vision on my right side. In the 18 years since, my right eye has become ever increasingly red as new veins grow across the eye itself, and more cloudy as the glaucoma or cataracts develop ( I have both although I'm not sure which causes the cloudiness). At this point my eye is very red and the cloudiness is now more and more visible. My question is two fold, would I be a candidate for a corneal transplant, and if so what would the end result be? (reduced redness, cloudiness, etc...) I doubt I will ever have my vision restored as my optic nerve was damaged, or so I've been told. Secondly, would I be advised to pursue having the cataract and or the glaucoma removed? If so what would be the net benefits?  My main concern is my health, and at this point my right eye is in constant pain, which unless I give it specific thought, I've essentially tuned out, or become accustomed to. However, I would also like a cosmetic improvement, i.e. a reduction in redness, and cloudiness.  Any advice is greatly appreciated, my opthamologist is always so short and simply answers no to my questions. At my next appoitment in May I plan to be more active in our discussions, but I'd like to know as much as possible and living in a remote community a second opinion is unfortunately not an option.\n\n",

As this happened when a friend was assembling the gun there was no eye protection. He has seen an eye doctor/surgeon who is monitoring him. Hyphema is present, IOP is 21, abrasions and lacerations to the cornea and white of the eye as well. Vision is reduced to only recognizing that there is movement at an arms length away without detail. He said that there is severe bruising to the retina and that the blood in the anterior chamber will be reabsorbed. The pupil in the injured eye is fixed and dilated. What causes that? As the eye heals will the pupil return to normal and with this kind of injury are the chances of regaining full vision in the injured eye good? Any advice on home treatment to increase the chances of this?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello jillyb118, I'm afraid I'm not an ophthalmologist, but would like to help nonetheless! Here are a few things you should know that you may find helpful. First of all, you have to know that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should be absolutely avoided in your sons case. A patient with a hyphema who has a normal IOP is usually treated with corticosteroids and cycloplegics, but that depends on what your doctor recommends. IOP reduction is usually necessary if it is higher than 30 mm Hg. Patients with early IOP elevation following blunt trauma should be reexamined every 4-6 weeks during the first year to monitor the condition. Some early cases are self-limited, but patients should continue to be observed after the condition has appeared to resolve. Other early cases represent a severe form of the disease that may be refractory to standard medical treatment; such cases warrant more frequent follow up. Blunt eye trauma can interfere with the function of the nerve supply to the iris (parasympathetic nerves) resulting in dilation of the pupil. As for retinal involvement and vision, ultimate outcome depends upon time, degree of damage and whether the macula (central part of the retina) is involved or not.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Did they give you any medication for your eye? You should ask your Physician to swab your eye to recheck that the treatment is appropriate for the infection if you feel it isn\u2019t working.  Conjunctivitis is inflammation of the conjunctiva which is a thin, clear membrane covering the white of the eyeball and the inside of the eyelid. There are different causes of conjunctivitis and treatment will differ depending upon the cause.   Viral conjunctivitis usually affects only one eye and causes excessive eye watering and a light discharge.  Bacterial conjunctivitis affects both eyes and causes a heavy discharge, sometimes greenish.  Allergic conjunctivitis affects both eyes and causes itching and redness in the eyes and sometimes the nose, as well as excessive tearing.  Giant papillary conjunctivitis (GPC) usually affects both eyes and causes contact lens intolerance, itching, a heavy discharge, tearing and red bumps on the underside of the eyelids.   To pinpoint the cause and then choose an appropriate treatment, your doctor will ask some questions, examine your eyes, and possibly collect a sample on a swab to send out for analysis. Always wash your hands before touching your eyes, try to keep touching at a minimum and don\u2019t use eye drops unless directed to by your Physician, even to get the red out \u2013 they make the irritation worse.\n\n",

The sight loss will only last about 3 or 4 minutes but it is usually accompanied by a loss of balance & some degree of disorientation, not good for a teacher in class.

The neurologist prescribed anti depressants & when I ask why he told he did so because my Spanish is so bad. I am English living in Spain. I pointed out that my wife is Japanese & it is her language that I am studying most, not Spanish. Neither of the doctors I have seen have made any physical contact with me so can have no idea about blood pressure or anything else. I have also not been asked if I smoke or drink. This does not inspire me to trust or go back. Any thoughts would be a help.  Thank you, JCMF\n\n",

    "content": "Dear JCMF, I am certainly not an expert in this problem so please excuse me but your post reminded me of something that happens to my mother.  She will get flashes of lights in her vision field and then will loose partial site for a short period of time. Her physician diagnosised her with migrains even though she does not have any pain prior to or after this episode. Here is something I found on the web. perhaps it will help you explore your situation further.  The aura of migraines The two main types of migraines are those that occur without aura or those that occur with aura. Aura refers to an array of psychologic or neurologic disturbances that occur shortly before migraine onset. Compared to migraine without aura, migraine with aura is the less common type, but it is perhaps more medically intriguing, and for patients who get them, more unsettling. (Aura also can occur without a subsequent migraine, a factor that can result in mischaracterization of the migraine type. More on this below.)  Auras typically last 5 to 20 minutes and involve symptoms such as vertigo (motion sickness or dizziness), imbalance, confusion or numbness; but most auras consist of visual disturbances such as partial vision loss, the appearance of \"special effects\" and distortion of objects. Sometimes the visual effects can be dramatic, says Dr. Mays\u2014flashing lights, complex color patterns and shapes (e.g., triangles and dots), and floaters (the perception that some tiny foreign object is floating across the eye). An individual might also see shimmering or zig zag lines in the peripheral vision and blurriness in central vision.  The \"one-eye\" migraine In a related condition called ocular migraine, which is even less common than migraine with aura, individuals experience the same visual disturbances that occur during an aura, but the symptoms only occur in one eye. The aura that occurs before an ocular migraine is commonly followed by a migraine headache. And the same triggers that can bring on migraine with or without aura also can cause ocular migraine.  Ocular migraine can produce various degrees of vision loss or obstruction. Some patients, says Dr. Mays, report blind spots or \"holes,\" referring to missing sections in the normal visual field, or they may experience a shade of black or gray over the visual field. Some people compare the visual phenomena of ocular migraine to the patterns produced by an old television with faulty reception, says Dr. Mays. \"Others say it\u2019s like looking through watery glass.\"  Ocular migraine symptoms are temporary and do not harm the eye; but they can interfere with daily activities, such as reading and driving and can interrupt the work day.  Fear about vision loss caused by ocular migraine often leads an individual to seek medical care, says Dr. Mays. In some cases, the first stop is the ophthalmologist\u2019s office. That\u2019s fine, says Dr. Mays, but people diagnosed with ocular migraine should also see a neurologist so that conditions such as stroke, which can cause similar visual symptoms, can be ruled out and so that the migraine itself can be effectively managed. Other conditions that produce ocular-migraine like symptoms include retinal artery thrombosis (blood clot in a vein inside the eye) and, as noted, migraine with aura.  Confusing auras Although ocular migraine and migraine with aura are very similar experiences, one key difference is the source of the vision disturbances. In migraine with aura, the occipital cortex of the brain is the source of vision disturbances. In ocular migraine, it is the retinal blood vessels inside the eye. The retina is the thin lining on the back, inner part of the eye that prepares images for processing by the brain. An individual experiencing the aura of ocular migraine could cover or close one of the eyes and stop the symptoms. Not so for an individual experiencing traditional aura. \"The symptoms affect both left- and right-sided vision,\" says Dr. Mays. \"The source of the problem is the brain, not the eyes.\"  For some reason, says Dr. Mays, auras that occur without a subsequent migraine often get labeled\u2014by patients and physicians\u2014as ocular migraines. She speculates that it\u2019s a combination of a lack of knowledge about migraines and the notion that if there are visual problems but no migraine, it must be an \"eye,\" or ocular, problem.\n\n",

    "title": "Loss of sight",
    "content": "Angelseakr, \t\tThank you, your post comes very close to describing the problems I am having. I had discounted migraine reasoning that it would not affect one eye while not affecting the other, it seems I was wrong. I do avoid things like drink, chocolate & sweet things in general because these will bring on a headache, as will sleeping more than 4 or 5 hours. The head aches didn\u2019t (& don\u2019t) seem to be related to the loss of sight, which as you describe is more like a grey cloud that blocks out the central area of sight. The \u201cnormal\u201d pattern of attack will be lightheadedness & a general distubance of vision to the point that I need to sit down, this then is followed by one or both eyes clouding over. The pressure in the head, near the temples, will at this point be incredible, but in small classes I can usually bluff my way through, though to what degree it is not noticeable I really don\u2019t know. I think that this really does fit very closely to what you posted. I think, on re-reading, that I should add that my first post was not a critique on Spanish doctors, I do have Spanish doctors who are friends & they are excellent, but they will not of course say a word about others that may be a little less than excellent.\n\n",

I haven't had this in months.  Whatever I am looking at, say a computer screen, one side will not be very visible because this long curved string of \"prism'd\" triangles of color will be there.  If I want to see something on that side, I actually have to look a little farther to that side and allow the blurry part to be farther from where I wanted to look.  Sometimes it is actually on both sides and I can only see the middle of my vision field.  The remaining outer portions are locked into that \"prism\" of color triangles!  It will last any where from 20 minutes to over an hour.  My B/P is fine at the time.  My blood sugar is fine (I used my husbands meter!).  I am not dizzy or anything .... just cannot see!  Again, when I mentioned this to my eye doctor, he just shrugged it off and didn't even tell me what it could possibly be, whether minor or not.  Any ideas? Thanks! Teresa\n\n",

    "content": "Dear natureschild1961, You are description it appears that you have what are known as eye floaters. You can often see them when looking at a plain background, like a blank wall or blue sky. Floaters are actually tiny clumps of gel or cells inside the vitreous, the clear jelly-like fluid that fills the inside of your eye.  Floaters may look like specks, strands, webs or other shapes. Actually, what you are seeing are the shadows of floaters cast on the retina, the light-sensitive part of the eye.  For most people, floaters occur as they grow older. The vitreous humor thickens and clumps as we age, and floaters result from the clumped vitreous gel. Eye injury or breakdown of the vitreous humor may also cause spots and floaters.  This is more common in people who are: nearsighted;  have undergone cataract operations;  have had YAG laser surgery of the eye;  have had inflammation inside the eye.  Most spots and eye floaters are merely annoying but harmless when they temporarily enter the field of vision, and many fade over time.   If you suddenly see new floaters, or eye floaters accompanied by flashes of light or peripheral vision loss, it could indicate serious conditions such as diabetic retinopathy; vascular abnormalities such as retinal hemorrhages or carotid artery disease, or the beginning of a retinal detachment. You should see your eye doctor immediately. Best regards,\n\n",

    "title": "Strabismus: how to prevent scarring? Is laser use possible?",
    "content": "I had a number of operations correcting strabismus. Five on my left eye and two on the right. It was so many because the first attempt was unsuccessful and the second caused extensive scarring of the eye globe surface. Current condition is a scar at the bottom of my left eye that joins together eye globe awith the surrounding fat tissue lining inner eye socket.  I am looking for every possible way to disjoin the eye globe and the fat and if possible to remove the mass of the scar and still to have them separate after everything heals. To my knowlegde nobody claims that he/she can do it. When a surgeon uses a knife, always a new mass of scar if formed that welds together eye with the eye socket severley limiting eye mobility.  In this letter I am trying to ask the ophtalmologists' community if an ophtalmic laser can be used in order to separate tissues. If anybody know if a laser can be used for this purpose at all, and how the healing goes on. Is there any lower probability of the scar formation after the surgery? Is there a chance that the touching surfaces of the eye and the surrounding fat will stay separated? Thanks.\n\n",

    "title": "Blindness cured?",
    "content": "Hi!  Yesterday I read something about about a priest called Padre Pio who had stigmata for many years of his life and was said to be able to do various miracles. He died in 1968 and was proclaimed a saint by the Pope in 2002.  There's one \"miracle\" in particular I find interesting. On many websites you can read that in 1947 he cured a blind girl who was born without pupils and who still lives today and can see normaly since then. Nevertheless I have a hard time believing this... unfortunately there are not many critical websites on the net regarding this girl/woman. In fact the only one I could find yesterday was in Italian and it took me some time reading it, since my knowledge of that language is rather restricted and I needed the help of an online translator. The link to that website: http://www.cicap.org/emilia/pupille.htm  In this article the author writes \"Contattando dei medici veniamo a sapere che esistono rare patologie con sintomi simili a quelli dichiarati dalla Di Giorgi.\" which translates to \"Contacting the doctors we came to know that rare pathologies exist with symptoms similar to those reported of Di Giorgi.\"  So maybe there is a natural explanation for her condition. Another detail from this article I find remarking is that she always wears sun glasses and if she removes them, her eyes are trembling as if they were irritated by the light. This could be an indication that her vision isn't really completely perfect. Regarding the rare pathologies with similar symptoms the author doesn't go into further detail. That's why I'm posting this on the forum: I'd like to hear a medical opinion about this case (with the information available). They say this woman was born without pupils, the iris in her eyes is compact without an opening, so there is no natural way for her to see. What do you think of this case?  Gemma di Giorgi is the name of the woman. On http://biblia.com/pinilla/italia2.htm you can see a videoclip of her when you click on \"Gemma en Televisi\u00f3n\". The clip shows a close-up of her eyes, but unfortunately the image quality is very weak.  I know this is not a personal medical problem I have, but it puzzles me so I hope I'll get an answer to this. Many thanks in advance,  Seeker\n\n",

    "content": "Hello: I am afraid this forum is not set up to answer spiritual questions but rather is for the discussion of medical problems.  On a personal note however, since I am Christian, it is interesting to me when I read of these \"miracles\", that the individuals who are \"healed\" are not totally healed, such as this young girl you mentioned.  However, in the Bible it shows that when Jesus and/or the apostles healed someone the healing was total.  It would seem to me then that if someone were to regain sight due to holy spirit it would be complete and not partial.  Also Jesus was able to resurrect persons from the dead and so far none of the so-called healers of today have claimed that ability.  So is it really from God, or is it a ploy of evil men?  I leave that for you to answer. Regards, Carolyn\n\n",

    "content": "I was diagnosed yesterday with a bacterial corneal ulser.  My eye doctor had me using Vigamox 0.5% every 30 minutes.  Today I am still using this every 30 minutes and he also gave me Pred Forte 1% to use 4x per day to reduce the pressure and Alphagan P 0.15% 2x's per day.  He did not do a culture to see what kind of bacteria it was and I am wondering if the Vigamox will kill all bacteria including Pseudomonas?  I could not even see a chart on the wall let alone a BIG E.  On this computer screen I can only see colors (blue and white) no writing with the eye with the ulser.  Yesterday the pressure in that eye was 13 and today it was 26.  What is the significance of that?  I am worried I'll never see again with this eye.  Is this a good form of treatment ?   What are Pseudomonasbacterias???  I read (with my good eye) that they can cause severe damage and even blindness within 24-48 hours if not treated.  Thank you. Lisa Hastings\n\n",

Tuesday, 14.09.04 I had the most horrid tired eyes - they feel so strained - eyelids have been a little puffy. My body itself does not feel tired.  Wednesday - stayed home from work, eyes were severly strained and just slept the whole day, feeling tired.  My eyes have been feeling dry and tired ever since.  I am a secretary who spends a lot of time in front of the computer adn read a lot. I am meant to wear reading glasses which were prescribed 6 years ago - but due to financial constraints just never got them.  Do I need to go for an eye-test ?

In these disorders, the macula degenerates prematurely with loss of central vision. So far, a cure has not been developed. There are many diseases belonging to this category, since i am not an ophthalmologist, i am not familiar with them, so i will not be discussing any of them.   The person that you are referring to should be seen by an opthalmologist to see which type of degeneration he has and his daughter as well should be seen to see whether she has any signs of early degeneration and to have appropriate genetic counselling and to have a prognostic evaluation for her vision.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

The cornea is the eye's outermost layer. It is the clear, dome-shaped surface that covers the front of the eye. The cornea must remain transparent to refract light properly so that we are able to see.  A corneal transplant can help someone who has greatly reduced vision as a result of injury, disease or infection of the cornea.\n\n",

    "content": "Chrisy, Surgical procedures aimed at improving the focusing power of the eye are called refractive surgery. In LASIK surgery, precise and controlled removal of corneal tissue by a special laser reshapes the cornea changing its focusing power.   It is associated with risks and its not for everyone.  You are probably not a good candidate for this procedure if:You are not a risk taker. Some jobs prohibit certain refractive procedures. You required a change in your contact lens or glasses prescription in the past year. This is called refractive instability. Patients who are: In their early 20s or younger,  Whose hormones are fluctuating due to disease such as diabetes, Who are pregnant or breastfeeding, or  Who are taking medications that may cause fluctuations in vision,   are more likely to have refractive instability and should discuss the possible additional risks with their doctor.  You have a disease or are on medications that may affect wound healing; such as autoimmune diseases (e.g., lupus, rheumatoid arthritis), immunodeficiency states (e.g., HIV) and diabetes, and some medications (e.g., retinoic acid and steroids) may prevent proper healing after a refractive procedure. You actively participate in contact sports. (boxing, wrestling, martial arts). You are not an adult.  Currently, no lasers are approved for LASIK on persons under the age of 18. Precautions Do NOT have LASIK surgery if you have a history of any of the following:Herpes simplex or Herpes zoster (shingles) involving the eye area. Glaucoma, glaucoma suspect, or ocular hypertension. Eye diseases, such as uveitis/iritis (inflammations of the eye) and blepharitis (inflammation of the eyelids with crusting of the eyelashes).   Eye injuries or previous eye surgeries.  KeratoconusOther Risk FactorsYour doctor should screen you for the following conditions or indicators of risk: Large pupils.  Thin Corneas.  Dry Eyes.Being only 18 years old, I think you should wait, maybe 5 years as you suggested; because clearly its not an ideal procedure for everyone. You don't want to do something that brings on more problems than it solves. Regards,\n\n",

    "content": "A very strange thing just happened to my left eye, and I'm wondering if I should go see a doctor about it..  Suddenly the pupil in my left eye is dilated, at first I didn't feel a thing, I noticed it in the mirror because the pupil was abnormally large compared to my right eye. But then several minutes I started feeling strain, as if something is pulling on it.  Could this be something serious or is it something that will pass?\n\n",

    "content": "Rachmaninov, One day after the incident and i am wondering if it did indeed pass? if so make no significance of it. If it recurrs and / or is a cause of concern for you then have an ophthalmologist see it. Pupilary dilatation   cant be judged easily from looking in the mirror as it may differ depending on which eye is exposed to more light. Dr. Tamer Fouad, MD\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Pupilary dilatation",
    "content": "Dear Rachmaninov,  Thank you very much for using our website.  Pupillary reflexes can sometimes be tricky. If you look at a close object the pupils usually constrict as a part of a reflex. Just looking in the mirror by itself with one eye i guess could make you think that the other pupil is larger if you could concntrate long enough to see that it is really that larger. And of course as Tamer mentionned it could be just the lights. And let me ask you how would you know that the left pupil is the one abnormally larger and that it is not the right pupil that is abnormally smaller or constricted???  However, unequal pupils (a condition called anisocoria) is sometimes normally observed in some people who do not have any medical condition and are totally asymptomatic.  Unequal pupils are sometimes a sign of neurological diseases (disease of the nerves that supply the eyes or the part of the brain that controls the eyes).  You have told us nothing about your medical background so that we can say whether or not you are predisposed or at higher risk of developping such diseases.  If this is not causing you any symptoms, i think there is no need to see a doctor for the time being, or if you happen to see your doctor for other reasons it would not be a bad idea to let him check your eyes.   Once more, thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "sir, i agree with u.i would like to comment on one more aspect.  lets assume there is dilatation of left pupil...and not the constriction  of right pupil..Mr.Rachmaninov experienced strain in left eye ( might be just because of anxiety)..   in addition to the possibilities discussed by Dr.Mokhtar theres one more possibility...Mr.Rachmaninov must have accidently put some mydriatic (or cycloplegic) drug like tropicamide(or atropine) in his left eye...even fingers smeared with above drug can do the trick.if it lasts for short time the possibilty is its mydriatic..if for few days..then it might be a cycloplegic.A cycloplegic(atropine) will produce visual disturbance while mydiratic (tropicamide) will hardly produce any visual disturbance.     on the other hand,miotic(pilocarpine) in right eye might have produced constriction...which Mr.Rachmaninov must have appriciated it the other way !!   Mr.Rachmaninov,do u have anybody at home using drugs for eyes?if yes then abovemight b one of the possibilities !! thanks Dr.Amit Rajput\n\n",
