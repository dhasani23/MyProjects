    "title": "Tested negative for all common STDs, but itching persists?",
    "content": "In June, shortly after engaging in unprotected sex for the first time with my current partner, I experienced intense vaginal itching. A month later, I had sex with him again, multiple times, each time more painful and leaving me more sore than the last. I had profuse yellowish discharge that was most prominent after sex, burning during urination, lower abdominal pain, and it hurt too much to even encourage bowel movement. I always felt the pain, when I walked, when I sat down (I had to make sure to sit down gently), always. After our last sexual encounter, I also started bleeding, nearly a week before my period was due (although this was presumably due to missed birth control pills). These unusual symptoms slowly subsided within a week, and it was back to just intense itching. Nevertheless, I freaked out and Googled and couldn't help but self-diagnose. I was convinced I'd contracted chlamydia or gonorrhea, as my symptoms were pointing to one of the two, or possibly both.  Last week, I went to the clinic and got tested for the three most common STDs: chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomonas, as well as yeast infection and bacterial vaginosis. The doctor gave me medication for BV, which I finished yesterday. Although the itching has decreased, it's still there. I also see white pasty stuff between my inner and outer labia (which I've noticed for awhile and thought nothing of; assumed it was regular vaginal discharge that somehow got stuck there). I called the clinic about my results today and they told me they all came back negative, even yeast and BV. So what could have caused those worrisome symptoms, and what could still be causing the itching? Am I not cleansing well enough when I shower? Is it the Nair I use down there? Please help!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It is possible you could be sensitive to the hair removal cream so you could try eliminating it to see if it helps.  Having ruled out infections it seems likely that it is nothing serious.  I doubt it is a hygiene issue if you are bathing normally.  Excessive scrubbing is not necessary and douching is not recommended.  If it gets worse you should return to your doctor but otherwise I would recommend waiting and watching to see if it gets better on its own.  Best wishes.\n\n",

It is possible you have developed a yeast infection (itching is common) and this can be treated but it's best to find out for sure if that is the problem since a bacterial infection would require different medication.

    "content": "I have many test over the past three months. at first i have problems with my pill, i was bleeding during the active pills and experienced some swelling. i had a urine test which came back negative. at this time my new boyfriend was diagnosed with gonorrhea which i think was most likely from me seeming he hasnt had a sexualy partner in a year he said, and considering that he had symptoms within a week. at this stage in our relationship we had only done oral sex. I have now noticed green discharge, i have had more swabs done which all came back negative again. i have now got a rash on my vagina wich spread within days, it almost looks like it was eating at my skin. There was a burning sensation and started to bleed when i went to the toilet. the doctor immediately thought it was herpes, i had more swabs done of the cervix and the sores themselves and also blood tests. all these results came back negative. being not so sure of the tests i went to a differnt doctors surgey for more swabs and blood tests which all came back negative again. At this time i have been having painfull cramps in my lower abdomen almost like period pains, i had ultra sounds done and more swabs and the results were all normal. i have changed pills to one which has a higher dosage of chemicals but doesnt seem to be doing anything different. i have experienced pain when having sex to. i would really like your opinion and any reasoning into what is happening, if im infectious, and could have something that would test positive as gonorrhea when passed onto a male? any response to this would be very helpfull. Thank you\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,Assuming that you did transmit Gonococcal urethritis to your boyfriend with only oral sex then the only way you could transmit is if you have pharyngeal or tonsillar gonococcal disease.DNA probe test and culture from pharyngeal area has a good specificity. Pharyngeal gonorrhea could be asymptomatic but canbe a source of disseminated disease and is more difficult to eradicate than genital infection.Though this is relatively uncommon yet needs to be thought of too.However the commonest form of transmission remains genital.

She recently told me that she has HPV (the kind that can cause cervical cancer--she thought it was either Type 16 or Type 18) and that she had unprotected oral sex with the partner from whom she received it. My question has three parts:  1) What are the specific risks, besides becoming a carrier of the virus, that I face by having unprotected oral sex with her?  2) What are the specific risks that I face by having protected (condom) sexual intercourse with her?  3) Is the Gardasil vaccine approved for men, and if we wait 6 months for me to get all three regimens of the vaccine before having sex, will it fully protect me against getting HPV types 16 and 18?  I have looked around on the Internet, but haven't been able to find a good guide that fully addresses these issues.\n\n",

I have been with my second partner for nearly 6 years and have always slept together without a condom as she is on the pill. We were however apart for 6 months and she did have another partner in this time.  Over the past year I have noticed a number of small warty looking lump appear on my penis.  I have also seen  a DR about this who precribed me Warticon. I used this and they do treat the lumps but have reappeared. The thing is my girlfriend has also been the DRs and has had the all clear from genital warts twice so I am not infecting her and if she does not have them has not infected me.  Could this be a case that they are not warts and something else but the warticon is also affective on. thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Back in October 2009, my Pap results came back with ASCUS, and during my repeat Pap in March of this year, they'd progressed to LSIL. I'm not sure if Pap tests detect genital warts, but my doctor told me I had no sign of them, and spoke to me primarily about the potential precancerous changes in my cervix, so I assume that I have the cervical cancer strain of HPV.  Is there a point in getting vaccinated with Gardisil if I've already been exposed to HPV? I know that Gardisil prevents the common cervical cancer strains as well as the genital warts strain, and if I've already been exposed to the cancer strain, I'd at least like protection against genital warts. Is this possible at this point?\n\n",

This person got any sign of any illness, sores, blister or whatsoever. She was looking perfectly healty.  5 days ago I saw some red rash like bumps on: 4 around belly 1 between pubic hair and belly 4 on my right leg: buttock, front and groin They look like spider bites.  NOTHING on my penis, near my penis or scrotum.  I did some research on internet, and got super scared, i started to think these are the signs of an HSV infection. I slept in anxiety and wake up, go to bathroom and... ! a cold sore on my face! near my lip. A cold sore exactly as I feared of.  I've been to a dematologist today, 1.he told me the bumps has nothing to do with herpes (i don't think so..) 2.I may a have HSV1 since childhood and its just an outbreak because may i have been stressed and weakened last days (its true that i am weak now given the stress i had when I started to think i have herpes! and I had some cold sores when i was a child, thats also true) 3.He thinks i have a repeating HSV1 or a reinfection of HSV1  Seen the new Intercourse I had and the match of indications i am almost sure I got newly infected, or reinfected..by HSV1 or HSV2 I don't know..  Now my question is: I have still nothing, no sores or bump in my genitals. ..But I had the rash & bumps on belly and leg. And the sore on my lip. Do I have HSV1 or HSV2????  Doctor prescribed exams for finding it but I need an opinion before lab exam, i am in a very bad psycological situation..  please anyone who has something to say about Herpes prodromes relative to HSV1 and/or HSV2, matches and differences, how to distinc them, please tell. Is there a possibility that HSV1 causes rash on my belly and sore on my lip??\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,The question that you ask is is it possible to distinguish clinically Type1 and Type2 as a prodrome or a primary infection?Unfortunately no.Infact there are not much difference seperating the two types except the preferential locations.This virus locates in the nerve ganglia,and that time it is known as neurotropic.When it comes out via the nerve  there is the prodromal pain.Now outside it blisters throwing out some viral particles,and known as viral shedding.At the skin level it is known as epidermotropic.Not all persons will show the blisters, but continue to shed the virus without knowing. Type1 is comfortable at the facial area and type2 genitalia based ganglia.There is some protection here but not absolute preventing the other type from infecting.Yet outside location the virus type generally gives a muted respose,ie outside preferential location.Recurrence becomes uncommon beyond preferred area. In your case should it recur,you can get tested.There is no cure here but as years go by shedding tends to become less.Treatment would reduce shedding and symptoms. Best wishes.\n\n",

If symptoms persist after that time you should go back to the doctor.  Once cleared you would not pass the infection on to others, regardless of the mode of sexual contact, but you could become reinfected if you have sex with someone else who is infected.    The infection can occur in various parts of the body where contact was made with an infected partner so you can have it in one organ and not another.  I hope this helps.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Pubic Lice Incubation Period",
    "content": "hi all   i realised a couple of days ago (3rd of august) that i have pubic lice, i had them once before in college so im 99% sure it is. But  im wondering about how long it takes for them to come out and show and stuff like that.  i started a new relationship with a girl on the 12th june and she said that the last person she slept with before me was on the 4th june. i slept with her on the 26th of june but i only noticed a couple of days ago (3rd of august) that i had pubic lice. she is the only person i have slept with since we got together and before her I had not slept with anyone in 4 months.  i suppose the question i am asking is... is it possible that if the person she slept with on the 4th june passed them onto her that they would take so long to show on me? given that i slept with her on the 26th june.  my infestation is not bad, not as bad as i had before and hardly noticable until further inspection but i did remove a couple of what seemed like full grown lice and there are a good few other tiny red bumps and the usual stuff.  thanks in advance for your help\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,Phthirasis pubis is otherwise known as pubic lice can get transmitted not only by increasing promiscuity but also by public bedding.Thus it is difficult to date this from the date of sexual contact.These also infest the eyebrows and eyelashes.Also the infestation may not be noticed till the person develops an hypersensitivity.Thus though the infestation may be immediete,the manifestation may take some time to exhibit. Pediculocide as recommeded by the manufacturer is the treatment but this should not be applied to eyelashes.Shaving is a good way to get rid of the mite. Best wishes.\n\n",

I have tried lamisil cream but it still persists. I have not been intimate for more than two years. Is this a STI and what over the counter medication can I use to cure this? This irritation has been there for more than two weeks. I do not have any pain when urinating. It is summer where I am now and hot.  Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hi camcam,  Trichomonas is an anerobic (does not flourish in oxygen) protozoa, which is a parasitic microorganism.  It is the most common sexually transmitted disease.  The only known effective treatment for trichomonas is metronidazole, or Flagyl.  Treatment consists of either a single dose or 2000mg, or 500mg twice a day for 7 days.  Usually, treating the female partner is sufficient, but if the infection recurs, both partners need treatment.  I could find no information that chemotherapy might be effective against trichomonas.  Rather, chemotherapy lowers a person's resistance to possible infections by any organism, so trichomonas may actually flourish during chemotherapy treatment.  Trichomonas is a frequent occurrence in persons with HIV.  Encourage your partner to advise his physicians of his possible trichomonas infection so appropriate treatment can be given as needed.  Good luck to you and to your partner.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, though Herpes I and Herpes type II belong to the same group, yet behave differently. The predominant mode of transmission of herpes type I is non sexual while type II sexual. The type I has more preference to the phase while type II to the genitalia. Though it is possible for the type I to infect the genitalia, the chances of getting a clinical infection are indeed most unlikely. At best, it maybe a mild non recurrent infection. Basically the Herpes viruses are latent infections and the virus inhabits the ganglia of the nerves. Most cases of type I are acquired in childhood but they do not suffer from clinical disease.

    "content": "There is a possibility you could have a sexually transmitted infection such as genital herpes but of course I cannot diagnose this.    A doctor or other health care worker may do several laboratory tests to try to determine if symptoms are caused by the herpes simplex virus. A person may still have genital herpes, however, even if the laboratory tests do not show the virus in the body.  A blood test cannot show whether a person can infect another with the herpes virus, but it can show if a person has been infected at any time with HSV.   Herpes is treated with antiviral agents to help control future outbreaks.  Again, I cannot say this is what you have but it is one possibility worth investigating.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  A girl I met has a single lump on her upper lip. Its located away to the right (between the laugh line and mid lip ridge), and approximately half way between the lips and nose (so it is away from the red part of the lip, on the same type of skin as the rest of ones face). It is kinda large, with a diameter between that of a pencil and sharpie. It is raised about half the length of a pencil eraser. It is smooth, and has a pinkish to almost clear color (she is caucasian).  Im also certain she is sexually active. With my own web research I found diagnosis ranging from benign tumor to hpv warts and various others. The location away from red part of lips and it being just one single smooth bump has mad it hard for this novice to diagnose, what could it be?  Ive seen people with bumps and lumps of their face that seem like just normal anatomy, how do you tell the difference? Id rather not catch anything, so if it doesn't seem like an STD I would pursue something. Thanks, Alex\n\n",

Many lesions have \"typical\" morphological features which help a clinician in making a provisional diagnosis.This is what is called as \"inspection\". Feeling the lesion comes next(\"palpation\"). From the description given, it could well be one of many possible conditions. A broad term which may be used is that it is a \"nevus\".   You say \"if it doesn't seem like an STD I would pursue something\". In this situation, to hazard a guess and to offer a diagnosis(an STD diagnosis or some other) which may make or break a relationship, taint a reputation or cast aspirations is not in my opinion appropriate.

    "content": "I'm a 28 year male that was diagnosed with herpes simplex type 2 about 10 years ago.i have never been on any antiviral medications since the initial diagnosis ie 10 years ago thought i would experience severe breakouts that is low grade fevers frequently.Now 10 years later i started to experience rapid weight loss and muscle wasting.my symptoms are accompanied by profuse sweating and dry mouth symptoms. my concern right now is the severe hair loss  experiencing on  my scalp and all over my body.  My scalp hair is thinning rapidly and have this patchy hair loss .also  I'm losing hair all over my body.  a)Can untreated HSV2 cause the hair loss and thinning ,if so would this loss be permanent b)What tests can i do to determine if HSV is causing my hair to fall out c)would topical minoxidil or a DHT blocker  help to restore my hair loss due to herpes\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, HSV-2 is a localized disease and it infects certain ganglia in the body and comes out to the skin during reduced resistance. This is not associated with hair loss. Alopecia (which is actually hair loss) is of two types. Scarring and Non-Scarring types. In your case, we are talking in terms of non-scarring Alopecia. The commonest non scarring type is Telogen Effluvium which leads to sudden diffuse shedding of hair. In this condition spontaneous regrowth is possible. This condition is generally caused by stress and may follow severe illnesses. Certain drugs, thyroid problems, also are implicated here. Other causes would include iron deficiency, inadequate diet, secondary syphilis and malignancy.  In your case you may need a full blood count, serum iron measurement, liver, renal and thyroid function tests and tests to rule out connective tissue disorders, tests to rule out immuno deficiency. Treatment would be based on after identifying the specific cause.  Best Wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: chlamydia and gonorrhea",
    "content": "Hi, It would have been more helpful if you had give a little more information about which particular methods were used, which type of specimen was used and which site was sampled in your instance for testing.  Another crucial information that is not forthcoming is whether your husband has been tested and what the results were.  However,i would urge you to first visit the following link (http://www.doctorslounge.com/forums/vie ... 61&t=48038)  before continuing to read the compiled information that follows, addressing the various tests available in this regard, their advantages and disadvantages.   A variety of laboratory tests are now available for the diagnosis of Chlamydial infections including isolation in cell culture, direct florescent antibody (DFA) assays, enzyme immunoassays (EIA), nucleic acid probe (NAP), and nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) etc.  NAATs can be used with either urine or swab specimens for men and women. - The real advantage is that this test can detect C. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae in a single specimen.  - A disadvantage of some NAATs (specifically the PCR platforms), is that specimens can contain \"amplification inhibitors\" that can cause false negative results.  - NAATs need a high level of technical laboratory expertise to perform the test. - The sensitivity of NAATs can vary by specimen type with particularly low sensitivities for PCR using urine samples from women.(to the extent, that some experts recommend that non culture test results should be confirmed due to chances of potential false positive results, particularly among asymptomatic individuals).  Nucleic acid hybridization (nucleic acid probe) tests are also available. Both of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved tests, PACE\u00ae 2 and the Hybrid Capture II\u00ae, can detect C. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae in a single specimen. - These tests also require a high level of technical laboratory expertise to perform the test, and  - also exhibit lower sensitivities compared to NAATs.  It is obvious from the foregoing account that even the best available tests have a false positive or false negative rates. Clinicians are perhaps as concerned as yourself about the interpretation of these results and treating their clients.  Currently, CDC recommends empiric treatment against chlamydia in persons diagnosed with gonorrhea, but not vice versa.  Ultimately, for a clinician, the decision to empirically treat even in the setting of a negative lab result depends upon (among other considerations),  - the population involved(high risk/low risk), - The probability of a given individual having the infection, - the probability of a person not returning for re-testing (if deemed necessary), or - partner testing positive.  It is very unlikely that one may test positive due to another bacterial infection. Even if one of the tests is truly negative, if your doctor feels that you should better be empirically treated, i would urge you to follow his/her advice. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "20-50mm Translucent Hairlike Things and Cloudiness in Urine",
    "content": "I travelled to London about three months ago and had unprotected sex. I contracted chlamydia, gonnorhea, and something that, as yet, cannot be identified.   Symptoms are:  >Pain in region of bladder, especially at the left and right extremes. Pain is escalating as time goes by. >Urine - Translucent hair-like floaters - about three to five per urination depending on the amount of water I've been drinking. They are generally about 20-50mm long, but the length is difficult to judge because they are often clumped in upon themselves. Their width is as per a human head hair, and their shape is shaped roughly like average pubic hairs (No, they definitely are not actual hairs, unless my bladder is hirsute). They are accompanied by cloudiness which adheres to them (and settles to the bottom upon standing) unless I consume an excessive amount of water, in which case they come out clean as described. Said cloudiness has a similar appearance to ejaculate in water, but is different enough to differentiate the two. Urine smells foul, similar to the way it would smell when dehydrated. >Anus - small round nudule on the rim of anus and stinging bowel movements. >Testes - dull pain extending upward through the tubes. The pain felt toward the top of the tubes could be the pain I'm identifying as bladder pain on each side, I'm not sure.  Tests conducted so far are:  Chlamydia and Gonnorhea - clear after initial antibiotic treatment; STI, UTI ; Syphilis; Hep A,B,C; HIV. These tests have been conducted three times. All were clear.  Unsuccessful treatments so far (including those prescribed for the chlamydia and gonnorhea): >Amoxycillin - one singe 4g dose, and a later full course of 500mg three times daily for two weeks and augmented for about three days with probenecid. >Ceftriaxone - 250mg intramuscular injection. >Azithromycin - 1g single dose on three separate occasions (doctors just kept giving it to me...). >Trimethoprim and Sulfamethoxazole - three day course (can't recall the dose, but it was the standard one for a UTI). >Cranberry juice - 2l over one hour... I was getting desperate. >I just started on a self prescribed (since the doctors here basically shrugged their shoulders and accepted defeat) course of antiparasitic (anti-worm) tablets, but they are indicated for intestinal worms.  >I've tried drinking massive amounts of water to flush my system - it didn't work.  Any help would be greatly appreciated. This has dragged out for a long time. Thanks.\n\n",

The cause of this condition remains to be fully elucidated and some feel it is due to fastidious organisms in the prostate which can not be cultured routinely from the urine. You may need uroflowmetric studies to ascertain the cause.A prostatic biopsy may be indicated in some and studies to culture using sophisticated methodologies using RT-PCR. You may be put on another course of antibiotics after a repeat culture.Finastride is a drug tried, if proved to be nonbacterial prostatitis. Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm an 18 year old female. I have had sex TWICE in my life with two different partners (AKA once with each). I used a condom both time, and am not sure if the second time was actually completed, since i had to leave, and the act was only approx ten minutes long.  I have found small whiteish/redish bumps on my vagina (frequent masturbation led to these findings) they are very small. i also have some (not more than normal/before i had sex for the first time) discharge and itching.  i had sex for the first time last june, and for the second time at the end of july.  i noticed the bumps within the last month.   does this sound like any type of STD? i have been blood tested since then for herpes, and other things. i assume these tests would cover HIV. also i don't have any other symtoms of HIV, or any other symptoms in general (no fever, vomiting, rash, etc)  do any doctors out there think that those bumps are an STD? or am i just being paranoid?   i would very much appreciate a response from multiple doctors. thank you so much.\n\n",

    "content": "There are many STD's and the symptoms vary some; however, in general STD symptoms include vaginal burning/dysuria and discharge.  Malodorous discharge is often found.    The bumps you describe may be a normal finding, or may represent blocked glands.  There are several glands at the opening of the vagina that can become blocked and infected.    Itching and discharge may represent an STD or may be a yeast infection.  While using condoms greatly decreases the risk of STD's, it does not eliminate all risks.  I would suggest you be evaluated by a gynecologist for an examination.  This will give you a more definitive diagnosis and likely make you feel better.  Also, just so you know, HIV is not generally included in \"standard\" STD labs unless you give consent for this test.  If you did not consent it probably wasn't tested for.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

I've been tested for chlamydia and gonnorhea in the past just as a precaution because I tend to be very very paranoid when it comes to STD's. (I tested negative for both) In the last 2 weeks, I've had a very irritated vagina, some days I don't notice it at all and some days its quite itchy. I have no discharge, no bumps or unusual marks (I've checked very closely) and no odour. The itch seems to be around the labia and around the vaginal opening. I've tried switching my soaps thinking maybe that could be irritating me, but no change, and I've used Vagisil anti itch cream, which works temporarily before wearing off. 3 weeks ago I did take antibiotics for tonsilitis, do you think this is just a yeast infection? Any response would really put my mind at ease, I'm quite nervous.  Thanks.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: chlamydia and infertility",
    "content": "Hi,  Most available data indicate that the severity and the chronicity of chlamydial infections appear to be highly variable. Infection in women is mostly subclinical or asymptomatic. However, in these cases,if not treated adequately, the very  same sequelae as that of symptomatic salpingitis ensue (fever, pelvic pain, tubal obstruction/infertility, and high risk for ectopic pregnancies).  Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) have superceded cultures and other tests due to their accuracy, ease & convenience of specimen management, and ease of screening sexually active men and women. Culture is useful only in certain special circumstances (for testing non-genital specimens).  Sample collection appears to be crucial.  Even with the most sensitive nucleic acid amplification-based method, the rate of specimen positivity was much lower if endocervical cells were absent. An adequate specimen would be expected to contain endocervical cells.  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1168 ... t=Abstract  Thus, there is a likelihood that a false negatives may result even with the best available test.   The chance of becoming infertile after symptomatic PID increases with the severity and number of episodes and is highly variable(6 to 60%).  Thus, there are a number of variables in the successful diagnosis of chlamydial infections, ranging from errors in specimen collection to the varied presentations and natural history of the disease itself.  The fact that you tested negative an year ago should be reviewed with this background information.Perhaps, it is difficult, if not impossible, at the present time, to guess the exact duration of a chlamydial infection in an individual. Best wishes!\n\n",

This may not be true with mucus membranes the soft red areas of vagina,penis or anus in which vigorous rubbing,microabrasions,and contact with blood,vaginal or spermatic fluid can form a nidus for transmission.Skin again with abrasions is at risk.The moral is to inspect your and partners fingers during mutual masturbation and see that there are no injuries.

    "content": "I understand that there is a window period between transmission and when HIV is detected by a HIV test. However I am wondering if there is a a waiting period between having sex with a HIV positive person and infection/tranmission. I read that the test detects HIV antibodies, but are these only detected in the bloodstream? Because I thought it can take a while for HIV to enter the blood stream. This is why i ask. So does the window period begin immediately after exposure to an infected person or later? I wana make sure a HIV test is performed at a time where it would definately detect HIV if I was infected.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, There would not be much point in doing the antibody testing prior to three months after exposure.  A negative test at three months usually means a person is not infected with HIV. If an individual\u2019s test is still negative at six months, and they have not been at risk of HIV infection in the meantime, it means they are not infected with HIV.    Keep in mind, you could become infected by another exposure if you are careless in that way and if you are infected you can spread the virus to others even before you know the results of your tests at three or six months.

If I walk into a high school gym, you would smell me entering from the other end in seconds.  The smell makes other people sneeze and makes their noses run.  I've even seen friends break out all over their body in hives from the smell.  Is their anything I can do about this infection HPV has caused me to have.  The smell is too much to handle.  it's constant.  It's worse then life right now for me.    Their is no secretion from my penis.  just the warts on my tip.  and maybe some herpes.  Will antibiotics at least get rid of this smell possibly\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Tests for Sexually transmited diseases (STI)  may test for a single infection, or consist of a number of separate tests for any of a wide range of STIs. No procedure tests for all suspected pathogens.  The site of testing may vary according to - the sexual history, - the type of infection suspected.  Just to give you one example, let us take the example of gonorrhea.  In asymptomatic heterosexual men (those without urethral discharge), a culture of urethral specimen is ideal. If urethral specimen is not possible, then, the urine is tested ideally by nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT). Cultures from the oropharynx is not recommended.  In the case of asymptomatic men who have sex with men (MSM), NAAT (if urethral specimen not available) and for oropharynx and rectum, cultures are recommended. A urinary or urethral culture may not reveal an oropharyngeal infection. A person can obviously have a gonococcal oropharyngeal infection without a urethritis. It all boils down to sexual preferences & practices!.   I can give more examples, but i think it may not be necessary. Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,Despite not ejaculating you need to be investigated for STDs if you and your partner has not had a mutual monogamous relationship.Oral sex without condom ,inserter or receiver with or without ejaculation need to be tested for chlamydia,gonococcal infections,HIV,HPV,syphilis,Hepatitis Band C.Withdrawl before ejaculation would significantly help in reducing the rate of spread of infection. Presence of gum disease,ulceration,or recent flossing could potentiate infection if organisms are present. It is required for you to wait for,in your case the symptom of itch would not fit in for a diagnosis, in symptomatic treatment. Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "My friend was living with me and my husband for 4 months until she got back on her feet. She found out a few months into her stay that she had chlamydia and gonorrhea. We have a 7 month old daughter. I have anxiety, which is why I'm freaking out. I was wondering. Since my friends things wer ein my daughter room with my daughters things can it get passed to her? Can it get passed to us? I know people don't wash their hands every time they use the bathroom, can it be passed that way? She slept on my couch, in just underwear? I'm just really worried we're all going to get it... Her clothes were scattered throughout my daughters room, etc.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,The references from the US dept of justice and literature clearly state that gonococcal and chalamydial urethritis are not transmitted by fomites,meaning towels and toilet seats etc.www.thelost.org/en_US/.../sexually_tran ... _abuse.pdf. The only chlamydial infection that can get transmitted by fomites is C.trachomatis which can cause an eye infection which has a direct venereal transmission,autoinnoculation with genital secretions,or by fomites in humid conditions.  Chlamydia trachomatis can be transmitted by a nonporous plastic surface in vitro.Cornea. 1995 Sep;14(5):523-6. Do get the child examined but it is most unlikely any such transmission would have occured since the fomities happen to be nonporous plastic surface and the child does not suffer from conjunctivitis.

(all came back ok)... i have been ok until yesterday.  i used a vibrator.  after maybe 5 -6 hours, i started getting those sharp pains again center of lower pelvic area. maybe very slightly to the left at one point. and minor lower back pain.  it has subsided a bit and now it's more dull almost gone.  i do have some side pains, but they feel like they are more muscle soreness than internal.  side as in right where the dip of the stomach is below the breasts.  i read now on symptoms and it says herpes can also appear on the inside (cervix etc).  do these symptoms sound like herpes?     .. foot note.  i have sjogren's.  thank you for your help.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Shooting pelvic pain after intercourse",
    "content": "Hi, In the past herpes virus type 2 was mainly associated with genital herpes but of late, both herpes virus type 1 & 2 seen to cause this condition.  The disease initially appears as  - a 'First outbreak', during which the symptoms are severe and later on - continues to cause 'recurrent outbreaks' of lesser severity.  Women tend to experience more severe disease and higher rates of complications during the first outbreak. In women, herpes lesions may occur anywhere in the genital area including the vulva, inside the vagina, on the cervix, and urethra. Herpes lesions can also occur in extra-genital areas such as the thighs & buttocks. Herpetic lesions are common during the first outbreak, but the typical vesicles,each perched on top of an erythematous base may not be seen.Rather,there may be tiny acute ulcers. The first outbreak symptoms are as follows. - fever - myalgia - malaise - headache & - lymphadenopathy.  At times, \"Internal outbreaks\" may occur (lesions affecting the inside of the cervix and/or urethra). These cases may present with  - deep pelvic pain - vaginal discharge - Dysuria & - dyspareunia    internal outbreaks have the potential to be misdiagnosed as a pelvic inflammatory disease, yeast infection, cervicitis (inflammation of the cervix), and Herpetic lesions that involve the urethra may be misdiagnosed as a bladder dysfunction or urinary tract infection.   In recurrent infections, women may experience only irritation in the genital area without a rash. Therefore, it is important that women presenting with recurrent vaginal symptoms or vaginal discharge  be investigated for herpes.  Although your symptomatology is not typical of herpes outbreaks, herpes needs to be excluded. Sjogren's syndrome may be contributing to the atypicality. Best wishes!\n\n",

My period is gone and still have the pelvic pain .. now also my lower back and back of legs my thighs my joints..

    "content": "Hello, I am 19 years old and I have had little white bumps on the shaft of my penis for as long as i can remember,  I can pop some of them like zits but there are about 50 of them mostly towards the bottom of my penis, I am uncircumsized and on the inside of my foreskin there is some sort of scar tissue. I was wondering if these are dangerous or not and if there is anything I can do to get them to go away.  also on another note I was wondering If I could get circumsized at this age if I chose to do so... Thanks in advance doctor\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  The little white bumps sound  like they may be superficial \"whiteheads\" due to inadequate local hygeine. (This is not a criticism, but the area is subject to more sweat, etc., than most other body areas, and so is prone to this sort of thing). They of course could be indicative of something more serious, such as herpes, but only if they change in appearance, become red and open sores. These don't sound like that. Do get them checked though, since it is so difficult to know for sure what's going on in this region, especially if you have unprotected sex.   The scar tissue you describe shouldn't be of any concern beyond whatever discomfort it may cause you. As for circumcision, you can absolutely get that done at your age if you wish. It's totally a personal choice and a pretty simple surgery (as you can imagine). Discuss this with your doctor as well.\n\n",

    "content": "I've had a similar problem with my penis, but the little white bumps are spread on my scrotum as well. These bumps started appearing around the age of 12 and I've had them since. They are mostly near the bottom of my shaft. Some of them do, on rare occasion, become larger and red, like a boil of sorts, and I usually pop it like a zit (as hard2tell32 mentioned.) but by the end of the week, they are usually back to normal. I don't know if it could be herpes but when i was 12 i wasn't having sex. I know that it could be from a different source, assuming they're herpes, but I'm really too embarrassed to bring my situation to the attention a local doctor. If there is anything I can do at home to narrow down the possibilities of what I hhave, please let me know. Also if there is anything else you need to know about my problem, just ask and I will answer with all my ability.\n\n",

    "content": "To Madness and jerz -  I've seen this before, but know little about the cause. In my experience the sort of bumps you mention look like little pustules but are painless and don't seem to progress to anything really bothersome. They've been largely dismissed by doctors I've worked with, or simply noted and then dismissed. If there is pain, redness or soreness involved, you really will need to bring it to the attention of a doctor, and doctors honestly aren't interested in anything but the \"case\" before them, so you mustn't feel embarrassed. If they are innocuous and don't bother you except when you see them, they are probably best left alone.   Wish I could give you more to go on, but that's about the extent of my knowlege on this subject.\n\n",

    "content": "I have this same exact problem since about the same age. They started just after puberty. It has nothing to do with cleanlyness because I shower twice a day and do not sweat much at work as I have a relaxed job. The only reason I noticed this post was because it has been recently concerning me because I would say over the past 5 years it has extremely slowly spread to my penile shaft. The bumps are tiny and they are not painful and only rarely can they be popped like a zit. They first appeared on my scrotum at a young age (pre-sexual) so I know it is not an std. I am sure alot of people see this post as it comes up in the first 5 search results in google for the title. If you could ask a dermatologist friend it would be very helpful to get to an exact point since there are probably a lot of people that read but do not reply.   thank you in advance for any type of research on your part or a coworker it is much appreciated.\n\n",

Some people have them, some don't, but so long as they don't become irritated or otherwise bother you I'd just continue to practice good hygeine and maybe mention it to the doctor during a routine physical, if they're even still present by then.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Jamal.  My name is Adam, and I currently am 17...  Your \"peeling skin\" from your penis is most likely caused simply by irritated skin...  It had happened to me once and I had found out the reason, because of my lubricant (Body soap, I was about 15, c'mon).  Any lubricant that you use that isn't intended to be a lubricant is NOT a smart idea (Unless something pure such as spit...).  Basically, my penis had skin that decided to harden up and peel off...  It was by far the most painful thing I had to endore, always itchy, always irritated....  If that doesn't fix your problem, try just slacking off masturbating for a week and see if it stops, maybe you're stroking too rough and slowly you're ripping your skin... -------------------------------------- Now, back to the subject...  I have had these white bumps, actually I still have them...  I have been circumsized and they mainly gather right beneath the head of my penis.  I have TONS beneath my head, so don't worry.  I have tried to pop one before and was barely successful with a painful relief...  I haven't had sex though I have done things that freak people out; use dirty bathrooms, sleep in other people's clothing, and other things like that but even at that, I'm pretty sure that it's not an STD...  If I were you I wouldn't worry unless it began to spread elsewhere from your genital area.  -Adam\n\n",

    "content": "Tags: STI/STD, oral, sti, STDs, Anxiety, worry, stress, HIV Hey!  I am sorry if this question has already been asnwered, but I couldnt find it.  I am a male who was stupid enough to receive unprotected oral from a girl at a massage place on a number of occassions.  I am now awaiting my tests results and have been advised that I really don't have anything to worry about, however, my research on the net indicates otherwise.  Obviously I will confirm my results, but, in the mean time, I am suffering from serious stress / anxiety.  I also have a slight rash on my face that is a bit irritated and feels inflammed. Can anyone tell me, what are the risks of contracting HIV if a clean and healthy male receives oral from someone who potentially has everything?  thanks in advance!!! - I haven't slept in days!!!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,There are no exact data but then it is certain that the chances of transmission are much less than vaginal or anal sex. The entry point in case of infection would be from the urethral mucosa or the anal mucosa or through small cuts  or sores. Latex condoms help in prevention, and in those allergic to it polyurethane condoms. Dental dams are helpful to prevent the infection as a latex barrier.Plastic food wrap has been used as a barrier to prevent herpes simplex though it is not an approved method.By the way other STD's also could get transmitted during oral sex. You will have to wait for your results for appropriate action if ever there is anything.As of now always practice safe sex. I am sure you received counselling before the tests. Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 24 yr old male and had unprotected sex for the first time some weeks ago and about 1 week after that, I noticed many tiny red bumps all over my penis head. These bumps would not Itch or tingle but just remained there. I am uncircumsized and soon there was this redness on my foreskin all over... again no Itching or anthing. After a week or so, most of these bumps disappeared and I thought I was fine. However now, (3-4 weeks later), I have had these really small pimples with white heads, that seem to burst after a day or so and turn into a blister. Again, these are concentrated in 2-3 regions (both sides of penis head, and in the front) in groups of 1-4 pimples. They do not Itch but tingle very occasionally. Also, the tiny red bumps are still scattered all over my penis head. There is nothing noticeable on my penis shaft, foreskin, scrotum or anywhere else.   I have not yet visited any doctor, as my reading up online seems to suggest that this is nothing serious. I have read everything from residual irritation, to soap rash to herpes, but nothing seems to perfectly fit the symptoms. Also, my girlfriend has been tested very often and recently as well she came out clean. Feel free to ask me any more questions.   Thanks in advance for your help!\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks Dr.Safaa for your quick answer.  I sure plan getting myself tested very soon. However, a quick question right now that might help rule out herpes. I have had this redness for a little over 2 weeks now and there has been absolutel no pain, just a bit of itching/tingling at times. The small white pimples started 3 days ago and they do not hurt whatsoever. I hardly even remember that I have a problem there. I heard that Herpes could go unnoticed at times. Could this possibly be the case for me?  Also, since my girlfriend has always come out clean after tests, is there still a possibilty that she has been misdiagnosed because tests were conducted when she didn't have an outbreak? She doesnt recall having an pain before, but only recalls having a yeast infection once many years ago.  Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The safest guess (and easiest to treat) is yeast infection.  This is a common ailment among women and is especially likely since you have been on antibiotics.  You can treat this yourself with over-the-counter antifungal cream.  In men this is called \"jock itch\" and the same cream works for that.  Look in the women's personal hygiene section of your pharmacy.    If that does not do the trick, you may need to see a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I ended up smashing it into power and putting it in her coffee. I know there is a moral issue here, but like the other guy; I really want to save my marriage.  My question is, would that take care of my wife and her gonorrhea?  Don\u2019t know if it would make a difference, but I got infected by unprotected oral sex, 69.  My wife and I have been using a condom, but she did give me unprotected oral.  One more thing, it\u2019s been 3 weeks and I still feel tingling on the tip of my pines, on and off.   Could I still have it?  Also my throat has been sore, hasn\u2019t gone away even after I took azithromycin.\n\n",

    "content": "About a year ago, I had an STD test just to be sure I was clean of everything. My blood test came back clear and they took a sample from my penis which also came back clear.  The doctor however told me that I had herpes. He couldn't however tell me which type, when I asked type 1 or 2?  and turns out now I can see how inexperienced the doctor was. I know I have a history of HSV1 because I have had cold sores on my mouth since I was a small child, and my mother had them, sister had them, so forth.  But I was curious if the STD test could have mistaken type 1 for 2 or if the virus is in your blood automatically because a patient has a history of type 1. What makes this even harder is the fact that he wouldn't specify the type. I haven't had any outbreaks whatsoever in my genital region anywhere, but to this day I continue to get a cold sore about twice or more a year on my lip.  Thank you your answer is appreciated greatly.\n\n",

    "content": "I suffer from intense anxiety which I keep a secret from friends. I am a chronic worrier and I over analysis every detail in my life, so this is why I post this question about the risk of HIV transmission during sex I had recently.  Frank details right to the point:  Had a one night stand with a woman I know nothing about last weekend.  Wore protection, it stay'd intact.  During sex, she pulled me out and gave me a brief blowjob with the condom still on.  We went back to having sex.  There was heavy kissing during sex following the blowjob. This happened about three times.  After she left, I cleaned up the condom and wrapper. I filled the condom with water in the tap before disposing of to make sure there were no holes. There wasn't, it stay'd perfectly intact. Tested it twice, then chucked it in the trash.  My question is: I've done some reading today about HIV transmission with oral sex, although I did not perform oral sex on her, can anyone offer information on how possible it is for vagina fluid from the condom, to her mouth, then directly to mine to transmit HIV or another STI. I guess anything is possible, and thats why my anxiety is so terrible.  One way or another, I'm going to get checked in a couple months, as I've already done twice before in the past couple years.  Please reply.\n\n",

This started only 36 hours after I had sexual contact with this person.  It has now been a little over 72 hours.  My doctor was highly doubtful of HIV causing these symptoms, but thought that it was best to get tested for all types of STDs, so this morning I did a blood test and a urine test.  We are going to follow up in 3 months with another blood test for HIV.  Would early symptoms (swollen tonsils, sore throat, night sweats) of contracting HIV show up this early, or would some of the other treatable and none treatable STD's also demonstate these symptoms aswell this soon following sexual intercourse?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: HPV and cervical cancer",
    "content": "Hello NellaX,  HPV (human papilloma virus) is a virus that is strongly associated with cervical cancer.  There are more than 100 types of HPV and a few are considered \"high-risk\".  These include HPV types 16, 18, and 31 (although the specificly high risk types varies slightly by region).  It is estimated that HPV types 16 and 18 are involved in about 70% of cervical cancer cases.  However, it is very important to know that while there are high risk strains of HPV, even the high risk strains still have a relatively low rate of subsequent cervical cancer given the extremely large number of people infected with the virus.  So, being infected with HPV is not a definitive diagnosis that cancer will develop.  It is, however, a definite indicator that your girlfriend should continue to have ongoing evaluations to screen for the development of cervical cancer.  Unfortunately, I cannot give you an exact percentage increase in the risk of developing cervical cancer as I do not know these statistics.  Regarding not recommending condom use to prevent \"reinfection\", if your girlfriend is infected with a strain of HPV, further exposure to the same strain will not increase the risk of ongoing infection.  Nor will using a condom increase her chances of clearing the virus.  It is possible, though to become infected with other strains.  In addition, the virus can be spread to others as can other STD's so condom use is always advised to help prevent the spread of STD's.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,Herpes simlex is a tricky virus.You may not know about as to whether you have contracted the disease, easily.Despite using condoms too it can get transmitted and only sure way is to have a monogamous sexual relationship with an uninfected partner.A positive blood test may not always indicate as to when it was acquired.Condoms do reduce risk.No drugs can cure or prevent as of now but they can reduce the symptoms and spread.Diagnosis is by visual examination of the typical blisters and getting the fluid in it checked.Many people will not exhibit disease but can spread it.Male to female transmission is more common.Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I assume you mean that you have contracted the virus genitally.   Usually the initial infectious outbreak is the most severe; later they are often milder and may be infrequent.  You may not have a problem at all during pregnancy and it will not affect your ability to conceive.  If you get an active genital outbreak near the time of delivery, the baby is often taken by cesarean section but if there is no active lesion a vaginal delivery can usually be accomplished.  Just be sure your attending doctor is aware of your history.    I know of no sure way to prevent this but stress sometimes aggravates it so try to keep yourself as stress-free as possible.  Use relaxation exercises, meditation, yoga, etc.  Best wishes\n\n",

I actually had to advise my doctor to deliver the baby by c-section. I did not appear to have an outbreak but I could feel a hard bump under the skin forming. I am glad that we made that decision because I had the outbreak two days later. My son is almost 6mos and my husband and I are expecting again. I am about five weeks into my pregnany and excited. My only concern is having multiple c-sections in one year but that is a conern that I will take up with my obgyn. Don't let the disease scare you. Enjoy your pregnancy, monitor your body, and direct every concern (big or small) to your doctor.  p.s. Sometime during the last six or four weeks before my due date my doctor had me take valtrex to reduce the appearance of an outbreak.\n\n",

I freaked out and immediately went to my doctor around 12 noon Monday (35 hours after sex). The doctor said its too early to tell but I went ahead and got tested.  My test results came back and I tested positive for HSV1 (mouth herpes). Then he said i tested \"barely\" positive for HSV2 (scored 128 but positive starts at 120) and doesnt know if i am really positive or not. And he couldnt tell me if it was too quick to tell if it came from 2 days before.  I have 2 questions:  1. Could this have showed up that quick after the weekend usafe sex or was it before?  2. is the 128 score (from the blood test confirm im positive or not?\n\n",

I saw a question asking about transfering herpes from ones hand to own genitals after fingering vaginas.  But my question on skin to skin contact is, what is chances of getting herpes just from contact with her vaginal area (fluids) to my hand or fingers, if I see no visible breaks on my hands? Everyone talks about skin to skin contact and getting herpes, and at same time talks about skin on hands being a good barrier. Can I get either herpes contracted by her vaginal fluids touching my fingers only??\n\n",

Is LGSIL FOR SURE a wart? or just pre-cancerous cells? ive read both and am so confused.  2. Am i likely to develop warts on the outside genital area, and is my boyfriend likely to develop warts as we have had unprotected sex for over a year so he definitely has the HPV.  3. Are there ever false positives for this condition because like I said this was a routine pap smear at a health clinic and the first abnormal result i've had. i normally get pap smears from my gynocologist.\n\n",

    "content": "LGSIL of the cervix is caused by many factors including early initiation of sex, HPV (strains 16 and 18) and Herpes infection, and other sexually transmitted bacterial infections. Pap smear can show false positive results for LGSIL. Many a time, these lesions regress by themselves after treatment of bacterial vaginal infections. However, you may proceed with your gynecologist's advice of colposcopy and biopsy and if nothing worse is detected, you may follow up with Pap smears.     Since you have been vaccinated with Guardacil, this may protect you from strains of HPV virus with which you have not already been exposed.    Genital warts are caused by HPV virus strains 6 and 11 and are relatively innocuous causing condyloma on the cervix, vagina and vulva. We don't know whether these strains of the virus have already infected you and your partner before you received the Guardacil in which case you may still get the warts. Using barrier contraception(condoms) would still be a good idea, in spite of using injection provera since it would protect you from various STDs.\n\n",

    "content": "Doctor,  I am extremely worried and 4 weeks ago I was given unprotected oral sex by a sex worker. We then proceeded to have protected vaginal and anal sex.  about a week ago I started feeling a tingling sensation and sort of crusting at the tip of my penis.no discharge and really not painful to pee but a warm sensation in the urethra that felt like an infection might. Very weak stream, dribbling and discoloration appeared with small blackish spots on the head.  Got a hold of amoxicilin and began taking it twice a day 500 mg within three days symptoms started to recede. On fourth day symptoms seem to be back a little although not as severe and the crusting seems to have turned bumpy aroudn the urethra but the rest of the tip looks healthier.  one other thing that happened is I was doing a lot of work such as painting and then did masturbate several times and sort of wore the same work clothes for a few days including underwear. i was wondering if that couls have caused irritation or infection.  I know there is no conclusive way to tell without being tested but i wanted to know if the amoxicilin could be effective, if this sounds like an STD symptom like chylamidia or ghonerea or more severe like genital herpes or mor elike a standard UTI.  thank you\n\n",

My question is my tests came back negative but I was taking cipro for the supposed prostate infection and just thought about it. I know cipro doesn't cure these but would it affect my results?

    "content": "Hi, PAP smear testing and colonoscopy are not primarily used for detecting STD's. But at times, incidentally may lead to suspicion of some STD .  For example, on PAP smear study,ASCUS may be incidentally seen. ASCUS (which is an acronym for \"Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance\") - which means that there are some abnormal- looking cells on the test and more tests may be needed to see if the HPV (human papillomavirus) is the cause for the changes.This, if confirmed, will lead to tests for other STD's.  There are reports of Colonoscopic biopsy specimens being analysed by DNA techniques for chlamydia pneumoniae & chlamydia trachomatis in cases of suspected IBD(inflammatory bowel disease).This no doubt,opens up many potential avenues for research.In future, other organisms also may be identified.  Thus, chance identification of one causative agent of STD's would no doubt, prompt screening of an individual for other STD's.  Let me stress again that PAP smear testing and colonoscopy are not primarily modalities used for detecting STD's. Good day!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Sewberry,  I agree with Debbie.  I would also add that if you have had the three shots there is no need for repeating the series.  It is reasonable for your company to ask for evidence of vaccination which can include having your blood drawn to measure the antibody levels in your blood to Hepatitis B.  If the vaccine has worked properly, the levels will be appropriately high, giving protection.  I would recommend you suggest simply having your vaccine antibody levels (known as titers) drawn to test your immunity.  If they are OK there is no indication for repeating the vaccines.  If they are low, you should have another vaccine dose to boost your levels.  This is all very well supported by the Center for Disease Control and their recommendations are available online at their website.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Except for that my lip was very swollen and I did not notice anything unusual. However, the day after that the swelling went down, except for in one spot. I get cold sores a few times a year, and so was concerned that I had gotten one because my lip had been bitten so hard. A day later I did develop a cold sore. I have read that herpes simplex 1 can infect the genitals as well, and I am very worried that after being bitten I could have infected us both with genital herpes. Unfortunately, I can't find information on how likely this is. Today, I noticed red spots on the inside of my foreskin, but as I have a history of balanitus this is fairly common, and it is difficult to tell if it is a herpes outbreak or if I simply need to step up my hygiene regimen.   Any help understanding the transmission of herpes between the lips and genitals is appreciated, as well as any other information you can provide.\n\n",

Then the other night he did it again and now he has it again. I do not have a yeast infection and I was tested for any sexual diseases when we first got together as he said his ex was cheating on him and I wanted to make sure she hadn't passed something onto him. I was clean.   I tried to find something about it online but didn't find much. I did however come across an article that stated thrush can happen more to people with autoimmune issues. He did tell me his doctor had told him in the past, that he has autoimmune. He is prone to get cold sores and rhumatoid arthritis runs in his family. Not sure if this has anything to do with it but it couldn't hurt to mention it.  I have since kissed him and I do not have thrush. Could I or he be a carrier of something that causes this? Could he have some kind of allergy to my natural juices?  I'm Concerned that we won't be able to enjoy this part of our sex life anymore.  Thank you for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "I was diagnosed with genital warts (HPV) back in 2001. I had a Rx of cream which made the cauliflower-like sores go away. I never had another sore until I contracted herpes from my longterm boyfriend. Still, no sign of the warts. Anyway, so I got a wart on my finger which I treated with an over the counter wart remover. No more problems. Well about a week or so ago I got a really dark rash that appeared on my chest in between my breasts. I see a cauliflower-like sore there and Im freaking out. Before I head to my gynecologist I wanted to find out if genital warts (HPV) can spread throughout my body and if there is any way that this rash could be caused by the STD I contracted in 2001. Please give me some insight. What could this be?\n\n",

    "title": "Constant urination getting worse cold hands at certain time",
    "content": "PLEASE HELP!    Hi,     I am 29 years old male.  I am not sure where to start and that is part of the problem. My delusional world is starting to clash with reality and it is leaving me in a state of constantly thinking about death, feeling perpetually trapped and fantasizing about suicide but then at the same time \u201cknowing I would never do it\u201d   I have had sex with around 25 girls in my life and I never wore a condom. A few of them anal. I have actively worked out throughout my life. Between the age of 15 \u2013 28  I drank alcohol  assively on the weekends and some weekdays. As an example, I used to go to raves when I was 17 buy huge bottles of ephedrine, pour them into a cooler of everclear which is pure grain alcohol and drink it until it was finished. Beyond exsevly.  I smoked weed for years then quit., I took shrooms around 50 times, cocaine every weekend for a few years and I have gone summers where I did not sleep from Friday till Monday pushing my body to the brink of destruction. At 24 I started taking MDMA. When I discovered this I took it non stop every weekend for a couple of years straight. This was usually on top of cocaine, tons of hard ketamine, GHB on many occasions .  This was always on top of the drinking I was able to get good jobs with my IT skillset but I never held them down. Finnaly after my second DWI I discovered adderal and at first I took it for fun then I saw how I was on it and I got prescribed it. I then read a great book called \u201c the easy way to quit drinking\u201d and did just that.  A few years back I started taking proecia for hair loss and using roggain with it. A year ago I got prescribed 60mg daily of adderal XR.    Now this all may sound unreal but it is true. On top of all this I have never had a blood test and I get the adderal from one DR and the propecia from another. They have no idea about my history. Nobody really knows besides my sister, and she only knows half of it.  I am freaked out of my mind to the point were I cant move when I think about going to the doctor for a blood test and waiting for the results. I always thought that the urination thing would go away over time but it got worse and worse.  I often get sharp chest pains and I take pre work out supplements before the gym with upwards of 500mg of cafffeen. I quit drinking a year ago and smoking and drugs (minus adderal, caffeine, propecia, Rogaine) The thought of being bald makes me rather die then stop taking this *****, the thought of getting off adderal and going back to my old messy disorganized self makes me want to hide, the thought of finding out whats wrong with me an dealing with it , well.. it is impossible and writing this is the most I ever even admitted to myself.     I constantly look for signs from people to justify how I feel. If someone says to me \u201cyou have nice skin\u201d I automatically take that in and feel good for a few weeks by saying to myself \u201cWell I can\u2019t have nice skin and be dying of some disease\u201d  But the fact remains that I have to pee more and more like 20 times a day and all I keep thinking is that my kidneys are done and so am i. If that is the case I think id rather just die then know and suffer the rest of my life. I will go and die in the woods before I let my family suffer with me. They sufferd enough just dealing with my ***** over the years.  Oh and like 6 years ago this one girl told me that I gave her something but I thought she was lining and I never got it checked. I just pushed it away in my brain.   If you can help , I will owe you my life. If you can\u2019t at least you heard a story that you probably never heard before.\n\n",

    "content": "I have had enlarged lymph nodes in my groin and neck for about two months now. I have a lymph nodes that are easily felt under my jaw one on eachside and three or four on both sides of my neck towards the lower portion of the neck closer to my traps. I can also feel one on each side right by my collar bone. I also have enlarged lymph nodes in my groin 3 on both sides. Im not quite sure about my armpits if i push/digin far enough with m hands i am able to feel something in my armpits, but they are not easily felt like the ones in neck and groin. My concern is if they are due to hiv. My last sexual encounter was 4 months ago, unprotected vaginal sex with a woman. I have tested for hiv numerous times in these 4 months. I tested week 4,6,8,9,11,12,13,16,17 all negative. My groin lymph nodes came on around week 6/7 i had started using aldara around that time for my genital warts, sometimes i left the aldara on for too long. At the time i was using aldara the warts were frozen off so there were some open wounds. My neck lymphnodes came on around week 9/10. i did have a wart on my lip that was frozen off. About week 9 i noticed a wart growing on my tonsil it looked just like what was on my lip. It grew farily large but has since shrunk alittle. Im not sure if that is what could be causing my lymph nodes. Are my lymph nodes worriesome for HIV? Should i keep testing eventhough ive tested out of te 3 month window period?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I'm a 31 year old male. I have had a suspicious intercourse with a woman whom i did not know very well. Because i'm an idiot i didnt get protected so i decided to have tested for common STDs. It turned out that i'm HPV positive by DNA PCR test. I requested type identifying test as well but i don't have the result yet. No warts on my genital area showed up yet.  I'm too much worried about to spread this virus to other people. I've done tons of searching on the internet and talked to a doctor and the biologist who did the PCR test but i am not still clear with the followings:  1) How much is it possible to transmit the virus with other than genital contact if i don't ever have the warts?  2) How much is it possible to transmit the virus via genital contact if i don't ever have the warts? 3) If my immune systems overcomes the infection, will i still be a carier at all times? Meaning is it possible to pass it on to the other people while i have the virus in my cells dormant but not active? Assuming either there has never been warts or existing ones has been treated.  I'll be thankful if you can answer all of my questions.  Regards\n\n",

    "title": "Re: HPV, Immune System and Transmition",
    "content": "Hello,Seroreactivity to HPV could indicate active disease or an earlier exposure to any type of the virus earlier but generally indicative of infection is the detection of HPV DNA.Usual method of transmission is sexual,not necessarily only vaginal,and it can get transmitted by non penetrative sexual activity,which is an uncommon mode of transmission.It is believed to be communicable most during active disease,and persisting infection.Since we can not culture the organism communicablity becomes a difficult question to answer.Also getting one type of virus does not protect you from aquiring other types either.Condoms do reduce transmission but do not totally prevent.Refraining any genital contact with partner is the only sure way to protect against transmission of genital HPV infection.Mucosal HPV infections can be trasmitted despite not showing clinical disease, by oral,genital,nasal and other mucosa.However most genial HPV infections with out clinical disease are transient and have no clinical consequence yet show a positive test.In case of genital warts actual infectivity after treatment is unknown.There is a gradual improvement in immunity and there is a virus DNA clearance after a period of time ,the frequency of it being unclear.Hope this answers some of your questions.Do get clarified on all these issues from your physician.Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Yeast Infections when you have herpes?",
    "content": "Hi, I was diagnosed with herpes a few years ago and have had maybe 2 or 3 outbreaks since my initial one. Recently I have been having symptons that are similar to those I got during an outbreak but they are not the same. I have a slightly sore and swollen vulva that itches like crazy, which is normal for my outbreaks. However, I now have a yellowy discharge that has a somewhat thick cottage cheese texture to it but little smell. It is also not coming out much, but clinging to the inner walls. I am wondering if common infections like yeast are affected by the presence of an std or if this is something completely different than both.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,Monilial vaginitis is an independant infection and herpes does not predispose to it.It is classified as a non STD and may be related to the change in the normal flora of the vagina.Antibiotica can destroy some organisms and predispose to moniliasis.This is also more common in diabetics.In contrast with bacterial vaginosis it does not smell bad and has cotton cheese discharge which is rather stuck to the vaginal walls.This can cause burning especially after sexual intercourse.Responds to antifungal treatments it is nothing to worry about.Do get examined to confirm the diagnosis,which is very simple to demostrate the yeast in the discharge.Best wishes.\n\n",

I thought nothing of it and put it at the back of my mind thinking it will go away, however it has now been a good few months and now I have developed a couple more red lumps and the skin in around the lumpy area has gone really dry and flakey. I do not and have never clean shaved my pubic hairs (i just trim it).  Does this sound like a STD? Or an infection of some kind? Why has this happened? What can I do to help myself?

    "content": "Hi, my boyfriend and I have been together almost a year and. Occasionally after we've had sex--especially after a prolonged session-- he will wake up the next day with folliculitis (it was diagnosed as this the first time by a doctor) and a bump or two will increase to several over the next few days and take about two weeks to disappear. We were both tested for STD's and he came up with none, but it turns out I have HPV, which I am pretty sure came from him since I have paps every year and none have been abnormal before.  My question is-- is the HPV causing his folliculitis? I also seem to have yeast infections and urinary tract infections at times-- is the yeast infection causing follicullitis?  Is there a way we can prevent this happening so that we don't have the nervousness hanging over our heads every time we have sex?  Is there a specialist we need to see?\n\n",

Before we decided to engage in oral sex she had told me that she had been tested one month prior and assured me that things will be safe (she did not mentioned what she was tested for). After the episode and a month passed I started to feel really anxious and I did go to a clinic to get examined and I learned that I had a small cyst at the shaft of my genital. The ANP had advised me that there was no signs of herpes and I do not need to get tested.   After two months passed I my genital were itching and felt discomfort, two large bumps roughly around 3-4 millimeters formed. This time I decided to go see a different clinic in the largest hospital in the city. The ANP who saw me told me that they were cyst and she took a blood exam and swabbed the tip of my penis. I asked her is I should get a herpes test and she told me to wait because I have not shown signs of it. She said most likely I would not need it.  I still have to follow up with the ANP in a couple of weeks. I am not sure what to do if I should get tested for hereps or not. I want to be responsible to my new partner and guarantee her safety.\n\n",

    "content": "I was recently tested for STDs due to a questionable past partner or two. The last one was 3 weeks ago. HIV was negative. HSV1 anti-bodies were present but my doctor and I had suspected that already and I believe I've had that for years. 1 genital wart or what my doctor believes to be a wart was detected on the shaft of my penis. I really hadn't noticed it before or atleast for very long. It was low near the sack and could have been there for a while. I have had oral sex performed on me and then kissed the woman afterwards. I keep reading where Oral HPV transmission is possible this way. However, I can't seem to find enough details to know if what I have below was transferred to my mouth or, if I possibly received a new strain. I now have small white painless bumps appearing on my top lip. Based on the photos I have seen, this does not resemble Fordyce condition.  And, the few photos of Oral HPV I was able to find look similar. How long does it take for Oral HPV warts to appear. And, I assume they are not filled with liquid, or hurt and can be just white correct? If what I have is confirmed in 2 weeks by the dermatologist, how long will it take for these to go away or will they? And, if they aren't warts, what else can it possibly be? Is a fungus a possibilty or not?  I have a total of 8 bumps. 4-5 of them are clustered together. But tiny and not too noticeable as of yet. I saw only 2 a week a go and now I see more. I'm a smoker and now am worried about the link to Oral Cancer and HPV if that is what I have. What home treatments would you recommend while I wait for my appointment. I can't get in any sooner. Thanks, extremely concerned and worried.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, well i come here basically seeking advice on a problem i have had from around the age of 12, im now almost 20 years old so time clearly isnt the healer for this one, i am still a virgin due to this so it obviously wasnt transmitted through having sex. Well basically, the whole of my genitals is covered in small lumps that look like warts/spots, they seem to contain a white substance which can sometimes be pushes out of them but it does nothing. They are around 1mm in size and cover all of the skin (between 2mm-10mm apart) on on the outside of my penis and around my testicles, they stop covering just at the very tip of my penis.  I am embarrased to consult a doctor about this and i know i shouldnt be as it is what they are there for however i wondered if anyone could give me a brief idea of what i may have, and what will be expected to get rid of these little spots.  Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,There are one or two conditions which may resemble the descriptions given,and both are of no great consequence.Molluscum contagiosum is caused by a virus and can cause small to medium sized pearly nodules on the penile skin and rest of genitalia.It is common in children and could occur elsewhere too.They can be removed by cryo.Much smaller white papules are seen in a condition called lichen nitidus and they generally disappear in time.There are small glands on the rim of the penis head known as pearly penile papules,again can be left alone.Hope you have got over your fears.Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Can you contract Gonorrhea through sharing eye makeup with an infected person?    A couple of my gay friends (men) contracted Gonorrhea in New Orleans over the weekend.  They came over to my house before any of them had been treated and we were all putting makeup on each other.  There was no sexual activity of any kind.  This morning I woke up with my eye feeling a little sore, almost like the vague beginnings of pink eye.  Can I contract this from touching an infected persons eye, then my own...or possibly through using the same eye makeup?  If so, do I need to throw away the makeup I used?\n\n",

    "content": "My name is Dan I am a 22 year old male. I have only had a few sexual partners in my life, and in each case we had only protected intercourse, however over my life I had received unprotected oral sex from more people. I have never been diagnosed with an STD of any kind, nor have I ever had any problems or symptoms to lead me to believe I was infected with any STD.  I recently started dating a woman, we've been dating for about 6 weeks. About 2 weeks ago she had an abnormal pap and was diagnosed with HPV. We have not had intercourse but have had oral sex on several occasions. Her doctor was not very informative about how we should proceed in our relationship in order to keep me safe and infection free.  I have done many hours of research, first of all to find out how it would effect my girlfriend (I was worried about her health) and then how I could keep myself safe and infection free and what it might mean if I was infected. However the information seems confusing, I don't know what we can do. To be more specific what I would like to know is what kind of sexual acts can we perform, and what are the chances either of us was infected orally with hpv from the several times we have had oral sex?   I am extremely confused and upset about this and despite being a college graduate and doing hours of research I feel no better about the situation. I feel like its not fair that she has this, she is a nice girl who is not overly sexually promiscuous and she even had the HPV prevention shots. I deeply care about her and its possible that we may be together a long time but that is unsure and I don't want to infect any future women I may be with. What can I do?\n\n",

    "title": "HSV&HPV related? and how long to cure genital warts?",
    "content": "Dear Doctors,  Hi Doc, around 2 months ago, I was diagnosed that I got herpes (HSV2). I had sex with my bf around 4 months ago. There were some lesions appeared but then the doctor gave me acyclovir and some cream to remove them. Well it worked well. Me and my bf also took a blood test, and the result for both of us is NEGATIVE. As I know, the blood test of 1st or 2nd week from the first outbreak is not accurate and the best timing for another blood test is around 3-4 months after the first out break. Question  #1. Is it true that the blood test result is not accurate??  But as my bf's blood test result is negative,   #2. does it still mean that I'm the only one who infected with HSV2?  #3. Should I take another test?  I'm now really frustrated, coz 1 month ago, I found genital warts (condylomata acuminata) so I went to see the doctor back. Then I tried to remember, and found out that before the place where the warts came up, there was like a cut bcoz of the sexual activity. One question from here : #4. is it possible that my bf gave it to me? since I never seen any warts appear on his genital. I heard about the flat warts or something that make a discolor on the genital. But really, I can't find any of them.  So, the doc said that I'm infected by HPV virus. I did a lot of research on the internet, that the type of this HPV won't cause cervical cancer, but #5. is it still possible that I might be infected with another type of HPV virus that will cause cervical cancer? And to be honest, the warts make me feel so depressed, the doc already put like a solution to burn them off.. 1st time visit, some of them were removed, and 2nd time visit the doc gave me the solution again, but there are still some warts left now, and the old warts that already been removed start to re-appear :( The question are: #6. How long usually the genital warts disappear? #7. Will the warts re-appear after some years? #8. What is the best way to prevent genital warts besides avoiding sexual contact? #9. Will it harms my baby if i planned to get pregnant someday?   I'm sorry there are a lot of questions from me. Hope the questions are clear enough and thanks in advance for your answer.\n\n",

    "title": "Sensitive skin on penis..for several months.",
    "content": "Hello,  Ok..here goes..  I had unprotect oral/anal/straight sex with a woman I have known for four years. It lasted a few weeks. The last time..the sex got rough. Her teeth were pretty rough on me down there and I physically squeezed my penis in one instance. Yes..I know this is funny to some, but I want all the details out so I can get an answer. Now, the next day or so I felt a pinpoint pain underneath my penis just behind the head. I have no doubt this was just a bruise on the inside from my squeeze. At the same time on the right side of my penis just behind the head it became itchy (perhaps from the squeeze as well). This area was about the size of a penny or smaller. Tthee were no visible signs of anything, but this lasted several weeks. It eventually subsided..but was very itchy. On the left side of my penis around the same time, I felt a similar sensation about middle way, but a smaller area. At that location was a small skin colored bump that looked exactly like one that I have had for years. Now keep in mind that I am a big worrier. Over the next several weeks and months I have worried, itched, poked, and prodded my penis. I have taken baths in Aloe Vera, salt, and bath oils trying to ease whatever was going on. I have applied hydrogen peroxide, alcohol (BIG MISTAKE), Vitaman E, !00% Aloe Vera, Desitin, Sarna, and maybe a few more things. I have also just tried leaving things alone. At present, I have no bumps, rashes, or anything visible, but my penis has very sensitive skin. Have I seen a Doctor you ask? Welll... I went to a GP about the small bump and he said it was nothing more than a little cyst for lack of a better name and nothing to worry about. I went and had a full physical and ask another doctor to look at the bujmp. He said it was nothing. I pointed out the sensitive skin and he waved my hand off as if it were nothing. Still not satisfied (the worrier in me)... I went to another doctor asking for STD tests. I explained everything as I have here and he really chewed me out for worrying so much and told me to get on with my life. He looked at the itchy area and told me I had nothing. Relunctantly, at my request he ordered an HIV test (6 months after the sex) and it came back negative.  So...my concern... I am still very sensitive down there and it seems to be expanding. I have been good about leaving things alone..despite an occassion application of 100% Aloe Vera gel. The itching seems to occur if I sweat. A simple cleansing the shower takes care of that it seems, but the sensitivity remains. One other thing of note...is that since this started, I have felt an occassional pinpoint pain (like a pin sticking in me) around the anal area. Once again..keep in mind that I am a worrier and what got me started worrying about HPV initially was when this female sex partner of mine told me that a friend hers had genital warts. My friend does have a habit of saying things at the wrong time and occassion so I don't think she was trying to \"clue\" me in that she had something..but like I said..I worry. By the way, my friend is a professional woman and has regular check-ups and she is by know means dumb and is in fact quite smart with two daughters so I don't think she would put herself at risk. Obviously, she felt comfortable with me regarding unprotected sex and that is ok because at least prior to her I was ok.  Ok..so summary... Why is the skin on my penis sensitive after nearly 7 months? I have no visible signs of anything. Is it my worry? Is it my application of all the chemicals? I think the alcohol was the worst. Is it possible I have a strain of HPV? If so, would my penis skin be sensitive all this time?  What is going on?  I know it is tempting for some to post some funny remarks to this, but please give me a break and let the doc's respond.  Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Any time there is the possibility of an STD I recommend the person be tested.  Local health clinics can often provide complete and anonymous testing if desired.  There is a small possibility that the sensitive skin is due to some mild nerve damage that may have occurred during the trauma.  Nerves take a long time to heal (easily a year) so it is still possible that this area is healing.  Pain from nerve issues is often described as tingling or burning.  It can be intensified while the nerve heals.  I would recommend you be tested for STD's although this does not sound like an STD and continue to follow up with your doctor.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I think your \"nerve damage\" explanation may be the most likely cause.   Gentlemen....if you feel manly...don't get to rough with it...or you will definitely pay the price. Be safe at all times.

    "title": "Having trouble classifying STD/STI",
    "content": "Hey everyone! Within the past week I've had unusual behavior in my genital region. It first began with an inflamed area right at the tip of my penis, which caused pain and discomfort when ever I walked and my shorts would rub against it.  As the week progressed I began to feel pain right as I began a urine stream, but the burning/stinging feel went away after the initial second. Occasionally I feel a pain in urethra from the base of my penis to around the prostate. It will last for my 5 seconds on an off for a total of a minute. But this isnt continuous through out the day. Now, recently (the past couple days) I have have a white thick substance exiting my urethra. It has a very similar appearance to semen, however it has not much of an odor. Im guessing its pus building up and making its way out of the body, since it is a very milky white substance. My lymph nodes seem to be at normal size, but then again I don't check it regularly. There really is no burning or itching down there. The only part that has pain is on the tip of my penis and that occasional pain I mentioned. I havent really noticed any lesions or ulcer like openings, but there is one small bump that looks like a very small looks like dried up popped zit. Its too hard to tell though since it is so small.  Its unfortunate that the more serious seeming problems started occurring after business hours last friday. Since all my STD testing clinics and my family doctor are all closed for the rest of the week end, including today, I will have to wait until tomorrow to try and get checked.  After doing a whole bunch of symptom tests online, Gonorrhea, chlamydia, and hsv all regularly come up as possibilities. I don't care how bad it will hurt, or how serious it will be. I just want it to be curable so I don't have to spread it to anyone. So I'm crossing my fingers for maybe a bacterial infection.  Also, my dads side of the family has prostate issues, and I also work at a garden center, and dirt gets inside my pants all the time. But up inside me seems a bit extreme.  Thank you for reading, and I really appreciate any advice or opinions offered! What are your thoughts?\n\n",

Given that the thrush medicine didn't help I would recommend you see a doctor for an evaluation.  You may need a mild steroid cream to help clear it up.  Using steroids on the genitals can be a bit dangerous and I would not recommend using any over-the-counter creams (like hydrocortisone) until you get a direct examination.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I had unprotected sex with my gf yesterday, about 3 times that night. My penis gradually started hurting and the 3rd time was quite unpleasant (first time I had unprotected sex). A few hours later, maybe 5 or so, I noticed these red spots on my foreskin and something that looked like rashes on the head of the penis. I'm not having problems with urinating, it doesn't hurt when I do. My penis also doesn't really itch. I'm quite worried though because I don't know what it could be. Could it be balanitis or herpes or another STD? Or just some irritation from the sweat and body fluids? Thanks in advance!\n\n",

    "content": "I am 19 years old and recently was diagnosed with herpes. I'm still waiting on the tests to see whether it's type 1 or 2. I have a feeling I've had it for a while, as I think I had an outbreak in December but didn't realize what it was.  I have been having a monogamous relationship with my boyfriend since April. We've had frequent sex and always used a condom. Last week, during a particularly vigorous session, I started to feel mild discomfort around my hymen and labia minora (as best as I can describe it. Basically, the walls before my vaginal opening). I figured it was just some friction and allowed him to continue. The next day, we had sex again (with a condom), but the discomfort was still there. The following day, I looked down there with a mirror and saw two sores.  After a check up, they confirmed it was herpes.  I was just wondering how likely is it that my boyfriend has herpes, assuming I'm the one passing it on to him?  Before we would officially begin, he would manually stimulate me and then put on the condom himself. Is there any way that when figuring out which way it unrolled, he inadvertently put some of my vaginal excretions onto the inside of the condom before putting it on?  Assuming he gave it to me, is it likely that he went without symptoms for an extended period of time? He claims he's never had an outbreak. I've heard symptoms can be very mild for both males and females. Is there any way of telling who gave it to who?  Considering he's never had an outbreak with visible lesions/rashes/etc., would a blood test show him coming up negative for herpes?  Is it still safe to have sex with a condom if I have herpes and he doesn't? Are there any percentages of the likelihood of spreading it? Hard facts would be most preferred.  Any and all extra information you could throw at me would be most appreciated. Thank you so much!!\n\n",

HSV-1 (commonly oral herpes) can be transmitted from mouth to genitals as well, though it is not as common there.  Transmission can occur from an infected partner who does not have a visible sore and may not know that he or she is infected but it is from person to person through close contact of some sort.    The disease can be dormant for a time without an outbreak.  If the lesions are present on the genitals at the time of delivery, the doctor may encourage a c-section.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Ok, I messed up, I know I did. I was caught up in the moment, and I had unprotected anal intercourse with my girlfriend.  Now, I am very worried. I know it was a stupid thing to do, but I have a few questions.  First off, is HIV something that can only be contracted from somebody else who has the disease or is it something that can be created by two non-carriers? I was a virgin, so I'm sure I don't have it, and I'm fairly sure she doesn't either, what are the chances that either of us contracted it?  Also, just moments ago (the intercourse occurred Saturday night), I noticed two small red bumps in my genital area. One was located mid-shaft, the other on the scrotum. They don't hurt or itch particularly, but I am very worried about my stupid mistake the other night. What could i possible have? I have had small white bumps before (months, even years ago), but they went away, I assume it was something unimportant.   Recently, I have noticed my genital areas itching more as well. It is not to a horrendous point, however. I have always been itchy, as I am a hairy person who attempts to control with persistent shaving. This may just be awareness induced by paranoia, but I suppose it is mentionable nonetheless.  Please, any and all input would be fantastic, I really need to know.  Thank you for your help in advance.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Let me reassure you that if neither of you is positive for HIV, you cannot create it on your own.  Itching can be caused by a number of things, as you said, such as shaving, yeast infection (Jock itch), etc.  The anal sex itself is most risky for infection since you could get some ecoli (normal bacteria in the colon which can cause urinary infection). If you move from anal sex to vaginal sex, there is a possibility of spreading infection to her as well, so condoms should be changed at that point.  Your partner is actually the one to have the most potential harm through this type of sex since the tissues are quite delicate and can be torn, especially if there was inadequate lubrication or you were rough or too fast.  You can transmit HIV this way if either of you is positive.  Sexually active young people should be tested periodically for sexually transmitted infections.  Usually tests can detect infection within six months of exposure.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Just to emphasize what Debbie said, you 100% cannot create HIV if both of you are negative. Simply impossible.   Now then, onto business. The best thing for you to do is get tested a few months after the sexual encounter with her. That's the only way to know for sure, and trust me, it will be a huge relief once you know. A simple blood test at an annual doctor check up is really all it takes, and even if I haven't been sexually active, I get tested for things like HIV just to be reassured. Just ask for the doctor to check for it (blood test) and that's all there is to it. I would suggest getting tested 3 months from when you posted this, then again at 6 months just to be safe (actually, it's a smart idea to be tested every six months just to be safe). There is always a risk of you contracting the virus, even if you use a condom (just as there are risks of pregnancy and plenty other things) so the best thing to do is make sure both you and your partner are tested.   The bumps you found on your genitals could, like Debbie said, be MC or another type of STD. However, (and men seem to do this often... We're such worriers deep down) it could quite possibly be nothing. Bumps and marks can appear on the genitals just as they can appear anywhere else on the body, so don't be too alarmed just yet. It could be simply psychosomatic, meaning you were anxious and nervous about the situation with your partner, so in your anxiety, you caused some stress related marks to appear down there. I would give it a few days, maybe a little more than a week, and if the condition is still there, see a doctor, and it can be easily treated. In the mean time, don't have sex.   Let us know how things turn out.  X\n\n",

    "content": "I have been tested for HIV, twice on my own request and once due to a life insurance policy over the last 5 years. All three test came back negative. I show no signs/symptoms of an infection (started abstaining from sexual intercourse 7 years ago until present, while my last incident of oral sex was more than a year ago - administered by both parties). Since then my life has changed for the better and I am not involved in any sexual activities anymore, not until I get married.  My question: Are there any STD's/infections that can be dormant in your system without you knowing it, without any symptoms, that can resurface at a later stage? If so, which ones and what tests are needed? I would like to have all the relevant tests done as soon as possible in order to rule out any possible chances of having an infection coming back to haunt me at a later stage - I want to take other people into consideration. I don't have any reason to worry, but would like to make 100% that I can go into a marriage 100% infection free and clean.  Your advise and expertise would be much appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, With this time frame and history of negative testing, you can be quite confident.  Most \"windows\" where the infection is incubating are up to six months.  You haven't mentioned if you have ever had an outbreak of herpes.  This is one infection that can remain dormant in your body but typically there is an initial outbreak so you probably know if you had it.  You have taken a wise course in abstaining while making certain you are clear of disease before a long-term commitment.    You should be sure you are also having annual pelvic exams to be sure you don't develop HPV infection, which can result in genital warts as well as cervical cancer.  Responsible sexual behavior as you have exhibited these past seven years will definitely improve your odds for a good foundation in marriage.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Oops, sorry, why did I think you were female???  Careless in not checking your history.  You gave me a good laugh as I'm sure I gave you.  Men do not get HPV testing even though they can get genital warts if they are exposed to HPV from their partner.    The cyst you had is probably not a sign of herpes.  Male herpes symptoms usually begin with an itching or tingling sensation in the genital location. Following this first warning sign, the area may become swollen with red bumps on the penis, or surrounding area. These turn to blisters, and then open sores. The healing process begins once these open sores begin to scab over.  Other less identifiable symptoms can be burning during urination, swollen lymph nodes in the groin area, constipation, lack of energy, fever and headache.   Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Herpes of Early HIV symptoms?",
    "content": "Hello.  I had unprotected sex almost 8 months ago.  Three days after having sex, i noticed an unusual discomfort in the penile area, followed by frequent need to urinate (usually very little amounts).  The discomfort was an unexplainable sensation on the left side of my penis (towards the tip) and had somewhat of a dull pain, nothing severe as far as pain goes.  The feeling went away after about a month but then there was an unexplainable red bump immediately left of my penis opening.  It started off as a small red bump (1-2 mm) with no opening. It remained as such for a little while (another month) before i started to mess around with it.  It didnt look like a typical blister or a herpes blister, but when I put some pressure on it, clear fluid gushed out.  After the clear fluid, a very small amount of blood followed before the bump scabbed over.  Its been about 5 months since the initial gush out and scabbing, but the sore is still visible on the exact same spot.  It never went away and its still remains the exact same size and shape (like doughnut), and still has clear fluid coming out (albeit very little amounts/no gushing--more like a pin droplet just at the opening with no blood).  From time to time, i notice the same sensation in the same penile area as i had talked about earlier.  Other symptoms I'm noticing NOW (starting about the 7 month point) is the fact that I feel extremely tired during the days, and a mild feverish fatigue like symptom in evenings (starts usually around 5 pm).  It feels like a fever, but my temperature is normal.  I now have a persistent mild sore throat, and an uncharacteristically white coated tongue (striated and quite visible towards the back of my tongue). Three weeks ago, I had a slight fever with chills and cold sweats before going to bed (I woke up drenched in sweat). No swollen lymph nodes. Two weeks ago, my right index finger started to itch and without noticing anything i started to scratch at it while watching TV.  I came to realize that what started as just  red itchy eczema like symptom quickly turned into a grouping of tiny fluid filled blisters.  It popped and then its seemed to heal very quickly without any further issues.  This week I started to have mild diarhea (past 5 days)  Can anyone please provide some insight on this matter?  Could it be primary HIV infection symptoms? Do you always have swollen lymph nodes if you're infected with HIV? Does the sore I described sound like HSV-2?  Thank you so very much for your time and help. God Bless.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there --  The only way to know if your boyfriend has an STD or not is for him to be tested. The fact that he had complained of a discharge makes it somewhat  suspicious, so this would only make sense. The bleeding is another thing though, and usually is due to breakage of small capillaries in the ureter near the tip. This could be due to an infection or just simple mild trauma or mischance. Again, the only way to be sure what's going on is a medical exam and tests for common STDs. I would encourage him to do this, and to do it soon, since these things often can become latent without having resolved.   I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you both.\n\n",

You could have a condition called molloscum contagiosum, or it could be something like clogged, infected glands or follicles.  Of course there is also herpes but people usually complain of pain with this.  If it is the MC, it can continue to spread and is contagious to other so sexual contact should be avoided.

    "content": "Hi am a 24 year old guy from cyprus and i have been diagnozed with perianal warts.My first question is since am not gay how could i possibly catch this disease? My doctor(general surgeon) put me to laser surgery because i negleted to go and the warts where too many. After the surgery they started to reappear on the second week. My doctor told me on my weekly visit that i should come whenever i see even one wart popping up and he will burn it and eventually when 6 weeks have passed and no warts appear i wiil be cured. And almost every day i go and he burns me. Its been more than 2months after my surgery and i see no improvement in the matter. My question is : Is this treament correct? secondly since my operation i am having difficulties into going to the toilet on time and sometimes(part me for the expression) i crapp my pants and i don't even realize it. I feel something is wrong with this treatment and  my body. I am planning to ask a second opinion by tomorrow by i don't know where to go since there isnt  a proctologist in the country ; so what doctor should i go to?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, These warts are usually caused by the HPV virus and are spread through sexual contact; not merely homosexual.  In fact in most cases it is spread heterosexually and the warts can appear on any part of the genital area.    It is possible if the burning has been done all around the anal sphincter that the muscle can be affected that controls the bowel movements as well as allowing stretching for the stool to pass.    In most patients, the warts will disappear on their own within about a year so you do not have to have them removed if you don't want to.  There are also self-applied medications that are effective in the treatment (Aldara or imiquimod).  Any doctor could prescribe this, though I understand it may be costly.  It is as effective as surgical removal.    Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, This is the advice of the CDC:  \"Persons with chlamydia should abstain from sexual intercourse until they and their sex partners have completed treatment, otherwise re-infection is possible.\"  This means that until the antibiotics are completed, there is still risk of infection that you pass back and forth between you.  Repeated infections in the woman also increases her risk of damage to the reproductive organs.  You should consult your doctor who may choose to treat you again.    Best wishes.\n\n",

If he did not have a sore to secrete infection and your immune system has been strong enough to fight infection, it is possible to dodge the bullet.  It sounds like you have been fortunate.  But, in an ongoing relationship, it is still possible for you to test positive if he has just recently been diagnosed.  Some people don't show symptoms until 90 days after exposure, though it is more typically 21 days.  If he is treated and you remain negative, count yourself very lucky.    Best wishes.\n\n",

If he has not gotten the virus, continuing to have sex will increase the chances of it.  If he has been infected, there are many varieties of HPV and it is possible to get one of the others in addition.  So, the safest course would be to wait.  Proper use of condoms may also lower the risk of transmission should you decide to have sex.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Chlamydia diagnoses - timings and implications?",
    "content": "I have been having post coital bleeding, painful intercourse, and increased discharge since the summer of 2007. I went for pap smears and internal exams, and the doctors all said I had cervical erosion which was causing the symptoms, and that I should get cauterization done to cure it. However, a friend who is a GP said that my symptoms sound like chlamydia, and that I should get tested. I was an 18 year old virgin when I got married, and my husband was 27. He had dated people. but he told me he was also a virgin for religious reasons.   So you can imagine my surprise when the test came back positive. IF we only ever slept with each other, where did it come from?  After two days of arguing, he finally admitted that he had slept with a few girlfriends before marriage, this would have been over 8 years ago. So he says that he has had it since then, and thus I must have gotten it around the same time. I am skeptical because I had two pregnancies and it never came up (although apparently that's not a routine test - I had my pregnancies in Pakistan, where they do not screen for it), plus, the symptoms distinctly showed up in 2007.   We were - not seperated - but having a rough patch in May 2007, during which he was in London for a month, and repeatedly told me things were over. I asked him what happened at that time, and he admits that he was seeing someone, but said that he realized he couldn't have a physical relationship while married, and told her he was coming back to me to either get back together or finish things.   We are going to counselling and he is swearing that the physical relationships he had were before we married.   Is it possible that we have had chlamydia for all that time, and the symptoms only showed up later, after 7 years, in me? Or am I right in thinking he had an affair in May of 2007, which is why I had the symptoms in the summer of 2007?   I want very much to beleive that it is from before marriage, but I don't want to be stupid also. Does anyone know of reliable sources that say that yes, you can be asymptomatic for years and then the symptoms crop up after 7 years? Or is there absolute proof that it is only possible that I got it in 2007?   The answer has serious implicaitons for our marrige - ie did he cheat or is it from before - and I would like to know what the medical evidence points towards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The problem is that women do not always have symptoms.  This would mean it is possible for you to have had it for a while and since you have not been tested, you would have no way of knowing.  Up to 85% of women and 40% of men may be undiagnosed because they do not have symptoms.  Given the scenario you describe, we would have to assume you were both asymptomatic for quite a while, even if the infection occurred in 2007.  But, untreated infection can attack other pelvic organs such as fallopian tubes and cervix.  Since you do have cervical problems, it could have been that the infection was actually present for a while.    To complicate things, false positive testing is also a possibility, if only slight.  Assigning blame can be difficult so I'm afraid I can't help you much on this one.  Since this is complicated, I will refer this to other team members as well in case someone else has more information.  Good luck in dealing with your relationship.  These events complicate life and erode at trust but can be overcome if you both have the desire and are willing to commit to working it out.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Thus, had I gotten it when first married, we both would have symptoms from that point (ie 8 years ago) - or would not have developed them at all, and it would probably have been discovered due to infertility problems.   If we were symptomatic, we/I would get the symptoms within about a month of contracting the disease - they would not be dormant for the first 7 years, and then start appearing after 7 years of being asymptomatic. As my symptoms started in the summer of 2007, that would point to having contracted it at that time.  I would be interested to hear what your colleagues think about her diagnosis?

    "content": "Chlamydia is known as a \"silent\" disease because about three quarters of infected women and about half of infected men have no symptoms,  it can cause silent damage to the genital organs in both sexes. If symptoms do occur, they usually appear within 1 to 3 weeks after exposure.  Though it may remain undiagnosed, but easily treated by a dose of antibiotics(preferably Azithromycin or Doxycycline to both partners). After treatment and abstinence for a duration of 1 month, we may retest to confirm complete cure. After cure it comes again, it is reinfection. Chlamydia causes more damage in those women who had intercourse at young age, below 25 years of age.  My advice is to get complete treatment , and take preventive measures for reinfection. Be proactive.  You must go for marriage counseling, and try your best to save it, but only if your husband is also willing to do that.\n\n",

    "content": "TC,  I'm sorry to hear about your chronic pain on many levels regarding these issues.  First tests can be false positives, so you may want to re-test for Chlamydia.   Normally, with women, this disease does not present itself until the infection has spread thoughout various parts of your reproductive system.  This is called pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).  Since it appears that you have had symptoms for some time now, you may want to see your OB/GYN to determine if PID has occured.  Another possibility is that you have what is called vaginitis, which is common with women, and is not a sexually transmitted disease.  The symptoms with both vaginitis and chlamydia are often similiar, and caused by a bacterial infection that can be cured with the right antibiotics prescribed for you to take.  Your OB/GYN doctor may be worth seeing again to diagnose you more accurately.  Both diseases involve often different bacteria.  So if your doctor does a culture from fluid in the area of concern, this will identify the bacteria causing the infection.  Afterwards, an antibiotic can be better selected to rid you of what likely is an infection.  Good luck,  Dan\n\n",

I've been having sex with no problem unprotected as well and when down on each other and nothing bad.  This comes and goes with me as well and I have no idea what it is, my partner doesn't seem to have discomfort or anything when oral sex and intercourse takes place.  It only gets me nerved wrecked because my partner is clean.  I begin to get anxious and paranoid and begin to think it's a possible STD but I don't feel the itchiness only rarely.  I when I see it I either put vaseline or lube on my penis to keep my penis moist.  It's it an STD or is it a fungus?  If so, what can I do to get rid of it?  I know see a doctor, but if you guys that has had this issue happen to you, what did you guys do?  It's really bothering me.\n\n",

    "content": "I chose this topic as I received unprotected oral sex about 10 days ago and sex after with a condom used correctly. No kissing was involved. I have had buring in the tip of the penis, no discharge, a urine drip and urge or feeling like I should urninate since then. Had one white bubble/pimple form in my mouth bottom inside under tongue but not on it. it burst by itself with clear liquid and then grew back again in the same spot and now seems to stay a burst sore. I have mild blood shot eyes. I have a sore throat and sneezed yesterday. I had tingling in the penis and up in the area to the right of the groin. Took anti-biotics for 7 days and still the same symptoms. Buring in anus. While I had the oral sex I had scabby skin on the penis from fungus infection. No major lesions or open wounds however. I did not ejaculate from this. No bites or blood on the penis as far as I can tell. 33 year old male. For the last several months I have had pain in right chest, to the right of the middle of the chest, no cough, yellow pleghm at many times, mild runny nose, congestion in the morning, temple forehead headaches off and on, severe jock itch, fungus on the penis, back fungus/pimples, neck rash, chest rash, lose of a little chest hair on right side, red rash under the nose and mouth, (spread by shaving?), 1 warts on finger, a red pimple that burst with white stuff on leg and never really healed and now is a black spot and yellow around it, irregualar borders on the half-moons in my nails, sensitive nails sore days after cutting, hangnails, a reaccuring cold, no fever, diareahia, blood clots in the mucus of the nose (was at high alt for 1 week) and mild pasty white tongue that went away with brushing after using the anti-biotics in particular. no white in the mouth or side or under tongue. I just had HIV test neg 3 and 4 months after unprotected intercourse with a women with a scabed penis from masturbation. It is now the 5th month. neg for stds until recent encounter last week too. I have had poor diet, tons of stress and worry about this for weeks on end and live in a foreign country. Cold/flu like symptoms came on 2 months ago and never really left completly including massive stress. Some of the fungus I had before the encounter for years (thought it was acne) as well as the wart. Could I have HIV from 5 months ago now or just recently aquired it last week or is it stress or something other STD?? please help!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, You have a variety of symptoms throughout your body and there is no way without an exam that a diagnosis could be made.  It seems unlikely, given the recent sexual encounter, that you could have contracted HIV, though it can take a while for it to show up so you should continue to be tested at six months post-exposure, just to be sure.   Transmission is through exchange of body fluids and not typically saliva so chances are not as great for a male to be infected from receiving oral sex as in other methods where deep body fluids are exchanged such as through ejaculate, vaginal secretions, blood, etc.    I think you have enough varied symptoms that may or may not be related that you would be well advised to have a complete physical exam with routine blood work for all sexually transmitted infections, etc.    Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, We cannot say if the vaccine would have definitely prevented the warts because there are about 30 strains of HPV and the vaccine covers the four that are the most dangerous.  It would depend on whether or not your strain is one that was included in the vaccine.  While getting the vaccine now would not help your current infection, it is possible it could guard against future ones.  There is still much we don't know about this and we will learn as time goes on with more and more women receiving the vaccine.  There is some indication protection from this vaccine may even go beyond the four strains it was designed for. You should discuss the options with your provider.   Best wishes.\n\n",

It feels like it just keeps on leaking after I ejaculate and if i squeeze my legs together it will ooze out its like my prostate isnt expelling all of it or something I don't know whats going on I've seen multiple urologists been on multiple antibiotics over the course of 3 years. Is this just somethign I have to live with?  What happens is I ejaculate. Some will come out once i go limp Then after i urinate sometimes some will come out with it or at the end.  This seems to be only directly assocaited with ejaculation.  Also it seems that when i cum or pee without enough pressure it comes out in 2 streams top and bottom of my urethra like 2 droplets one at the top one  at the bottom.\n\n",

    "content": "Yeah, let me clarify a few things first.  This all began after having Unprotected oral sex and protected vaginal sex with a female.  About 3 -4 weeks later i experienced a clear discharge after urinating it burned as it came out. This went on and happend for a few months I had first seen a doctor got a clamydia/gonnorhea swab both negative the doctor said it was \"normal\" i think he didnt understand me and thought i was confusing precum with some sort of disease. This continued for several months almost a year until i saw another doctor who gave me antibiotics 100mg doxy 2x a day for 14 days   A few days into taking the doxy i developed the clear discharge after ejaculation but the clear discharge after urinating disapeared. I do experience some burning in the morning at urinating etc.  I've gone thru it all cystoscopy 2 years ago, a cystoscopy a month ago, no abnormalities.  Saw a urologist in boston and im about to make a second appointment, He did a slide of my prostate secretions and only found 1 wbc per mag field.  I have no clue whats going on I just want it fixed this is so annoying especially since I know where I aquired it Just nobody can identify it.  Also sometimes i will get a sharp pain in where I would think my prostate is located.  Like a needle then a \"falling\" feelling inside it.   2 Urologists said \"non-bacterial\" prostatitis but neither of these urologists did any sort of test just said my prostate was inflamed  and said i had an obsessive with stds when I would bring up the fact that 3 years ago is when this all started.   The urologist I Saw last said the 1 wbc per prostate secretion makes him think i probably don't have prostatitis, Im going to call him tommorow though and make a second appointment I just had finished my 14 days of erythromycin the day before thanksgiving It slightly relaxed my symptoms but i still experienced the discharge also occationally i do get a sticky clear discharge after urinating mixed in with my urine like \"gel\".    Any more suggestions?   From what I've read Im pretty sure the bacterial infection lasted such a long time that it advanced into my prostate and i possibly need an extended course of antibiotics or something.   Also I'd like to find out what the causative agent of all this is if possible which I know can't be done over the internet but maybe a suggestion to give to the urologist.\n\n",

    "title": "? NSU ?? PROSTATITIS",
    "content": "It would appear, from the history of your complaints and the list of drugs prescribed for you, that you were treated for non-specific urethritis (NSU) and an attempt was made to treat you for bacterial prostatitis.  You have not indicated if a urethral smear, after holding urine overnight, was examined for leucocyte count. This would have been helpful in relation to the findings of posterior urethritis obtained by cystoscopy.  You have also not indicated if you have abstained from unprotected sexual exposure since your various courses of treatment. If not, you may be acquiring \u201cnew\u201d infections.  One of the complications of untreated or unresolved NSU is acute bacterial prostatitis. A few patients with acute bacterial prostatitis experience the complication of chronic bacterial prostatitis (CBP). CBP is an important cause of bacterial persistence in the male lower urinary tract. In fact, the most common cause of relapsing urethritis in men is the persistence of small numbers of bacteria in the prostate gland. The diagnosis based on the number of white cells in expressed prostatic secretion (EPS) or semen is inadequate.  Effective therapy for bacterial prostatitis is achieved with drugs that penetrate prostatic tissue adequately and are effective against most of the common bacterial pathogens. Many drugs penetrate prostatic tissue poorly, but the quinolones and trimethoprim achieve adequate levels and are currently the drugs of choice. Treatment for bacterial prostatitis must be for at least 28 days.   Concerning the recent finding of posterior urethritis and the prescription of Flagyl, I  would have preferred  a combination therapy of an appropriate antibiotic for NSU with Flagyl, rather than the latter drug alone. After completing the course of Flagyl, I would advise that you undergo the urethral smear test for leucocyte count, with urine held overnight. It will also be a good idea to be evaluated jointly by a genitourinary physician  and urologist. Please keep us updated.

    "content": "I had this problem for several years and ignored it; I experienced discharge after ejaculation and urination. After I had ejaculated I often had a buring sensation while urinating but I thought nothing of it.  After a few years I was referred to hospital with testicular pain suspected torsion. I had an operation and they discovered a sack of fluid round my testicle, but I was sent home the same day without any antibiotics.  I then had lots of clear fluid mixed in with urine and just thought it was after effects of surgery. After about two weeks I got testicular pain again and pain shooting down my legs. I referred myself back into hospital and they discovered that I had postratitis and epydidmus (sorry if spelled wrong) so they put me on Dyoxycilin for four weeks which didn't work then Keflex; then amoxycilin; then the specialist put me on Levofloxacin; then my GP put me on Trimethropim all these were four week courses. After this my pain and discharge stopped now I get slight clear discharge while having an errection and the same after ejaculation which I believe is natural.  To this fellow don't worry about a slight discharge after ejaculation this is normal just see a doctor if you experience pain after ejaculating/urinating or if discharge is discoloured.\n\n",

    "content": "Hey there.  I know this is an old posting, but I'm having similar symptoms, and across the many websites with a similar posting, this is the most like mine.  I also had unprotected oral sex and my initial thought was that.  I know it's rare to get STDs that way, but it can happen.  The other \"different\" thing that I did was have penetrative sex in \"the back door\" with my girlfriend.  I wondered if that area could lead to an infection?  I've not had much sex lately, though I have been aroused many times.  Could I just have a semen back-up?  Can I just jerk off a lot and it get better?  I've had the leftover semen come out after I cum and get soft.  In addition, sort of a clear sticky gel-like secretion on occasion.  That has been happening for a while and I never thought twice about it.  Today I experienced the semen like fluid after urinating, which alarmed me, and led me to this and other sites.  It resembled \"beads\" of gel mixed with urine.  The gel beads are common in my ejaculate, so that didn't worry me, it just made me think it was cum!    Did you ever get resolution for your issue?  Any recommendations for me?  Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hi jess_allsopp, Symptoms of genital herpes may range from small blisters or lesions which may cause itching, burning and pain which crust over and heal in approximately two to four weeks. Lesions aren't necessarily confined to the genital area and can be spread to other areas of the body. Some people may experience little or no symptoms. Genital herpes is diagnosed is by a physical examination, culture of the affected area and lab studies. I would suggest that you have an evaluation by your physician to identify if this is the causative factor for your symptoms. I hope this is somewhat helpful. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  While it is possible guy2 could have contracted chlamydia from having oral sex with another person (it can be transmitted orally, but will not travel through the body, only stays where it lands) this would be a complicated story if one was to use a flow chart to diagram the path. The other girl would have to have caught it orally from someone who had it orally or via oral sex with someone who had it. Assuming she is straight, she'd have to have had oral sex with a guy who'd had picked up genital chlamydia. It's possible, just complicated enough to make me wonder. Guys, as you no doubt are aware, aren't always honest. If you don't trust the guy's story, there's probably a good reason.   It's also difficult to know for sure which of the two guys infected you, and it's not really possible to know with certainty how long you've had this, as it often goes on without symptoms for quite a while.  I think, since you've been treated successfully for it once, and no doubt will be again,  your real concern is who's being dishonest with you. How do you determine if someone's telling the truth and who's not? It isn't always easy.   First, please make certain you get the new infection treated and resolved. Second, please, in the future, consider taking measures to prevent this from happening, since a lot of people either don't know they have it or aren't honest about having been exposed -- and not just to chlamydia, but plenty worse things than that. And probably the worst thing of all, is just not being honest, when you get right down to it. You need to find someone you can talk with about this and exchange stories with maybe, and try to get some insight into the guys you're involved with. And at all times, take the necessary precautions to protect yourself. At your age (I'm assuming you were born in 1989?) a lot of guys are going to be either clueless or just plain dishonest. Not all, but a lot of them. Get to know people well before you decide to even risk being intimate (there's more at stake than just your physical health) and even then, until and unless you feel certain you really know the guy and  you two are exclusise, by all means use protection. This isn't something you want to have (chlamydia) and there are, as I said before, plenty worse things you could catch from someone who doesn't know or, worse, just doesn't care.  I  hope this helps clear up some of this for you. Good luck to you and please follow up with us here as needed. Take care!\n\n",

    "content": "I'm an 18 year old female and I recently had unprotected sex with my new partner. About 5 days ago I started to feel a sore lump under the left side of my mons. To the touch it was a round swollen lump that hurt a lot. Then a day later I urinated and noticed there was blood in it. I thought I just had a UTI then and had protected sex either that day or the next after letting my partner know. About two days ago though I noticed a big cluster of what looked like big pimples at the base opening of my vagina, but outside the labia major. There's quite a bunch and they go along my rectum and buttocks; there's also one by itself on my bikini line as well as one on my right thigh away from anything else.   They cause me alot of pain, I guess because they rub up against eachother anytime I move. I noticed today though that they secrete puss themselves. I try my best to keep that region dry even more now because it can get very damp. I'm producing a very foul odor but I haven't had any strange discharge.   There's now also a lump thats formed on my left labia major but under the skin that is extremely painful to any touch. I'm even more so worried because today an area of skin right in the crease in my leg on my thigh has turned a little reddish in color and is sore to the touch so I'm worried about what may be forming. Also, just before I got on this website I urinated with blood again and it was very painful.   I've been trying to figure out what all these symptoms are. Possibly a bunch of things? I just wanted an opinion because I haven't been able to visit a clinic yet.\n\n",

It is good to have other STD testing done but for your information, it is not recommended that you use blood donation for such.  When you give blood, they do test but you should be responsible in having the testing done specifically through your doctor and not rely on these volunteer services, intended to help those who need blood.  It is not an ethical use of the service and you should always answer the questions honestly for the safety of others who may have compromised immune systems.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  While  no one  can tell you with any certainly whether or not your husband might have brought this into the picture, you can at least give him the benefit of the doubt, as HPV, like herpes, can remain dormant indefinitely. The only difference is in what we know historically, since interest in HPV is much more recent, and there isn't as much documented long-term information. However, it appears to behave very similarly to the herpes virus in many ways, and both can remain dormant for decades, so these could have been present for that long at least, and it  is anything but \"highly unlikely\" that they both could have been present for far longer than the period in question. Determining just when they were acquired is virtually impossible (even if you had chickenpox when young you could have had a mild enough case that it could have passed unnoticed).   These two viruses are so common, there are so many strains (about 110 variants of the HPV alone) and so insidious, that it wou'd be a pretty weak platform on which to base concerns about infidelity without some far more damning evidence to correlate with it.  I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck to you and please do follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  While it seems unlikely this is an STD, it probably is related to one or more of your multiple encounters. What it sounds as though it may be is crab lice bites. Those  guys are awfully small and difficult to spot, as they stay hidden in the hairy areas, but the bites often resemble what you've described.  Another possibility is that you've acquired a dermatitis either from direct irritation or due to someone in that series of partners having had some hygeine issues.  In any case you'll need to have this looked at by a doctor in order to have it treated. Trust me, especially if it's crab lice, you'll be wanting to be rid of them very soon. And even if it's a dermatitis (infectious or not) it's going to be really annoying if it isn't already.  Again, it seems pretty unlikely it's an actual STD, but there are things you can contract during less-than-fresh sexual encounters that can be just as troublesome and may as well be classified as STDs. Good luck with this. I hope this is helpful.\n\n",

Secondly, she does have genital herpes which I was aware of before we became sexual. Could the genital Herpes cause her PAP to test abnormal and read link she had HPV? I have been told that you can carry the HPV virus for years with no signs, but I read that if you have HPV it will show up on you PAP smear.

    "title": "Re: Girlfriend has HPV???",
    "content": "Hello, HPV is a condition that can arise from one of more than 100 different forms of virus.  Most of these go undetected because they don't cause lesions or  warts.  The virus enters the skin through a cut or abrasion, possibly when immune system is depressed.  An infected person can go years without any sign of the infection so there is not always a clear cut source of the infection.  In most cases it also clears up on its own within two years but since there is the potential for complications, we watch it closely.  The reason we continue to recommend PAP smears and pelvic exams annually regardless of the previous negative results is because anyone can develop lesions or warts caused by one of the offending types of virus at any time, even years after last having sex.    The chances are you are also infected and we can't say which came first.  We don't have a test for males currently and it doesn't carry the health risks for men that it does for women anyway.  It is believed that some women are just more biologically vulnerable than others - the old \"genetics\" role so often implicated in health and illness.    In most cases the lesions go away on their own and don't develop into cancer, so even an abnormal pap is usually watched for a while to see what happens.  Often the doctor asks the woman to return for follow up in six months.    Herpes is an entirely different virus and has nothing to do with her acquisition of HPV.  But, the previous normal testing does not indicate she has not had the virus for years; just that she has not developed lesions that were apparent in the previous pap testing.  Best wishes.\n\n",

HPV can be transmitted to the oral pharynx causing subclinical condylomata.

Therefore, use of condoms or abstinence are recommended for disease prevention.   An oral exam with magnification may help determine if the infection was spread to the mouth.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello! I was recently diagnosed with Trichomoniasis. I was given & took the 1 day dose of 4 500mg tablets of Metronidazol. The nurse who called just asked what pharmacy I used & explained not to have intercourse for 72 hours & that my partner would also need to be treated. The basics it seems. Because I had never heard of Trichomoniasis and I had no symptoms at all (which also worries me, how long could I have been carrying this infection?!?!?!), I did some research on Trichomoniasis. Now I'm confused. My Gynecologist did not recommend I come back in to confirm the Infection was taken care of by the medication. Only that she would see me next year for my annual. It seems there are enough instances of this infection being difficult to get rid of that she would have asked to see me again after a more specific (or sooner than 1 year) amount of time. Also, I read that Trichomoniasis seems to be linked to \"infertility\". I'm not sure that would be the correct term as it doesn't seem to make the man or woman infertile forever. Only to inhibit fertilization while the infection exists. So, ok. Should I request to see my Gynecologist again to be reexamined and/or tested to be sure the infection has been completely erradicated? If so, how long should I wait to be sure the posotive/negative test result will be clear? Also, I am concerned. Although it has been over a year since I have had any physical contact what-so-ever w/a man, I will (well I hope), be involved with another man. I do not want to pass this to any partner in the future. Obviously, wearing a condom is key. (I have never had unprotected sex in the past. I assume this occured at some point where there was a breakage or something similar.) I want to be certain this infection has been taken care of. In addition, I want to be able to conceive a child should that situation appropriately present itself. Please help, now I am more concerned than ever! Thank you very much in advance :)\n\n",

Trichomonas is often coupled with other STD's so testing for gonorrhea, chlamydia, HPV and HIV is important.   Medical research has reported a link between Trichomonas and infertility.

Consensus says that folks should wait 7 days after last dose of metronidazole to have sex and because of the med's proven effectiveness, no follow up testing is needed.   Hope this provides some further education.  All the best to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Red itchy bumps on genitals.",
    "content": "It all started with a itchy rash starting on my inner thighs. Warm temps (like being under a blanket would cause itchiness to the extent of keeping me awake. Then I began to have itchiness on my testicle forming a red spot the size of a pencil eraser. That red bump then spread and within a week I got as many as 7 bumps on my genitals. No pain, no puss, no blood, the bumps feel solid. They look like mosquito bite bumps and become larger if I touch them. Other than that the rash on my inner thigh has spread to my armpits, causing a similiar bump on the back of my arm and inner thigh. The itchiness is driving me crazy, I have been using corizone cream and neosporin to attempt to help the situation. It temporarily stopps the itching but the bumps become inflamed. I have had 5 sexual partners my whole life. I have not had sex in months. all of my partners (all women) get tested and do not have anything. From what I have read i may have dermatitis however i need confirmation because im starting to become concerned. I have pictures however i do not want to post directly on the site. Please help - thank you\n\n",

So instead I went to a clinic where they gave me a shot for Gonorrhea as well as these two pink pills for the Chlmydia. Now my question is how long was i suppose to wait to engage in sexual intercourse. The doctor at the clinic didn't tell me and my fiancee listened to the phlebotomist who told him, he could have sex in three days. Which sounds funny to me because I know a phelbotomist isn't a doctor. Then, i thought maybe because it was a high dosage, that maybe it she was right. Because my prescribed medicine was for ten days. Anyway please help me in telling me what to do. P.S- We had sexual intercourse four days after his visit and three days after mine. He went on day before me. Also am feeling burning, Im prone to yeast infections and think that the high dosage of antibiotic may have given me one.\n\n",

It is possible that the infection may be sufficiently treated after 3-4 days to prevent reinfection but one week is a good safety margin.  Since both of you were treated it makes it a little less likely for reinfection as well.  I would recommend, to be safe since these infections can sometimes be asymptomatic, that you be retested in a few weeks to be sure that you are free from infection.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi I was diagnosed w/Trich 7/06; 1/07 and most recently 1/09. My husband claim he has not been cheating. In 1/07 we were treated with the same medication 500mg of metronidazol 2x a day for seven days.  Did not drink any alcohol. After that I had no symptoms. I was on the bc pills so we had unprotected sex through out 2007 until May 2008 when my birth controls prescription ran out. We used a condomn May 2008 to December 25, 2008. We had unprotected sex 12/25/08. 1/8/09 I had syptoms and went to the doctor and was diagnosed with Trich a third time.  My GYN said the prescription she gave 1/07 is 99% effective if taken properly and so did not prescribe anything for him this time. Instead said he should go see an internist. The internist said there was no test she could perform on him to see if he had Trich. I ask is it possible for it to have laid dormaint in him all this time (2 years) and given it to me again? She did not give me a clear anwser she said you either have it or you don't and it's a sextually transmitted disease.  She went on to say she'll treat him as though the first treatment failed. I have never had this disease until I met this man, every time I had syptoms its after intercouse with my husband.  Please explain is it true no test can accurately prove if he has it or not? If he was not completely treated the 2nd time could Trich have laid dormaint in his system for two years and it not be transmitted to me until now? Should I get tested again after my medication has run out?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  The information you were given that no test exists for detecting Trichomoniasis in males is absolutely incorrect.  Male partners of infected females can be tested for this sexually transmitted infection using either a First Catch Random Urine  or Semen or PCR Swab. The test is known as the Trichomonas vaginalis by PCR test..  However, the presence of a single sexually transmiited disease in any sexually active person should prompt a search for others. I would therefore advise that you and your husband undergo a test known as the Sexual Health Profile by PCR. In this profile both of you will be tested for the following seven sexually transmtted diseases using only one sample from each of you:  Chlamydia trachomatis N. gonorrhoea Mycoplasma genitalium Ureaplasma urealyticum Trichomonas vaginalis Gardnerella vaginalis Herpes Simplex Types I amd II  I hope this information is helpful.

They don't look classic for this from the picture, though.  You may also simply have some blocked pores in the skin that are causing the bumps.  The skin wrinkling may be a normal variant.  I'm not sure about this one.  If STD's are possible I would recommend you be tested since many STD's can be asymptomatic, especially in men.  If this continues you may want to see a dermatologist to get an expert opinion.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  It is difficult to tell what these bumps could be without direct clinical examination. However, these bumps could be due to dermatitis. Dermatitis is referred to different types of skin rashes that are caused by infections, allergies, and irritants. The severity of the rash ranges from mild to severe according to the cause. There might be itching on many cases.  Contact dermatitis occurs due to skin contact with a substance that causes an allergic reaction (allergic contact dermatitis) or with an irritant substances (irritant contact dermatitis). There are many causes for contact dermatitis some involve irritants such as soaps, certain creams and some may be due to allergy. Avoiding the causing substance is the mainstay of prevention in addition to medications prescribed by your doctor.  Another likely cause is Inflammation of the Hair follicles or the sebaceous (sweat) glands.  They may be visible as small nodules or might only be felt as small lumps in the skin. They are yellow/black or red nodules on the hair shafts in the inguinal region. Nodules are often on the scrotum and occasionally on the base of the shaft of the penis. They may contain pus in them.    - Friction and fungus (less likely) can also be the causes of these symptoms although itching is a common symptom. Skin rubbing against skin generates heat and sweat; they in turn lead to redness and painful itchy patches.  Obese and active people are more susceptible.    Direct clinical examination is essential. So, I advise you to follow up with your doctor. Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

What would be the reason for the doctors recommended use of condoms. If we did not use condoms could it make her HPV matters worse, or would it cause neither of us to be cured by our immune systems due to repeated infections from one another?

    "content": "Hello DuCo,  Regarding your first post, the answer is maybe.  The reason for this is that there are many strains of HPV.  Some cause genital warts.  It is possible that you have one strain and your wife has another.  As such, you potentially could become infected with a new strain that can cause genital warts to begin to appear.  If you have the same strain it is unlikely that you would develop new warts; however, if you do have this strain it could potentially reactivate and cause new warts without new exposure.  Regarding your second question, the answer to this one is no.  The strains of HPV that cause genital warts do not cause warts on other parts of the body.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Some people choose to cover a wart with a bandage if they are worried about spread to another.  But, though they are contagious, simply touching a wart on someone doesn't mean that person will get one. The viruses that cause warts are passed through close physical contact or from a surface that a person with a wart touches, like a bathmat or a shower floor.  A tiny cut or scratch can make any area of skin more vulnerable to warts. Also, picking at a wart can spread warts to other parts of the body.  There are effective treatments for warts such as these.  Of course the doctor can remove them (though sometimes they recur).  Home remedies include an occlusive barrier such as occlusive tape (people often use duct tape).  We don't know exactly how this works - perhaps it triggers an immune response so our own body targets the area with white blood cells.  Because warts often disappear on their own within about a year it is possible this process is expedited with the tape.  At any rate, it must be occluded for quite a while - not just a week or so.  Success has been reported about 50% of the time.    It also appears warts like a cool, dry environment.  Another remedy is to soak the area frequently in water as hot as you can tolerate it.  As the water cools, gradually add more hot water.  Do this for about 30 minutes as often as you can manage.    People also get results from salicylic acid applied to the wart with caution to avoid adjoining healthy skin.  This comes as a remedy you can buy.  Dermarrest and Compound W are some brands available in the U.S. that are marketed for this use.  The biggest problem with people using these treatments is that they quit too soon.  It takes quite a while to get rid of these pesty lesions.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Other strains cause genital warts while still other strains cause warts in other places.    Often, women learn that they have HPV because there have been changes found on their pap smear.

    "content": "Can std for example like gonnorhea be passed through kissing or saliva? A few days ago I had sexual contact with a guy who I hardly new. I'm afraid i have contracted some sort of STD. Our genitals were in contact, but we didn't fully have sex, his penis only went in half way but we stopped as it start to hurt. he also went down on me. Is it possible if he's infected transfered an STD by contact of our genitals and then after that went down on me, would it then be picked up in saliva after going down and then passed to my mouth and throat via kissing afterwards??? is there any std that are carried in the mouth/saliva on its own and passed through kissing?  cause about 2 days after I get a bit of a sore throat and then white bits on my tonsils and at that same time had a little bit of a temperature. I'm really scared about this. I don't know whether its just some normal bacterial infection in my thoat/ tonsillitus. is it just a coincidence?? also I want to know because I'm afraid if i have contracted something, i'm afraid i might have passed it onto this other guy that i've kissed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, There are infections that can be passed from the genitals to the mouth such as herpes, but to it would be very unlikely you could have gotten a STD and passed it along through kissing alone.  I suspect your symptoms are coincidental but there are lots of infections that could be spread sexually so if your partner was infected, you could be at risk and having a screening is not a bad idea.  There is a period of incubation which varies with each type of organism and the individual so you sometimes need to repeat this screening after a few months in case something is incubating.    A sore throat itself, even with spots on the tonsils, does not suggest STD.  If it continues you should have it checked and may need a culture for accurate treatment.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I cannot remember them getting a blister until we got back home a few days later.  I have never had herpes, fever blisters, cold sores so I did not know it is so contagious.  I was intimate with my husband (before my lip blistered) and of course eating and drinking and kissing my babies.  What are the odds this has to be herpes and did I infect my entire family?    I did go to Care Now and they just looked at it and said oh yeah its just a fever blister.  Like it was no big deal!  I am quite upset and just waiting to see if my husband or I break out anywhere else.  He has had cold sores before but not for a very long time and only when he is sick.  How else could I have gotten this?  (we are both faithful.)\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Does a blister on my lip from sunburn have to be HERPES?",
    "content": "Hi there -  You can relax. While  there's little doubt your fever blister is the result of herpes simplex, there are plenty of more innocent ways to catch it than romantic (or even unromantic) physical intimacy. For instance, if you ever had chickenpox, the virus has been lying dormant in your body all this time. Most all of us have it,  the question is more when will it show up and how? Most of us either get oral stomatitis (canker sores in the mouth) or fever blisters. Some get extremely painful outbreaks of shingles. Some really lucky people never have anything noticeable happen.   When active, any expression of herpes (simplex or type II, which are essentially the same anyway), is highly contagious, so it's just a matter of awareness and consideration to avoid passing it along, but in a family setting this can also be almost impossible.    This will resolve in a short time.  While it is active you'll need to try to remember to avoid touching it (if you even know you're doing that, as most people do it unconsciously -- we can only try), washing your hands, not kissing anyone (try \"air kisses\" temporarily I guess), and keep your washcloth isolated from  others. Once the thing goes away you're \"safe\" again, and it may never happen again. Then again it might. The herpes virus is infuriatingly unpredictable, but it never really goes away, it just goes dormant.   I hope this is helpful. More people have had this happen than not, most likely.  Just take care to keep it to yourself as best you can, and if it  does wind up spreading to a loved one, again, there's only so much one can do.   Best of luck to you. Follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Dripping - Slight Pain",
    "content": "Okay, so, for two years, since I began having unprotected sex, I have been day to day, constantly checking my penis, making sure I don't have anything abnormal appearing....In the past 5-8 months, however, after peeing, I have \"felt\" that my penis is \"dripping\", or that a bit of pee is coming out...so I have made sure at the end of peeing, to make sure all is gone, and yet, it still feels somewhat drippy....No pain, none at all, ever, and sometimes, it doesn't even feel that it is.   No discharge, ever, and my penis does not itch whatsoever either. My brother, mom and grandparents and aunts are all nurses. I have inquired, and they all seem to think I am just thinking about it too much.  I dated a girl for 3 years, that's where unprotected sex began, and have had only 2-3 random hookups without a condom, but I have known them (sure, a horrible excuse, but still), and also, another girlfriend for a year or more, and none of them have ever gotten back to me about anything. my most recent girlfriend, got checked for STDs, even months after having sex unprotected, and said she was completely clean. She still has never said anything, and I know she would if she found out she had something. Haven't had time to drive to get tested, but recently got tested by the Navy, and I believe I'm clean, will find out after xmas break.  i masterbate a good amount. at least once a night, and wonder if that could be due to anything.   the slight pain, is not even pain, but more of just a feeling of a presence in my penis, more the tip than anything else.  Any ideas? Thank you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Dripping - Slight Pain",
    "content": "Hi there -  There are many possible causes of this problem, some of them involving STDs, mainly gonorrhea (although the lack of pain makes this questionable). Nonspecific urethritis (NSU) can be caused by any number of relatively innocent agents. However, a \"leaky faucet\" should not be ignored and it's not \"all in your head.\" It may be (and probably is) very simple, but still  should be checked. Since you've been tested by the Navy, one of the pre-eminent sources of STD testing experience, you should know soon if you have anything at all that is infectious. However, if the  problem is caused by something else (like a pinched nerve for instance) this could be missed. The good news is it won't cause any systemic trouble. The bad news would be the problem could continue and might be difficult to trace. It may not matter. I suspect your main concern is that it could be an STD, even though you've been largely careful. If you have an infection it will be discovered and treated. Let this be a wakeup call regarding the inherent dangers of unprotected, relatively anonymous sexual encounters. No judgements here, just a concern for the public health and welfare and, in this instance, yours.   I hope this is helpful. Please let us know what you find out. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "I have warts that I thought were genital warts on my inner thighs, and recently found out from my OB-GYN that they are not \"genital warts\", but regular warts located near (not ON) the genitals. She did a treatment with a type of acid (I can't remember what kind), and suggested that I see a dermatologist to have them frozen off, which I did recently (about two weeks ago). The warts have fallen off, but the area is still healing. My question is, how long until it's safe to have sex again? Also, even though these aren't \"genital\" warts, do they spread the same way? I didn't think of asking the dermatologist until I had left the office. The only answers I've seen so far are \"practice abstinence\", but that really doesn't help me, I don't want to practice abstinence for the rest of my life! :)  One more thing, I've been reading that the basic treatments only remove the surface warts but don't kill the virus and thus leave the area still contagious (don't know if I'm using the right wording, sorry!), is this the same for freezing? If these warts return, what is the most efficient way of getting rid of them once and for all (I know that the virus that causes warts stays in the body indefinitely, so I suppose the question shouldn't be \"once and for all\" but more a good chance at once and for all)? Would it be laser treatments or would having them cauterized be as effective?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Various treatments are available and all are effective for certain warts.  Often it is just a personal choice matter of which method the doctor prefers.  Sometimes they return but usually the various treatments result in their eradication.   Regular run-of-the-mill warts are contagious but not specifically sexually.  Even though they are contagious, they don't spread all that easily person-to-person. How easily one gets warts is often related to the immune system.  You should not have to abstain for life and probably not at all unless the partner is immune compromised and worried about getting the virus.    You are correct that the virus stays in your body but it is not contagious when there is no active wart present.  Best wishes\n\n",

Most of cases however are due to infections with bacteria (Ecoli) that ascend through the urethral meatus (through intercourse or local contamination).   These symptoms could be also due to a sort of dermatitis in which urethritis caused by trauma or chemical irritants. There is itching in the majority of cases.Avoiding the causing substance is the mainstay of prevention in addition to medications prescribed by your doctor.  Urine analysis, urine culture and exclsuion of STDs are essential for the diagnosis.  So, I advise you to follow up with your doctor, he will prescribe the appropriate treatment based on clinical examination and investigations results.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Sorry for the delay in replying.  Oral sex although is thought to be safer than vaginal or anal sex in many aspects, transmission of diseases is still possible.  There is a possibility that you may catch infection into the urethra causing urethritis. Since you have caught infection in your throat from your girl friend, the possibility is there.    But if you cleaned yourself immediately after, the risk is much less. So, once you feel any symptoms suggestive of urethritis like burning micturition and frequency, you should contact your doctor and get a urine analysis and culture.  Hope you find this information useful. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  It is difficult to tell what these bumps could be without direct clinical examination. However, these bumps could be due to dermatitis (since you have eczema, atopic dermatitis).  Dermatitis is referred to different types of skin rashes or bumps that are caused by infections, allergies, and irritants. The severity of the rash ranges from mild to severe according to the cause. There might be itching on many cases.   Contact dermatitis occurs due to skin contact with a substance that causes an allergic reaction (allergic contact dermatitis) or with an irritant substances (irritant contact dermatitis). There are many causes for contact dermatitis some involve irritants such as soaps, certain creams and some may be due to allergy.  Avoiding the causing substance is the mainstay of prevention in addition to medications prescribed by your doctor. Secondary bacterial infection in the damaged skin from scratching is easy in this area, so avoid scratching and keep it clean.   Another cause that should be excluded is Herpes simplex, which  is one of the sexually transmitted disease. Genital herpes is a very common disease caused by Herpes virus type2. It spreads by direct contact and results in small, very painful blisters (fluid is inside the lesion) on the penis and other genital areas, causing  irritation, itching, and discharge. The sores turns into crust, that scab and heal in about 3 weeks. Exclusion of other STDs is essential if it is proved to be due to herpes infection.  Treatment is based on the underlying the cause. Keeping the skin dry and clean is very important.   Direct clinical examination is essential. So, I advise you to follow up with your doctor.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  This is probably due to urethritis. The majority of cases are due to infections with bacteria (Ecoli) that ascend through the urethral meatus (through intercourse or local contamination). However, individuals at risk (multiple sexual partners) should be investigated for sexually transmitted disease like Chlamydia or gonorrhea. Patients usually have burning micturition and itching that is more intense early in the morning. Discharge per urethra is common too especially with gonorrhea.  Making the urine more diluted would lessen the dysuria as concentrated urine alone would result in dysuria.  These symptoms could be also due to a urethritis caused by trauma or chemical irritants. There is itching in the majority of cases. Avoiding the causing substance is the mainstay of prevention in addition to medications prescribed by your doctor.  Urine analysis, urine culture and exclusion of STDs are essential for the diagnosis. So, I advise you to follow up with your doctor, he will prescribe the appropriate treatment based on clinical examination and investigations results.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  This sound like urethritis although your tests are negative for any causative organisms.  The condition typically occurs due infections  that may be or may not be related to your sexual activity. Most of cases however are due to infections with bacteria (Ecoli) that ascend through the urethral meatus (through intercourse or local contamination). Negative cultures do not exclude bacterial infection especially if tests have been done after starting antimicrobial treatment.   Urethritis can be diagnosed based on the presence of a mucopurulent or purulent urethral discharge; a urethral smear that demonstrates at least 5 leukocytes on microscopy field; and/or the miscopy finding of at least 10 white blood cells (WBCs) in sample from the first-voided urine sample or leukocyte esterase positive on dipstick test of a similar sample.  These symptoms could be also due to a urethritis that is caused by trauma or chemical irritants. There is itching and dysuria in the majority of cases. Avoiding the causing substance is the mainstay of prevention in addition to medications prescribed by your doctor.  Exclusion of STDs is essential and it is good that your doctor recommended it.

    "title": "Possibility of a STD from dentistry work?",
    "content": "Hi,  I am curious as to the possibility of contracting a STD from a visit to the dentist's office. I understand that dentists are required to undergo a specific set of procedures to make sure their tools are bacterial free, but I have my doubts. I visited my dentist approximately six months ago. Right after the visit I had a rather large pimple like object on the corner of my lip, but it went away in about a week. I experienced no other symptoms other than the object.   About a month ago I noted that I had a small, pimple like object at the area where the growth of pubic hair ends on the top area. There is only one, and is not a group of them.  I am wondering if this is simply a coincidence or I am at risk of having a STD. I understand that these diseases can only be transferred via sex or contact with infected blood into one's own bloodstream (I may have had a cut in my mouth, but I am not sure). I also realize that the risk for infection for me is very low - for me to have an STD the doctor must a) use tools that were not disinfected before use, b) the aforementioned tool to have come in contact with a patient with a STD with a cut in his or her mouth, and c) have a cut in my mouth.  Keep in mind I am only 16 years of age and have not yet had any sexual encounters of any kind. I am also wondering if oral STDs stay isolated in the area, and if symptoms of an STD transferred orally can appear in the genital area.  Please let me know if any more information would be of assistance to you. I definitely appreciate any insight on my condition and predicament.  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, What you have described could be inflammation of the Hair follicles or the sebaceous (sweat) glands.  They form visible as small yellow/black or red nodules or might only be felt as small lumps in the skin.  They may contain pus in them.    It is possible to get STDs like hepatitis through contaminated instruments used in dental or surgical procedures that came in contact with the blood of infected person and then in contact with damaged tissue without being disinfected.   But the bumps you described are not suggestive of any kind of STDs even if you are worried about herpes virus type I that causes cold sores or herpetic lesion at the oral cavity, it is not the same type of virus that causes genital herpes which is Herpes virus type II.  Cold sores are usually caused by type I Herpes simplex infections and are contagious.  People usually get their first time infection with herpes virus during childhood. The first attack of herpes is associated with fever and painful sores around the mouth (gingivostomatitis) that may last several days then heal completely.  The virus then remains as dormant infection or in a latent period.   Once exposed to certain conditions like fever, colds,stress or exposure to the sun, reactivation occurs resulting in cold sores. An initial prodrome to herpes infections occurs in the form of burning or tingling sensation followed by blisters that are mildly painful. The diagnosis of cold sores based mainly on the clinical appearance of the lesions.   It is likely to be a coincidence but direct clinical examination is essential to reach proper diagnosis. So, I advise you to follow up with your doctor. Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

Skin rubbing against skin generates heat and sweat; they in turn lead to redness and painful itchy patches.  Obese and active people are more susceptible.  Fungus infection predominates in the summer.   Treatment is based on the underlying the cause. Keeping the skin dry and clean is very important. If secondary bacterial infection occurs local antibiotic ointment will be needed.  Direct clinical examination is essential.

    "content": "Okay so I have these sores on the top of my vagina and a little under the lips but mostly above the clitoris. They hurt a lot and look like they are trying to scab up but its too moist down there for the scabs to form. There is one big one in the middle and many little red sores branching out. I cannot for the life of me figure out what it is. I have had a major sore down there before a couple of years ago.   I know I'm pretty prone to yeast infections on the inside, i've had them before, but i've researched vaginal yeast infections online and nothing i've read has said anything about sores forming.   These sores are very painful, to touch and also when anything rubs against them. I don't even want to have sex with my husband right now it hurts too much. They literally came over night. I was at a friends house and slept on the couch in a shirt and my underwear and the next morning i felt down there and there was a big sore. I thought maybe it was a pimple or ingrown hair but when i pinched it nothing happened and i just got jolts of pain from it. I showed my husband and he can't even figure out what it is. I do know that my friend, who's house I stayed the night at, had bed bugs and was trying hard to get rid of them, but if it was those i thought that they don't go under clothing or even bite in area's like that, and wouldn't i have them in other places besides just that spot down there???!!!   I don't see how it could possibly be herpies or any type of STD because my husband has been tested and never diagnosed with it, and i have never seen this type of outbreak on him. and he has been MY one and only sex partner.   I have noticed that my mom constantly gets cold soars on her lips, but i asked her if she's been tested for herpies and she said she had been and never was diagnosed. So I have no idea if I could have been born with it possibly from my mom, because i've read that constant cold sores are a type of herpies or something I guess.   I really don't know, any advice as to what this could be would be appreciated. I'm waiting for my medicaid to come through so i can finally go to the doctor while i have the outbreak, but by the time that happens the sores may be gone. I'm just at a loss. It freaks me out to think that it could be Herpies... i've only slept with my husband and ONLY him, how the hell could i get Herpies if i've only been with ONE partner and he's been tested after each woman he's been with (which is only like 4 women) and not diagnosed or had any type of symptoms of it what so ever.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Herpes does present like that and it can be transmitted from a cold sore in intimate situations.  If your husband had a cold sore and then you had oral sex, it is possible to get Herpes Type I in the genital region.  It is highly unlikely to be related to your birth this many years later and cold sores on the lips do not necessarily mean a person has genital herpes.    The only way to diagnose this would be to see a doctor, preferably during the outbreak when the lesions are present.  From here we can only speculate.  Transmission routes will depend on which type it is (if it is indeed herpes virus that is causing this).  You may have a communicable disease community health clinic where you could be checked for STI for a nominal fee if you are anxious.    It does not sound like bed bugs to me.  But, you do want to find out what would be the right treatment so seeing a health care provider will be good.  If you don't get in until you get the Medicaid, chances are there will be another outbreak if it is Herpes.  If it goes away and doesn't come back it still would be wise th have a general exam with pelvic and pap smear so it will give you a chance to discuss this at least.    Best wishes.\n\n",

While getting a pap smear would allow the doctor to do a visual inspection, the purpose of the pap smear is to check for abnormal cells on the cevrix so that alone would not rule out herpes.  I would encourage you to see your doctor.  Blood tests can also determine if you have antibodies to the herpes virus.  There are treatments to help control this disease if indeed this is what you have.  It could also be another problems such as infected follicles, but only a doctor can say for certain on this.  Meanwhile, please use condoms for sexual activity to avoid these infections.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Worriedintx,  The tiny white bumps that can push like a pimple may be normal.  Sometimes such white bumps appear on the penis shaft, as well.  The knots under the skin also can be normal, but must be evaluated by your doctor.  You didn't mention if the bumps on your penis shaft are there all the time, or only when erect.  Your doctor needs to evaluate them, as well.  Please be sure to have thorough hygiene for both your scrotum and penis; if you are uncircumcised, be sure to pull back your foreskin and clean off any smegma (\"white stuff\") every day.  It does not sound urgent, but you should still see your doctor right away.  Do not be embarrassed; your doctor has undoubtedly checked such things out many times.  Good luck to you.

    "content": "Hello,  Mild repeated irritation (mechanical like tight cloth with frequent friction or chemical like exposure to irritant creams or soap) can result in dark skin areas. In this case avoiding irritation will make it fade away by its own.  Other causes include fungal infections. Certain types of fungi can result in skin color changes.  On the other hand vitiligo causes depigmentation (loss of color) of the skin and commonly affects people with darker skins.   Direct clinical examination is essential. I would advise you to follow up with your doctor for proper treatment approach.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

Unprotected fellatio performed on me, protected vaginal intercourse. Anxiety, guilt & depression.   Started researching STDs online. Myriad symptoms have come and gone. Briefly was having intermittent pain on the left side of the head of my penis. Urination has been normal and always painless, but had 2 strange 2 occasions. Once after a normal night urination I noticed a slight trace of blood on a tissue I used to wipe away excess urine drops (6 weeks). Once after a normal afternoon urination I noticed a white substance floating in the pool of darker urine (10 weeks). I'm also certain that I'm having some sort of discharge at night due to both wet/dry underwear stains. I can't be certain of discharges during the day except for the white substance I found that one time in my urine. The discharges started at 6 weeks. I was advised by an MD in another forum that I'm hypersensitive to body sensations due to guilt and anxiety. I'd like to beleive my test results and try to move on. What could be causing my emissions?\n\n",

Later on that day I kept having these odor-less clear discharges...its almost like pre-seminal fluid, but im not having an erection. Im totally clean and have been tested and so is my partner, what could this be? Could it be an allergic reaction to something? Bacteria? Hormone changes? And like with any fluid that  is inside your urinary tract while your trying to urinate there is a slight sting, even after i masturbate and  I urine, it stings which is normal, because im trying to push out urine while theirs semen in my penis. But I like I said, im clean and sooo is my partner, im just freaking out.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello to cmb2442 first -  While anxiety can do an amazing number on us and cause all kinds of symptoms, this one is concrete enough to be worth having medically evaluated. While it would seem all the obvious things were ruled out already, somehow, perhaps not even related to the  sexual encounter you mention, you could have developed some sort of genitourinary irritation, infection, etc. In fact, I guess we come full circle here, because unconscious physical restraint in that area (I can' t think of a better way to phrase that -- physical tension unconsiously applied due to guilt and anxiety) could even be causing this. What you are seeing sounds like normal pre or post ejaculatory fluids, but you probably need to find out why they are showing up and that's best accomplished by seeing a medica provider. If you get the same answer (anxiety) then you can probably let the concern go. It would seem you didn't sustain any physical trauma from your encounter, but just ruling out STDs doesn't mean you don't have some other sort of GU problem; it would be a big coincidence, but those are the things that drive medical people crazy, because they happen so often.  Get yourself medically checked, get your peace of mind back, and start enjoying life again. Hope this is  helpful. Please follow  up with us here.\n\n",

What I can tell you is that if it resolved in short order it was probably just a \"strain\"  (old, out of use term for overuse of the apparatus), but if it lasts more than a day or two you should have yourself checked for a possible STD or other UTI (they aren't all sexually transmitted). Give it a day or so, then go get seen.   Best of luck to you. Follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

So I went back to my doctor and it so happened that I had anal warts.  And my doctor noticed my anal area was quite inflamed.  So she prescribed me some gel for the warts (Condylox 0.5%) and referred me to a dermatologist for further treatment and observation.  But she also prescribed me Doxycycline 100mg capsule.  Now I can't figure out why she would prescribe this and I am not a fan of taking antibiotics.  What would this antibiotic be for? I have heard over and over that antibiotics usually CAUSE yeast infections.  So I am quite confused. I wish I would have asked my doctor at the time.  I am now hesitant to take the antibiotic.  Please let me know why she would prescribe this antibiotic and if you think is necessary.  Thank you.\n\n",

My guess would be that she wanted to be sure the warts in healing did not become infected to cause further trauma in an area that is rife with bacteria.  Antibiotics don't actually cause yeast infections but they can leave the body without the good bacteria to keep them at bay.  Not everyone develops this fungal overgrowth when taking a course of antibiotics.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  This is very suggestive of genitourinary tract infection (urethritis or cystitis). Urethritis is mostly due to infection with bacteria that ascend through the urethral meatus (through intercourse or local contamination).   Sexually transmitted disease diseases should be tested and excluded.  Stones also give similar clinical picture and should be looked for.   Urine analysis and urine culture are essential for the diagnosis. Your physician may also recommend US of the bladder and kidneys.  I would advise you to follow up with your doctor. Thorough history and clinical examination are mandatory for proper management.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

I have had blood work done recently when I was in the hospital for a viral infection and everything came up fine.

    "content": "Hello,  These lesions are likely to be due to dermatitis. Dermatitis are caused by infections, allergies, and irritants (such as soaps, certain creams).  - Infections like: Herpes simplex usually presents with small, very painful blisters that burst into then scab and heal in about 3 weeks.  Friction and fungus cause red patches that are also itchy. Obese and active people are more susceptible.   - Dermatitis can occur also due to contact with an allergen or irritant like soap, creams, synthetic cloth, or after vigorous sexual intercourse or masturbation.   Direct clinical examination is essential, so I would advise you to follow up with your doctor for proper management. Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  Herpes is transmitted either by direct physical contact with a lesion or bodily fluids, or sometimes via skin-to-skin contact. It is a fragile virus outside the body,  so while routine environmental hygeine is (always) wise, it is probably near-impossible to contract herpes type I or II via any environmental surface unless fresh exudate somehow finds its way onto a surface which is then contacted directly by another, a scenario which is almost impossible.   In short, no. there is no need for special enviornmental cleanup following use of ordinary household facilities. You're to be commended, however, for your vigilance. Direct contact is the area which must be most closely monitored. Hand washing can be as per usual, but should be done anyway, so just continue that good habit as  always. Other than that,  just stay aware of active lesions and try to avoid contact with the affected area during those times.  Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "What you describe (and your excellent quality photos confirm) is what used to known as \"falling piles\", which are, in fact, prolapsed hemorrhoids. These are relatively easy to treat, although as extensive as yours appear to be, this may require several separate sessions to complete. This  condition can be due to a predisposition  or,  often, due to chronic constipation. Small veins in the anus become vericosities.  If they are pendulous as in the pictures, they may drop outside and can cause a great deal of discomfort. The treatment is either surgical or semi-surgical (sometimes they are sclerosed by injection or by application of rubber bands. They then die, drop off, heal, and hopefully don't recur).   This  isn't  an STD but hemorrhoids at their most  bizarre, but it is still a fairly common and well known problem.    I  hope this eases your mind and is of some help.\n\n",

For pregnant women proper assessment with local examination, Pap smear, and close monitoring for any changes during pregnancy. Changes in the vulva and the cervix from rapid cell division may occur during pregnancy and should be managed properly during pregnancy and after child birth.   Regarding the pregnancy, it is usually safe with no miscarriages, premature delivery or congenital anomalies from virus transmission to the baby.   However, during child birth transmission of infection to the baby may occur and throat infection may occur resulting in serious condition. Being not common, obstetrician does not usually consider cesarean section as an option to avoid infection transmission.  I would advise you to inform your doctor and to discuss with him your concerns for better management and avoiding putting your self in a more complicated situation.  Hope you find this information useful. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "About 70 days ago, I had unprotected oral sex with a woman.  I know this is silly, but right after I was done (I realized that I shouldt be having oral sex with someone I didn'tknow that well), I washed my mouth very well.  About five days ago, I noticed a bump on my lip with a little open area on it, almost like I bit my lip.  The next day, I had what appeared to be a scab forming, but it still hasn't formed. My body is a little achy and I was feeling like I was coming down with a cold, but I am fairly physically active and the aches can be explained by that.   I have done a lot of research on syphilis, and the sore doesn't look like any of the pictures that I have seen on the internet. The sore is almost round and that is only when I move my lip around.  The area looks somewhat discolored, but it is hard to tell. I have been taking a friend's zovirax just in case it is a herpes sore and the sore does seem to be going away.  It has been five days and the sore is starting to go away. Will herpes medicine help a chancre go away?  Will my symptoms have taken this long to show themselves?  Like I said, it has been over 70 days since my last sexual encounter.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Is this sore a syphilis sore or herpes on my lip?",
    "content": "Hi there -  The lesion certainly sounds like herpes. It  could be due to the sexual encounter or it could be coincidental, since these sores are relatively common anyway.   While Zovirax can help drive a herpetic lesion into  remission, there is no cure for these things. They recur randomly and can happen with on no regular basis, be gone for months or even years, only to appear again later. I  have to counsel against self-treatment, however, especially with a prescription medication that belongs to someone else. Not only is this illegal, it is unwise, because there is usually a reason a medication is not available over the counter, and prescription medications have that status because not everyone can safely take everything.   The good news in all this is that you may have, via experimenting with your friend's Zovirax, confirmed the lesion is herpetic. Whether or not it is the result of your encounter is more difficult to determine, which is one reason you need to be seen  by a doctor. Another reason is to be certain this is a correct assumption. This is what doctors are for (and why we have to see them to get the appropriate prescription drugs when necessary).   Your other symptoms are also consistent with a herpetic outbreak. Syphillis usually doesn't cause as much in the way of generalized physical symptoms  until much later. But to be certain of what you have and to get the appropriate medication for it, you need to be seen by a healthcare provider. If this is herpes (which it very likely is), you'll need your own prescription, especially if you're sexually active. You'll also have to deal with sharing this information with partners when appropriate. There's nothing quite like this sort of \"present\", as you now know.  Even if you didn't get it from your last partner, you can still \"give\" it to someone else, and that's not something you want.   I hope this is helpful. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Warts usually do not require treatment, unless for cosmetic purposes, complications or to avoid spread.   Doctors usually start with local treatments including Salicylic acid to resolve warts.  Warts that do not respond to home treatments may require different approache, based on the wart site, symptoms and the doctor recommendation and the patinets preference.  These approaches include: - Freezing (cryotherapy or liquid nitrogen therapy). It may require more than one session.  - Minor surgery. This involves cutting away the wart with an electric needle and curettage.  surgery is usually reserved for warts that haven't responded to other therapies.   - Laser surgery: being expensive, it is reserved for difficult to treat warts.  Laser surgery and surgical excision both require a local or general anesthetic.  Surgical removal gives the highest success rate and lowest recurrence rate.   There will be pain and tenderness in the vulva postoperative for few days. Bleeding in the form of spoting may occur during the first week.  You should wait till the next check-up before having sex. Commonly you are advised to be checked withing few weeks to one month after discharge from the hospital and you are advised to record all the notes for the next visit.  Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I would like to add some information about genital warts and human papilloma virus HPV.  Condyloma acuminata (genital warts) are the most common sexually transmitted condition in the United States. Although it affects both sex, women are reported to be more affected than men. The disease is caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV).  About 100 types of this virus exist, of them more than 40 types cause infection in the anogenital tract (genital tract and anus) of men and women and cause genital warts (known as condylomata acuminata or venereal warts).   Persistent HPV (some subtypes) infections are known to be the major cause of cervical cancer. They first cause precancerous changes in the uterine cervix and uterine, cervical cancer.   HPVs may also play a role in  anal, vulva, and vaginal cancer.  HPV vaccines are now available and can protect against most cervical cancers and genital warts. The quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, Gardasil\u00ae, is the first approved vaccine given in three-dose vaccine and is now routinely recommended for 11 and 12 year old girls.   Catch-up vaccination for older females who have not received the vaccine is also available. Females who may have been infected with any HPV type can be protected from other types through vaccination. However, there is no available clinical test to determine if the four HPV types targeted by the vaccine have been already acquired by infection.  Those who have been exposed to infection should be under routine cervical cancer screening and follow-up of abnormal results. This is done by the Pap test which study cells collected from the cervix. It can identify abnormal or pre-cancerous changes in the cervix and determine further approaches needed according to changes found.  Another test known as HPV DNA test used with a Pap test in certain occasions to identify HPV of high risk.   Hope this information is useful. Best regards.\n\n",

Although both are rare especially in healthy individuals with good immunity, it should be always kept in mind and excluded once suspicious symptoms and signs are present.  Currently there is no routine test for men to check for HPV types that can cause cancer. Some physician recommend anal Pap smear (collect cells from anus) for those considered at risk of HPV related anal cancer. The test tell can tell if there are abnormal cells that mandate further investigations and intervention.  Not only that It is also important that your partner is tested and if positive, regular pelvic examinations and PAP tests are recommended since early detection of cancer equals better chance for cure.  Vaccination programs are available now for women who are tested negative and are very effective.  Unfortunate there is no current treatment to eradicate the virus but regular follow up and physical examination help identification and treatment of early lesions.  Hope you find this information useful. Best regards.\n\n",

I have been feeling something like a tingling stretchy feeling in the area I came in contact with (shaft of the penis) for the past 15 hours. This feeling comes and goes. Within 2 hours I washed the area with non-antibacterial soap and within 12 hours with anti-bacterial soap. 15 hours for shower, I just got out. I understand that it takes anywhere between 3 to 14 days for initial outbreak if you have contracted herpes.  I would appreciate any preventive advice and the medical chances I have at not getting herpes versus getting herpes.  Thanks\n\n",

    "title": "Re: STDs and Confidentiality",
    "content": "Hello -  While I am not knowlegeable at all on British domestic and tort law, let alone an expert on law in general, I can tell you this much: the male partner of a woman infected with chlamydia can contract the condition also, and the potential for damage (as well as propagating and/or spreading the disease) is even more subtle than for the female sufferer. Ethically speaking, since he is likely to be infected, he certainly should be told. This is my personal opinion based on ethical principles only. Legally it's difficult to say for certain whether he would have any grounds for action if not informed, and even if he is informed, depending on the status of the relationship, he may have (and take advantage of) legal recourse available to  him. If this is a concern, then an attorney should be  consulted, perhaps prior to informing him; however, to not inform him implies potential damage to his person from the disease, and if the marriage is shakey, it may be seen, legally, as vindictive to keep the information from him,  since it could permit others to become infected as well. Since the disease is often quite insidious early on, if one is unaware of having been exposed, this naturally increases the potential for damage.   Ethically I cannot see how witholding the information from one's husband could be defensible. Legally it is likely dangerous as well.  I hope this is helpful.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  Herpes and some STDs have, on rare occasions, been recorded as having been exchanged between certain types of monkeys and humans, but not most common domestic animals (dogs, cats, horses, etc.). Some diseases can be transmitted between species, but herpes apparently is pretty species specific, so has been, so far as I am aware, limited to human-monkey contact, and again, mostly only in the laboratory setting.  An animal  which licks a human's face (most likely a dog), would be extremely unlikely able to retransmit the virus to another human.   I hope this is helpful.\n\n",

She says that after anal sex there was some discomfort and that soon after she began wiping very roughly and I believe that was the reason for the bumps (but why would they appear so many weeks later?). But she now says that she stopped wiping roughly and there are now two more bumps above the anus around the \"crack\".   She seems to be convinced that it's herpes.

    "content": "Hi, I'm a 38 yr. old woman who has had genital herpes for 22 years. I have not had severe recurrent outbreaks until about 4-5 years ago. I have tried EVERY medication consistently and my body does not respond, the outbreaks continue. I have been tested for HIV and I am negative. My paps are completely normal. My blood work is normal. I am 5'6\", 128 lbs., eat healthy, and when I am not in severe pain, I exercise 3 to 4 times a week. The prognosis is that I am under a great deal of stress and until this is resolved, I will continue to have these outbreaks.  When I say outbreaks, I don't mean one tiny sore. It can be up to 10 or 12, with a fever, severe pain, and fatigue to the point of not being able to get out of bed. I have taken prozac for the stress/depression, but had to switch to wellbutrin since the prozac made me drowsy. The wellbutrin is marginal at best in aiding the depression. I continue to have outbreaks that last anywhere from 2-3 days, to 7-8 days, frequently.  I have recently moved to a new city and have been to 2 doctors who are reluctant to provide percocet for the pain, for fear of loosing their license. I have found that this is the only medication that relieves the pain and seems to \"numb\" the area. I am extremely faithful in taking the amount prescribed, nothing more. I'm assuming their reluctance is due to media attention of this drug but it makes it difficult for people who have a legitimate problem.  My question is this; is there something comparable to percocet that will ease the pain, that doctors will be willing to prescribe? I've tried Tylenol with codeine but it is not effective.   In conclusion, I believe in Divine healing, but until that arrives, I believe that we are guided to doctors that can help us through times of stress and discomfort. I am very discouraged. Frankly, I want to progress past this \"stressful\" point of my life and be free of all medications, but until that happens I need solution to my painful situation.  Thank you for your time,  Alice\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -   While there are a number of drugs comparable to percoset, these are generally not any longer the drugs of first choice for herpetic (or post-herpetic) pain. What is usually prescribed now is one of the neurlaleptic medications (gabapentin, pregabalin, etc.), which serve to block the pain rather than mask it. They can be very effective and while  they are often Schedule II drugs like percoset, etc., doctors aren't as slow to prescribe them.   In either case there is the  potential for abuse, and if the doctors you've seen are unwilling to prescribe anything, it is either because they are overly cautious or because there is something about your extremely long history that makes them uncomfortable with  prescribing opioids. It may be that they would be willing to try one of the nerve pain blocking meds instead, unless of course you've already gone that route. If so, then you'll have to find a pain specialist and probably enter into a medication \"contract\" with one.   I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

No change.  Did a yogurt douche + lactobacillus bacterica.  Great relief.  Today I douched with a 'yeast' infection specific formula and noticed that there is something significantly wrong with my vaginal area.  Previously I had felt a rough patch and then what felt like skin tag just inside my vagina wall.  Today when I looked, there was a bunch of extra skin surrounding my clitoris.  Is is the same color as my other skin and does not itch  Then when I opened my vagina as much as possible, I saw long, thin column-like growths.  Further inside the vaginal column felt rough.  I looked up HPV pictures and it does not look like warts.  I am very worried because the new outside growth truly looks like another interior set of lips and it is about to completely cover my clitoris.   I had a Pap smear 2.5 weeks ago and was normal.  I have had one sexual partner since then.  He says that he has no symptoms.  It has been about 2 weeks since any sexual contact.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -   This sounds like it is probably a skin irritation problem, but it could also be either of the other things you mention, which can sometimes develop as a result of a chronic skin irritation combined with less-than-ideal genital hygeine, which, for men, is more complicated or demanding than we sometimes realize. At any rate, while it sounds fairly benign, anything which goes on for an indefinite period is bound to cause some larger problem eventually, so as usual, my best advice to you is to be seen by a medical provider who can diagnose this precisely and prescribe the proper remedy.  Hope this is helpful. Please follow up with us here.\n\n",

    "content": "My whole thing started after i recieved oral sex.  Now i don't know if this has any relevance but im gonna throw it in.  there was a lot of teeth involved so much so that it actually caused small abrasions.  Now the first symptom were a rather linear looking series of about six slightly raised red bumps at the abrasion site.  I thought this was a normal reaction, well the day after now 2 days from the contact i noticed what apearred to be a broken blood vessel right at the eurethra hole. that has existed now for about 5 months its a vaugley circular unraised spot that has upon close inspection three slightly more red spots in a triangular formation. now about after a month the right upper forth of the raised area of the penis tip has grown what appear to be pearly penile papules or warts, since they have made no ground on the skin behind or infront of this raised area though i believe it is ppp. i still have the linear red bumps now as well but they go all the way around the raised area as well.  I have also noticed what i would call more of a pimple then a chanker i would not say that it looks like a sore and it is no than one of the small ppp looking things. it is ont he shaft infront of the circumsision scar.  The oddest of syptoms though is that about every 1-3 weeks a white head appears and gets no bigger than a white head is almost looks more like dried skin, which i usually out of ocd take off generally easily. now upon seeing these white dots which occured more frequently among the first month of infection i believed it to be hpv.  Then as the ppp like things devoloped i believed this even more.  But on further research ive found that this may very well be something else like corpus molluscum, according to these symptoms the oddest of which is the unraised red mark i still have no real good idea of what this could be.  if you can figure out what this is please tell me and if you could tell me of a way i could avoid showing my junk to a doctor please tell as well (ps upon eating a natural anti-biotic i believe i saw some improvment but this could all be a psychosomatic effect, i stopped because i can not eat taht much garlic a day)\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  The most common problem in this subject area is the reluctance of people to see a medical provider about the problem. This, combined with denial and delay, can cause very serious and unnecessary complications. I hope you will have these lesions examined in a clinical setting ASAP. There is no reasonable way at a distance to do anything more than guess, and your guesses are very educated ones which I would have made if you hadn't already made them. They still won't resolve the problem nor help you to avoid more serious potential problems. This really isn't worth allowing self-consciousnes to keep you from seeing a doctor. Trust me, medical people really are detached, professional and are seeing a medical problem, not the measure of your manhood, and they shouldn't be making any judgements about your behavior, either, although you can expect to get some reasonable advice about how to avoid this sort of thing. You are free to disregard that advice. But most of all you need to get past the self-consciousness about this and have it evaluated and, if necessary, treated. We here cannot engage in guessing about potentially serious medical conditions,  but can only direct you toward appropriate medical help. I hope you will be see if you haven't as yet.   Once you've done that, please do follow up with us here. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "I have been getting cold sores since before I was sexually active. I just noticed a red rash spot on my scrotum and then noticed 2 other spots that had a white-ish color on it. Also, i noticed that my right groin had a painfull lump in it and my head has been very sensitive to the touch.   I have a feeling that I may have genital herpes.  My question is this.  Since i am already infected with the HSV-1 (cold sores) does that make me already infected with HSV-2 (Genital herpes)?  Also, about a week ago I went to get an ultrasound on my testicles to check out what turned out to be a harmless cyst,   My second question is this.  Is it possible to have contracted the genital herpes from the ultrasound machine if someone had the virus and they used the machine on them and then me? They did not have any protective material on the ultrasound machine when they did my tes.  Please advise. Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, You do not automatically have Herpes Type 2 because you have Herpes Type 1.  Either type can be genital but type 1 is more commonly the oral variety.  People get genital HSV-1 by oral sex with someone who has this condition.  In other words you could give it to a partner.    It is highly unlikely you would contract HSV from medical equipment.  Even though you did not see protective materials, that does not mean they do not disinfect the equipment between use.  Also, it generally requires intimate exchange of body fluids to contract disease.  Try not to worry too much but you can have a doctor check you if you believe your symptoms are consistent with genital herpes.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -   To quickly answer your additional questions, first, yes, it is possible for herpes to not show up for years. This is one of the things about it which makes it very frustrating, as people have often totally forgotten about the past possible exposure.  Second, yes, herpes zoster can result in genital herpes, although naturally it more often causes oral herpes. But yes, one can acquire genital herpes that way, or even, by passing it to one's partner through kissing, eventually wind up being infected by one's own oral herpes zoster infection.   Hope this is helpful. Good luck to you.\n\n",

From the description it sounds like it could be herpes or it also could be primary syphillis, although if you've had syphillis three times already you'd probably be able to recognize that pretty quickly. You need to best examined and tested. With luck it is nothing more than a hygeine problem, which is far more common than anyone would imagine, but the description is enough of a concern to urge you to get to a doctor at once and find out.

    "content": "Hello -  Hopefully by now this problem has been treated and/or resolved. Still, it deserves a reply. I'm venturing far out of my specialty and catching up on unanswered questions, and this one is interesting.  I don't think, first of all, that this represents HPV. It certainly does deserve examination by a doctor, but it could well wind up with a referral to a dermatologitst. It also could be due to scabies, although you don't mention any itching or irritation. However, and believe me, you're not the only one I've said this to, picking at any lesion is rarely a good idea and exposes you to the risk of infection over and above whatever is going on there. These lesions look pretty innocent and are probably the result of some skin irritation or perhaps exposure to something to which your body is sensitive. It could also be, as I said before, due to something like scabies. By all means have it looked at by a medical provider if you haven't as yet, even if it has cleared up.   Hope this is helpful.

    "content": "Hello -  As I mentioned to the other poster with the same complaint, this sounds most like a hygeine issue, and again, please don't take offense at that suggestion; it is just that the area can be more prone to skin irritation and the formation of these little pustules than one would think, and you may need to devote more time (more frequently perhaps)  to cleaning the area. If that is  definitely not an issue, then yes, by all means the next step would be to see a dermatologist.   I hope this is helpful. Please do follow up with us here.\n\n",

    "title": "Rash and bumps on Penis",
    "content": "About four and half months ago I had shaved my scrotum and hadn't noticed anything abnormal. A few day later I started having some discomfort on my penis and noticed two large red spots on the verge of bleeding on the leftover foreskin. I should backup a bit and mention that I had a newborn at home who did not sleep for the fist few months without being rocked or bounced in our arms on a theraball (big rubber ball). My assumption was that the constant friction from bouncing, sweating and the new stubble from my shaving caused a blister or lesion/s to appear (the area were the bumps are now has always been more sensitive from rubbing and had more leftover foreskin that dangles loose). The lesions started off very swollen and very sensitive on the underside of my penis just below the head on the remaining loose bit of foreskin (I am circumcised). I had kept on bouncing on the theraball for the next week or so trying to minimize the rubbing between my penis and stubble on my scrotum but only aggravated the lesions more it seemed. I stopped bouncing and within a week the lumps or lesions went down in size drastically but did not disappear. The appearance seemed to be like a scar with the loose skin of the area seeming to have folds, when the skin is stretched out the surface feels raised and smooth like a chickenpox scar I have on my shoulder.  A few weeks after the lesions or bumps showed up I broke out in a body rash (Red skin and small bumps) that itched like you would not believe (maybe of no relation), this rash covered my arms chest stomach bum legs and genital area as well. After a few weeks of moisturizing and switching to gentle cleanser the rash seemed to clear up with the odd flare up on my scrotum and in a patch just between the head of my penis and remaining foreskin (this patch seems to have a mind of it's own being there one day and seeming to disappear the next). The rash seems to consist of tiny reddish Bumps a silvery tinge that doesn't itch too much or cause me pain although I do notice the patch if I have been sweating down there. I should also mention that I was wearing a polyester protective penis garment called the manhood to avoid more chaffing and it seemed to help with that but I have stopped wearing the garment and since then things started to shrink even more now.  The texture of the bumps changes from day to day and it would seem several times in one day. Sometimes the bump feels like loose skin and other times it feels like a semi hard lump that feels like soft scar tissue and the surface is dry to the touch. The bumps have never bled or released any fluids and seem to get better every day.  I have setup a site with some more recent pictures:  http://picasaweb.google.com/northernrob ... dNpqphwBEM    My questions are:  1) Is foreskin tissue more prone to injury and scarring than regular skin.  2) How long should this skin take to heal properly and the scar to be absorbed?  3) Do the rash and lesions look like anything to worry about?  4) Can a person develop an allergy to synthetic materials like polyester later on in life?  Thank you  NorthernRob\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Rash and bumps on Penis",
    "content": "Hello -  While it is difficult to say how long foreskin should take to fully heal, it is probably slightly more prone to injury than regular skin, since it has a slightly different composition and is not exposed to the elements on a regular basis.   The  photographs make the lesions look a great deal like the result of friction, which is certainly a possibility in this case. They of course could also be indicative of herpes, but given the course of the complaint it seems unlikely, whereas there was plenty of irritation potential.  Finally, yes, as with all allergies, polyester sensitivity can develop at any time in life. These things seem to be cumulative sometimes and at others, completely random, but there is no question allergies and sensitivites to most things can be acquired at any age.  Good luck, I hope you will bring this to the attention of a doctor (there is no substitute for real-time evaluation of these things, as uncomfortable as it may be for many people), and please do follow up with us here.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Single, painful blister two inches above penis",
    "content": "Hello -  Denial seems to be a big problem with STDs. While your description of the lesion makes it sound like a possible ingrown follicle, the fact that you've had unprotected sex recently makes it more likely to be either a symptom of a newly acquired STD or possibly a hygeine issue related to unprotected sex. This is not as unlikely as it sounds. There are some less publicized STDs which can cause a lot of discomfort, do some damage if not treated, and cause a lot of anxiety. This latter is especially important, since convincing one's self that unprotected sex is safe and thus the eventual medical complaint must not be related to it is in itself a dangerous and unnecessary diversion.  Get yourself seen by a physician, preferably while this lesion is still  present and visible. If it goes away, do not let this deter you from being seen, as this could be an early sign of something (perhaps primary syphillis) which could go dormant for a time. If treated, you radically reduce your chances for problems later on.  I hope you've already been seen, and do follow up with us here.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  These two bumps could represent some chronic irritation, even from the use of a condom. They also could be an atypical presentation of herpes. If they showed up spontaneously following protected sex they may well be due to a latex sensitivity or something else related to condom use. Whatever they are, when  something like this happens, although it is usually not serious, these bumps aren't supposed to be where they are, and should be clinically evaluated. If they go away shortly on their own you should still be seen by a doctor, because primary syphillis (I know, it's not likely -- but it happens) often only gives this much of a hint before it goes dormant. You don't need that to deal with later.   Again, it's probably something fairly simple,but even simple things can cause problems down the road. Just get seen, preferably while  the bumps are still visible. Good luck to you, and please follow up with us here.\n\n",

    "content": "Okay here is the situation. I thought i had a UTI. I got this tingling sensation right behind the head of my penis and an uncomfortable, almost aching pain in my urethra. I went to the doctor a couple days later and got tested for the UTI and it was negative. The nurse scheduled me an appoint for a week and a half later (still 4 days away) to get tested for \"Other Things\". Since then. I still get the tingling sensation every once in a while throughout the day, also with a feeling that even though i've urinated, I still have to go. Also, since then, i've been getting some weird aches in my abdominal area and genitals (testicals, shaft) nothing is consistant. it comes and goes. The most constant thing is the feeling that I still have to urinate. To further confuse me, yesterday I felt fine for the most part of the day, whereas today I feel like i have a constant pressure/aching pain/sensitivity in my bladder (not sure how to describe it) and its been present all day. Also, not sure if it is related, I had a pimple or something at the top of my pubic area, right where the waistline of my pants sits, and i popped it. This was a while ago. There is still a red dot there (maybe a 16th to an 8th of an inch) which i'm assuming is still there because its right under the waistband of my boxers and pants. It doesn't hurt and its not sensitive or anything. Its just there, like a reddish healing scar. And other stuff thats probably not related at all, i have some dry itchy skin on my chest next to one of my nipples, and my wrist hurts like hell and when i bend it a bump rises on the top of my wrist. Since a universe of information is available right here on the internet, i've been getting myself extremely paranoid and worked up. A little over 3 years ago i made the mistake of getting extremely drunk and having unprotected sex with someone i didn't know, but due to my high level of intoxication, i couldn't stay erect and probably minimal fluids exchanged since there was no ejaculation, but i wouldn't really know. And i've also been sexually inactive for the past 2 and a half years. So I tested negative for UTI, and i'm paranoid and extremely nervous. Any ideas what it could be?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello derakicksyou -  My best guess, since you came up negative for a UTI, is that this is possibly an occult prostatitis. Many of your symptoms would be consistent with an infection there, and they can become walled off. Usually they make the patient feel pretty sick, but not necessarily. The feeling of urge to urninate without anything happening is also common with prostatitis. While it is an unpleasant condition, it's not usually serious if treated promptly with antibiotics. I don't think the pimple had anything to do with  what you're having now, but for future  reference, it is probably better to let a pimple alone, except to wash the area with warm, soapy water and rinse thoroughly, as they can become infected if popped manually. Still, I  don't think that  would have anything to do with your other symptoms. Hopefully by now you've been checked for \"other things\" and maybe are feeling better. Please do follow up with us here.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I'm not familiar with the term \"water warts\" but since you said they are most common in children, I am guessing this may be molloscum contagiosum.  This is an outbreak of painless bumps from the poxvirus family.    There are a number of ways to catch this, including towels used by an infected person, clothing, toys, and sexual contact.  These can be treated but sex should be avoided while they are present due to the contagious nature of them.  If this is not the same condition and you are able to provide more information, let me know.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, You would be wise to see a doctor because there is a very good chance this is normal and bumps can be caused by clogged ducts, cysts, etc.  This is something we cannot verify from a distance like this.  By finding out the definite diagnosis you will likely be put at ease.  Whenever you are sexually active there is the possibility of infections but many of these can be treated effectively.    Douche does not help and it can interfere with your body's normal pH balance.  If you have yeast, you need an antifungal medication, available over-the-counter.  The milky discharge sounds normal.  But presence of odor and discharge that seems to have \"curds\" are more suspicious for infection, requiring treatment.  Once you are cleared for health, you should use latex condoms for sex until you are ready for a permanent relationship.  If you don't have access to a doctor, consider a family planning clinic that might be available.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I have been having unprotected sex with my boyfriend for about 5 months. I was tested shortly before we began dating and my results were completely clean.  He was tested shortly after and also came back all negative.  A few days ago, he came back from a month-long trip.  We had sex several times, and within less than 24 hours I began having painful urination, a pus-like discharge, and some bleeding.  Intercourse was slightly painful the second and third times. Everything I have found says that these are symptoms of gonorrhea.  I have not had sex with anyone besides him, and as far as I know, he has been faithful.  Even if he had cheated on me, would it be possible for the symptoms to appear in only 24 hours?  I realize that if he had cheated on me, I could have been infected before he even left, but it seems too much of a coincidence that the symptoms would appear immediately after sex.  It has been about 48 hours since these symptoms began. I have been taking cystex - an over the counter  UTI medicine.  The purulent discharge is lessening, as is the burning sensation, but I'm afraid the medicine is just covering up the symptoms. I am making an appt with my gyno ASAP, but until the, I'm freaking out.  Any ideas what this could be?\n\n",

Is it imperitive that i get this looked at? i Would greatly prefer my family dossent know about this and im sure seeing a doctor for it would lead to me having to fill them in on it. Is there any over the counter way i can battle the wart? i started taking Folic Acid and drinking alot of orange juice. Any Advice? also my girlfriend has had all of her shotts of guardasil as of 2 weeks ago - Does this meen she is immune to warts? or coud she develope them from me? currently i don't know if i should let her give me oral sex or not please help\n\n",

    "title": "Re: HPV Wart? Options? advice?",
    "content": "Hello, You said your girlfriend has known HPV infection and she just completed the HPV vaccination so they would have been doing this to protect her from some of the other forms of HPV (there are 130 identified variations) since it is too late to protect her from the one she already has acquired.  30 to 40 types are transmitted sexually.  The vaccine protects against four types - those most commonly known to cause cancer in women.    So, if you have already been infected by her, the vaccine won't protect you from genital warts.   I know of no treatment available over-the-counter.  The doctor can offer several treatment options.  Patient confidentiality is standard so your parents would not need to know of your visit.  If you are afraid due to small town familiarity, see another doctor in another area.  If the doctor is a family friend, he/she should still maintain confidentiality.  It never hurts to remind the staff that you want to be sure nothing is mailed to your parents' home if you feel they would open your mail.  Most physicians mark the envelope confidential but I realize this can raise questions.  Perhaps scheduling a routine physical exam would be the safest course, then you can tell them what you are doing without causing alarm.  Let them know you want to be sure you are current on all your potential vaccines such as tetanus and you want to verify your overall health status.  Having been sexually active it is always wise to be checked for sexually transmitted infections.    Best wishes\n\n",

We have been together for over 2 years now and she has not had an outbreak since the first one or two.

We are getting married in a week or so and I am curious about the best way to handle this issue with my soon-to-be wife.  Even though I will be managomous with her, I still do not like the idea of risking getting Herpes by not using condoms.  It's a major kink in our relationship having to use them with \"my wife\" if you catch my drift.  Is there anything out there that would alow me to not use condoms and still keep me out of risk?

    "content": "Hello, Congratulations on your upcoming marriage.  I can understand your concern and I'm sorry this has to put a damper on your happiness in any way. This is one of the hardest issues a couple may face that is more psychologically damaging than physically.   I would like to refer you to a US FDA site that handles this topic very well.  http://www.fda.gov/Fdac/features/2002/202_herp.html There are some decisions you need to make but it is possible you may be able to take some cautious risks with your wife taking antiviral medications and avoiding sexual relations when she has outbreaks.  Latex condoms will reduce your risk but you may opt to do without them and take your chances because of the relationship.  Nobody can tell you what risks you should take.  Having sex outside a monogamous relationship with a non-infected person is the only sure way to avoid these diseases.    Herpes is extremely common, not life-threatening and manageable.  But I won't deny the distress it causes people.  Support group participation can sometimes help people to learn to cope and adapt.  As others discuss how they have managed their disease, you may get ideas for your own marriage.    If you decide you just can't risk doing without a condom, and pregnancy is desired, your only real option would be an artificial reproductive technology such as artificial insemination, using your sperm.  If you do choose to have sexual intercourse without a barrier, be sure she is not having an outbreak at that time.  This will reduce your risk.  Often the frequency of outbreaks diminish quite a bit over time - frequent at the beginning, less later one.  We don't actually know the reason for this.  Good luck to you both.  I hope you find great joy and happiness in spite of this hurdle.  There is much to be gained from a good marriage.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  In the last month I have some genital concerns. It started with some thick discharge, more than normal but otherwise normal, which became dry and stuck to my labia, resulting in a wound. I had pain for a few days while this healed, and tried wearing pantyliners to prevent any further sticking, but even they seemed to get in the wrong spots and irritate me. Then a week later the area became very itchy and sore, and when my husband and I looked at it, there were three red, raw, angry looking patches less than 1 cm in diameter inside the labia majora and on the labia minora. I tried treating this with an over-the-counter yeast infection kit, and I applied some cream that I have which includes cortisone, an anti-fungal and an antibacterial agent, and it went away in a few days. Then I had my period and I used tampons throughout, trying to minimize any discharge. Then I noticed that the angry spot on the labia minora was still there, except it seemed a bit scabby and quite tender, so I applied polysporin with a topical anaesthetic. Afterwards I was quite dry for a week or so and I thought I had fixed the problem, as the spot was less and less sore. I continued to apply polysporin until it healed. Two days ago I had copious discharge but it was clear, so I wondered if maybe I was ovulating. Last night my husband and I had sex, and today, he has a little rash on his penis, and he is complaining that it is quite itchy. I don't know if this is related, but we both, and our two-year-old daughter, have been sick with a cold off and on for about three weeks, and he has been fighting pink-eye (I did not have any eye symptoms). What is going on with us? Do you think there is an STD potentially involved? (not sure where we would have got it, unless I had it before we were together, since 2001?)\n\n",

Behcet's disease is rare in the U.S. but this can also result in sores on the vulva.  The fact that your husband also has symptoms is suggestive of an infectious process as opposed to friction soreness however.  Some people have found relief with acidophilus and or vagisil ointment.  You can try these once you are convinced there is no bacterial or yeast cause that needs treatment.    It is possible you could have had a latent herpes infection that did not show up until now but that perhaps you were exposed to in the remote past.    Best to get it checked out. Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "My name is Brad and I am 24 years old.  About 2 and a half years ago, my (ex)girlfriend admitted to cheating on me after I complained to her of pain during urination, slight clear discharge from penis, and swelling of and painful testicles. I went and got tested of ALL STD's and I was diagnosed with Chlamydia about 2 and a half years ago.  I was treated with Doxycycline administered for 2 weeks.  I did not have sexual activity during this time.  Although the discharge from the penis went away, all of my other symptoms (painful testicles, smelly urination, frequent urination, and pain in my lower back) remained.  Approximately 2 months with no relief from these symptoms I returned to my doctor who referred me to a urologist.  I went to the urologist and he took a urine sample and examined my penis and testicles.  Before he even had time to test my urine, if in fact that was his plan, he simply said everything looked fine and that most guys that have anything wrong with their penis or areas surrounding it get very paranoid and tend to think something is still wrong.  About a year later, after determining that I am certainly not just imagining these symptoms I went to the Health Department (because I am no longer covered by any insurance) and told them that I have had Chlamydia that has not gone away.  They gave me 4-6 pills (I don't remember exactly how many) and I took them all there in front of them.  The symptoms still never went away.  Today it has been almost 3 years since I first contracted Chlamydia.  I still have NO INSURANCE and simply CANNOT AFFORD to go back to the doctor (especially since the last time I spent the money they did absolutely nothing but tell me it was in my head).  I assure you that this is not the case - despite the pain in my lower left back at certain times, pain in my testicles constantly, burning/frequent urination periodically - my urine is smelly and dark.  The only question in my mind is if this is still Chlamydia or if the Chlamydia is gone but I waited too long to treat it and has now caused some other infection.  Or that both of these circumstances are correct.  I do not know what to do at all.  Should I go back to the health department and get treated for Chlamydia again?  I could probably afford the doctor visit if it was just going to be ONE and I had faith that they would know what was wrong with me instead of not trusting anything that I say.  I NEED this to be gone and am desperate.  It is a daily problem.  I cant hardly participate in any athletics or running because my testicles hurt too badly.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  Do you have any idea what this could be? Is there any other way to test for Chlamydia than the swab which almost made me pass out last time it was inserted into my penis? Can Chlamydia turn into anything else? I was tested for all other STD's before and am certain it is not a different STD. Please help.  -Brad\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It is possible to diagnose chlamydia through a urine sample as well as by swabbing but if you see someone at a STD clinic, such as may be offered with the health department, you will have to submit to whichever method they use there.    Chlamydia is an easy infection to treat so I do not suspect this is still present unless you have been re-infected (always a possibility).  If you took the antibiotics as prescribed and as you say, you should be fine that way.  Untreated chlamydia does come with complications, but treated appropriately, I doubt your symptoms are related to this past disease, especially since you had follow up care with a urologist who found no long-term damage.  I suggest you see a doctor again if you are still having symptoms but it is possible that an exam alone will reveal nothing more than you have already learned.  If additional testing is indicated the cost will go up and there is no guarantee you will find an answer or cure to your symptoms.  If you have been screened and still found to have no urinary-related health problem, it might be worthwhile to see a therapist at a mental health clinic.  If you are having these lingering doubts, you might be able to get a handle on it.  The mind is very powerful and you probably feel like you have been dealt a low blow, having contracted this illness in the past.  Sexuality is also a very sensitive subject, so having felt violated in this way (or guilty that your own sexual activity led to infection) may cause your body to react physically to the psychological trauma.  Your community may have a mental health agency that uses a sliding fee schedule.  Ask your employer if they offer an Employee Assistance Program which provides life assistance counseling, often at no cost to the employee.  For anyone without health insurance I recommend a health savings account.  Consider that if you had insurance you would have to pay monthly premiums for the benefit.  Put as much as you can into savings, earmarked for health care, just as if you were paying the premiums and think of it the same way - money you would have had to put out if you were insured.  This is not enough to be comprehensive medical coverage but it can at least allow you to see a doctor when you need to and in some people, the costs will be less.  For instance if you only need to see a doctor once every six months, your cash price may be less than your premiums for insurance would have been.  If it means picking up an extra part-time job to afford to take care of your health, it might be worth it.    Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I recently went through a month-long illness. Symptoms included persistent fever, head ache, achy-ness (as if I had the flu), lack of energy and a cough that was unbearable. These symptoms lasted about 3 weeks and as they relented, new symptoms emerged.  They included, tingling from the waist down. Hot spots or burning spots on my skin from the waist down. Cramps in my calves and feet. A severe urinary tract infection and finally a bump at the base of my penis.   The bump eventually burst and stayed open and wet for about a week, eventually it spread to two more bumps appearing right beside it, at the base of my penis.  At this point I went to the clinic. They took a sample of the pus in the open bump and a week later they called to let me know that I have Herpes 2.  My wife assures me that she has been faithful and I haven't been with anyone in any type of sexual manner since before her and I were married.  My question is, is it POSSIBLE this is really Herpes Zoster, since my immune system was under a serious strain? I did have chicken pox when I was a child.   If not, can the Herpes 2 strain be carried, without a flare-up for 8+ years?  Thank you for any and all answers. I'm sorry for being long-winded but it's been my experience that Doctors appreciate details.  222\n\n",

    "content": "Hello 222,  Herpes Zoster (Shingles) is more properly known as Varicella Zoster because it is actually caused by the varicella virus, as opposed to the herpes simplex virus.  They are in the same family (the herpes virus family) but are distinct viruses.  So, if the culture grew the Herpes simplex 2 virus this would not be consistent with shingles.  HSV2 can stay dormant for vary long periods of time, particularly if the immune system is healthy.  When the immune system is suppressed (such as during illnesses, stress, etc.) it can allow the virus to reactivate causing an outbreak.  I cannot comment specifically on the possibility of dormancy for eight years in your case since there really is not a specific way to identify when infection occurred.  Best wishes.\n\n",

He thinks it might be HPV, viral warts and has recommended me to see a skin specialist. In the mean time, he prescribed a cream called \"Aldera\" (hope I have the name right) Now I have done a little research on my own and have found out that there is no approved test for Men to determine if you have the HPV or not.

    "content": "Hello, Skin tags are not caused by sex and are just a benign skin condition.  The Aldera is a good option for treating the warts.  It takes only a tiny amount but you must use it daily for several weeks as directed.    It is possible it could be molluscum contagiosum if not HPV.  Either of these conditions can go away on their own but you have nothing to lose with the treatment that is likely to expedite the improvement.  As for diagnosis, in many cases the doctor has to use his own judgment based on experience.  Lab testing is a relatively new phenomenon to help in diagnosis but it is not yet to the point that we can find every disease through testing. Medicine is a combination science and art.  The doctor relies on intuition along with his medical education.  Good luck.\n\n",

This would be too early for herpes and most infectious diseases, all of which have an incubation period during which the infection grows in the new host.  More likely this is some type of allergic reaction or contact dermatitis and is probably not serious.  If it doesn't heal on its own you should see a dermatologist.  You may try an antihistamine such as Benadryl to see if it helps.  Hydrocortisone ointment might also help if you are not allergic to it, but apply sparingly and avoid the eyes.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I doubt this is herpes if you have not been sexually active.  Cold sores are caused by herpes type 1 but in order for you to get this in the genital region, it would require sexual activity with someone who has the herpes virus, coming into contact with your genitals (i.e. their oral herpes making contact with your genitalia).    Canker sores are not caused by the herpes virus.  My guess is your doctor prescribed an antiviral that would be helpful in getting your own immune system working against whatever this is.  It is nonspecific, meaning in triggering your immune system, it doesn't matter what the offending germ is.  Since the antibacterial agents didn't work, I believe the doctor suspects it could be viral, so an antiviral agent might be effective.  I assume the doctor did not find evidence of a yeast infection.  Keep in mind that anxiety and stress can cause or exacerbate physical conditions so working at this (stress reduction) may also be helpful.     Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "About two months ago I had unprotected sex with a ex-girlfriend. One month later (a month ago) she began dating and began a sexual relationship with another man. Last week he began filling a burn whil urinating and went to the local clinic and was diagnoised with NGU. NGU is commonly caused by Chlamydia bacteria. He is still waiting test results for Chlamydia. At this time my ex-girl friend went and was tested and all results came back negative. She was clean. She says she has suspicions about his faithfulness from the beginning and suspects he may have been still sexually active with a former girl friend of his who he still openly communicated with. He blames he contracted whatever he has on my ex claiming he was recently tested and was clean and only had sex with her sense. But she has been tested clean. He was also told NGU may have been caused by a track infection, or sense he is uncircumcized that may have caused a bacterial infection, or the lubricants they used may have caused the infection. From what I have written here im at possible risk of chlamydia or NGU. I have no syptoms.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Actually most women who are infected with gonorrhea have no symptoms at all.  This is why we need to get regular exams, especially if sexually active.  If your friend has been monogamous with this man, chances are he is infected and who started it is hard to determine if either of them were sexually active with others in the past or even the present.  The most important thing is to get treatment and to be honest about sexual partners so they can be notified of the possibility and treated as well.  It is selfish to avoid naming a possible victim since damage can occur without symptoms so responsible sexual activity includes disclosing to local health agencies all potentially infected partners.  They will see to it the people are contacted, tested and treated.  Thank you for your concern for your friend.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 20 year old, going on 21 this July. I've only had intercoarse once, long ago, it was a mistake. I've tried, and tried to deal with the idea of being touched to get myself checked out. Finally, this January I did. I checked everything. I don't have HIV. I got a papsmear, I phoned them not long ago and they said that 'no news is good news. Your results are in and there is no tab signifying a call back.' Thusly, no abnormal pap.  Now, I'm a fairly healthy person. Almost never get sick. Extremely strong immune system. My periods have always been easy going. Usually, its mentally troubling when I am PMSing such as, consentration, and things like that. I've never experienced pelvic pain or things like this much ever in my life.  After my first pap, my period was not so well. I hear this is normal that after your paps your periods are a little worse. They didn't have enough sample so I had to go again. That was fine, I did so. Between second last period and my last period I had pain in my pelvic region, burning, itching, but no pain while I am urinating, or anything else that would identify as a yeast infection. My period was fine. Now, its been almost five days sense my period is done. Two days later I began to feel pain again. Not enything excrutiating, but pain enough to be felt, or rather irritating. Mostly on the right side of my lower pelvis right near the crease of my thigh. However, I also experience my entire lower pelvice area sort of throbbing or.. being irritating for lack of better words. I've had my inner thighs swell, and sometimes just below my bellybutton will cramp. However, usually its lower, and it stings and somtimes stabs. Also, I experience tightness as well. Furthermore, the skin around my vagina is sometimes burning and itchy-- again though, no further sighns of a yeast infection.  My question is, is this post stress? Is this my body still dealing with the shock and discomfort of the pap? Is it possible they made a mistake and I do have an abnormal (its rare, I am aware. They more commonly mistake you to have something than not)?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I doubt you have anything infectious that they missed with the exam.  It sounds like they were quite thorough, having you repeat to be sure of adequate samples.    It is also difficult to say if it is stress related as people respond differently to stress and physical symptoms is one way.  There are many organs in the abdomen so the symptoms you have could be related to a number of them.  It is possible you could have a urinary tract infection.  Some people get these without typical symptoms.  You could also have something like irritable bowel syndrome, involving the bowel.  Uterine-related concerns could include endometriosis - something that is not diagnosed through a pelvic exam and pap.  If the pain does not resolve soon, you do need to go back to your doctor.    If your symptoms get worse, sharp and stabbing, you get light-headed, have fever, the abdomen becomes rigid, tender and hard, you get constipated or have nausea you should get help right away.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I have went to the doctor and I am now waiting on my results.  The dermatoligist said the wart on the outside of my lower lip looked like something else other than a wart.  Is it possible to have a wart outside of your genital area and it not be genital warts or HPV, just a plain wart?  I read that warts tend to break out in moist areas.  I have also had a pap smear, waiting on that result too.  I am still worried even though the doctor said everything looked clear.  I have had a pap smear every year for the past 6 years, all clear.  I have been researching HPV to try to get some answers and it honestly scares me to death even though it doesn't seem to be considered a deadly virus.  Hopefully, you can tell me something good. Thank you\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  The types of HPV that cause genital warts are usually different from those causing warts on other body parts, such as the hands.   it can be hard to tell the difference between a wart and normal bumps on the genital area as well.  There are cysts and infected follicles that occur in the genital area.  It is possible to have another type of wart show up there.  I'm sure your doctor will be able to give you more definitive answers when the lab results are in.    Good luck with this.\n\n",

    "content": "This \"thing\" is located on my crotch area on the left side, right inside the line where brief underwear are, and towards the top of where the bulk of public hair stops growing.

It doesn't seem to be growing or getting smaller and has been around for some time (don't remember exactly, but months surely).  It is red, and the only reason it worries me (besides the fact that it hasn't gone away) is no there are two smaller bumps (tiny) that somewhat resemble it, only not as irregularly shaped and are about a half an inch to to an inch away.  At first I just assumed that it was a zit or ingrown hair like I've had before, but this thing hasn't gone anywhere.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: STD Transmission from Toliet Seat",
    "content": "Hello, Almost all sexually transmitted infections cannot survive outside the environment of mucous membranes in the body, so it is considered impossible to contract one by sitting on public toilet seats. Viral causes of STIs (as with HIV) cannot survive for long outside the human body either, so generally die quickly on surfaces like toilet seats.    It would require the perfect meshing of factors for anything to survive and infect another person.  One of those factors would be an open sore on your buttocks which might come in contact with some infected mucus and that would have to have been deposited immediately before you came in contact with it.  The National Women\u2019s Health Information Center states that, in addition to sexual contact, trichomoniasis can be picked up from contact with damp or moist objects such as toilet seats, if the genital area is in contact with the damp object. But toilet seats do not provide the ideal environment for parasites to live or reproduce. And to become infected, your genital area would have to come in contact with the parasite while it is still on the toilet seat.  Because this scenario is so unlikely, the US government\u2019s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that STIs, including syphilis, HPV, and HIV, cannot be transmitted via toilet seats.   In light of this information it is reasonable to be sure to wipe off the public toilet seat before sitting on it to be sure there is no dampness or use a paper liner.  But the likelihood of contracting a sexually transmitted disease this way is extremely slim.  It is highly likely however with sexual encounters so you should put your greatest protective efforts there.  This means abstaining from sex or doing it only with a monogamous partner who is not infected.  Using a condom will also reduce your risk.  It is also recommended that you get all available vaccines such as Hepatitis and for women HPV since these can also prevent serious and life-long infections.  I hope this answers your questions.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Tivo12,  This is a bit difficult to interpret.  Generally, by this point, if one truly did have herpes there would be expected to be detectable antibodies to the virus.  However, if the viral culture grew the virus it is difficult to dismiss its presence.  I would recommend you have the viral culture repeated to see if it is still positive.  If it is negative, it is likely that you do not have herpes.  If the culture is positive I would tend to think the lesion is due to herpes but I cannot explain why you would not have the antibodies.  If there is continued question about the spot it may be helpful to see a dermatologist to get a skin expert opinion about it.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,   For quite some time, i've been concerned that i may have genital warts.  Over the course of a couple years, i've visited several general care physicians, urgent-care doctors, as well as dermatologists.  All have assured me that i don't have genital warts, and rather they were fordyce spots and natural penile bumps.   Finally, i had convinced myself that i was just paranoid.  Recently, i noticed the occurrence of more bumps, this time further up the penis shaft than before.  I had decided use apple cider vinegar against them to see the results, as i had read many people have had success with that.  I was aware that it may turn other natural bumps white as well as warts, but i was greatly concerned to see that it had.  i then began soaking cotton balls in an attempt to self treat.  Some bumps eventually discolored, and one eventually removed itself in the shower.  there was a slight flesh appearance where it once was.  i continued using the ACV, only until it severely burned the skin on my penis and scrotum.  i immediately, and embarrassedly, saw a doctor.  The doctor told me that they did not appear to be warts, but rather just natural changes in the skin.  However, i'm still curious that the bumps would turn black and potentially \"burn\" off, if you will.  make no doubt about it, i won't be applying ACV to my skin anytime soon, as the temporary burns are rather unsightly.  I know now how silly i was to self diagnose and treat, and I won't be making that mistake again, nor would i suggest to anybody reading this post.  However, i would very much appreciate any insight to this matter from a doctor on this site.  Does it make sense that such bumps could discolor as such if they weren't warts?  I know i may sound paranoid, but i am deeply concerned about my sexual health and i've always been cautious.  i'd really like to lay this to rest, as it is somewhat tearing me apart.  thank you in advance for any information you can offer.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Marco3772,   I would tend to agree with your urologist.  Antibodies can remain positive even after infections resolve.  I am not familiar with the use of interleukin in chlamydial testing.  The PCR studies are the generally accepted tests for chlamydial infection.   Additionally, the antibiotics for chlamydia are very effective.  As long as you took them as prescribed the infection should have cleared without any problems.  This does not mean that reinfection is not possible though.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello!  My partner and I have been together for over one year now.  About 5 months ago, he developed flaky, scaly skin on his penis after sex.  It was diagnosed as a Yeast Infection.  We both used over-the-counter ointment and it went away.  But then we had sex again, and it reoccured.  Now, after sex, we both have itchy and irritated genitals.  I had a Pap smear which turned out normal but an HPV test which came back positive.  All other STD tests came back negative.    As of late, we had sex and his itchiness was so severe that it caused an abrasion which scabbed over.  Also, almost every time we have intercourse, he develops  red patches on both the base and the head of the penis.  It takes about a week for these to heal.  I also have severe itching and soreness after intercourse.   This has been occurring for over 6 months now.  It has recently become more severe.  Can this be herpes?  Please help, this is causing such stress on our relationship.  I also should mention that I am 4 months pregnant and have been experiencing reoccurring yeast infections.  THANK YOU!\n\n",

This does sound like a reoccurring yeast infection problem which would be less concerning if you were not pregnant. Yeast infections in pregnancy have been linked to premature birth and infections in utero. This would warrant a call to your obstetrical team so they may be able to make the best decision for the care of you and your unborn child. Best of luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I am a 24 year old male, I am currently on no medication, I have been previously diagnosed with herpes type 2. I have had these bumps now for atleast 3 years now (see links to pictures below), I at first thought they were herpes related but this dosen't fit the herpes profile that they would have stayed so long, I am thinking maybe they are HPV? Although they don't fit this profile either. I am wondering if maybe I have MC? Or maybe they are caused by irrtation from the fact that I have suffered long term from thrush with out treatment? Also I was wanting to know can females contract MC? What symptoms do they show? And what negative effects does MC have on females\\males? Also I would like to mention that my problem looks almost identical to the one disscussed in the following post, in your reply to this you mentioned that it might be fungal,would the application of canestan solve this?  (the above mentioned post) Flesh color bumps on penis head - skin wrinkled, pinchable by gu33st on Sat Nov 17, 2007 2:05 am  1. Age - 21  2. Male  3. Past diagnosis: Natural Occurrence ?  4. Past surgeries: None  5. Family history: None  6. Current medications: None   I have this for 2 1/5 years, flesh color bumps on penis head - pen head size, skin is wrinkled, few pinchable around head.  It is totally different from natural occurrence of wrinkles after shower or hair bumps which my doc was pointing at in first place.  I took Gen-Fluconazole and Lamisil but they didn't help.  Pics: http://www.freewebs.com/gu33st/index.htm What does this look like to you, so I can get tested.  Thank You    And here is the link to my pistures also, http://www.freewebs.com/thehotlistparty ... ctures.htm  please look at them, I think maybe that they will help you? I must say though that they are causing me no discomfort, pain or anything like that, my main concern is that I don't have an std I am unaware of and pass it on unexpectedly to a sexual partner! I must mention also that I have had numerous blood screens for std's since the occurance of the bumps and continually tested positive only to HSV-2 and negative to hpv, chlamydia, syphlis,HIV ect. does this mean that all of these can be ruled out as a cause? I really don't want to give a girl HPV, for obvious reasons! Thanks again!  Kind Regards Un_lucky\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Bumps on penis head. Herpes, MC, HPV or another STD?",
    "content": "Hello Un_lucky,  Based on the pictures, these do not appear to be herpes or HPV lesions.  Herpes lesion, as you probably know, tend to start like a blister then crust over.  HPV lesions look like a typical wart that one would get on the hand, although the strain of HPV that affects the hand does not affect the genital region.  Molluscum contagiousum is a virus that causes small bumps about 1-2mm in size that classically have a central dimple in them.  The virus is spread by skin to skin contact and can be passed from man to woman as well as woman to man.  It is not a particularly dangerous virus.  It causes the bumps and that's about it in healthy, immunocompetent individuals.  The pictures you posted do not look to me like MC bumps but it is hard for me to be sure without direct evaluation.  I suspect that what you are seeing is simply a normal variation of penile skin that can have some small bumps on it.  I would recommend you have your doctor take a look at this when you're in the office next just to be sure, though, since the limitations of the internet prevent a proper exam/diagnosis.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "What is the risk of contracting any STD's from the following activities:  (1) Male fingering female vagina. I am asking because I understand that some STD's (herpes) can be transmitted by skin-to-skin contact with the genitals. If a male fingers the female there is skin contact, though not genital contact. What is the risk?  (2) Nipple Sucking: I heard mothers who breast feed can transmit some STD's to their child. Is there any risk of contract anything when sucking the nipples of woman who is not pregnant and hasnt recently had a child?  (3) Protected Oral Sex: If a male wears a condom when recieving oral sex does this elminate any risk of transmission? I know that condoms are entirely fool proof during vaginal or anal intercourse, but are they fool proof during oral sex?   Thank you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: activities with STD risk?",
    "content": "Hello PepperK  These are good questions.  I'll address each separately. 1) The risk of spread of STD's by hand to genital contact is very, very low.  Often the one that is asked about is warts.  Warts on the hand are not transmitted to the genital tract because the strain of virus that infects the hands is not the same as the one that infects the genital tract.  2) Similarly, the risk of transmitting STD's from mouth to nipple contact is also very low.  Mothers and babies can be coinfected with a yeast infection where the baby can get a yeast infection of the mouth that can be spread to the nipples of the mother.  This really is about the only infection that transmits this way.  I should point out that some STD's can be spread from the genital tract to the mouth and vice versa, in particular, gonorrhea and chlamydia can infect both regions.  3) Using a condom for oral sex does decrease the risk of spreading STD's.  However, it is NOT 100% effective.  The condom covers the skin of the penis but does not cover all the skin of the genital region so some infectious contact may still occur.  Similarly, using condoms during vaginal or anal sex is NOT 100% effective at preventing pregnancy or STD's.  Condoms can break or slip off and, again, do not cover the entire genital region so some STD's can still be transmitted.  Condoms do cut down dramatically (nearly 100% but not quite) on the risk of pregnancy and STD's, though, and are probably the best protection against both pregnancy and STD's available.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello. About a month and a half ago, I had protected sex with someone who said she was STD free three or four times. About 2 weeks (possibly a day or two more) a red spot about the size of a ladybug appeared on the head of my penis. After about 2 weeks, it went away. Recently, a rash appeared on the head of my penis that is sometimes itchy, sometimes slightly painful (mild discomfort or irritation). After a heavy \"making out\" session with my girlfriend, which included lots of clothes on rubbing and pushing, the rash got worse and there is a painful area right below the head of my penis (circumcised) that is somewhat moist (if I press a dry finger to it, my finger has a VERY small amount of liquid on it when I take it away). A few days ago, the skin got very dry and flaky around the head, and was more itchy then. The rash comes and goes (has been for about 2 weeks), any ideas on what it could possibly be? I plan on setting up an appointment with the local PP clinic tomorrow. Thank you!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Helpme18,  If these are truly blisters then herpes must be a consideration.  It would be unusual for a person to contract genital herpes without sexual contact.  Transmission from hand touching would be very difficult (though possible if a person had a cold sore or other herpes lesion that they had just touched then touched the penis immediately after-this would be pretty rare though since the virus does not survive well on the skin).    If these are not true blisters but instead are small lumps there are many more possibilities.  These would include a bump from a virus called molluscum contagiosum.  These bumps are usually about 2 mm in size and have a central dimple.  They may also be fordyce spots.  These are normal findings on the penis shaft.    If these spots continue I would suggest you have your doctor evaluate these when you are in next for a check up.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "With the central dimple, these are most likely a bump from a virus called molluscum contagiosum.  These bumps will ultimately go away on their own but it may take a few years.  They can also be treated by your doctor with treatments similar to wart removal treatments.  I am not sure if over-the-counter wart removers would work on these as I've never tried.  I would recommend seeing a doctor about these the next time you are in the office just to be sure that this is what is going on.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Bamagirl66,  It would be difficult to contract a vaginal infection from oral contact.  I suspect that your symptoms are due to something else.  I would recommend you see a gynecologist for an examination to help see what may be going on.  There are a few non-STD infections that can occur without sexual contact.  Regarding how long it takes for an STD to cause long-term complications, this is a bit variable.  In some girls they may develop rapidly (over the course of several weeks or months).  Others may not develop chronic problems for much longer.  Things that increase risk include repeated infection, more severe infections (such as pelvic inflammatory disease) and prolonged infection without treatment.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The activities you describe carry an almost impossible risk of transmission of sexual diseases. Most diseases are transmitted through deep bodily fluids - semen, blood, vaginal secretions; not saliva.  Skin is a good barrier as well so if no breaks in the skin, you will not get something from skin to skin contact.  I would not be alarmed and there would be nothing you could do after the fact if you did have intercourse except wait for testing to confirm any disease.  If you engage in more serious sexual relations I would recommend consistent latex condom use to decrease your risk.  It is not worth the chance you might be taking in casual sex.  Shortsightedness there can result in a lifetime of regret since some diseases are not curable.  Best wishes.\n\n",

The other possibility is that your initial sore was due to a blocked gland or pore that became mildly infected.    If you redevelop a lesion I would recommend you have it evaluated to determine if this is herpes.  There is also a blood test for antibodies against the herpes virus that can be done to help determine if an infection is present.  Best wishes.\n\n",

The strains that cause warts on the hand (usually types 1 and 2) are not the type that cause genital warts (usually types 6 and 8).

    "content": "Hi, It sounds like some good may come of this experience if your New Year's resolutions include changing your drinking behavior.  Congratulations!  Licking the chest would be a very unlikely way to transfer herpes but as you know, drinking can lower your inhibitions and next time the activity could be much more dangerous.  Herpes is transmitted through bodily fluids with oral or genital interaction involved.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, There are many causes for pain associated with intercourse.  Some reasons include:     * Vaginal dryness     * Side effects of drugs      * An allergic reaction to clothing, spermicides or douches     * Endometriosis     * Inflammation of the area surrounding the vaginal opening, called vulvar vestibulitis     * Skin diseases affecting the vaginal area     * Urinary tract infections,  yeast infections, or sexually transmitted diseases     * Psychological trauma, perhaps resulting from sexual abuse or trauma in the past  I would recommend an exam.  Give your doctor your complete history, including psychological trauma.  There are treatment options but it is important to first determine the cause of the problem and an exam would be the place to start.    Best wishes.\n\n",

I would recommend you discuss this with your gynecologist to see if there are any signs that there may be an issue.  It is unlikely that your son will have problems.  Chlamydia transferred to a newborn via birth typically will cause an eye infection or pneumonia.  It does not cause genital infections.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I can touch all 3 scabs and u can definitely tell they are raised from the skin, it doesnt hurt to tough either.  I have never seen anything like it on myself. Please Help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Mroogman,  It's a little hard to say for sure.  What you are describing could be herpes; however, herpes tend to be somewhat painful.  Herpes lesions often start as a blister then scab over.  You may also be seeing some blocked pores that have become inflamed.    The best way to find out is to have your doctor take a look when you have these bumps.  Also, if STD's are possible I would suggest you be tested fully for them because many STD's are often asymptomatic.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi again,  You are correct that pearly penile papules generally occur at the base of the head of the penis (termed the corona).  Near the frenulum the corona moves upward so the spots may still occur in this area.  They do not generally appear higher than the corona, though.  If your spots are higher than this, they probably aren't due to pearly penile papules.  They may also be some areas where the pores of the skin have become blocked.  If the bumps have a central dimple they may be due to a virus called molluscum contagiosum.  This virus is often thought of as an STD; however, it is spread by skin contact so it can be transmitted by hand contact unrelated to sex.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Eks67,  There are several possibilities regarding this.  It may be an irritation from excess moisture (such as from sweating) that has been irritated by friction.  It may also be a clogged skin pore that has become infected.  It doesn't sound particularly like an STD but this would be a remote possibility.  Ringworm (a fungal infection) can affect skin basically anywhere so it may be that you now have a small area of infection causing your symptoms.  I'd recommend you see your doctor to have this evaluated.  Often, these types of issues can be easily diagnosed by having a direct visual exam.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I would be very grateful if you could read this and tell me in your opinion what the symptoms point to, My doctor didn't know. I'm getting tested tomorrow & don't think its HSV, it doesn't look like any pictures I've found of HSV/HPV. Here goes, (PS: the images are cropped,not very graphic)  6 days ago I noticed what looked like a mosquito bite with a whitehead in the center, or  large zit. I popped it like a zit and white puss came out. I wasn't too alarmed--I've had smaller zits in my pubic region. However this one was on the lower side of my penis, and a bit larger then the tiny zits I've had before. It bled a tiny bit more then I expected it too when popped, and healed a bit different--I monitored it healing closely and I'm almost sure it didn't scab. At this point it looks entirely healed but left a (?shinier), slightly raised light pink bump of skin where it was originally, it doesn't look like a scar to me. I have no other symptoms, and I don't remember it itching or hurting. Here is a picture of the bump it left behind:  http://hidebehind.com/img/53/53077F.jpg   From what I've read herpes scab over, is it possible to have an HSV-2 spot that looks & pops like a zit, has white puss, doesn't scab, and completely closes up 5 days later leaving a small bump of skin? (this bump is what worries me)  its possible that there is one more smaller zit/bump i popped in the same area, but its too small to tell.  The things that look like small zits in the past didn't worry me, but thinking back when i popped these the whitehead seemed to be more solid/squishy and tiny (unlike the one i have now),  these other spots on my pubic region rarely leave behind a light pink dot that looks like this pic but ARENT raised:  http://hidebehind.com/img/1B/1BB012.jpg  In fear of having HSV-2, Could you tell me if either of these is likely to be HSV-2 or HPV, or what else this could be based on the description and images?  My details are as follows, 22 year old man, no previous diagnoses, (clean std screening 6 months ago), I practive safer sex, no past surgeries or family history of problems (outside of lupus), and no meds.  Thanks & God Bless,  Jacob E.  (I forgot to add that this seems to of developed completely over night while i was asleep, within the span of 9 hours)\n\n",

    "content": "Hello JacobE,  It is hard to say for sure but I don't think these spots are HPV.  They almost certainly aren't HSV.  Actually, I don't think they are an STD at all; however, I would recommend you be tested to be sure since many STD's can be asymptomatic (particularly in men).  These spots may be an irritated hair follicle or possible a Fordyce spot.  If these do not improve I would recommend you see your doctor again for a follow up.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I've had the oral form of herpes since childhood. I get outbreaks during times of extreme stress- right now it's depression, among other things. My outbreak of the virus is over, and the healing has completed. My lips, however, are very dry. I avoid using my chapstick so I don't re-infect myself once the outbreak is over. And because  my lips were dry, when I smiled, my lips cracked where the sore once was. The sore from the cracking is closed, but still red. Is it possible for me to spread the herpes virus now?  Also, I read in another post that herpes cannot be transmitted via water. This is true, yes? Just to clarify. I specifically recall a health education teacher saying otherwise. I grew up with a fear of innoculating myself in the shower.  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Coupland10,  I'd like to give you a bit of information about the herpes virus to help you and our other readers know more about it.  The herpes virus is a virus that lives in the nerve roots so once an infection occurs it doesn't ever \"go away\".  Instead, it lays dormant and reactivates from time to time causing the cold sores to return.  Because the virus never goes away it can be spread at any time.  The virus is most contagious when a sore is present.   The virus is not particularly strong so it can easily be killed by soap and water.  It is not spread through water.  Instead it is spread by direct contact, such as from mouth to mouth by kissing.  It is also spread by contact to the genital area either by mouth or intercourse.  Transmission through the shower is very unlikely.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The best you can do is reduce your chances of contracting any sexually transmitted disease.  Faithful use of latex condoms is the most sure preventive measure available next to abstinence, but it is not 100% effective and condoms can break.  The good news is that in the rare instance you do get a sexually transmitted infection, many of them are curable.  Some, such as HIV are merely treatable, others such as herpes are controllable.  Choosing to have mutiple sexual partners, especially in casual sex, is a risk factor that cannot be 100% preventable.  There is hope for HPV though if the woman gets this vaccine - this is true prevention so encourage all your girlfriends to get this vaccine that protects against the most common human papllovirus that can cause genital warts.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "background>  25yo, male, married.  Wife had a few partners before I came along, I did not.  She has been tested for various things and all negative.  we are both healthy, I have no real skin problems other than acne.  Let me try and describe this as best I can without a picture.  I get 2 somewhat circular red marks on my penis whenever I get a cold or flu.  It usually appears a day or two after my sickest day, as I begin to recover.  The circles (maybe ovals, whatever) are roughly the size of a half-dollar, one on each side, located partly on the head, and partly the shaft below, centered on the \"rim\" (whatever that's called).  If you were to divide the circumference of the penis into thirds, the red circles would be located in the upper left and right thirds, nothing on the bottom.  also- they always appear in the same spot.  Ok, hope that was descriptive enough.  Anyway, if you look really close, you can tell the skin is *slightly* raised, and warm to the touch, and the skin looks a little irritated, with what looks almost like cracking skin (but it does not crack, just not as smooth as usual).  But at first inspection, it just looks red.  It does not hurt or itch, but it does feel just a bit sensitive.  I made the mistake a few years ago of not noticing it and *ahem* masturbating and a few days later the skin oozed and scabbed and looked awful.   I never made that mistake again and so now it just fades away in about a week.  I have researched all the common STD's and nothing is consistent with what I have.  My wife will sometimes (but rarely) get a spot of redness the size of a pea on her genitalia, and she says it's a little sore for a few days,  but to me it doesn't look like anything, it's almost completely unnoticeable,  and she's had a doctor look at it and test it and everything seems fine.  I just would like some suggestions on possible things this might be that I can further research, and if there's a possibility that there's nothing to worry about.   I wondered if it was a skin condition, but the correlation with cold/flu and the consistent location and distinct pattern does not seem to be simply a skin problem  thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Approach27r,  What you are describing does not sound like an STD.  It really does not sound like an infection of any sort.  I suspect that what you may be seeing is areas where the blood vessels are close to the skin.  The infection may be triggering some dilation of the vessels making the red areas noticeable.  Given your description I do not believe this is anything that is serious or dangerous.  Most likely it is some form of a normal body reaction to healing.  If you are able, by chance, to have the areas evaluated when the redness is present it will allow you to get a better idea of what is causing this.  Best wishes.\n\n",

So if you have been sexually active with more than one partner be sure to know who it was that infected you they need treatment also.  If the person who gave you chlamydia also is HIV positive the chances are increased that it will be passed along. This is due to inflamed tissue holding a higher level of the virus and being released in the semen.  If you have chlamydia and and are HIV negative the chances of you contracting HIV from someone else is also high since the immune system is compromised.  You are on the right track being tested and treated.  I wish you good luck and keep me posted on the results. Sandy RN\n\n",

It is also possible to exchange Herpes Type 2 (HSV2) from vagina to mouth but not as commonly spread that way as from genital to genital.  Some sexually transmitted infections are unknown whether or not they can be transmitted this way.  But, if a partner is infected with most any STD, you could get it through oral sex.  Risks also vary with gender and you did not indicate which this is male/female, same sex, etc.  It also depends on which one is giving and which is receiving for the various diseases.  Let me know if you want more detail based on your individual case.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "With oral sex you would not get the STD in the vagina, and the risk is only there if one of you is infected anyway.  If your partner had a disease, most of them could be transmitted to you, but it would be to your mouth; not your vagina.  Some of the disases are curable with antibiotics; others such as HIV of course are more risky still.    So, if he is infected you risk the following:     * Chlamydia     * Gonorrhea     * Hepatitis A     * Herpes     * HPV (warts)     * Shigella*     * Syphilis In addition there is the possibility of risk for HIV and Hepatitis B.  It is unknown about Hepatitis C.  If you are not yet immunized for Hepatitis A, B or HPV I would recommend you get those now so you would reduce the chance for those at least.   There is no truly \"safe\" sex unless you both have a totally clean bill of health but you can reduce your risk with behavior choices such as latex condoms.    Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I'm a 22 year old male. A few months ago I gave and received oral sex. A day to a few days later, I noticed a single small blue-ish bump on the shaft of my penis below the head. I really wasn't sure what it was. When it didn't go away, I did some research and  finally came to the conclusion that it might be a genital wart; however, it really doesn't look like any genital wart pictures I see online. It's also totally painless and feels like it's below the skin.  Today, though, I finally found a picture that best shows what I think I have. The picture is supposed to be an example for pearly penile papules, but I'm not looking at that. The blue bump below the papules is similar to what my bump looks like, as well as very close to the location of my bump.   Here's the picture: http://www.genitalwartsreport.com/warts ... -glans.jpg  So, I'm just wondering if that blue-ish bump is a genital wart, or could it be that a vein or capillary burst there...perhaps from contact with teeth? It hasn't really changed in shape/color/size since I first noticed it. Also, it's kinda hard to notice unless the penis is erect (not sure if that makes a difference). And if it isn't a wart, is there any risk of me passing this on?  Any feedback would be greatly appreciated!! Thanks!!\n\n",

    "content": "Age: 24 Sex: Female No past diagnoses / surgeries  Over three weeks ago I had sexual contact with a guy whose ex girlfriend had genital herpes. He told me she never had an outbreak when they were together and he never developed any lesions etc. In other words, he claimed he was clean. About a week after our contact I developed a cold sore on my mouth. I wasn't too worried because I've had one before. A week or so after that, I started to have a strange pain on my left labia. No visible sore, but the area was very red and I had white thick discharge. I got nervous and went to the doctors. I was prescribed Diflucan and some other yeast infection ointment. My symptoms did not get better and I just found out my test was negative for yeast anyway! I went to the doctor again because the pain persisted in my left labia and the opening to my vagina was very red - burning sensation when I pee too. My doc did not think it was herpes, but tested me with a swab to ease my mind (no lesion to test, just swabbed the whole area). The test came back negative for herpes. A couple weeks later I am still having issues! I went to my gyno and she gave me gynazole and some anti-fungal ointment (ointment has provided relief of redness and irritation in groin area). She also said it didn't look like herpes! However, my vagina area is still burning / irritated and red! The inside of the labia is red on the right side (left side is better now! so weird) - the inside of the right labia has a weird shiny red look to it...dry feeling. I also noticed some peeling at one point! What could this be? A dermatits issue? I've been getting weird pimple like bumps also - not sore to the touch and they are hard. They are on the outer labia. I use to shave the entire area but my doc told me to stop. Could this be a skin infection from shaving? I am just very concerned and confused. It is also uncomfortable between my vagina and butt area -sore feeling.  I've been using these meds and my symptoms have not gone away. Please help!\n\n",

It actually does sound very much like a yeast infection.  Sometimes, the outer skin infections can take more than one dose of fluconazole to treat.  You may want to talk with your doctor about rechecking for this.  Another possibility would be a bacterial skin infection such as with a bacteria called streptococcus.    A contact dermatitis may also be possible.  I would recommend you follow up with your doctor for reevaluation since your symptoms are not improving.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Question1234,  I have reposted your second post here.  In an effort to keep our forums manageable we request that follow ups be posted in the same original thread.

I had ongoing pain in my left labia, no visible sore, but irritation and discomfort throughout my vaginal area. I was tested twice for herpes (swab tested) and both came back negative. Since that time I've completely stopped shaving per the doctors orders. This past Saturday I gave in and shaved the entire area...I couldn't stand the hair anymore (it was itching). Previous to my issue I was shaving the entire area regularly and had a bikini wax about 4 weeks prior. After I shaved on Saturday I noticed a hard bump on my left labia. I totally freaked out. Since then I've been very anxious and 'feeling' it get more sore. Today I went to the doctor to have it tested...since now there is something in the region. At first glance she said it does not look like a herpes lesion and there seems to be hair in/around the bump. She swabbed tested the area, she dragged the swab over it repeatedly (the bump is long, alittle above the skin, not round) and now it is super sore! I realize I will get my results in 2 days, but I am hoping for some quick advice / help. Any thoughts on what this could be? Does it sound like herpes? I got very worried because I got my period today and I've read people get lesions around their period. Could just be a coincidence. Please help.  This new bump does not particularly sound like herpes to me either.  This may be a blocked gland.  The opening to the vagina is lined with many glands and pores.  One of these may have become clogged causing a build up of fluid behind the pore.  This may be the lump you are feeling.  I would recommend you follow up with your gynecologist.  If it is a gland, using warm compresses can sometimes help open the pore.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Yeast tends to make you very tender and sometimes it itches.  People often describe the discharge as being cheesy, with a fishy odor.  While yeast can be treated over the counter, if it is bacterial or some other type infection you would need a doctor so it's best to find out exactly what it is.    Please consider using condoms if you are sexually active to avoid not only pregnancy but to decrease your risk of infection.  Some problems like yeast, can occur without being infected from another person.  If the normal bacteria present in the vagina is altered, you can have an overgrowth of yeast.    Best wishes.\n\n",

But, if either of you have used IV drugs or other risky behavior, or have infection that has not yet shown up, there is still risk.  Also, it is believed that there is an underestimation of risk when it comes to HIV - people have sex thinking believing there is no risk, when in fact there is.

    "content": "Hi, I'm a 21 year old male. I've had STD tests and everything comes back negative. This will take quite a while to describe, as I don't want to leave anything out.  Five months ago I had unprotected vaginal intercourse with my ex. I later heard that her boyfriend right before this event had genital warts. About a week afer intercourse my urethra started itching like crazy for periods ranging from 10 minutes to an hour or so. That stopped after two weeks. I then noticed  a rash-like redness on my frenulum continuing right up to and (I think into) my urethral opening. The urethral meatus has changed appearance; it isn't flush with the surface of the glans like it used to be; it's developed a redness and small red dots (slightly inverted?) the size of a pin-head that are only sometimes visible and I believe I can see some redness/discolouration on the inside if i spread my urethra open. I also have one or two small pin-head sized bumps on the glans, right next to (about 1cm from) the urethra that are aparrent only while erect or if I squeeze the end of my penis. I've developed small bumps on the prepuce area, which my GP says are most likely irritated glands and (hopefully) not warts, but there's no way to tell for now.  Now, the thing that I'm most concerned about is the redness and irritation on the frenulum/urethra. It occasionally and increasingly feels itchy or I can just kind of feel that the rash is there. I've been told to use Hydrocortisone, Canesten (aparrently to 3 different doctors it looked like a yeast infection), and Nerisone. None of these have done anything. When I go to my family doctor he just keeps telling me to use the Nerisone. It's bothering me more and more frequently, but seems neither to be spreading nor regressing. I've been to about 7 different doctors to see if anybody knows what it is and what to do and it's always no diagnosis and \"cream, cream, cream\" and they send me on my way. I've tried to get referrals to a dermatologist, but my requests are constantly ignored (for no given reason). I'd like to know exactly what it is, then I can explore my options with treating it if treatable.    Do you have any ideas what this may be, or any suggestions on how I can find out (specialists that may be able to diagnose it)? Can warts cause rashes? Could it be cancer? There is a history of skin cancer in my family. A thorough answer would be greatly appreciated if you've got the time, if not, a short answer is fine. Anything will help; I'm at my wits end!!! I apologize for not being brief.  Thank you!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi BadBrain,  Your description sounds like a urethritis.  It really doesn't sound to me like this is a case of genital warts.  It may, however, be a different STD.  Even though you've been tested, the tests are not 100%.  I would recommend you talk to your doctors about being treated for gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomonas.  All three of these can be treated with a one dose medicine (three different one dose medicines).  This may help clear up an infection if it is there.  It sounds like you have been appropriately treated for a fungal (yeast) infection so this is less likely.  Treatment often will need to be for 2 weeks solid.  Less time may allow it to return.    Another possibility is urethral irritation from excess moisture or contact with an irritant such as a detergent that you are mildly allergic to.  Follow up with your doctor is important.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 20 year old female. I went to the doctor back in Sept, because I found out my ex boyfriend had and infection  and I started feeling like my vagina was sore. I told the doctor the symptoms I was having and that my ex had an infection. She tested me for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis, which all came back negative. Since the results wouldnt have come in until a week later she put me on antibotics for all 3. After finishing the antibotics, I felt fine for about a week then it all came back. I went back to the doctor (and thats when she told me everything came back negative)  and explained my symptoms and told her I recently starting having vaginal discharge which was white and clumpy. She said that its probably a yeast infection and I got more medicine for that (she didn't do any tests or anything).  While doing the whole monistat thing, I drank alcohol on 2 different occasions. I told my mom the problems I was having and she said that since I drank the medicine wouldn't work. I tried it again, and now I'm having abdominal pains every now and then. The only thing I could find out about my ex boyfriends infection was that it started with an \"o\". His mother is a nurse, and told me that she doesnt think that I could have gotten that from him.  I made an appt. with a different doctor, but its not till late november. So Please help me figure out whats wrong with me!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Mmc1358,  To my knowledge there is no interaction between miconazole (the medicine in monistat) and ethanol.  It should still be effective if alcohol is taken.  There are many possible causes of abdominal pain, including viral infections, GI tract irritation and gynecological causes.  It sounds like you have been appropriately treated for STD's so it is less likely to be this.  (I can't come up with what the infection starting with an \"o\" would be.)  Follow up with your doctor will be important.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "5 month ago my condom broke when I was penetrating a sex worker. Few minutes\u2019 later i started to have discomforts in the head of my penis that was a Sunday. the next day I went to see a physician, he put me on 7 days of doxycycline, once off 1g of ciprobay and one anti-retroviral for HIV prevention.  After the anti-biotic treatment I was still not fine, the physician asked me to do a Chlamydia blood test witch came back negative and a syphilis blood test that came back negative, we also did a C-reactive test that was normal by then.  He then told me I was fine, I was still not feeling fine. 5 days later I went to see an urologist who discovered while physically examining me I had a swollen part in my testicles. He put me on a 15 days of ciprobay, 10 days of doxycycline, and 5 days of flagil. After that treatment i was still not fine and my bladder was inflamed, he didn't realize my bladder was inflamed, he gave another 5 day of doxycicline and ciprobay.  After that I was still not fine, i decided to see another urologist, he then check my prostate and my testicles everything was inflamed.  He prescribed me 1 months of some anti-inflammatory and 10 days of flagyls.  After that treatment i was still not fine.   I waited 2 weeks then i did a STD profile including HIV, everything was negative except the Chlamydia IGg witch was positive (Chlamydia IGg doesn\u2019t tell if the infection is acute or a past infection. By the time I went back to see that urologist he was not available.  i then went to see a different urologists who told she thinks i was fine, even when i was still having discomforts in the head of the penis and some pain in the bladder. We did a full blood count that shoed my neutrophil was low and my CRP was slightly higher.  I took a month off doctors, just to see how things were going to go. I then started to feel lower abdomen pain and pain all over my back, I did a urine culture which came back negative, i went to see a family physician, he checked my prostate and said it was inflamed he prescribed me another 10 days of ciprobay, when i was still not feeling fine he prescribed 20 day of amoclave Bd (it is some penicillin)  Toward the end of that treatment I did prostate sonar it said my prostate is not inflamed, but I am still not feeling well.  i feel sick all over my body, the color on my pelvis is not the same it use to be and things are not fine, my body get itchy, i did a stool test to look for fungal because of the many anti-biotic i took, it says scanty  Candida albican.  I need your help in trying to diagnose my problem. Your suggestion will be appreciated.   i went to see a physician few days a go she  put me on purmycin  for 2 weeks 4 times a day. I am still taking it.   Tell me what test you think I can do to trace m y problem. Any suggestion welcomed.  Thanks for your help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Jhonneedhelp,  I would agree with Debbie, I think you need to see a physician.  Seeing an Internal medicine (general adult medicine) doctor is probably the best place to start.  I would add that you have had enough antibiotics to treat any possible infection you may have at this point.  This makes me think that your condition may actually be more of an inflammatory condition such as an inflammatory bowel disease.  Seeing a general medicine doctor is a good way to step back and take a look at the whole picture to see if there is anything else that is going on.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Hi Dr Chan,  Thank you so much for being here to help the people.  on you quote you said i have had enough antibiotics to treat any possible infection that i may have contracted, but Lymphogranuloma venereum does only die with a 3 weeks strait course of doxycycline, tetracycline or erythromycin, and i never took a 3 course strait of doxycycline.   i took 7 day doxycycline prescribed by the physician then i had 5 days without taking it, then when i saw the eurologist he prescribed me 10 days of doxycycline and 15 days ciprobay, by the time i finished the ciprobay i had 5 days without taking doxycycline, then when i went back to him ge gave me another 5 days of doxy. Summarizing all the doxycycline i took, i never took for 3 weeks in a raw and if my problem is lymphogranuloma venereum it would not have died    On the other forum, they suggested I get checked for Lymphogranuloma venereum, and when I look at my symptoms and compare it to the lymphogranuloma venereum symptoms they look identical, i know some disease mimic other disease and i want to be sure before i conclude that my problem is really lymphogranuloma.  My question is: can a person have a Chlamydia trachomatis IgA and IgM test negative and still have Lymphogranuloma venereum?    Because i did a Chlamydia trachomatis IgA and IgM and it came back negative, but my Chlamydia IgG came back positive.   And yet my symptoms look like lymphogranuloma venereum.\n\n",

Because of this it is possible for each of you to develop the infection in the unaffected area, though a little less likely.  Regarding protection,  using condoms to limit skin contact can help prevent genital infections.  There are barrier devices for oral sex if needed as well.  The virus is most easily spread during episodes when blisters are present.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Yes, it is possible for you to get this infection in either place, especially through oral sex.  Transmission is more common from the oral to the genital area than from the genital to the oral area.  The risk for infection is highest with direct contact of blisters or sores during an outbreak.  Sex should be avoided both during the outbreaks and the prodromes (the early symptoms of herpes), which include tingling, itching, or tenderness in the infected areas.  Infecting another through shedding when there is no sign of an outbreak would be more common with HSV 2 than with HSV 1, however.  Female condoms would be your best alternative to reduce your risk of infection during the rest of the time (when asymptomatic).  But, keep in mind, this is no guarantee with this.  I know you understand by the way you worded your question.  Best wishes.\n\n",

This virus causes small bumps that have a central dimple on them.  It is spread by skin-to-skin contact and is not typically tested for during STD testing because visual diagnosis is key.  It may be some clogged pores as well.  If they are not going away I would suggest having your doctor take a look at them.  Usually, visual diagnosis is key with issues such as this.

I am sexually active. My problem is that, my vagina has been itchy. It comes and goes. So one week, last month, it go really bad. So I decided to go to my primary doctor and ask what was going on. She asked me questions of what I feel, etc. So she told me it might be just a yeast infection. She told me that vaginal itchiness involves wearing tight pants and moisture. So she told me to wear loose clothes and make sure that I keep my vagina dry. Well, it went away and then came back again. Usually after sex. Me and my bf have been sexually active since early this year. So, is it normal or should I be more worried? Does it usually come back?\n\n",

If the area is painful it may be infected so I would recommend keeping this appointment with your doctor.  Occasionally warm compresses to the area can help open these pores, if this is what it is.  Given your description I would still be a little concerned about herpes.  To effectively test for the virus the swab must be done of the base of the sore and with a special viral culture.  Your doctor can help say if the lesions look like they may be herpes and can repeat the tests if necessary.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  i am 23 male and Sometimes if I urinate soon after ejaculation, I will feel pain in my urethra near the tip of the penis. Also, sometimes I will feel mild discomfort even before I have urinated. The burning pain during urination usually only lasts for about 30 minutes with mild discomfort lasting another 30 minutes or so. During this time, it feels like I can't empty my bladder and I end up visiting the bathroom many times, only urinating a little at a time. This can happen after masturbation. And I don't think that it's something I've caught from my sexual partner as I havnt had any sex with anybody in my life yet. I have had this problem for several years now (even before I became sexually active).   Please help i am really scared. Thanks in advance[/u]\n\n",

Her OBGYN had performed a swab culture of 3-4 small red bumps located near her right labia, that she (my girlfriend thought was irritation from shaving or this new pair of underwear she purchased)..the cultures came back Negative.   She also had a swollen lymph node in the pelvic region (same side as the bumps), that hurt her to the touch. Her OBGYN sent her to see a diff. Doc in regards to this. That Doc. perform the blood testing for the HSV 1 and 2.  The results for the HSV 1 were 0.48 and HSV 2 were 10.68 lgG  But, according to her... the Doc made it seem as if though it was not that big a worry and more or less down played it telling her to make an aapt. back with her OBGYN for further instruction. (very weird to me)  My questions are...  Does this indicate the herpes virus in her, or could it be a false postive in some way?  What are my chances if she IS infected of contracted this and how soon would I see a possible outbreak?  And what is the MOST effective test that we should ask for...if we want re-testing for her?

    "content": "Hi Worriedboutus,  Unfortunately, the values at which titers are considered positive varies from lab to lab.  I was not able to find any reference values during my search on the web.  In regards to HSV1 vs. HSV2, titers are typically not helpful because there is a significant amount of cross-reactivity between the two so that distinguishing them is difficult.    The best way to determine infection is by actual culture of a blister when it is present.    In regards to treatment, if outbreaks are frequent it may be worth while to take an oral suppressive medicine such as valacyclovir (Valtrex).    I hope this helps some.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Un_lucky,  Based on the pictures I am not convinced that these are herpes lesions.  You can ask your doctor to do a viral culture of one of the bumps to see if it grows out the herpes virus.  I am a little suspicious that it may be a contact irritation or possibly a fungal infection of the skin.  Using valtrex for an outbreak of HSV can shorten the time the blisters are present and slightly decrease the time that the virus is shed actively (slightly decreasing infectivity).  It is not dangerous to choose not to use the Valtrex for outbreaks.  They simply will last a few days longer.  Follow up with your doctor is important.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I can certainly understand your frustration and confusion.  I am not familiar with a urinary frequency complaint in connection to Herpes infection.  That doesn't mean it isn't there - I just haven't heard of it.  First of all there are some false positive results.  IgM antibody tests frequently are in error.  I don't know if this is the test you had or not.  But it would be ONE possible explanation.  It is also possible to have an initial outbreak of Genital Herpes that is so mild you would not even be aware of it.  That would be my guess in your situation.  If this is the case and you have not had any further outbreaks, you could be in this kind of puzzling situation.  For this reason, some people question even doing screening for asymptomatic herpes infection.  Having this kind of information can be upsetting when there is little to be gained by the knowledge anyway as with your situation - in a monogamous, even currently non-sexual relationship.  There may be more harm than good to come from this kind of diagnosis.    The primary reasoning for testing would be to encourage the person to use caution in sexual relations to avoid infecting another person or in the case of a pregnant woman, to avoid passing it on to her newborn at the time of birth.  If the provider is aware of the infection they can take precautions (possibly even C section delivery).    You may wish to investigate further for confirming diagnosis if it will ease your mind.  But if you are without symptoms now, I think you can rest easy on this, especially in your current relationship.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "title": "Post Chlymadia",
    "content": "I am a 27 year old male who recently had chlymadia.  I contracted it from my girlfriend. At first I thought it was a yeast infection or UTI and was put on Ciprofloxacin then fluconazole for 2 weeks at a time.  Then my girlfriend got tested for all STD's and came up positive for chlymadia.  I was experiencing discharge, burning urination, sensitivity on the meatus and tip of penis, redness around meatus and cottage cheese like ejaculation.  I was on Doxycycline Hyclate, 100mg, for over a month and the discharge stopped, no burning, ejaculation is normal. I went back to my doctor and he said everything looked normal and not to worry. My girlfriend was tested a second time and she was clean.  It has been about two months now and the meatus still seem a bit swollen on one side and I notice it gets red for a prolonged period after I have sex or masturbate.  What I am worried about is that I still have the feeling that I always have to pee.  It isn't that extreme to call it painful but more annoying.  I will pee and 5 minutes later I feel I have to go again.  I will hold it until I really have to go.  Are there long term effects to chlymadia?  Could I still have it even though I was on Doxy over a month and the only symptom I have is peeing a lot?  Also, before I had chlymadia, when I pee a couple of shakes would clear the excess urine off.  Now, post chlymadia, I notice it dribbles more urine out and i have to shake more and sometimes wipe the tip of excess urine. Will it ever be normal again?  Thank you in advance.\n\n",

It is unlikely that the chlamydia is still the cause of your problems since there really isn't a lot of resistance to doxycycline with chlamydia.    However, STD's very often come in packs so it may be that you have another one that has not been treated.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I would recommend you be tested for both strep and gonorrhea.  A general bacterial throat culture can pick up both of these.  Treatment for both is an antibiotic; however, the antibiotic of choice differs for the two so an accurate diagnosis is important.  Best wishes.\n\n",

This is probably better than the STD clinic because the STD clinics generally are not set up to give follow up and treatment for strep throat, only STD's.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I have noticed these bumps(see pictures) come up over a long period of time and would like to know what they are? Like maybe I also have HPV or are these a symptom of my HSV-2? I do not understand my infection very well, every doctor I have ever seen has just handed a prescripition for Vatrex and said don't have un-protected sex! Not very helpful. So if they are a symptom of HSV, are they a break-out? Will they go away if I continualy take Valtrex? I have had what I beleive are break-outs, where I get small painful leisions then they clear, this is a breakout yes? I hope I have provided you with enough information so you can help me! Thanks!

    "content": "1. 22 yrs old, sexually active 2. Male 3. NA 4. NA 5. NA 6. None  For the past almost a month, i have noticed 2 small bumps that were skin colors on the shaft of my penis. After about a week or 2 i noticed a very small red (pimple like) bump on the sensitive skin area of the shaft. After a few more days i noticed that there were a few more of these that popped up.  Now they are very small, and i stupidly picked the 1st pimple like one and it bled a little bit but did not puss. The white area of it seemed to be more like skin than anything. It has now disappeared but the other ones i have not popped are still barely visible. The first 2 bumps i noticed originally are now just a little red.  The bumps do not hurt at all even if touched. It seems they are more below the skin, like a pimple. The thing that worries me is that more than 1 was showing up which has never happened before. I have looked at pictures of MC and it seems to be the closest thing like that but the bumps are not that big. They are also not blistering at all like i have read herpes is suppose to do.  I do have a picture if it is needed. It is a little tough for me to describe everything in detail i feel is need to know to make an educated guess on what it could be.\n\n",

    "content": "Okay so..I'm a 20 year old female and 3 weeks ago i was diagnosed and treated by a local free health clinic for chlamydia. My partner, whom i infected, could not get treated until my results came back 2 weeks later. We had protected sex inbetween those times. Because I misunderstood my nurse (a little bit of ignorance and sexual tension, perhaps), i had unprotected oral sex with my infected partner. So i re-exposed myself and contracted Chlamydia again. I went back to the free clinic and got treated again with a Z-pac (Zithromax). Since then my partner has been treated and is symptom-free. Also we haven't had sex since either one of us has been treated last. BUT its been a little over a week now, and my symptoms have been getting steadily worse. These include; vaginal itching, discharge, and odor, sore throat, difficulty swallowing, and a recent occurence of what looks and feels like pink-eye. I don't know why the last treatment of the z-pack did not work... and would like some answers. Please, if anyone can help me sort through this... i would appreciate it entirely!  Thanks in advance.

My other thought is that I would recommend you be tested for all STD's.  STD's often present with multiple infections at the same time.  The azithromycin will only treat chlamydia.  If you have another infection, such as gonorrhea, it may continue to cause symptoms.  Also, I am not familiar with the resistance patterns for where you may be located.  Almost always, chlamydia is susceptible to azithromycin but it may be worth asking if there is resistance.  Seeing a gynecologist will be helpful.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Merlin26,  It is possible that you have  a persistent yeast infection (fungal infection).  Vandazole (generic name metronidazole) is not affective against yeast.  It is used to treat a condition called bacterial vaginosis where too much bacteria is present in the vaginal tract.  This condition can also cause a discharge.    The oral pill you took was likely a medicine called fluconazole that will treat yeast infections.    You may want to try using one of the over-the-counter yeast infection medicines (one with an anti-fungal medicine like miconazole or clotrimazole or any of the other several choices).  This is a safe thing to try.  If it helps, great.  If it doesn't you should see your doctor again.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I am 31yo female, no past diagnoses/surgeries. No related family history or medications. I had a tiny lesion on my lower part of the labia. Two days later, the right groin lymph node enlarged. I never had anything like this before. My boyfriend said he doesn't have STD and we have been together for about one year. I did have an ex-boyfriend who might have passed me the disease which I don't know, but it was over a year ago. I also had cold sores in my mouth when I was a teenager and last time I had it was a few years ago.  My question is, if I go for a blood test for HSV1 and 2. I will test positive for the 1 since cold sore is  1. Am I right? Does that mean I have herpes/STD? Many people have cold sores and they have no blood test done. If someone has cold sore does that mean he/she is herpes carrier? How do you distinguish this? Does the symptoms that I have suggests  that I might have the HSV2 as well? Thank you for your time and help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Gal,  There are many glands that line the entrance to the vagina.  Your symptoms may be due to herpes lesions or they may be due to some of these glands becoming clogged and subsequently infected.  Regarding the HSV1/2 issue, most often HSV1 causes cold sores and HSV2 causes genital lesions.  However, either type of the virus can cause sores in either location.  It is possible for the cold sore virus (presumably HSV1) to subsequently be transferred to the genitals and cause lesions.    I would recommend you see your doctor for an evaluation.  Herpes lesions can often be easily distinguished from other sores by visual examination.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Dr. Lowe, Thank you very much for answering my questions. I had seen my PA because my MD wasn't available. He couldn't tell what my lesion was. And my lesion had gone now. It lasted for 11 days total. I had only one very small lesion. It was painful to touch and when I showered the area. Othertimes, it didn't bother me at all. No problems with long run for almost 4 hours/ 20miles on day 2 the lesion occured or biking 25 miles on day 9. I had no fever. I wasn't completely sure if it is herpes lesion even I had seen some herpes pictures on the internet. After consult with a MD, my PA asked me to have blood test for HIV, RPR, HSV1 and 2 in a couple weeks. I had the first two tested negative in the past, so I am not concern of those. My concern regarding HSV1 is, I almost certain that I will test positive for the HSV1 as I was growing up with cold sores before I sexually active. I afraid to have blood test done now and confirm that I have HSV1 and my PA dx me with STD/ genital herpes. Then it will be in my medical record and I am subject to tell my future partner (broke up with my boyfriend recently) about my STD instead of cold sore in my mouth in the past? The lesion could be caused by herpes, but if the lesion wasn't caused by herpes, I just don't think it is fair to me to have this genital herpes dx. People have cold sores in the past don't have to follow all the precautions as people dx with STD when they have a stable partner/ get married. Am I right? What should I do? Your opinion is greatly appreciated. Thank you very much for your valuable time. Gal\n\n",

You may benefit from taking a daily suppressive medicine to help prevent outbreaks.  Your doctor can prescribe this for you and answer any questions you may have about this medicine if you need.  Seeing your doctor about the spinal pain is also a good idea.  Other possibilities include a pulled muscle, degenerative disk disease or a stretched ligament.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "The greatest risk for spreading hepatitis C is through blood.  Drug use (especially IV) is the most common mode of transmission.  Sexual transmission is less likely.  If the boyfriend had skin mostly intact, without small cuts, etc. he is safer for sure but there is always the possibility of microscopic cuts but exact risk for sexual contacts is unknown.  This is because it is most readily spread from one person's blood to another person's blood - not just to the other person generally.  It would also be a risk if they shared razors or toothbrushes - something like that where actual blood to blood contact might be made.  So, it is possible that in an intimate situation there could be more than one way of passing along the virus.  It can take between 2 weeks and 6 months for it to show up following exposure.    To reduce future risks, she should consider using condoms with every sexual encounter.  They may not protect completely but should reduce the likelihood.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello doctor,  I'm 26 years old and recently have had unprotected sex for the first time with my partner, twice in the last week.  I went to a lake labor day weekend, where I encountered alot of gnats (I think).  I counted nearly 40 bites all over my body, and two pimple like bumps on my labia area, directlly on the hairline. I was also in a wet bathing suit for two days straight, jumping in and out of said lake. I've had an earache all this week.  Again this past week, my partner and I had unprotected sex.  The intercourse was \"rough/dry\" in nature, and my period started in the morning.  A few hours later, I noticed that the bumps from earlier in the week got larger, and there were three more present along my hairline at my labia, and two on my lower right buttock.    These bumps are not white, they are reddish tint.  They are not pussing, or producing any substance, but they are painful.  I made the mistake of squeezing them, to try to \"pop\" them, so now they resemble an open sore, which I'm unsure if this is the cause of the pain.    I'm freaking out all this weekend, due to not being able to get to a physician until Monday.  All these signs are pointing to herpes, but also, folliculitis...by what my research is telling me.  Please help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I'm a 22 year old male with no real past known issues and not currently on any medication. Two weeks ago I had unprotected sex with a female I don't really know too well.  However this problem didn't arise until after I had unprotected sex with another female who I've had sex with for the past couple of years. I'm not sure if this rash type problem is an std or not but it wouldn't be impossible. Looking at pictures and other posts nothing I've seen looks like this. It is all red at the base of the shaft and covered with raised tiny red bumps and continues up a little getting blotchy. The redness at the base is also quiet shiny. After that there are just some more of these bumps, still red in color. Even still a few more on the foreskin and even 2 small ones on the head. Not really itchy now but when it first developed it was really itchy.  That said the  picture is here. Hard to make out all of the bumps but they look like small pimples. Now, for a little info for possible help in diagnosis, I had shaved some stray hairs at the bottom of the shaft[yet this shouldn't have an effect on the bumps on the head] earlier that day and also, we ended up encountering in anal sex as well during our meet. The next day the base my my shaft itched pretty bad but I thought nothing of it because of my schedule and noticed nothing else out of the ordinary. Next day, still continued to itch only this time I looked and saw this. At the time it was a much brighter color red and the bumps stood out more. Now it's not itching so much several days later but still quiet prominent. Any info is greatly appreciated. Thanks so much for reading all of this.\n\n",

    "content": "HPV is a virus that has about 100 strains, of which 30 or so are sexually transmitted.  The incubation period (time between exposure and acquisition of disease) varies from weeks to years.  Because of this huge variability, it is impossible to say where it might have been acquired.  This time frame works for you (average 3 months), as well as for previous partners she has had so the fact that she has not had sex with any of them in the past year does not mean they can be ruled out as potential infectious partners.  A person can also be contagious without having symptoms.    She should continue to get regular examinations to monitor cervical changes.  Some strains can lead to cancer so it is important to stay in contact with the doctor.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi 7769pt,  First, we should clarify that what you received is NOT a vaccine for gonorrhea but is treatment for possible infection.  Vaccines prevent future infection.  The treatment you received will not prevent future infections but will treat the current infection.  The reason to wait seven days is that after treatment it can take up to seven days for all the bacteria to be killed.  Until this point, you may still be infectious.  Unfortunately, there is not a vaccine for gonorrhea at this point although there may be one at some point in the future.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi XD,  The only link between HPV and molluscum is that the two viruses are both sexually transmittable.  Women can be tested for HPV when they have abnormal changes on their pap smears to see if the changes are due to HPV and what strain of HPV it is.  Men can be tested but it is rarely done at this point.  HPV can cause genital warts in men and women.  It can also cause cervical cancer in women.  In men, the link to penile cancer is less certain.  If you would like to be tested you can talk with your doctor to see if testing of men is available in your area.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Am I correct in assuming HPV is for life (in men & women) while MC is only a skin condition that can be cleared up?  It is a little frustrating because most of the HPV information concerns its effects on women and not men.  It's fine and dandy HPV doesn't cause any much harm in men since I'm a guy, but spreading it to other women doesn't sound like a very nice thing to do, which is the cause for concern.

Molluscum causes small lumps that typically have a central dimple in them.  HPV is a lifelong infection.  Molluscum typically will resolve but it may take several months or even over a year before new lumps stop forming.  If you have lumps that you are not sure what they are your doctor should be able to answer this pretty easily by examining your skin.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I do shave so maybe it could be an ingrown hair, but there in no puss in it at all. It's also slightly painfull to touch, but only when I touch it.  So now I'm really scared about this.

When I get tingling in my lip is the virus shedding and should I avoid oral sex at this time. ?   Q. What is your opinion on the comment below : ? \"If you do nothing but avoid sex during obvious lesions - your partner is ~ 96% likely each year NOT to contract hsv2 from you. If you take daily suppressive therapy his risk is cut in half. If you throw condoms in along with everything else - he's about 99% likely each year NOT to contract hsv2 from you. Statistically there's not any different between a 1% risk with condoms and a 2% risk without them.\"   Q. If I receive anal sex , unprotected but into suppressive therapy 2 weeks with no ob, is the chance of transmission to him about 4%. ? And if he receives oral from me what percentage are chances of my transmission to him, ( I have had one cold sore 10yrs ago) last brief ob on my penis was two weeks ago. ?  Thank you. miserable life.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Miserable-life,  I am not particularly familiar with the exact percentage chances of transmission of HSV so I am not able to comment regarding the quote on percentages.  As you've suggested, the risk of transmission is much higher if you have active sores.  Suppressive therapy helps but does not completely eliminate the risk of transmission.  The virus can be shed even when no sores are present.    I would always recommend using condoms.  Even though there is no statistical difference between 1 and 2%, if the virus is passed on the odds don't matter in the end.  Condoms have clearly been shown to reduce the risk of transmission.  Sorry I can't give you more specifics.  I hope this helps some.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi doctor,  I just wanted to get your opinion on something:  I have not had sex in several months...  I've been so busy with work I have not had time to have any time of relationship that would warrant such actions.  However I've found several bumps on my groin area, which I will do my best to explain.  They seem to be fleshy colored, much like a pimple.  They are about the size of a dull pencil's led for the most part.  These bumps do not itch, burn, or cause any discomfort.  They seem to be non-symmetrical and are not enflamed, red, or swollen.  They are dry, not weepy...  I have one on the right hand side of my penil shaft that grew to be large in the course of a night and I popped it the next morning to have a pimple like discharge come out of it.  These pimples have been on this area for about a month and haven't really bothered me, or given me any type of trouble other than being there.  They are not in a cluster per say...  There are several of them, not in one particular place.  However virtually none of them are on the shaft of my penis, only the area surrounding it.  I have sat down and done some research and am not really sure what to make of it.  I have been going through intense physical training that causes me to neglect my physical hygiene more than I'd like.  This may mean I'm out doors for days at a time with no shower.  It seems like it could be likely that this is a bacterial infection, but since these spots are raised I figured that might be a bit unlikely?  I would like your professional medical opinion on what this is likely to be?  Some of these are quite raised indeed (two of them almost look deformed *raised out like a patch of skin forming a non-symmetrical cylinder type of bump.  Thank you for your time, BJWwonders\n\n",

I have read many of your prior post in order to help give me some idea as to what I may be dealing with and I must say that it seems as if \"warts\" are more of a possibility than herpes with the symptoms I have and then with the long term breakout I would potentially being experiencing if it were herpes.  These bumps don't seem to have the central dimple on the head as I've read is characteristic of molluscum (sorry if this is an incorrect spelling).  The shapes are non-symmetrical as I stated before and a couple of them seem to have more of a califlour shape to them as I have seen you describe in prior instances.  However others are fairly round looking with a white head, and from their appearance doesn't seem to be water filled..  What would you make of this?  As far as I know I've not been exposed to genital warts and I've been pretty selective in my partners (I'm only 22, so I haven't had many).  I'm just a bit confused about all this, I suppose rightfully so.  With my job going to the doctor is very difficult (working as a public servant).  Due to the times I work and the wages that I'm (not) making. lol  Again, I appreciate your help in this matter.\n\n",

If they came and went then returned it may also be a cold virus that is causing a rash.    There are several viruses that can cause rashes (non-STD's), particularly on the legs.  These viruses are very common around this time of year.  I would recommend you have this evaluated if the spots don't get better.  It is very unlikely they are dangerous but having them evaluated will let you know what they are.   Best wishes.\n\n",

My titer went down to 1:16 last year then raised back to 1:32, back to 1:16 and now is back to 1:32. I have had a spinal tap which was negative for neurosyphillis and my only partner has tested negative for syphilis all along. I have never had any symptoms of syphillis such has spots on my palms or feet, or any chancre. My doctor is not sure why my titer will not decrease. I have tested negative for lupus. I looked up on the internet something called \"antiphospholipid syndrome\" which can make people have a false-positive test for syphillis. I was wondering if this could be a posibility for me? I have had a past MRI of the brain which showed over thirty spots on my brain, and the doctor said that it could happen from having a lot of mini strokes...I was 15 years old at the time. I have also had a miscarraige and have tremors....all of these are said to be symptoms of antiphospholipid syndrome. Any answers would be appreciated....Thanks\n\n",

Get an appointment as soon as possible with a doctor to be examined, tested and probably treated.  Some bacteria thrive in inaccessible places, and it is possible that through gums or a crack in epithelial tissue, salivary glands, etc. an infection flourished.  Around the jaw are lots of lymph glands that can swell quite large with infections.  Gonorrhea is one of a variety of infections that can be involved, but antibiotics should not be used until the kind of infections is properly diagnosed.  Also refrain from sex until a doctor tells you it is ok to resume.  Some infections will cause symptoms in one person but not the partner, even if the partner is infected, and harm could come from not being diagnosed and treated.\n\n",

    "content": "The only way to be sure you have genital HSV 1 is to have a culture done when you have an actual blister outbreak.  A blood test could show you have the virus but would not specify if it was genital.  If you have an outbreak, get to your provider within a day or two to have it done.    Spreading of HSV 1 genitally is less likely than HSV 2 but is possible when you have a lesion so avoiding sexual contact when you have symptoms would be the safest course.  Of course if you have sex without a condom, you can certainly expose yourself to other viruses and pregnancy, unless you have a reliable alternative.\n\n",

Off hand it doesn't sound like an STD; however, any time STD's are possible I recommend being tested since they can have some serious complications if left untreated.  It should not be too early to test for most of the STD's at this point.  If your symptoms persist I would suggest you see a primary care doctor (rather than the urological specialist) for an evaluation.  This way you get a whole body perspective rather than just the urological system.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "similar but different? - red rash on my penis",
    "content": "I am a 38 yr old male who about 10 days ago discovered a red rash on my penis I am circumcised. It's on the top side just below the head. I got out of the shower one day and while drying off, I noticed the skin in the same area peeling off like wet skin does after a sunburn. It didn\u2019t itch or burn but was red. I have no discharge and no pain while urinating. A few other factors that may have contributed to the rash (if we're being honest) - I had unprotected sex with my wife four days before the rash was discovered and I hadn't bathed since then (I know, I know), I've gained some weight due to being off my feet after a surgery and my underwear are fitting a bit tighter, and I trim my pubic hair. It\u2019s been pretty hot here lately so the area gets sweaty naturally. Now I considered all of those in thinking my rash was possibly jock itch, or an irritation from the stubble although I hadn't had that problem before. After my shower, my wife and I had unprotected sex despite our discovery of the rash. That seemed to only increase the redness and brought on a feeling like it was rubbed raw. We let a few days pass by to let things dry out and the appearance of the rash became very diminished. It wasn\u2019t red and was more normal in color, but the skin texture appeared like it was a burn that had been healing. Kind of smooth and wrinkly at the same time. Just in the last day or so, my wife didn\u2019t want to take any further chances with what she thinks is more serious. She decided to manually bring me to completion rather than have sex. The result of that caused the rash to surface and again to feel like it was rubbed raw. I then showered and treated it with Neosporin for the dryness. This morning it was again back to near normal skin tone. Still no burning or pain. I now have a slight itch but not scratch worthy.  Now for my wife\u2019s side of the story. She is an overweight woman who completely shaves her pubic area. She sometimes has a strong smell about her that I notice before, during, and after having sex and even sometimes when sex isn\u2019t involved. I don\u2019t know if it is just my keen sense of smell from being her intimate partner or her personal grooming behavior or what. However, she has said that she feels some irritation when we have sex but otherwise seems ok. She has no discharge or noticeable rash from the outside and no pain while urinating. Although the irritation is only recent, the smell has been around for quite some time. We\u2019ve chalked it up to her body chemistry.  Now my suspicion is that from other postings here is that it\u2019s a yeast infection. But I can\u2019t tell if the other posters had any of these same factors or not. And since I am not a doctor, I am asking you for advice. Help?\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 20 year old female. For nearly the past year I have had what seems like a UTI. I have seen two doctors and have been prescribed to two different medications. The medicines seem to help while I'm on them then it seems like the infection comes right back. I know at least one of the medicines was called Cipro. In the past 5 or 6 months I have developed some other ailments as well. Including abdominal pain, a deep pain during intercourse, recurring yeast infections( 4 or 5 within the past 5 months), a crampy feeling in my abdomen from time to time, and I have even bled once during intercourse. What could this be? Is is possible that I have an STD? I had an abortion in January of this year, but I have had the UTI for much longer than that. Any information would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Age: 23 Sex: Male  As the title says, I have a small (less than half a centimeter), oval-shaped, red blister on the shaft of my penis.  There is a slight itch to it, but that is barely noticeable.  It appeared over night. I believe I have had them happen once in a rare while, however my memory is very faulty.  It is always just the one single blister, however. Given it's location, it is not an ingrown hair, and it is definately not a pimple or anything.  I have researched herpes, and every description and picture I find seems to indicate multiple blisters as opposed to one single one. I don't have the money to visit a doctor at the moment, though past times I've gotten STD tests, they have told me that a herpes test wouldn't mean anything unless I was sure I had had other symptoms.  I have been masturbating, so could the Oklahoma humidity plus the moisture have something to do with it?\n\n",

Also, it is possible that a pore has gotten infected.  If it does not resolve in the next 1-2 days I would recommend that you see your doctor.  There are often clinics that can see those with limited income or no insurance at a free or reduced fee rate.  Your local health department can help direct you to these.  Best wishes.\n\n",

It is probable that these boils are being caused by a bacteria known as MRSA (methacillin resistant staph areus).  When staph becomes resistant to some antibiotics (notably methacillin) it also becomes more likely to cause spontaneous skin infections.  I would recommend you see your doctor for an evaluation.  You may need to have the area drained and need some antibiotics to help clear it up.  If you are getting recurrent infections there are some medicines that can be taken to help reduce the amount of the bacteria on your skin in hopes of reducing infections.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Doctor, I am a male, 48 years of age, and I have a problem, and I hope you can help me.  On June 20th, Wednesday, I had sex and the condom slipped but did not come off.   On Friday morning (June 22nd), I began to get an itching on the tip of my penis.  And it persisted throughout the weekend.  On Tuesday, I was experiencing alot pain in the shaft of my penis and inside the penis head.  It was more painful when I was seated.   Wednesday morning, I had tests done for STDs (except herpes)... all came back negative.  I was given antibotics, Z-pack, and acyclovir.  I don't have any sores or blisters or anything like that on the penis.  Just some dark diagonal streaks on the penis shaft skin, which I don't believe were there before.  I contacted my girlfriend to have her checked out. She went to the doctor and she was swabbed and took a blood test for Herpes and other STDs, and it all came back negative.  She contacted her last two boyfriends, and neither one of them is having any problems.    Also, since then my hands have become tingling, reddened and with chapped areas... no blisters or sores. I was checking my penis every 2 minutes while it was hurting. Could it be the herpes virus on my hands???   Every doctor I've gone to, and I've been to 6, all said that it wasn't herpes and I am guessing due to the absence of visual external blisters or sores, but I don't know.  Could I have the herpes sores on the inside of my penis??  I had difficult to urinate, but I have not experienced any painful urination. I am going crazy here...... It has been two weeks and I am still having pain in the shaft and itching in the penis tip. I haven't been able to sleep in two weeks.  My girlfriend insists that she is OK......and has the tests to prove it. What could it be??\n\n",

    "content": "age: 22 Sex: male Past diagnoses: Depression. Scheurmanns disease of the spine past surgeries: Tonscills family history : none Current medications:none  I noticed this yesterday while showering. It is all white in colour and is located under the foreskin below the head of the penis. Its not a spot as such you cant squeeze out any white goo inside or anything. I have been sleeping with the same girl for the past year and nobody else and this is the first time anything like this has appeared since i have been going out with her. She told me when she started sleeping together that she was 100% clean so maybe this it is something else.. its hard to describe it with words. Im really worried about this to be honest and small thigs like this can get be down very easily.  I don't really feel i can talk to anyone about this and not sure if i am brave enough to go to the doctor.. or at least id like an opinion before i go.  Thanks very much in advance  Guyinterupted\n\n",

    "content": "This must be very frustrating for you.  I'm glad you have seen a doctor and sorry you have not found answers.  In most cases anal itching, which is more common in men than women, is of no known cause.  But there are some things that irritate some people this way so I will mention some, in case anything might apply to you.  Dyes, perfumes, and chemicals on toilet paper can bother some people.  Food sensitivities can also be manifest in this way, the most common culprits being chocolate, beer, caffeine, nuts, dairy, and spicy foods.  Genital warts might also be present, causing itching and of course, hemorrhoids.  Sweating and too-tight underwear can also contribute to the problem, so you can try taking measures to eliminate these culprits.  You may also consider keeping a diary of foods and other situations such as irritants to see if there is a pattern that would allow you to identify anything that is particularly bothersome for you.    In altering diet, you could eliminate the high risk foods listed here for a couple of weeks to see if it makes a difference, then try adding back only one food at a time, possibly one food in each week, then if there is a sensitivity, you might be able to identify which food is causing the problem.      You should follow up with your doctor again about the herpes since this is the most likely reason for the pain, swelling and possibly even the itching, though it could be two separate issues entirely.  Treatment is available in the form of antiviral medication.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "1 age-19 2 sex-female 3 no past diagnoses, surgeries, or family history.  I have been practicing abstinence since February, and before that I had only been with one partner in a 2 year relationship. About a month ago (June) I noticed a pimple like bump in my pubic area.  It was not at all painful or ichy, but I told my previous partner and he said he would get checked out.  He told me he had chlamydia and his doctor gave me an antibiotic to take.  He developed worse symptoms later and his doctor said that he had not had chlamydia, but and enlarged prostate.  My bump went away in less than a week, I thought due to the antibiotic. I developed several skin tags on my upper thigh during this time.  I had some allergy symptoms, but nothing flu-like. About five days ago (July) I got another bump in the same area.  Again, it is painless and itchless.  I broke it open, thinking it was an ingrown hair, and drained a lot of the blood. Now it has scabbed and appears to be going away.  I was concered about it being herpes because of it being bumps in my pubic area, so I called my previous partner, and he said he had no such symptoms and was being regularly examined due to his enlarged prostate. I should also say that I shave, and both bumps appeared when I had used a dull razor and there was hair regrowth. I am very worried, but do not have access to medical care at this time.  What does it sould like?\n\n",

The problem i currently have consists of a few different symptoms. Over the last three weeks i have itching constantly (mainly lower abdominal region and arms, even after benedryl and itching pills subsribed by my doctor). I recently i have had this small dot on the head of my penis(maybe a blister) which has turned into a scab. Moreover, it has seemed that what i have has mildly spread to a lower section of the head. Now, i never itch in that specifed area or feel any pain (although sexual intercourse has caused the rash to spread, which it what i was referring to earlier). Basically, i have not seen the doctor for this problem because my girlfriend does not have stds at all and i of course was recently informed that i do not have anything either. The doctor saw no lines on my arms or legs, and told me that i have no visible signs of scabies. It just puzzles me now because of the blisters/scabs that have came about and prior to them appearing. Any ideas?\n\n",

After a couple of days, I started to notice my testicles started to hurt, like almost overnight. They were swollen to me. And it was hurting alot. Also I notices a little rash at the top of my pubic hair which seemed to dissappear any time i was at the hospital, the doctor could not see it. But i noticed it at night and after showers.  Although the chylmadia and gonnorea tests came back negative, the doctor treated me anyway, with cipro and doxy. Also during this period, i noticed a white-ish discharge but not when urinating, only when i was taking a *****. when i forced it out. not while pissing. Also, i experienced some kind of itchying when it all first started but that seemed to have subsided. ALSO, I NOTICED MY URINE SMELLED VERY DIFFERENT LIKE WORSE AND SO DID MY GENITAL AREA, STILL THERE BUT SUBSIDED A LITTLE   After this, i got very worried and saw a urologist, he did another urinary test there and then, which took like 10 minutes? he left and came back and told me it was negative? did he really do it? anyways, he said my testicles felt alright and that the discharge was something called prosatal fluid or something like that and that i shouldnt worry, i don't know what to do...'    Later on everything subsided, i havent seen the discharge for a while, but now, it seems like after i urinate, i feel a sensation in my penis that seems to last for about 45 minnutes. Everytime i go again, it comes back. I really don't know what to do? help?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi. I'm 35, male, heterosexual.  Had unprotected sex with a female and gave her oral sex as well.  A few things happened to me since then.  On the very next day after sex (which took place almost 2 wks ago), I began to feel like the bottom of my tongue was a little sore.  So, when i checked i noticed that middle part on the floor of the tongue, i think it's called Wharton's duct, was kind of red and had like two little dots. The doctor gave me a dental paste to try out (triamcinolone acetonide, 0.1%) to put on.  I did so, but didn't do a thing. I also began to feel a burning feeling when urinating and there was a slight clear liquid that came out of my penis.  This occurred on the third day after sex. I went to the doctor the next dayand was given doxycycline 100mg for 10 days for chlamydia treatment. I will finish my treatment this Monday, 7/9. However, the doctor did not examine me.  He went by the symptoms I told him. Now, this past Friday (which was a week 3 days from the sex) I noticed that I began to have a sore throat, while having nasal decongestion and some occassional sneezing.  My throat doesn't really hurt much, but it's really red in the back and in the pharynx I see like 1 or 2 red little bumps in the back.  I don't know if this is just simply because I got a cold or does it have to do with the oral sex i gave the girl.  I also don't know if these 2 dots on the floor of my tongue have to do with the oral sex i gave the girl.  Please answer my question and give advise.  Thanks.\n\n",

It is also quite possible that you simply have a viral cold causing your sore throat.   I would recommend you see your doctor and request a culture be done for gonorrhea since there is a possibility of exposure.  This way you can be evaluated directly to see if it is more likely a viral cold as well.  Best wishes.\n\n",

He is the only person I've had sex with without a condom, but we have both had previous partners. About two months ago, I got a single sore on my outer vaginal lip that was very red and looked like a pimple, without a head. It was filled with blood, but there was no puss or anything else that I could find in it. It healed in two days. It iched very little at first (that's how I noticed it) but that went away when I popped it, and there was no pain or anything else. I have gotten a few since then in my pubic hair, but never more than one at a time. He has never had anything similar to this occur, and neither have I, and I am wondering what it might be?\n\n",

None of these are sore and, to the best of my knowledge, I have never noticed any soreness of my foreskin.   After searching Google etc etc, I would most liken them to Warts, but have also heard of Penile Papules......  Further; I have, for some time now (almost 2 years), been getting sharp pains and aches in my left chest area, lower left rib and left kidney area..... could these be linked to any STI you know of?  I am extremely concerned that I may have contracted something and have been ignorant of it, but, at the same time, am scared by the prospect of visiting a clinic for testing.

    "content": "Pearly penile papules, as you mention, can be mistaken for warts.  They are typically found circumferentially around the corona (edge closed to the body) of the head of the penis.  Occasionally they will extend up onto the head some.  It would be unusual for them to start at the tip and spread towards the base of the head of the penis.    Pearly penile papules are harmless and do not need treatment.  Warts, on the other hand, are caused by a virus called human papilloma virus that is an STI.    The location you are describing sounds a little atypical for pearly penile papules so I would recommend that you be evaluated.  There are other possibilities as well, such as a contact dermatitis or other skin irritation.  If STI testing is a concern, there are often clinics that can test you anonymously.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "36, F. My query is rather complicated but I will try to be as concise as possible. Several years ago, I began developing rashes. I was diagnosed with contact dermatitis and after switching to natural deodorants, staying out of the sun, and eating shellfish, I have been virtually rash-free for over a year. The worst outbreak occured on vacation in Cabo. I awoke after a day in the sun to a rash that made my face swell to what seemed like double its size, as well as my upper-chest. When this happens, I go on prednisone and the rash, after a few weeks, gradually disappears.  Though I have been lucky to not have another outbreak like this (I had some patch tests done my my dermatologist;allergies to lanolin and nickel showed up), I have developed other strange skin disorders. For example, I have developed what seems like a chronic ear disorder. I was given antibiotics and a cream (a mix of an acid and hydrocortisone) for a rash on the inside that was insanely itchy. The right ear also oozed a liquid that ranged in color anywhere from clear to milky-white. It would also crust over on the inside and the more of it I removed, the more it came back. I have since then been flushing my ear with a syringe every morning and then placing a small amount of cream on the inside. This seems to help but there are times when it still feels itchy.  Also, I have had some issues with genital itching. Let me preface this by saying that I have not had unprotected sex and I've had the same sex partner for 2 years. I am hesitant to believe I have herpes because of my past sexual history. The rash is very itchy, especially at night (almost exclusively at night). The same goes for my ear. Sometimes, before a flare up, I feel a bit strange. Lethargic would be the best word and I find that when I work out, I have breathing difficulties. This lasts for anywhere from a day to three days. Also, my symptoms don't ever seem to completely disappear. There's always something going on, to some degree.  Can someone please tell me what might be going on? My doctor did a lupus test on me 1.5 years ago but that was negative. I've been back and forth to my primary physician and my dermatologist (I also have acne issues but they are under control) and right now am tired of getting the run around.   Skin disorders run in my family, on my father's side, but from what I understand, eczema is to blame. Both my doctor and I suspected an autoimmune disorder but as I said previously, blood tests were negative.  I would appreciate the help madrid\n\n",

Lesions that usually get dry and turn into scabs include bacterial folliculitis (inflammations in hairy areas of the skin), infected bumps, herpetic lesions (less likely) especially when they are traumatized by scraping them.   STDs are less likely to present with similar symptoms.  Avoid scraping these lesions as well as exposure to any skin irritant till you consult your doctor.  Direct clinical examination is essential. Keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "title": "Rash on underside of penis",
    "content": "I'd appreciate any professional advice. I'll try to keep the background brief:  I am a 36 year old male currently taking no meds. Two years ago I had protected sex with a new partner. However, she also performed unprotected oral sex. At the time, I had a small coldsore (just developing).  A few days after sex, I developed a painful series of bumps (looked like large pimples) around the base of my penis...I went to a walk-in clinic and they took a culture for herpes. It came back negative.  A few months later, I developed the pimply rash again. I went to my general practitioner and he said it was definitely not herpes. He treated me for impetigo and scabies.  Since that time, I've felt like my groin area is extra sensitive although no rashes developed. I've had itching in the areas between my legs and groin (no rashes). (I exercise daily and sweat a lot.)  I have had the same partner for these two years. We had protected sex and unprotected oral sex the other day and within 24 hours I developed a different-looking rash (no bumps) on the underside of my penis toward the base. It is quite red and itches.  Thanks in advance for your assistance.\n\n",

I\u2019ve been tested for all STD\u2019s and I did test positive for herpes, which I believe I contracted 10+ years ago from an ex, but I never have any breakouts.  On my last appointment (month ago) I had a light vaginal discharge with mild lower back pain and they diagnosed me with Cervicitis and gave me antibiotics.  This has been the second antibiotic treatment I\u2019ve had in 5 months and now I\u2019m having the same symptoms again.  Is this normal?  The vaginal discharge is a milky color and has no odor.  I know that Cervicitis can be caused by herpes, but I\u2019ve never had any out breaks.  My mother suffered from Lupus but I don\u2019t think that these are symptoms of Lupus.

    "content": "I would recommend that you follow up with your gynecologist for further testing.  Your description is very consistent with a condition called mucopurulent cervicitis.  This can be from gonorrhea, chlamydia or several other infectious causes.    If your clinic is able you should have the gonorrhea and chlamydia urine testing done.  This is much more sensitive than is the culture for these two bacteria.  If you were treated with a one dose treatment this is generally effective; however, you may need to have a longer treatment.  Also, there are resistant strains of these bacteria appearing so you may need to use a different antibiotic.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,   For the past couple years, sometimes when I am sick or hungover, I get this bump in my groin area.  It's always in the same location on my inner thigh.  It usually is a slightly red sore patch  about the size of a 1/2 dollar with one lump in the middle like a pencil eraser.  It's very tender but usually goes away in a day or two.   The first time it happened, it freaked me out enough that I went to the emergency room.   Although they didn't do any tests they told me it looked like an ingrown hair and seemed really unconcerned.   I would like to get it checked out but whenever it happens, it's gone before I can get in to see a doctor.  Does this sound like Herpes?  I have never had a sore anywhere else....  If I were to go to a clinic to get tested, could I do this anonymously or do they have to report me or something...  Thanks!\n\n",

    "title": "Penile Ulcers (please help!)",
    "content": "I am a 25 yo male from ireland. Last week, i noticed very small ulcers under my foreskin which became painful when i pulled my foreskin back. Then a couple of days ago, there were 2 or 3 ulcers on my shaft. I went to the docs and he asked me about my sexual activity; i've been with my g/f for 1-2 years and we have been totally faithful to each other. So he said there was no point going to an STD clinic. He couldn't tell me how i'd gotten them and what they were from. He was pretty sure it isn't an STD and prescribed two different antibiotics. I've been on the tablets for 2 days, but i'm no better. The tip of my foreskin is now swollen due to the ulcers and the \"eye\" of my penis is now a little red. I am also tender at the left side of my pubic region (lymph nodes??) only. The ulcers that are on my shaft are starting to turn a darker colour, as if they were scabbing away (hopefully).  Since neither my g/f or me have slept/kissed anyone else, could this be an std or just a bacterial infection. Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "If you both have been 100% faithful and there is not doubt of this, then it is unlikely that you have an STD.  Even in the most trusting relationships I still recommend STD testing because some infections can be spread even though the partner is asymptomatic (especially HSV).  This way, when everything comes back negative everyone can be reassured that these are off the list.  Also, I would be a little concerned about a skin infection such as with staph.  You may need to change antibiotics to cover for resistant forms of staph (MRSA) if you are not currently on such coverage.    If there are vesicles or areas to culture I would recommend doing so.  It sounds as if your issues are fairly severe.  I would strongly recommend that you follow up with your doctor soon to adjust your medications.  If oral medications are not covering the infection you may need an IV form for a few days.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Question now it is 6 months after  I am experiencing a post urination dribble (which is new), and after ejaculation a clear sticky substance is leaking out of penis up to 2 hours after climax, and is even present after urination post climax, this is new and concerning for me.

It has stopped itching, but today it oozed a little bit of whitish fluid.  I have had no other problems down there (not painful to urinate, no swelling) and it has not spread anywhere else.  I also have cold symptoms but I am not sure that this is related since I have been feeling the illness coming on for a week now.  Could this be herpes?

Also, typically genital herpes is usually caused by HSV 2 and oral cold sores are usually caused by HSV 1.  However, both strains of virus can cause infections in both places.  It is possible that if either of you have had a cold sore, the virus may have been trasmitted by hand contact to the genital area causing infection there.  If you have not yet been infected there are some things that can be done to help minimize your chances of infection, including your husband taking medications to prevent outbreaks.  This can be discussed with your husband's doctor or your gynecologist.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Later a little pimple formed on the head of my penis.  It went away in just a few days with no itching, burning, scabbing, scarring, etc. Also, I started to notice little bumps on my penis (which I've read up on, and the closest thing I can find is that they are the PPP things), except that they're not on the underside, as much as on the right side of the shaft going up, and a couple on the top, semi-towards the base (maybe 8-10 in total).  Then Last week pimples showed up in my pubic region, starting from about 2\" up from the base of my penis going up to my belly button.  Maybe 10 showed up.  The part that's worrying me is that I noticed them all at the same time.    Nothing I have itches, burns, etc. I've been with my current SO for about 7 months, she has never shown any symptoms.

    "content": "Skin-to-skin contact is essentially exactly as it sounds.  Skin must contact skin.  In the case of HPV infections, skin is also taken to include mucous membranes (such as those lining the vagina and cervix).    Contact to these areas with infected skin can result in transfer of the virus and infection.  Prevention is centered on limiting skin-to-skin contact. Condoms help to prevent infection but it is important to remember that condoms do not cover all the skin in the perineal area and thus contact with the skin that is not covered can result in infection.  The only way to definitively tell what strain is causing infection is to do genetic typing in the lab.  Certain strains are known to typically cause certain types of infection.  For example, types 6,8 and 11 are often associated more with genital warts and types 16 and 18 are more associated with cancerous changes of the cervix.  An infected person may also show no signs of infection.  Best wishes.\n\n",

They are not painful or itchy and I have noticed no other symptoms.  Should I go see my doctor?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, i am 21, male and currently take oral medication for acne and herbal tea to hopefully help try a diagonised kidney stone i have.  Onto symtoms now, and i think i have had jock itch before and what i have now doesn't appear to be the same, although the area infected does seem quite sweaty and admittedly these last few days i have not been very hygenic. However, I have felt itchyness on my right testicle days before and on an area just about on the underside and to the right coming close to the inner thigh. It is now red sore but i think this is due to scratching it. I don't see any bumps either. This is only itchy on my right side and right testicle. On the skin on the inner right thigh (..and when i close my legs the infected areas of the testicle and the thigh touch each other perfectly, possibly showing all along it is just friction, however i would disagree as this is not like any other symtom i'v had before) are lots of little red spots and if i run my finger over it they fill alittle bumpy although they look totally flat on the skin almost like birth mark spots but red!  i also had unprotected sex about 10 days ago. the itcying has been a few days now but i can't remember if i had mild itchying before hand. Because of this stupid drunkened mistake, is the reason i am here now worried. Basically, i have quite an itchy right testicle that is reddish but i cant see any spots (doesn't mean they aren't there), it is a tingling sensation and goes away when scratched. the area is quite sweaty also. I also have lots of little red spots on my upper inner right thigh but no discomfort of any sort there (i could not tell the spots were there until i looked), also i only noticed the spots after scratching purposely harder and looking around a second time (meaning the spots just suddendly came up, although this does not mean that they had not come up earlier. Also, i have just noticed, one or two red spots of the same sort appearing on my left thigh, and my left testicle once/twice got itchy, but all that might be being blown up in my head as i am worried. so could this be herpes, or any other form of STD? i really hope not. The girl is also known as a 'bike' too, to add to my stupid mistake and worries, which is probably why i am worrying more.    Sorry for the long post, i just figured the more info i could give, the better the response. thank you in advanced.\n\n",

    "content": "Generally, wisdom is that if there is any possibility of an STD you should be tested for all of them.  Often there are local health departments that can do the testing anonymously if you wish.  It doesn't sound too much like an STD but best to be safe.  Your symptoms may be due to a yeast infection of the skin (a form of jock itch).  You may also have some irritation from excess moisture and friction (sort of like a diaper rash in babies).  Keeping the area clean and dry will help the latter.  I would suggest you get a formal evaluation to be sure that you get the right treatment.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I realise you cant diagonise and you shouldn't anyway because it is always better a physical examination.    But....  The red spots on my inner thigh...i think i could notice ten minutes ago that a white ring had formed around one or two of the spots but can't seem to notice it again now...if this is there, what could that possibly mean?? and also, even tho they are small many spots one or two closer to the testicles are much bigger than the rest (0.5cm), they also appear to be different to the rest like more rough or dry that could possibly break (but its not a blister, atleast don't think it is). My testicles are red raw now also and on my penis are some redness patches but this is the kind that you wouldnt pull up and say anything about...just thought worth a mention (it just looks like pigmentation tho, or skin discolouration or something) as it is getting itchy now on my left side also on the underside but also on the left of the penis just on top of the left testicle also.   sorry, but what do you think about this development, could it be just a yeast infection developing or an outbreak of herpes or something. this will be my last post, thank you.\n\n",

When we were done, the next day actually, I noticed my penis was rubbed raw on one side. Like a rug burn. It healed some and then seemed to get infected. There were no white pimples like described in the other questions. Almost like sores from that had been in water. Like a kid in a pool with a band aid.  The rubs are almost gone now after almost a month. It seems like they heealed up half way and then got infected.  At the same time my wife and I joined weight watchers and started exercising and we have been pulling weeds like crazy. I say this because my legs have been sore as if I had the flu. Aches in my hamstrings etc.  I mentioned this to a buddy and they said their brother had herpes and part of it was leg aches.

    "content": "Friends-  35 year old male with no history of med problems.  I'm in a world of confusion and need some help.  12 days ago I had unprotected oral and protected vaginal with a new partner.  We did use a condom, but I didn't get a chance to check the condom for damage afterwards.  It is possible that it could have ripped because she put it on, she has long nails, and things got pretty rough.  7 days after we were done I noticed 2 small red bumps in the area just above the penis.  Not on it, but the skin area between the penis and waistline.  There were/are no other symptoms of any kind.  No itching, burning, etc.  I saw a urologist 3 days after seeing the bumps who conducted a urine test and visual exam.  The urine was negative (Bullet #1 dodged!), and he said the bumps, which now number 4, were Mollocsum Contagiosum.  He said that it was probably not herpes and did not recommend a blood test, then he prescribed Condylox gel to get rid of the bumps.  After Googling MC, there were a lot of things that didn't jive.  My bumps don't have craters and are a reddish color.  No where was Condylox recommended even if it was MC.  So I decided to get a 2nd opinion.  The 2nd urologist also conducted a urine test and a little more thorough physical exam.  The urine came back clean - just double checking!  He said that it wasn't MC but probably folliculitis or something along those lines, perhaps caused by rough sex and agitated by my active lifestyle.  I've never had bumps/folliculitis like this before, so I find it hard to believe that pure coincidence would make something like this appear 7 days after intercourse.  He said it wasn't contagious - a far cry from the highly contagious MC.  He said it most likely wasn't herpes because that usually shows up on one side of the area above the genitalia and not directly over it.  He advised that I discontine the Condylox.  I told him  that I preferred to do a blood test if there was any question that it could be herpes and he obliged.  Results due back in a week.  Here are my concerns:  1)  Should I continue the Condylox just to be safe? 2)  Does it sound like herpes or something more serious? 3)  What does the urine test eliminate?  Chlamydia?  Gonorrhea?  I can't find a clear answer on this anywhere. 4)  Should I discontinue intercourse of any kind until the condition goes away?  If it does go away, am I still contagious as a carrier of whatever the heck it is?  This is the one that concerns me most.  Please help!!!\n\n",

    "content": "Hopefully this will help answer your questions:  1)  Condylox is generally used to treat genital warts caused by the virus HPV.  From your description, this may actually be what you have.  Condoms help prevent, but do not 100% protect against HPV infection as skin to skin contact can spread the virus.  If your doctors do not think this will be helpful then you can stop using it.  While it wasn't directly designed to treat molluscum, in theory it would work as the treatment is essentially the same as with HPV-destruction of the lesion.  2) Your description does not sound like a herpes lesion which are typically more vesicular (blister-like) then scab over.  The best test for herpes is actually to unroof one of the blisters and do a culture of the skin at the bottom of the blister.  Blood tests are much less sensitive for skin herpes.  3) Urine testing looks for inflammation of the urethra/prostate/bladder.  It is a screening test for infections with gonorrhea and chlamydia.  Keep in mind that this is really only a screening test.  If you are suspicious of infection, a culture or DNA probe testing for GC/chlamydia should be performed.  4) If you suspect you may have an infectious illness, discontinuation of intercourse is always wise.  Regarding possibly being a carrier, this is completely dependent on what is actually going on.  Some infections remain dormant and can be spread.  Others go away once treated.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you so much Dr. Lowe.  My original post was 2.5 weeks ago, and since that time I have received a blood test with all negatives (I know HIV won't show up til later, but I'm not overly concerned about that one).  The 2nd urologist prescribed Cephalexin, which I've just completed, and the redness has reduced considerably.  I'm still concerned about when I might 'safely' begin intercourse again to reduce exposure to anyone else.  I've searched the web thoroughly and can't find an answer.  Is it once my skin looks normal again?   Is there a minimum period I should wait?  Any help would be MUCH appreciated.\n\n",

Could this be some type of STD? I have had sex with 4 people, 3 of which were a while ago now.. They don't hurt at all, they only become red if i have sex or masturbate.. i've always used a condom while enganging in sex also.  I havn't been to a doctor about it.. i havn't even really found anything about it on the internet.. i don't think its herpes or anything like that but i'm no doctor so i can't say for sure..

If the area is not improving in the next several days I would recommend that you be evaluated by your doctor.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I was given oral sex by my wife who a few days who later had a reoccurrance of Herpes Type 1 in the mouth (it had been years since the last one).  I understand that it is possible to transmit type 1 to the genital area even without showing visible signs.  However, from everything I've read and seen (pictures), what  I am showing is not typical signs of the herpes virus.  A week or so after the oral sex, a burning irritation/discomfort near the penis opening about a week and a couple of days ago.  I never saw any visible signs until last night when I looked more closely.    I found 2 VERY VERY small (pin head sized) black dots that are only irritated when touched and the burning last for a little while afterwards.  They are around 2 millimeters apart from one another.  I've looked many times to make sure they are black, not brown, or white, and definitely not red.   I wonder if it might be a bite of some kind, but of course, the deeper fear is that it is herpes type 1.   I hope that the black dots are just a coincidence and not something more.  Does this sound like anything you've heard of in regard to an STD?  Thank you very much for your help.\n\n",

    "content": "Most commonly genital herpes occurs due to HSV type 2 and oral herpes occurs due to HSV type 1.  Either virus can cause outbreaks in either location, however.  It is possible to get genital herpes from contact with an oral HSV lesion (though not as common as infection from genital contact).  Your symptoms do not sound classic for an HSV infection.  Typically, HSV lesions are more blister like initially then scab over.    You may also be experiencing some irritation of the skin due to trauma or a contact dermatitis.  If you continue to have the symptoms I would recommend evaluation by your doctor.  If HSV is in question a culture can be done.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 34-year-old lesbian. Sexually, I have a gf (of one year), and we engage in vulvar frottage. She gave me unprotected oral sex one time.  Here is my question:  I have been having an itchy, white rectal discharge and a strange-smelling vaginal discharge since June.   My doctor tested me for chlamydia, gonorrhea, HIV infection, yeast infection, BV and diabetes. All tests came back negative.  Finally, my doctor had me take cleocin ovules for three days, and it seems to have cleared up the odor. However, that feeling of dampness around my anus, and the itchy white rectal discharge is still present. Sometimes it looks like white clumps in the toilet bowl.  Here is my question ...  I know this can be a symptom of gonorrhea. My doctor tested me for gonorrhea vaginally and the test came back negative. If I have rectal gonorrhea, will it show up on a test that was done vaginally? Or does a swab have  to be taken from the rectum to diagnose it?  Thanks for your help.\n\n",

We had protected sex the other day for the first time, and then she informed me about the herpes afterwards.

Do I need to be extra conscious when I touch her sexually? Meaning do I need to make sure I don't get her fluids on other parts of my body? Should I wash my hands often? Are there risks associated with touching and petting? 3. What about sex without a condom?\n\n",

Usually HSV-1 causes cold sores or fever blisters on or around the lips and HSV-2 affects areas below the waist, causing genital herpes. But both HSV-1 and HSV-2 viruses can cause herpes outbreaks in either area.(I, e.. can be transmitted by touching/ or oral sex to your genitals after being exposed to someone who has an active outbreak or cold sore.   There is not a cure Once a person has been infected with HSV 1 OR 2 . Even though your girlfriend is taking Valtrex (which only aides in controlling break-outs) It does not guarentee that the virus cannot be passed even if medication is taken every day. Even if  your partner has been outbreak free for a year does not mean that you have not been exposed to the virus.  It is recommened that a condom should be used during intercourse to help control the spread of any STD including HSV.\n\n",

    "content": "I am so tired of having outbreaks and yet my doctors don't do anything. I keep telling them I have it but they just rely on the tests. I keep getting sores and it is not fun at all. I could be taking something to help prevent them from coming so frequently. I have hadfour outbreaks since July last year. I think that is even to much for me. It is hard to work through the day and take care of kids and then have this on your mind all the time. I am very frustrated. Is there any test that I should be telling my doctor about so he can do it to really show me the results of it. I don't like feeling this way anymore and having to deal with the pain and smells. It is not fun. please help me with my problems.  sincerely spybear a very worried patron\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 37 year old male.  I have never been diagnosed with any kind of STD.  I had unprotected sex about two weeks before this occured.  I am taking Batrim for a sinus infection that I have.  I also take diovan HCT for blood pressure.  I have an itching that started at right under the head of my penis.  After that the head of my penis became red in one area. This area is also wrinkled up and feels dry.  Itching has occured on the head and in the crease under the head of the penis.    The red area also showed some white flakes that kind of look like dry skin.  Could this be Herpes or Jock Itch.  I have never had Jock Itch that I know of so I am not sure what it looks like.  Another thing is that I have started having bad tension headaches about 4 days before this but I have no idea if that could be related or not.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Direct clinical examination is essential for the diagnosis.  These lesions could be due to one of the following causes:  - Friction and fungus occurs in an area where skin rubbing against skin is highly frequent.  Skin rubbing against skin generates heat and sweat, they in turn lead to, redness and , painful Itchy patches.  Obese and active people are more susceptible.  The Itch may progress into inflammation and becomes more complicated.  If caused by fungus, the Itch and redness will be more gradually. In such cases, the patches of scaly skin will have defined, ring-like borders\u2014hence the medical name Tinea cruris, or ringworm of the groin. Fungus-caused jock Itch predominates in the summer.   - Herpes simplex, which  is one of the sexually transmitted disease. Genital herpes is a very common disease caused by Herpes virus type2. It spread by direct contact. It results in small, very painful blisters (fluid is inside the lesion)on the penis and anus in men, genital irritation, itching, and discharge, swelling, reddening, or a feeling of pressure in the groin. The sores turns into crust, that scab and heal in about 3 weeks   Other causes like folliculitis, dermatitis should be excluded too.  I advise you to seek direct medical consultation. Best regards.\n\n",

One can get the chicken pox from a person with shingles if there is contact with the opened vesicles.  Shingles tends to be quite painful and almost always is only on one side.  The rash you describe is much more likely to be razor irritation.  Herpes lesions typically are more vesicular (blister like) than they are small red bumps.  If you are concerned I would recommend evaluation by a physician to make an accurate diagnosis.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "Having your gynecologist say that she is not sure what the rash is makes me wonder myself.  Cortisone creams are good for most inflammatory type reactions, including razor burn; however, it is possible that the cream may be causing some irritation or clogging pores.  Additionally, you may have a case of folliculitis-inflamed hair follicles-that may need some antibiotics if they have become secondarily infected.    I would avoid using steriod creams in the genital area for any prolonged period of time as they can cause skin atrophy easier in this area than other skin areas.  You may consider taking a break for shaving the affected area to give the skin a chance to heal, also.  A slight moisturizer may be of help.  Having said that, I would agree with your doctor.  If she did not recognize what the rash was I would recommend evaluation by a dermatologist.  Better to get a definite diagnosis and use the right treatment than trying multiple treatments that may help or may worsen your symptoms.  Hope this helps.  Keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Genital HPV infection is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) that is caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). Human papillomavirus is the name of a group of viruses that includes more than 100 different strains or types. More than 30 of these viruses are sexually transmitted, and they can infect the genital area of men and women including the skin of the penis, vulva (area outside the vagina), or anus, and the linings of the vagina, cervix, or rectum. Most people who become infected with HPV will not have any symptoms and will clear the infection on their own.  Some of these viruses are called \"high-risk\" types, and may cause abnormal Pap tests. They may also lead to cancer of the cervix, vulva, vagina, anus, or penis.  A Pap test can detect pre-cancerous and cancerous cells on the cervix. Regular Pap testing and careful medical follow-up, with treatment if necessary, can help ensure that pre-cancerous changes in the cervix caused by HPV infection do not develop into life threatening cervical cancer. The Pap test used in U.S. cervical cancer screening programs is responsible for greatly reducing deaths from cervical cancer. For 2004, the American Cancer Society estimates that about 10,520 women will develop invasive cervical cancer and about 3,900 women will die from this disease. Most women who develop invasive cervical cancer have not had regular cervical cancer screening.  Basically, if you are getting regular PAP tests every 6 months to a year, and they aare not comming back with abrmomal cells(precancerous cells)  then all you need to do is monitor your condition.   A hysterectomy is quite a drastic measure, and would not be concidered a preventative measure for this condition. At 21, you may change your mind in the comming years about having children. A doctor would only perform a hysterectomy at this age only if it were medically nessessary.( for example, if cancer was diagnosed.)   Your best preventative care is to make sure to get regular PAP tests every 6 months to a year.\n\n",

I am more concerned about why you feel you want these surgeries. why are you not comfortable with doctors touching you?

    "title": "Risk of HCV and HIV???",
    "content": "I screwed up and need your technical expertise. I am a 32 heterosexual male with negative HIV and HCV status.  I met a woman and she gave me a hand job 28 Dec 06. I do not know her status or even her last name for that matter (stupid, stupid stupid). The reason i am concernecd is she spit on her hand several times to lube it up--it was cold so my peeper was dry and chaffed. Anyways, After a couple of spitting episodes (maybe 4 minutes) which didnt work so well so she put some lotion on. Turned out the contained alcohol and burned a bit. Later that day, the chaffing was pretty bad--it was really red. I am a bit concerned because she had spit on her hand then rubbed me on my very chaffed peeper (Im a SCRUBS fan what can i say). Also, I had masterbated myself about 2 hours earlier--not sure if that could contribute to more tears in the skin.   Well the next day I started having \"symptoms\" to include fatigue, pain in the back of my neck, trembling, tingling of my feet and hands and diarrea.  At 9 days, i started \"noticing\" the area above my liver--it doesnt hurt but I can just feel it which i usually don't. Should i be concerned for HIV, HCV, or any other diseases? Normally before i engage in sexual activity of any kind, i am in a realationship and we get tested--but the little head overcame the big head in this case. I could really use your advise--the anxiety is crippling me. Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Both HIV and HCV are considered to be spread primarily through blood and genital secretions.  Saliva, while possibly containing some virus, generally does not have enough virus to transmit an infection.  Additionally, there needs to be good access to the blood supply to allow infection.  Given the combination of skin chaffing and low viral concentrations you are likely to be fine; however, both these viruses can have some serious consequences, so it would not be a bad idea to be tested anyway.  Plus, if you're tested and return negative it'll help ease your mind.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "The incubation period for HSV is reported as 2 days to 2 weeks.  Often the initial infection is asymptomatic but not always.  Thus, it is possible that you may have had an outbreak 3 days after sexual contact if you were infected at that time.  If there is some question as to the diagnosis a culture for the herpes virus can be performed.  Generally herpes virus is quite easy to grow in the lab, so the test is quite reliable.  Also, remember that STD's often do not travel alone.  If you have not been screened for other STD's it's a good idea to do so.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I'm a 22-year-old caucasian female. I've seen a gyno regularly since I was 17. However, I skipped my last annual because I'm afraid what might result. Almost a year ago I dated a male approximately the same age for less than a month and during a date one night he forced me to have sex (unprotected). Unlike random sexual assault cases, I got to talk to the person for some time (i.e \"get to know them\"). Prior to the incident he informed me he was being treated for a UTI. I remember reading that an std can masquerade as a UTI or be a symptom.   In addition, I have been shaving my pubic area for around six years now, always with irritation and ingrown hairs, sometimes shaving several days in a row (shaving over the same area a few times..I don't like hair ).  I have no other symptoms or complaints other than pimple-like bumps. I have noticed hairs inside some of the bumps, so I plucked them and two would come out instead of one. Could this simply be ingrown hairs?   The bumps disappear within the range of 2 to 14 days, depending on if I manipulate them. They are single bumps, no clusters with no calliflower-like appearance. They're located from the leg creases toward the ahem lower buttocks, but still remain on the inside of my leg (almost in the space between the buttocks). I had one inside the fold of the vagina (the outer lips). I think it is pertinent to say that I shave all over the genital area and the space between the buttocks. The bumps only form where I shave (this including the inside fold of the outter lips of the vagina. I never noticed the bumps in the buttocks area, lips or creases before, but after the unprotected intercourse I was more conscious and it was about 2 months after that I noticed the bumps in other places than the more visible pubic bone areas.  Also, I had an unrelated surgery recently in which a blood test had to be conducted before proceeding. I was told all was well. Does that matter?  I was also on antibiotics for a month (unrelated) and during that time didn't see any changes with the bumps...growth acceleration or being inhibited.  I'm driving myself crazy with this. Should I suck it up and see a doctor?\n\n",

Warts tend to have the \"cauliflower\" like look to them and do not typically resolve in a matter of days.  I would suggest you be evaluated by your gynecologist to be sure.    As a side note, most sexual assaults/rapes occur by someone the victim knows.  If you are having any trouble dealing with this, I recommend you find a counselor to talk with.  They can be of tremendous help, even just to tell someone what happened.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

We were both tested for all STDs and HIV before this and we both showed up negative for everything. Well about two days ago I masturbated and notice that my foreskin was really red. The skin seems to be very dry and flakey on the foreskin. I masturbated a few times after that. It does not hurt unless I touch it. The skin is red and raised, and  it feels kinda rawI don't know if this is a STD or because I am masturbating to much and my skin is dry. But I got a really bad cold around the same time this all started to happen so that is what really kinda making me wonder.   Any help would would be great thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Dysuria refers to any difficulty in urination. This would include any pain, discomfort, or burning sensation during urination.  It is most often a result of an infection of the urinary tract. Sometimes these symptoms can coincide with an STD or yeast infection. In men, the urinary system overlaps with the reproductive system, so dysuria can also be a result of genital infection.  Causes include urethritis caused by gonorrhea or chlamydia and is usually accompanied by discharge. Prostatitis, interstitial cystitis, radiation cystitis as well as urinary retention can all cause dysuria.   Its very possible that the rash is not related to the burning micturition. Do you have a fever?  Disseminated gonococcal infection occurs following 1% of genital infections. Patients may present with symptoms of rash, fever, arthralgias, migratory polyarthritis, septic arthritis, endocarditis, or meningitis. This condition is more common in women.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Those are symptoms of urethritis which is a UTI as mentioned above. There are two main types:  1. Gonococcal urethritis and  2. non-gonococcal or non-specific urethritis (NSU).  Gonococcal urethritis (gonorrhoea) is caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae and is transmitted by sexual intercourse, including oral sex. Without treatment, the infection can continue for many months.  Non-gonococcal urethritis can be cause by a number of organisms including, Chlamydia trachomatis (25-60 per cent), Mycoplasma genitalium (up to 25 per cent), Ureaplasma urealyticum (15-25 per cent), Trichomonas vaginalis (17 per cent) and Herpes simplex (rarely).  In very few cases of non-gonococcal urethritis are reported not to be caused by sexual transmission. The symptoms in these cases are blamed on irritants, soaps or detergents, but no firm evidence exists to support this theory.  More commonly, this is a sexually transmitted disease. In such a case you should be examined in a sexually transmitted disease clinic (STD clinic). Otherwise you should seek help of a genito-urinary specialist or an andrologist, if one is available in your area.   Keep us updated.  Best regards,\n\n",

Just another question, if you don't mind answering, I know it doesnt have anything to do with this forum, but I think you would know. Could a rash that does not go away be caused by photosensitivity caused by minocycline, with over exposure to the sun?  Thank you\n\n",

Sun screen should always be worn while on these medicines.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

Could a rash that appears whilst on holiday, while being frequently in the sun, very sweaty, and taking bacteria killing minocycline cause Pityrosporum Folliculitis. I know that this is caused by some sort of fungal infection(?), and with the minocycline killing the bacteria this would leave the field open other things?  Just a thought, I'm going to try to see the doctor tommorow and discuss this with him. I googled Pityrosporum Folliculitis and came across some pictures and symptoms that seem to match, except I rarely have itching.  Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  HPV is a heterogeneous group of viruses that contain closed circular double-stranded DNA.   There are more than 30 types of genital HPV that can infect the genital area of men, including the skin on and around the penis or anus.   There is not an approved test to detect HPV in men. However, infection is usually expected in men who have long time relationship with women positive for HPV.  Those who develop genital warts are easily diagnosed by clinical examination. Genital warts are usually diagnosed by visual inspection and tissue examination is possible.  When it is suspected, some doctors may use a vinegar solution to help identify flat warts, although  not specific for warts and a normal skin may give results similar to that of warts.   In gay, bisexual, and HIV-positive men, some recommend routine anal Pap tests for screening.   It is not important to diagnose the disease in men for fear for complication or for specific treatment although Genital human papillomavirus (HPV) is a sexually transmitted virus, most men will not develop health problems from HPV.   The importance of diagnosis comes from the fact that men at high risk for developing warts should be followed carefuly and should be aware for not transmitting the disease for their partner.  In women, HPV infection alone does not cause malignant transformation of infected tissue. Cofactors increase the like hood chance for malignant transformation, like  tobacco use, pregnancy, folate deficiency, and immune suppression.   Hope this information is useful. Best regards.\n\n",

I was diagnosed with a yeast infection and she said the bumps were probably just irritated tissue from itching that would go away on their own.  They haven't disappeared and still look the same, no bigger, no smaller.  It's not single raised bumps, it could be a cluster of them, but it just looks like big raised bumps.

    "content": "I am a 24 year old female who has been diagnoed with genital herpes. I have only had 2 outbreaks I think and I take Famvir when they occur which works relativley well.  I just had my second outbreak about a week and a half ago. It was pretty painful so I took my medication and after about 2 days once i was done my prescription i started feeling better. Yesterday I noticed the skin on my labia minora is peeling slightly and I have a sore spot closer to my clitoris. I can find anything there it is just sore. When I get my sores from outbreaks they usually end to be closer to the opening of my vagina. My question is is it possible to have another outbreak so close to already having one?\n\n",

It results in small, very painful blisters (fluid is inside the lesion)on the penis and anus in men, genital irritation, itching, and discharge, swelling, reddening, or a feeling of pressure in the groin. The sores turns into crust, that scab and hea in about 3 weeks.  Most people diagnosed with a first episode of genital herpes are expect to have four or five symptomatic recurrences) within a year. With time frequency will decrease.  Recurrent episodes are usually seen during periods of low body immunity.

This morning I found a bump above my vagina, in the groin area, to the left side. It was red and about 1/2 a centimeter in diameter and was filled with puss and tender to the touch. Due to rubbing, it opened up during the day and has been bleeding/pussing the past while. It's now purple. The last time I had sex was 4 months ago. Is it possible that this is herpes?

However, it is more likely to be due to: Infection and inflammation of the hair follicles and sebaceous (sweat) glands. They may be infected, trichomycosis in the case of sweat glands and folliculitis in the case of hair follicles.   They may be visible as small nodules or might only be felt as small lumps in the skin which are yellow/black or red nodules. They may contain pus in them.   The hallmark is that they will have a hair arising from them that reveals their true nature. These lesions can be associated with erythema and itching. Superinfection with other dermatophytes has been noted.  Direct clinical examination is essential. Hope you find this information useful. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Transparent penile discharge could be from prostatic secretions after straining.   Opaque white discharge from the penis then it could be a sexually transmitted disease.  Common causes of penile discharge are 1. Gonococcal urethritis and 2. non-gonococcal or non-specific urethritis (NSU).  Gonococcal urethritis (gonorrhoea) is caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae and is transmitted by sexual intercourse, including oral sex. Without treatment, the infection can continue for many months.  Non-gonococcal urethritis can be cause by a number of organisms including, Chlamydia trachomatis (25-60 per cent), Mycoplasma genitalium (up to 25 per cent), Ureaplasma urealyticum (15-25 per cent), Trichomonas vaginalis (17 per cent) and Herpes simplex (rarely).  In very few cases of non-gonococcal urethritis are reported not to be caused by sexual transmission. The symptoms in these cases are blamed on irritants, soaps or detergents, but no firm evidence exists to support this theory.  More commonly, this is a sexually transmitted disease. In such a case you should be examined in a sexually transmitted disease clinic (STD clinic). Otherwise you should seek help of a genito-urinary specialist or an andrologist, if one is available in your area.   Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "I would strongly suggest STD testing.  There are many STD's that can cause burning and itching for both women and men.  (I am presuming based on the question that you are not using barrier methods for prevention.  If you are, consider allergies to the latex.)  Most often when one partner has an STD the other will also contract it.    There are other explanations for the itching/burning feeling you describe.  For example, some women seem to be allergic to semen, thus causing the itching/burning feeling.  However, given that your boyfriend also has symptoms it makes these types of explanations less likely.  There are generally clinics that can screen you anonymously and without charge.  While hypothyroidism would not cause your symptoms with intercourse, it can cause a slew of other symptoms that can be significantly impacting on your health.  I would agree with Theresa about investigating programs to help you be able to get treatment for this.  You'll be amazed at how much better you feel when your thyroid is normal-even if you don't feel that bad now.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I am hoping that if I describe some of my boyfriend's symptoms, you might be able to tell me what they are- and if it's something he might pass onto me.   He has been complaining of lower abdomin pain for a year. Three inches below his navel and about three inches into his body. Also, he has a small lump inside his right tescticle, about the size of a pencil eraser; I am unsure how long that has been there. He has no genital skin complaints, but he has had a lump on his shoulder for four years- this one looks like a mosquito bite.   I am worried because one year ago (about the time he started having the ab pain) he was sleeping with a different girl, and SHE just had lumps removed from her breast and from inside her vagina; neither was cancerous.   Neither of these people have warts, herpes II or any known/visual STD, but isn't that a little bit more of a coincidence? I had myself checked for STDS's two weeks after I started sleeping with this boy and all came back negative, but is there a STD that causes internal lumps?   History: All three of us (myself, my boyfriend, his ex) are in our early twenties. I have only slept with one other person besides him; they are much more experienced.   Thank you very much ~brin\n\n",

Infection related symptoms more often include both scrotal and lower abdominal pain as well as symptoms such as burning with urination, discharge, in some cases fever or chills, etc. However, has he been evaluated by a physician to rule out a varicocele, or hernia? Regardless of the cause and testicular lump should be promptly evaluated. If he has not had an evaluation by his physician to identify the causative factor I would suggest he do so.

Symptoms apparently appear within 30 days of contact, but I have only been with one person in this past year, and he is completely clean.  Also, the discharge is 'curd-like', like in a yeast infection, which I've had before.  (Susceptible before my period, I guess.  This has happened about 3 times before.)  The only problem is the colouration is off.  Maybe I have both?  I'm currently treating the \"yeast infection\" because before I menstruated I was positive that's what it was..only after completely my cycle did the colour change to a yellow-ish green.\n\n",

    "content": "Some relevant para (This doesn't confirm you have candidiasis. Kindly get yourself examined by the doc) :-    Symptoms and signs of vulvovaginal candidiasis warrant treatment, usually intravaginal administration of any of several imidazole antibiotics (e.g., miconazole or clotrimazole) for 3 to 7 days. Over-the-counter marketing of such preparations has reduced the cost of care and made treatment more convenient for many women with recurrent yeast vulvovaginitis. However,most women who purchase these preparations do not have vulvovaginal candidiasis, while many do have other vaginal infections that require different treatment. Therefore, only women with classic symptoms of vulvar pruritus and a history of previous episodes of yeast vulvovaginitis documented by an experienced clinician should self-treat.   Single-dose oral treatment with fluconazole (150 mg) is also effective and is preferred by many patients.   Prolonged or periodic oral therapy may benefit women with severe or frequently recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis and those who do not respond to intravaginal or single-dose oral therapy. Such patients probably should be evaluated for diabetes and immunocompromised states, although such systemic illnesses seldom explain recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis.\n\n",

I all started after that fact. First during the middle of the day I had a small upraised bump on the tip of my tounge. Then as the day progressed it got a little bigger and more appeared. That night as Ii was laying in bed, it felt as if they had opened up or something. That next morning where the bumps had been were replaced by white patches that felt numb then would go away. Depending on if I bothered with it they would go away fairly quickly but during my taste would be all out of wack. They had been gone for a week and just started again last night. Woke up this mprning and sure enough the white patches were there. Any idea what this could be? P.S. My X-Girlfriend just told me a month ago that she had HPV when we were together but I did use protection at all times. What do you think it is?\n\n",

They are in the form of white plaques, distributed anywhere on the oral mucosa or tongue.They can easily scraped off showing a red base.   Diagnosis may be confirmed with  microscopic exam.    Oral candidiasis do not occur in healthy young adults unless they are on antibiotics, steroids, or other immunosuppressive therapy.   Undiagnosed diabetes may present with oral candidiasis.  Early evaluation and treatment by an Infectious Disease specialist should be done to exclude STDs.  -Traumatic plaques  lesions improve within a week.  -Hairy Leukoplakia, white plaques with a hairy-looking painless lesions on the lateral aspects of the tongue;EBV and HPV and HIV risk factors should b tested.  -Lichenoid reactions, may occur secondary to drugs, allergies and liver disease.  -Recurrent Apthous Ulcers -stress ulcers; they are usually multiple lesions and painful.  - Oral lichen planus patches form fine white lines and dots do not cause problems, and diagnosed by biopsied.  - Leukoplakia is only considered by exclusion when other conditions such as candidiasis, lichen planus, leukoedema, etc. are ruled out.  Any lesion that does not resolve with medications should be biopsied.  Direct clinical examination is essential.   I advise you to follow up with your doctor. Best regards,\n\n",

The bumps are smaller than pimples, almost reminiscent of pinpricks, the  skin around the bumps is also red, the surrounding skin is of normal coloration.  The bumps itch slightly and there is no discharge.  My foreskin is also slightly swollen.  I have been having unprotected sex with my gf for five weeks now.  We both have been tested prior to our relationship and both were clean.  She shows no signs of irritation with her genitals.  I have already discontinued sexual contact with my partner and stopped masturbation.    Any ideas you might have towards what it is or possible treatment like a topical cream safe to put on my penis would help, if it doesn't clear up within a week I plan to see my physician.

These exceptions may include:  * emergency situations where care may be provided without prior consent in order to safeguard the health and life of the minor. * specific legal provisions in particular states that allow minors to consent for certain areas of care such as  > the diagnosis and treatment of STDs,  > the diagnosis and treatment of HIV or AIDS, > the diagnosis and treatment of reportable or contagious diseases.  There is also the issue of who has the right to control the release of confidential information about your diagnosis and treatment and who has the right to receive such information. You should  discuss this with your doctor.  Dr Anthony Solomon Consultant Physician, Tropical & Genitourinary Medicine\n\n",

    "content": "Ok I went to a local planned parenthood to be checked out by a doctor. She said that i had molluscus. I told her that i have had it for almost 2 years now and it also itches which is not a symptom of molluscum. She told me that there was no sign of anything yeasty on the bumps and doesnt know why they itch. She stood by the fact that i had molluscus without testing and told me to go to a dermatologist for the itching. From the pictures that i have seen online of molluscum the bumps don't seem to atch up. They do not have a indent in the middle. I even went back to the same doctor a second time to see if I could explain my situation better but she didnt suggest testing by the look of it and didnt have anymore answers. I am just worried that i am being misdiagnosed. Are there any STI's that are similiar to molluscus? or is there any thing i can take or try to stop the itching? ( and just to let you know i shower daily and wash my genitals thoroughly so i don't think bacteria or jockage that causes the itching)\n\n",

Do you practise unprotected sexual intercourse with one or multiple partners? Have partners been notified and treated? Partner notification and treatment are essential to halt the spread of disease in the community.    The thick, white, odorless discharge and intense burning and tenderness on the vulvar region are suggestive of vulvovaginal candidiasis.  The telltale signs of candidiasis include itching, burning, soreness, swelling of the vagina and and vulva, and an odorless or yeasty-smelling discharge. You may have one symptom or several, and symptoms can range from mild to severe.  The condition is easily diagnosed and treated at a genitourinary, family planning or well-woman clinic, so get investigated to confirm the diagnosis.

There is several redish pinkish oival splotches, slightly raised, and if I scratch them, they peel almost as if they were just dry patches of skin. I first noticed these after attending a marine institute a few summers ago, they have gotten worse since then. It is quite embarassing, and I found a picture in the internet that looked just like it, although I forgot the name of the desease, but it said that the symptoms should be gone in less than  5 weeks, I've had this for going on 4 years. My dermatologist doesn't know what to think of it and suggests it's from long term sun exposure. What do you think?\n\n",

Now I went to the doctor b/c of a bump on my labia that almost looked like a little nipple.  I also have a strange discharge, and lower abdominal pain.  My doctor said I had a bacterial infection, and the bump is a warty growth.   I was always told that the strain of HPV that can cause cerivcal cancer is not the same strain that causes genital warts.  Is this true?  Is it possible for me to have 2 strains of the virus?  And how is it possible for the genital warts to show up after almost 9 years with the same woman when neither of us has been unfaithful, and even if one of us had cheated, her and I don't have skin to skin contact in that area of our bodies?  Should I be concerned that this lump is something more serious than a wart? Sorry for the long post...I should have asked my doctor these things, but when you're in the exam room, sometimes your mind just goes blank.\n\n",

    "content": "Warts are caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV). Currently, over 100 types of HPV have been identified but condyloma acuminatum (also known as genital warts) is a sexually transmitted disease caused by about 30 different types of HPV which may infect the genitalia. Many of these are without symptoms and therefore unbeknown to the patient.   You have asked < I was always told that the strain of HPV that can cause cervical cancer is not the same strain that causes genital warts. Is this true? Is it possible for me to have 2 strains of the virus?>  Yes, it is true. Visible genital warts, such as you have on the labia, are usually caused by HPV Types 6 and 11, while Types 16 and 18 are associated with dysplasia or cancer of the uterine cervix.  In women, genital warts may occur on the vulva, the perineum, the introitus, in the vagina or on the cervix. Therefore, more than one HPV type may infect different anatomical parts of the genitalia.   Dr Anthony Solomon Consultant Physician, Tropical & Genitourinary Medicine\n\n",

I had been having a discharge after urination.  I was so relieved I didn't have an STD, that I didn't worry about going back to the doctor to find out what was really wrong with me.  I didn't go back, mainly, because I don't have insurance.  However, the symptoms continued, worsened and have seemed to have become more noticeable in the past month or so.  I have had sex, but, only protected.    The discharge occurs now after urination and ejaculation.  The discharge is clear and sticky, like pre-cum.  It is gel-like, and has no smell.  Also, I should tell you, that about 6 years ago I had surgery for a urethra stricture.  My questions are these, can this be related to my urethra stricture?  Could the tests that said I was negative have been wrong?  What else could the discharge be, if not from chlamydia or ghonerria?\n\n",

As for the blood in the stool are you sure it wasn't actually blood from the urinary tract or vagina that relocated to the anus after voiding and it appeard to be coming from the rectal area? I would suggest an evaluation by your physician to identify if a urinary tract infection is present because if so, you may need treatment with a course of antibiotics to alleviate the symptoms.

If symptoms do occur, they usually appear within 1 to 3 weeks after exposure.  Men with signs or symptoms might have a discharge from their penis or a burning sensation when urinating. Men might also have burning and itching around the opening of the penis. Pain and swelling in the testicles are uncommon.  Your symptoms are not consistent with a chlamydia infection, however, if you had unprotected sex, you should see a doctor or clinic for STD testing to rule out any other infections.\n\n",

    "content": "Ok. So I had this girlfriend that I really liked and trusted. Turns out she liked other people and one of them gave her genital warts. So I know for a fact I have HPV. I have had some other symptoms that I can't find under any other std's. My scrotum is red with little bumps and is cold to the touch. Not so often the skin on my scrotum gets dry, and some dry skin peels off. It doesn't burn when I urinate, it's more like I can feel the muscles tensing in the head of my penis when urinating. I'm really not sure what to do, I have too much ***** going wrong in my life. As a matter of fact everything is. Anyways, I don't want to go to a doctor and have him tell me I have aids or something. I can look at my dick and tell there's something wrong. I just want to know what these symptoms relate to.\n\n",

Need help     --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  I have been tested negative for HSV through blood testing. My partner whome I have been with for the last 6 months, I think has Oral herpes. I have never confessed to him that im concerned because I feel he will feel offended. I noticed a sore on his upper lip 2 months back and avoided sexual contact which caused problems in our relationship. But at times he kissed me and I felt rude to tell him not to. But I got so stressed out thinking I might have caught it so I went for testing at two differnt locations and both places told me im negative. I really love him and im planning on talking to him about my concerns and that he should get testing.   Now my questions are  1) Even though I was sexually active with him for 3 months or more with him, and got tested negative for hsv, and never had sores or anything anywhere, but yesterday when he had no sores etc, and we had oral/vaginal sex, is it possible I could have got it now?   2) Lets say if I got the virus and go in for testing Tomorow, which would be two days after the initial contact. Will the result be accurate still. How long does it take for the body to buld antibodies for virus which can be detected in blood?   3) should I wait for a week more before going in for testing?   4) If its HSV-1, and if I got it on genitals....how many times it reoccurs on genitals on avarage?   Please reply, it will take some stress off my chest.   Thanks  Sanam\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 17 year old male. Exactly one week ago I had unprotected sex with a girl that had herpes. She had no symptoms at the time, and I washed my areas well afterwards. I noticed today that there were little red bumps surrounding my pubic hair and kind of around my thigh and very lower stomach area. They do not hurt, and they are extremely small and numerous (hundreds). They are not on my penis or anywhere but around my hair. I have no other symptoms, and no pain, blisters, or burning, but I\u2019m still worried about this. I almost think it is from having vigorous sex (different partner) the night before, or that it is newly growing hairs (I especially think it could be these things because I shave down there\u2026plus, so did the girl I had sex with so my skin might have just been pricked or irritated). I have been doing my very best to keep stress free so that I can help build up my resistance as well. Can you please tell me what you think the chances are that I have or will contract herpes?\n\n",

    "content": "The description you have given is not suggestive of genital herpes. Genital herpes is characterised by the appearance of a cluster of vesicles which break down into painful ulcers. The first episode, known as the primary attack, is often associated with systemic effects such as fever, malaise, enlarged groin lymph nodes and urinary retention. You do not complain of any of these symptoms.  The incubation period of genital herpes is 2-20 days, with an average of 6 days. I cannot predict if you will contract the infection, but if you have not done so in 20 days, it is unlikely to happen.  For your further information, an infected partner does not require to have visible lesions to be able to transmit the infection. 70% of transmission occurs during times of symptomless  shedding of the virus.

She was diagnosed and treated a year and a half before we started to date. She  did not have another outbreak of warts for more then a year before we started to have sex nor has she had one since then. She also had a pap smear when we first started dating and before sex that came back normal. I have never had any symptoms, and at one point was checked out by a health care professional (at planned parenthood) who said I did not have HPV after I told them I had been exposed to someone that used to have it. Although they only performed a visual test of my genitals.  What are the chances that I am a silent carrier of the virus and can pass it to another partner.  I recently broke up with my girlfriend and am not sure how to approach the idea of having sexual relationships with new people. I have read that most likely I do not have HPV at all. I have also read that after a few months if you have no symptoms the body has rid itself of the virus. Is any of this true? How big of a risk am I to future sexual partners?   What should I do? I want to know if I can rest easy and not pass the virus or if I need to tell every potential girlfriend about this.\n\n",

    "title": "HPV TRANSMISSION",
    "content": "Genital warts are caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV) and are the most common viral STD.  HPV infections causing genital warts are transmitted by direct sexual contact with a partner who has a clinical or sub-clinical infection. The risk of infection rises with increasing numbers of sex partners.  About 70% of sex partners of individuals infected with genital warts develop the disease within 2-4 months. Genital lesions are often inconspicuous and can only be identified by careful examination. In men, they are often sited on the frenum, coronal sulcus, glans penis, the lining of the prepuce, the shaft of  the penis and the scrotum. Genital warts also occur in the urethra, where they may cause urethral bleeding or discharge, or a change in the urinary stream. Genital strains of  HPV can also infect the anal canal and mouth via receptive anal intercourse and oral sex respectively.  Your post does not suggest that you have suspicious lumps on the genitalia or any urethral symptoms. Also, you state that examination by a health professional was negative for conspicuous lesions.  These negative findings indicate that the risk of infecting future partners is minimal or absent, but I would advise further examination by a genitourinary physician for reassurance.

The last time I had sex was about nine months ago and the condom broke during intercourse. The bump did not appear until about 7 months after that. The bump is a cm in width. It has came and disappeared a few times. It only hurts when I touch it, but not very much. I also noticed that it is in the area where I wear my pants and have my belt buckle tightened. There is also no discolorization to the bump. It is the color of my skin tone. When I squeeze it a very little puss comes out. I am a little concerned as to whether or not it is a symptom of any STD or it may be a little irritation caused by me wearing my pants and having my belt buckle tightened in that area.

Just to put an Anti Biotic.  Then later I got some white bumps, so I went to the Planned Parenthood to get a check up.  She said it was nothing, they did the Sypillis test and some other tests.  Im still waiting for the results.... She noticed some irritation on the tip of my penis.  But it didnt itch or anything.  A day later, it felt real irriatated.   Then like on the shaft it was kinda red like if it was scratched.  One time it felt the same way, and i broke out in hives in that area of the shaft.  Like it just swelled up.  So I took a benadril and it went away.          So I read somewhere that u could put Peroxide to get rid of Bacterial infections, but no peroxide so I put rubbing alchol and it really burned alot.  Later I bought peroxide and used that.  I noticed the part that really burned turned white, on the tip of the penis and that part of the shaft.  Got any suggestions on what this could be.  And what was with me breaking out in hives on that part of my penis.  Well it was the skin on the shaft that got this.  I used to have problems in breaking out in hives but years ago.  Could it be what I wear down there.  Im not circumsized.  Please could use some advice.\n\n",

    "content": "If you had unprotected sexual exposure and are now experiencing a whitish urethral discharge, this is suggestive of gonococcal or non-specific urethritis. The former usually presents as a thick, purulent discharge while the latter condition is characterised by a mucoid or mucopurulent discharge. The incubation period you quote points to the latter diagnosis. The commonest cause of non-specific urethritis is chlamydia.  You should be examined at a genitourinary clinic for diagnosis and treatment. The presence of one STD should prompt a search for others, so a full STD screen is mandatory. Please notify all sexual partners so that they too may investigated and treated to halt the spread of STD in the community.

    "title": "Std or bladder infection or ?",
    "content": "Hi, I'm an 18 year old female.  I've never been diagnosed before or had past surgeries.  I don't believe I have a family history of STDs, however my mom does have bladder infections every now and then.  I'm not taking any medications besides the occasional tylenol.   I'll start off by saying that I had sex the other morning multiple times with one person, and often times when I do that my vagina gets sore because it's being stretched and everything.  That afternoon I knew I was going to start my period so I went and put a tampon in, I've been using them for quite some time and never had any problems before.  I had a lot of discomfort after I put it in, and then I took it out because of that.  Later I had problems urinating, it hurt and there was a burning senesation and very frequent.  I was unable to get up and stay in another room for longer than 5 minutes.  I spent about 4 hours or so in the bathroom off and on.  I eventually was able to lie down on my stomach and that helped for some reason so that I didn't have to get up and go to the bathroom as much.  My urges went down and I was able to sleep the whole night.  The past few days there hasnt been many problems at all, every now and then when I finish urinating it burns a small bit.   Today I thought I would try the tampon again, and the urinating problems started up again, although not nearly as bad as the other day.  My mom thinks it could be a bladder infection, but I also worry that it could be an STD.  Why do you think the tampon is bringing about all this problems?  I do plan on visiting a doctor as soon as I can get an appointment, but I'd like to know what could be the problem and get myself ready for the news.  I also have small bumps around my anus and vagina, but they don't look like pictures I've seen of genital warts.  I have used a spermicide, I read that that could cause irritation.  Do you have any idea? Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "First of all, you should NEVER put in a tampon if you are not yet bleeding. Without blood as a lubricant, tampns will tear the lining in the vagina, causing discomfort and making you open to infections. The real danger is toxic shock syndrome, which is a rare but very serious disease associated with tampon use. You shoul dnever use a tampon wihtout menstration, and should only use an absorbency appropriate to your flow. ( use a light tampon for light flow, ect.)  It soulds liek you could have a bladder infection.  You should make an appointment with your doctor if the pain continues to get treatment. In the meantime, drinking cranberry juice is very helpful.   Spermicide can cause irritation, and you could be allergic to it, so that can be the cause of the rash.  This doesn't sound like symptoms of an STD, but without a better discription of the bumps around your vagina, I couldn't say for sure.\n\n",

So I went to my doctor and he agreed with me that they don't look like an STD.  He told me to pick up Lamsil AT and apply that twice a day for a week.  I've been using it since Monday and although I know it hasn't been long, I am still worried about it because it doesn't appear to be doing anything yet.

    "content": "Hello,  I am 16 years of age, and I am quite worried that I may have an STD, which one, if any, I am not sure.  I have looked at many STD sites with pictures, and none fit my description, but that doesnt ease my tension.  Situation:  In the area under/between my inner thighs there are  red spots.  They vary in size, and I have never experienced any itchyness, pain, but they have seemed to be dry on the spots.  I have experience pain while urinating once,  when I went right after I was finished masturbating.  My penis was not \"fully\" erect, but it was stiff, I am not sure if that has anything to do with the spots but I figure the more info I can give, the better you can answer.  (continue on topic)  well, just now i was in the bathroom, and while bathing, i noticed 2 dark spots through my pubic hair, but couldnt make out what it was.  So in order to see what was there, I completely shaved my pubic hair off.  Sure enough, it is the same spots that I have seen on my inner thigh.    the spots are not \"red red\". they are more of a \"reddish brown\",  and they almost blend into my skin.  The spots vary in size, some smaller than dimes, and some larger than quarters.  Most are circular/ovalish, while some are different shaped the spots have blended into each other.  These spots have been here a long time,months, atleast the ones on my inner thigh, but i always thought \"they'll go away\", and now that i see that it is also above my penis, I am very worried.  Sexual Past: I have had sex a total of 3 times.  Twice unprotected..... they werent long at all, but i guess if its in there a second i have a chance of catching something.  I know the person whom I had sex with had sex with previous partners....so I would not doubt I may have contracted something.    I have also been involved with oral sex several times.  All unprotected.    I really don't know what these spots are.  They are numerous, pain-free, itch-free, and sometimes a little dry.  They are located on my inner thighs and on the area above my penis (where the pubic hair is).  Do you know what this is, or could be,?  Could you tell me how to get rid of it??? Is there a way i could do something, if these are not normal, without my parents finding out??  I am very worried about these spots....  Thank you so much!\n\n",

    "title": "Chlamydia/Pregnancy/Doxycycline",
    "content": "Hi, Im posting for both myself and my girlfriend. We are both 18.  Anyways, I recently had burning urination and clear discharge. After online researched i figured it was likely i had Chlamydia so i went to a doctor to be diagnosed. It came back positive and i was prescribed Doxycycline. The doctor actually gave me 28 tablet for some reason but that was nice.   I have just started taking the medicine. However my girlfriend cannot be diagnosed as easily as me. We are 2 hours apart. For one she doesn't have a vehicle or anything to get around at her school, and i think due to problems with her family she temporarily lost her health insurance.   I figured i would just give her my extra 14 tablets that i have and she wouldn't have to worry too much about going to a doctor or anything. However theres a small chance she could be pregnant at the moment. And I've found Doxycycline can be harmful during pregnancy.   So what I am asking I guess is: Should I just give her my 14 tablets? Should she try to get diagnosed with chlamydia herself? Is there free clinics to do that if she doesn't have health insurance? Can she do it without her parents finding out? Should she check her pregnancy first, and if it's negative then give her my 14 tablets? What should i do if it's positive? I don't think we are ready for a child at the moment.   Any help is appreciated thanks.\n\n",

    "title": "STD, Cancer or something else???",
    "content": "I have a few questions about possible STD infections. I only have one sex partner and we`ve been together for over a year. Since we just got married and are planning on having kids, we`ve been having unprotected sex for the past year with no problems. The problem is, I was fine until last week but now I`m starting to have the following issues:   1) Swollenness and pain in the right testicle. 2) Slight lower back and abdominal pain that extend down the right inner thigh. 3) Sometimes a small drop of white semen colored inside the mouth of the penis before or after I urinate but no pain or burning sensation. Maybe slight carely-noticable irritation at the tip of the penis when urinating.  I`ve never had these symproms before but I noticed that they all started happening after two major things happened to me. 1st I cought the flu which lasted for a few days and went away. Then I decided to start working out so I rent running and did some rather intensive karate practice for two days. I was fine for about 4 days after that, but then the pain started and I don`t know why.    I just went to the doctor`s office to get tested for STDs so I`ll get the results next week. But I`m wondering what the possible cause of it might be? Does this sound like an STD infection? Only 1 testicle is swollen and other than the slight pain in other places, I feel fine. Also, I notice that the pain subsides when I go to sleep at night and wake up in the morning or when I walk around, stretch a bit, or masterbate. The ejaculated semen also looks normal color and consistency so I can`t really find anything wrong except the swollen testicle.  I`m currently checking the internet for facts about STD infections, testicular, cancer and such but I wanted to know is:  1) If it is an STD infection, it it possible for just 1 tecticle to be infected and not the other?   2) what are the distinguaishable differences between STD infections and other stuff like cancer, epyditimyst (sp??) etc... It`s a little difficult for me to diffrenciate.  3) How long can an STD lay dormant in a man before he has symptoms? The last sex partner I had before my wife was my ex fiancee about 2 years ago... I just recently founf out that she was sleeping around while we were together so I`m a little concerned about that as well.   4) Are there any good Traditional Chinese Medicine or herbal remedies you`d suggest to deal with any of the forementioned sympoms? I`m currently taking anti-biotics but I prefer alternative medical treatments.  Sorry this post is so long. Could you pleas help?\n\n",

    "content": "Your symptoms could be due to an infection, but the infection wouldn't necessarily have to be an STD. STDs  can cause your symptoms, but so can infection by e-coli bacteria or TB. Your symptoms could also be caused by cancer, hydrocele-- an infection of fluid in the teste, or a variocele- when blood flow in the teste becomes obstructed, or a spermatocele- a cyst filled with sperm on your testicle. It is most likely that it is an infection.  I would not discontinue the antibiotics until the entire course is up. If the infection is not completely treated you could become infertile and have a myriad of other complications. Unfortunately over the computer I can't give you an easy way to distinguish an STD infection from an infection not caused by an STD from testicular cancer. It's good that you went to the doctor and had a culture taken. If your symptoms don't clear up entirely with the antibiotics, your doctor should also assess you thoroughly for testicular cancer-- he should do an ultrasound of your testicle and maybe some blood work or a biopsy.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Confud,  You are likely seeing Pearly Penile Papules (PPP) which are whitish, pinhead size bumps on the glans of the penis and along the side of the glans. If you HAVE NOT had any sexual contacts these bumps are normal and non-contagious. Don\u2019t pop them and they should not bleed, ooze or itch. If they start to change or bother you, see your physician or for a good piece of mind, see your physician.  Now, if you HAVE HAD sexual contact in any way and you could have possibly become exposed to a sexually transmittable disease, these bumps may be something else. Any time you have something NEW show up or start to happen on your genitals such as oozing, crust, blisters, bumps, ulcers, pimples, warts, wierd things, get them checked out for STD.\n\n",

    "content": "Although you have provided a good close-up picture, palpation of the lump by physical examination is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. However, the description you have given of the skin lump may be helpful in suggesting one.   A lump  which is located in the skin,  is painless,  feels relatively solid,  and has the same colour as surrounding skin or is slightly paler, is suggestive of an epidermal inclusion cyst.  It is also known as an epidermoid cyst, epidermal cyst, or sebaceous cyst.  An epidermal cyst is the most common skin cyst and occurs in young to middle-aged adults. It is harmless, but when it ruptures, it is associated with inflammation and pain.  Physical examination by a dermatologist is necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

On Tuesday I also noticed a painless small bump on the INNER surface on my lip, almost all the way inside my mouth, towards the center horizontally.    It's almost gone now (Friday).  It was really small, round, with a white-ish center, almost like a small pimple, but it didn't break or anything, just shrank and went away.

If you kissed a guy with herpes, you may get a cold sore but nothing drastic.  You may well be run down due to the stress of finals, studying and a little too much partying on the side. It sounds more as if you had a sore in your mouth that had nothing to do with the kiss. Should you have contracted herpes, you will once again have sores and then I might check with my physician.\n\n",

Infection with HSV occurs by inoculation of the virus onto susceptible mucosal surfaces (such as the pharynx, cervix, conjunctivae) or through small cracks in the skin.   Is the lesion on your right buttock accurately doctor-diagnosed for HSV 2?

So that still does not answer about the appearance of HSV2.  I thought that breakouts below the wais were HSV2 only.  Since this is on my right buttock, wouldn't that mean HSV2?

    "title": "Masturbation injury or STD?",
    "content": "(I posted this in the \"Male Sexual Disorders\" Forum by mistake)  About a year ago I had unprotected sex with a girl who soon after had a Herpes outbreak that was believed to be HSV-1. Planned Parenthood didn't swab it and by the time she got to her GP or GYN, it was long gone. Her doctor (and she) were content with assuming that it was HSV-1. I, on the other hand, freaked out and spent countless hours on this site, looking at my penis and going to doctors, dermatologists and even paying for my own STD tests. Right off the bat I got the IgM test for recent exposure and tested negative. At around 12 weeks, I paid for a complete run through tests of all of the STD's (including the HerpeSelect IgG) and I came up negative on all tests including HSV-1 & 2. A rash that I was probably over-analyzing still persisted, so my Dermatologist did a biopsy to rule out cancer, etc. Nothing. I committed myself to never putting myself through that again and put it all behind me and I'm doing my best to live a \"clean\" life.   4 nights ago I was away on business and to take care of some stress, I decided to masturbate in the shower. I used some of the hotel soap and away I went. I was pretty tired, so it was taking a lot longer than I'd hoped and as I was finishing up, it started to hurt/sting a little around the rim of my glans - the soap wasn't very \"sudsy\" or lubricating. (the shower actually went cold it took so long) I finally ejaculated and when I got out of the shower, it looked like I broke some blood vessels in that area and it hurt/stung pretty badly. (I'm not sure if that's what I did, I'm just describing) It was pretty tender and when I got up the next morning it still looked pretty much the same and still hurt quite a bit.   Right now there's one main red, really irritated area and a few slightly raised smaller points about the size of a pinhead - most of them are on the rim of my glans, but one is further up, halfway to the ureter. None have broken out into true blisters (I think), they're just there. I'm starting to wonder if this all goes back to last year and beginning to worry.   Oh yeah and when I'm showering, I'm only taking a WARM shower and a few moments after getting in they turn white/fleshy and slightly larger. Once I get out and dried off, they eventually go back to their smaller size & red color.   My common sense/practical thinking says that the hotel soap, friction and the long time it took me to ejaculate are to blame. My worrysome side is very edgy though and I don't want to put myself through what I went through last year.   This all said - could I have HSV and it have not really shown up for a year in either the tests or in symptoms? Or did I just do this to myself in the shower? What are these things???   Your thoughts on my condition and suggestions of next steps would be greatly appreciated. I can provide some pictures if you let me know where to send them.   Best Regards,   Soapy123\n\n",

IIt will hurt fro a day or two after.It is painful and hurts when I pee which is the same thing as when I had a break out. ITs weird though because I was on the herpes medicine and I still would get this same cut in the same place when I had sex. My question is could the skin be weak after I had a horrible break out and just opens the skin every time from thrusting??

I took the two medicines for the Chlamydia and Gonorrhea but when it came down to the medicine for the bacteria infection i took Metronidazole.  I only took the medicine for 3dy out of the 7dys recommended..  The medicine was making me extremely sick.  Just last week i started taking Amoxilian Antibiotics b/c i had the flue.  The next day i noticed a lot  (more then I\u2019ve ever seen before)  discharge.  I was told it's just b/c of the antibiotics i was taking.  The next day two bumps came up.  They are on the inner side of my virginal lip (left).  The bumps are small, very painful, have a white tip and are red near the ring of them.  Are these herpes???????????\n\n",

    "content": "It is bad practice to discontinue treatment prescribed for STDs without consulting the physician. One of the well-known side effects of Metronidazole is vomiting, so your doctor would have prescribed an anti-emetic for that.      Genital herpes and Chancroid are two conditions that cause painful red bumps or ulcers on the genitalia.  Genital Herpes is acquired through sexual contact with a person who is shedding the virus. Usual symptoms are pain, itching, painful urination and enlarged, tender lymph nodes in the groins. The lesions in genital herpes usually start as tiny red bumps which progress to fluid-filled sacs before breaking down to ulcers. These ulcers persist for 4 -15 days until healing occurs.   Chancroid spreads from person to person only by sexual contact with no known alternate routes. Chancroidal lesions usually begin as tender red bumps  which, over a course of 1 to 2 days, become pus-filled, get eroded and break down into ulcers. The pain in chancroid is less than in genital herpes and while it is quite painful in males, it is frequently not obvious in females who may therefore be unaware of their infection.  Get examined at a genitourinary clinic for diagnosis and treatment of these painful lesions. Please remember that partner notification is essential to prevent  spread of STDs in the community.

I was with my girlfriend last night and we were kissing for about 2 hours, and all of a sudden at around the same time both of our throats started to hurt, and my R lymph node was swollen, and her L lymph node was swollen. No other signs and symptoms with this, and my medical history includes mono about 5 years ago with no recurrances. She has never been diagnosed with mono. The throat ache and swollen gland is persistant and there is some redness in the throat with no inflammation or white papillae. If anyone has an idea whether this could be a recurring infection of mono, if that is possible, or if it can be some sort of STD (not from the kissing), I would greatly appreciate your response.

    "content": "My boyfriend has recently noticed a few round light brown with a hint of pink (solid color) bumps on his penis shaft.  He has two very tiny what looks like harmless white skin tags and 3 of these round very slighlty raised bumps.   They are not formed together, nor do they have the cauliflower appearance I see with HPV.  He also has a dark brown (mole colored) larger skin tag in pubic hair he says has been there a long time.  He has a lot of moles on his body in various colors.  They (penis bumps) are not unsightly, cause no discomfort and to me look like  possible moles.  Is there any hope that this could be something other than HPV?  What skin disorders other than pearly and  molluscum could be possible cause?  We have been together 4 1/2 years and I have no visible signs of anything strange at all.  We tried straight white wine vinegar on the 3 bumps and after 5 minutes they turned only slightly discolored (a little lighter), more pink than brown, but did not turn pure white.  I also hear the vinegar test isn't totally reliable.  If HPV, do dermatologists take care of treatment and accurate diagnosis?  He doesn't know how long the 3 bumps have been there, but I noticed 2 of  them a year ago.  They don't appear to have grown or changed shape.\n\n",

    "title": "white discoloration where penis head meets shaft.",
    "content": "OK i am 20 yrs old and have only been with one partner.She has never engaged in unprotected sex with anybody except me and has only been with 2 other people.About 4 days ago after masturbation my penis seemed extra sensitive and has remained so until now.I also noticed that after urinating,even a couple mins after,a tiny dribble of what seems to be urine came out.That happened for a couple days ,but seems to have subsided.The very end of the head still feels really sensitive (rubbing on clothes etc)Doesn't seem to be any burning upon urination,if so its so minimal that i don't notice.Ihave been to my doctor and I am waiting for the results of a chlamydia/gonorrhea test along with a blood test for hepatitis and hiv.After the 2 times we engaged in unprotected sex my girlfriend had a burning upon urination that started 2 days or so after the sex and went away within a couple days both times.The second time we had unprotected sex i developed a slight rash on the underside of my penis, which the doc said was nothing to worry about he gave me some lotriderm creme and that got rid of it.  Is it possible that this is some sort of UTI or Urethritis? I say this because the last time we had sex she went to the bathroom right before we had sex,she was on top of me trying to get my penis inside of her when i stopped and put a condom on.The penis didn't quite get inside but it was on the verge.My symptoms didn't come about until a week or more after that.  Im a little scared because the only thing I really want in life is a family. Help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I am a thirty something female who has been diagnosed as having hsv2.  The most prevalent sign of the disease (which I believe I've had 2 years) has been canker sores, fever blisters and an occasional yeast infection like itch.  However, I've also had: small clear bumps on my eye lid and an increased amount of acne of my face.  I'm also suffering from hyperthyroidism which I took radioactive iodine to correct this summer.     I had a new boyfriend over the summer (I had no idea about the herpes then).  We were tested for hiv together at a local health clinic.  Our tests were negative.  During our time together, he was frequently impotent.  This led to condoms rolling off during sex.  Three weeks after the condom roll offs, I has a western blot test, which was also negative.   Currently, I'm experiencing some mouth issues which have me very scared.  I am constantly being told that a herpes outbreak lasts no longer than a few weeks.  The problem in my mouth has persisted on/off for longer than a month.  I asked my doctor about it twice and she said that it was normal.  She didn't even want to do a culture.  The problem is a sore tongue, slight streaks that come and go on the insides of my cheeks, my tongue and the roof of my mouth.  These lines don't hurt, but in the morning there is a film in my mouth.  I have had some slight soreness, but I'm mostly concerned that these things are around.    I have been rinsing my mouth with listerine and this week I started using peroxide too.   This stuff seems to be shrinking but I'd just like to know what it is honestly.  My doctor often dismisses my concerns as she believes that I'm over zealous.  She told me that the lines on the roof of my mouth have always been there and that everyone has them.  I don't really see how they could have been there and I've overlooked them.  She has been a fairly good doctor, she does actually talk to me a bit during my appointments.   I will take another hiv test at approximately 3 months prior to exposure.  Needless to say, I am very nervous, but have read some articles that suggest if I'm having a thrush or something like that it means that the hiv is going to be severe.  Can you help me shed any light to this mouth problem?  Any advice would be appreciated.  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "To answer your question, STDs can be transmitted all of the above ways. Oral, anal, and vaginally.  If you recieve oral sex from a female, she is at risk, and so are you. She is at risk because your semen if infected could infect her, and you are at risk if she has oral herpes, or open sores in her mouth.    The only totally safe sex is not to do it, and the second safest sex is to use a condom EACH AND EVERY time during any sexual encounter, including oral sex.\n\n",

    "title": "Possible herpes genital ->oral",
    "content": "Id say about 6-7 weeks ago i gave and recieved unprotected oral sex to a woman. After a fight with my girlfriend and a whole bunch of alcohol at a party I did something really stupid and something i really regret. Because of some things that have happened since then I am starting to be concerned that I may also have \"genital herpes\" I put it in quotes because there has been nothing happening to my penis but i think their might have been a possibility of me getting genital herpes in the mouth from unprotected oral sex. I am going to try and see a doctor as soon as i can but for now I was wondering if these symptoms sound to you like I may have herpes. It seemed a week or two after I got a few \"white head pimples\" but they didnt seem normal because instead of having pus in them they had a clear fluid. They have gone away and none of them developed into scabs but they did leave temporary red marks (most likely because I picked them). I also believe some of these may have come from stress about worrying wether or not I had contracted herpes. Now when I was performing oral sex I didnt notice anything out of the ordinary (pimples blisters scabs or anything) and the person had told me she was clean but there is always the possibility of people lying and \"shedding\". More recently I got a red mark on the gum above one of my teeth, now my gums are never in great condidtion ( i cant stand flossing) but it seems like the timing of the appearance was suspicious. What has worried me most however is just recently after a party where I consumed alcohol I was brushing my teeth and upon inspecting my tongue I noticed a whole bunch of little reddish pink dots on it. They are reallly small and most heavily concentrated on the tip and the sides but also on the top. They don't really hurt or anything and they are so small that when I took a picture of them they didnt really show up but they seem to be ever so slightly raised and it seems like they are on or between taste buds.  I would have seen a doctor by now but I still have to figure out exactly how I am going to do that since i am a college student and my parents are conservative to say the least using my health insurance to get a test would show up on their invoice.  Oh ya i don't know if this has anything to do with it but it seems like when I wake up in the moringin every other day or so i'll have some kind of buildup on my two front teeth that i have to scrape off with my fingernail.\n\n",

I truly believe she has never had sexual contact with anyone else, so i am feeling that the infection must have come from me, and my sexual past. However, i haven't had actual intercourse with any other girls, though about 1 year before me and my current girlfriend became sexually active, i did engage in oral sex with a couple of girls. Is it possible i have contracted the STI off the oral sex from these girls and passed it on to my girlfriend through intercourse? thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Pleasereplytome, While it is possible to spread Chlamydia via oral sex, I find it somewhat unlikely if you haven't had symptoms such as a sore throat over the last year after your previoous sexual contact. Even then you would have had to spread it to your current girlfriend via oral sex.  How long have you and your girlfriend been sexually active? How long ago was your last sexual encounter with someone else? I strongly urge you to use condoms EVERY time you engage in sexual activity. Since your girlfriend has been diagnosed, you MUST also get tested as well. She will need to take her FULL COURSE of antibiotics before she is cured. Do not allow her to share her medicine with you , because then neither of you will be cured and will continue to pass it back and forth to each other. Please go to your physician ASAP, or to your local Planned Parenthood or local health clinic for testing. It is important to not engage in intercourse until after you are finished takig your medication.  Please remember-use condoms to prevent this or something worse from happening in the future.  Good luck to you!\n\n",

I had sore throat, fever and bone ache, together with swollen meatus on my penis.  Inluckily I also have conjunctivitis which seems to implicate the involvement of Chlamydia with certainty.  Im on 1g Azithro treatment and recovering. When I told A, she said that she had a clean result from her STD screening. If no throat swab was done on her, will she still be detected as a chlamydia carrier? She does like to have cum in the mouth & swallow as well. Im worried for her, as she may be infected either from me or fr others.  Also how infectious is a male chlamydia carrier, when there are no symptoms? Tks in advance Joe\n\n",

I recommend that you see your family physician... you may be referred to a neurologist as well.  The fatigue alone would make me consider EBV (mononucleosis) or Cytomegalovirus, which is usually asymptomatic, but has been linked with symptoms of fatigue.  Two of the main complaints of Multiple Sclerosis are blurred vision and fatigue as well.  I really cannot make an actual diagnosis without other diagnostic criteria present, so please see your physician.  Thanks!\n\n",

My boyfriend and I both had other sexual partners before we met. I was just wondering if I could have had \"trich\" the whole time we have been together and not been aware of it. Currently, my boyfriend and I have no symptoms. When we first started dating he went to the doctor because he had some itching at the tip of his penis (one of the symptoms) but the doctor looked at it and said he was fine (without doing any tests). I have had 2 other papsmears since we have been together and nothing has come up. (expect that one was abnormal and I needed a repeat) So, my questions are: Do they always check/notice \"trich\" when a pap smear is given? Could I have had \"trich\" for over 3 1/2 years and didn't even know it? Can there be any long term effects?\n\n",

If someone uses these towels or washcloths or puts on the bathing suit, the disease may be passed on that way.You may have not gotten it from past partners, 3 years ago, and just recently been infected, that is why it didnt show up in pap smears before, there is really no way to tell, it is possible you were exposed previously and never had symptoms and it was just missed in previous pap smears..   Trichomoniasis by itself isn't very dangerous to a person's health, but it can be uncomfortable, and it can make you more susceptible to getting other STDs.  Sexual partners should be treated at the same time and individuals being treated should not have sex until they have finished their treatment and no longer have symptoms, or you can continue reinfecting each other.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Trichomoniasis Question",
    "content": "[quote=\"rainbow34\"]I recently found out I  that I have trichomoniasis after a recent pap smear. I have been in a monogomous relationship for 3 1/2 years, and am wondering how long I could have had this. My boyfriend and I both had other sexual partners before we met. I was just wondering if I could have had \"trich\" the whole time we have been together and not been aware of it. Currently, my boyfriend and I have no symptoms. When we first started dating he went to the doctor because he had some itching at the tip of his penis (one of the symptoms) but the doctor looked at it and said he was fine (without doing any tests). I have had 2 other papsmears since we have been together and nothing has come up. (expect that one was abnormal and I needed a repeat) So, my questions are: Do they always check/notice \"trich\" when a pap smear is given? Could I have had \"trich\" for over 3 1/2 years and didn't even know it? Can there be any long term effects?[/quote] Rainbow: i can relate to how you feel. I am 41 yrs old and have only been sexually active with 3 men  in my enitire 41yrs. I recently remarried a man whom i love so much. He is a man of all men. He has been my hero until 08-27-05. I have been sick with other bacterial infections in spinal cord for 2 yrs. Having to have urinalysis done at least mnthly. I showed positive for Trich. in a Urine. I came home . not even knwoing exactly what it was. got on here and saw STD!! the second he came home from work i told him. It blew my mind!!!!! So, the next am i got him to go with me to a OB/gyn 100miles from home. we get ther and she says\" you are eat up with it\".. he ask to be tested. HE IS NEG>> so,. you can imagine where it went form there. She admitted me to hosp. and he left. She stood in front of him with me crying telling her and him i had been with noone in over 7 yrs saying\" it comes from sex\" and he don't have it!!!! I was so confused and had no idea how i had gotten it. and the sad part about it was I had been away from him for 3-4 days b-4 i was DX with it. SO, there that was. and i made the stupidest mistake i am ashamed to even tell it. I wanted an answer so bad i made up something and told him. thinking he would not believe it and for other reasons too. Now......I am loosing the only man i have ver loved due to something i do not know wher eit came form. It is destroying my life and my marriage. I have called CDC In Atlanta, i have had urines done weekly hoping it woudl show up again. and i could back track myself between URINALYSIS. but, it hasn't !! i to this day haven't a clue as to where I got it from. and everything you read or i have read says it comes from sex. it is impossible!!!!!! NO MAN HAS TOUCHED ME IN Over 7yrs .. BUT HIM>.. if you have any INFO>. please help. i will not stop until i find out where it came from!!!  lilamae\n\n",

    "content": "Hi. 4 years ago I was diagnosed with genital herpes after my first outbreak, but I took my meds and have been fine ever since. About 3 days ago I started showing some symptoms, but I don't think it's an outbreak because there are no sores. The symptoms are: -some dense discharge, but no odor -itching (mostly inside the vaginal tract) -redness (mostly at the entrance) -burning sensation when I pee, but not really painful I should add that 2 weeks ago I had sex, mostly protected, but for a few minutes there was unprotected penetration (but no ejaculation). Also, I'm on birth control, but I forgot 2 or 3 pills in a row and I've had something like a period out of time. Neomycin is relieving the itching for a short time. I don't believe it's a herpes breakout, but what? And what can I do? Thank you very much\n\n",

The symptoms you describe could also be a yeast infection, trichimonas, or another STD.  Please see your physician as soon as possible so you can find out for sure.  Hope this helps!\n\n",

Does anyone have any info, i don't think its a STD due to me not having sex in quite sometime, but i don't know if it is normal to get bumps and boils like that, could the infected boil that i didnt take any medication for be causing the burning of urinating and so forth, any help would be great, thank you\n\n",

    "content": "About 2 weeks ago, I was shaving my pubic hairs, and after doing so I noticed small red bumps in the region, not on the penis shaft, or scrotum. I figured that it was a rash from the shaving and paid no attention to it. I am sexually active, but have only had sex once since then, and before that it was about 4 days before. I have only had sex with one person, and I was her first too. I noticed the other day that the bumps havent gone away and it freaked me out. So I have been doing alot of research on STD's and rashes. Their are approx 4 very small ones and 2 larger ones(pimple sized). They are not clustered, and do not look like any of the pictures that I've seen about STD's. They actually look like pimples. They do not itch, or hurt, and have not broken open at all. From the reading I have done i think it might be Follicitus, because when I shaved it was kind of quick/ rough, and the razor wasnt that clean/new. Any input would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi. This morning when I was showering, I noticed two red bumps just at the tip of my pubic region. The bumps are not painful, ichy, nor really uncomfortable at all. Now that I think about it, I have had several similar bumps in the past, but have always dismissed it as acne as I often have outbreaks in many regions of my body. These bumps, however, do not puss over as typical acne does. I have never had sex, yet have had several oral encounters. I have never noticed a cold sore, or bump of any kind on the girl's mouth when this has happened. I know that I'm likely worrying too much, but is it typical for acne to occur in these regions, and how likely am I to receive genital herpes from oral sex. I have never had bumps of any kind on or around my penis, just in neutral zones, such as the pubic region and maybe the inner thigh. Do you think I need to get checked out by a doctor, or am I just worrying too much. Also, is it possible to spread the disease while having protected sex, and not on an outbreak? Thanks so much for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Trichomonas vaginalis has been found in the nasopharynx and vagina of newborns born to infected mothers. In adult women with trichomoniasis, the organism can be isolated from the vagina in 95% and from the urinary tract alone in 5%.  In females, the urethra lies in close proximity to the vagina, therefore urine streams may flush vaginal trichomonads from time to time and so, yes, the organisms can often be detected in urine samples.   Infected men and women may sometimes have no symptoms and are important reservoirs of infection. Women who are treated for trichomoniasis show an increased cure rate if their regular sex partners are treated as well. Patients with trichomoniasis should be evaluated for the presence of other sexually transmitted diseases.  Dr Anthony Solomon Consultant Physician, Tropical & Genitourinary Medicine\n\n",

    "content": "Without an examination, you are unlikely to obtain a diagnosis. You will only be examined by one doctor, unless a referral to another is involved, so not everyone in your town \"will look between your legs\".  You can also ask to be examined by a female doctor if one is available.   There are several possibilities if painful red bumps are seen on the genitalia. I note that you have stated \"Genital Herpes\" in the subject matter of your post, which means you suspect this is what these bumps are. Genital Herpes is acquired through sexual contact with a person who is shedding the virus from a mucosal or skin surface. Systemic and local symptoms are often prominent in the first episode of genital herpes and often occur within 3-4 days after the appearance of the lesions. Systemic symptoms include fever, headache, malaise and body pains. Local symptoms are usually pain, itching, painful urination and enlarged, tender lymph nodes in the groins. The lesions in genital herpes usually start as tiny red bumps which progress to fluid-filled sacs before breaking down to ulcers which persist for 4 -15 days until healing occurs.

    "content": "Thankyou to all the volunteer Dr's. and RN's for providing this forum. I hope someone can help me. Very worried. Made a mistake but learned. Don't want to hurt my wife.  Background History: 51 year old male with history of a few gout symptoms (big toe pain). Never tested for Uric acid levels. What I figured to be typical urinary problems of a guy in his 50's, low volume stream, sometimes slow to start, slight dribble. Monogamous relationship for 27 years. One time mistake, drunk and had exposure to unprotected sex w/coworker 7 mo. ago. 2 mo. ago sudden tingle in penis, frequent urge to urinate, slight burning in head of penis. Volume seemed to increased during this time, could be due to increase in water intake. Treated with cranberry pills and D-mannose but UTI has not cleared. Within the week full STD panel through Labsafe .com, negative results for all tests. Chlamydia and Gonorrhea urine test utilizes nucleic acid amplification, however because of my urgency to urinate after holding urine for 4 hrs. the sample used was actually a mid stream catch. first oz or two went in the toilet. I have since read that with this type of testing, first catch is required. Question:  1. Is it likely that a false negative would happen given the type of sample I supplied? 2. Does my symptoms sound like STD, Chlamydia and Gonorrhea or just a UTI? 3. I have not gone to the Dr. (family friend) for fear I have STD. I have 6 250 MG of Cephalexin prescribed for my dog could that clear a UTI?\n\n",

Proper urine specimen collection (regardless of the tes)t to be done is a mid-            stream catch which you have just done yourself.  Proper urine collection can             yield an accurate result         2. time.           The amount of time or duration for the urine sample to be analyzed is also crucial.            The longer the time before the sample is analyzed, the more prone the sample will             be contaminated by microbial growth.         3. Container.           Urine samples placed in unsterile or unclean containers will obviously yield            positive microoganism culture.         For your second question, There are several conditions which present with the same symptoms that you have. Based on the information you have only mentioned:         1. 51 years old/male        2.

STD (this includes gonorrhea, chlamydia)         2. UTI        3. Urolithiasis (Urinary bladder stone)        4. Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)  To consider condition #1, aside from unprotected sex with a partner of unknown sex practices,  have you noticed any penile discharge - yellowish/greenish? foul-smelling/fish-odor, etc? any skin rashes or lesions noted? a urine or discharge gram stain/culture & sensitivity can identify the culprit. Once the microorganism is identified, a more appropiate antibiotic can be given to you (unless it is more of viral cause, then an antiviral is an appropiate drug).  To consider UTI, a simple urinalysis can reveal an elevated WBC count or presence of pus in urine. Gram stain/ culture and sensitivity can identify the organism involved so that an appropiate antibiotic can be given.  TO consider urolithiasis, a simple urinalysis may give you the suspicion of this conditon if there is presence of RBC in your urinalysis (unless you have an underlying illness which would make the urinalysis positive for RBC). A more definitive test is a KUB x-ray, sometimes accompanied with contrast/dye which will easily make the stone standout in the x-ray.  To consider BPH, during your physical exam (rectal exam), your doctor can easily confirm whether your prostate is enlarge which may be the cause of your urgency, frequency and dribbling. BPH is more common as a man ages. To confirm this condition, your urologist can do a cystoscopy (to see inside your urethra and bladder and to determine the size of the gland and degree of obstruction. another test can be urine flow study - a reduce urine flow suggest BPH. Another test can be a prostate antigen test (PSA).  For question #3, it is still best to go to your urologist (not your vet ^_^), although both specialties may have the same brand of medications used, your body mass, metabolism, over all physiology and that of your dog is somehow varied.  I hope I was able to address your concerns. Thank you for dropping by this forum.  MD\n\n",

    "title": "STD or UTI-Very worried",
    "content": "Thankyou for responding so quickly.   I am very sure I have a UTI, I also did a AZO home test and it looks like I have WBC positive but nitrite negative. I understand that most UTI's are caused by E. coli and I believe that is a gram stain negative that produces nitrites. Since my home dipstrip test was negative for nitrite does that rule out most of the typical causes of UTI's in men my age? Because all my STD test came back negative I know I should feel confident to go to my Dr. to investigate this UTI. I'm sure guilt is driving me and also the fact that I have never experienced a UTI before. From what you said, I should be confident with the urine sample part of my test even though the clinical recommendation is for a first catch sample and mine was a mid-stream catch. From what I read the nucleic acid amplification is very sensitive and can detect the presence of even one cell of Chlamydia and Gonorrhea in a sample. The fact that my urine was held, with great difficulty I might add, until giving my sample would give time for Chlamydia and Gonorrhea bacteria to be in the urine and not just the first portion.  I'm also wondering about the time to presentation of my symptoms. I know with Chlamydia symptoms can be so mild that an inflicted person may not notice at all. But is it typical for the presentation to mimic that of a UTI after 5 mo. from exposure? I have never seen any discharge at all ever. A little more history: I work at a desk, before the onset of my UTI symptoms I drank  a few cups of coffee a day. Sit for long hours and tend to hold urine longer than I should. Once the UTI symptoms showed up I started to drink large amounts of water to try and flush my system. Once while urinating I noticed a big increase in volume and pressure. Is it possible a stone was passed that was formed from high uric acid level in my system? could that have been what caused the UTI?\n\n",

    "content": "Unfortunatly, every unprotected sexual act can result in pregnancy, or STDs, regardless of the length of intercourse, and ejaculation, as men have preejaculate, which contains enough semen to cause pregnancy and STDS. Flulike symptoms often appear within 3 to 6 weeks of initial exposure to the virus, although symptoms can develop within just a few days. This first stage is called acute retroviral syndrome. Symptoms of acute retroviral syndrome are often mistaken for symptoms of another viral infection, such as influenza or mononucleosis, and may include:  Abdominal cramps, nausea, or vomiting.  Diarrhea.  Enlarged lymph nodes in the neck, armpits, and groin.  Fever.  Headache.  Muscle aches and joint pain.  Skin rash.  Sore throat.  Weight loss.   Thoes symptoms will disappear after a few weeks. After the initial infection with HIV, you may go many years without any other sign of illness. When symptoms recur, they may be vague and hard to describe (although some people complain of feeling fatigued or achy all over). A health professional may suspect HIV if symptoms persist or if a cause (such as influenza) of the symptoms cannot be identified. HIV may also be suspected when several of the following symptoms are present:  Confusion  Diarrhea or other bowel changes  Difficulty concentrating  Dry cough  Fatigue  Fever  Loss of appetite  Mouth sores  Nail changes  Night sweats  Swollen lymph nodes in the neck, armpits, and groin  Pain when swallowing  Personality changes  Recurrent outbreaks of herpes simplex  Shortness of breath  Tingling, numbness, and weakness in the limbs  Unexplained weight loss  Yeast infection of the mouth   If the only symptoms you have is swollen lymph nodes, then you probably only have a cold comming, and it is nothing to be concerned with, but since you had unprotected sex, I would recommed being tested for all STDs, as most don't show symptoms, and there is no way to tell you have one without being tested.  Please, always use protectection when having sex. Condoms are the only way to prevent the spread of STDs.\n\n",

    "content": "It sounds to me like \"jock itch\" Jock itch is caused by a fungus that lives on your skin. The name of the fungus is Tinea cruris, and is related to the athlete's foot fungus. Jocks aren't the only ones who get jock itch - men who sweat a lot can also get it, and sometimes women too. This fungus likes to grow and live in the warm, moist parts of the genital area, particularly the insides of the thighs. The rash makes the area itch, causes the skin to become red and sometimes crack or peel.  You can help prevent jock itch by keeping the area clean and dry. Take time to dry your genital area and inner thighs after showering, bathing, or swimming. To help prevent jock itch, you can put cornstarch or special drying powders on the area a few times a day (these are both available over-the-counter).  To treat jock itch, you can buy sprays or creams that are also available at a drugstore over-the-counter. In some cases, your health care provider may need to prescribe stronger medication to kill the fungus -- either a cream, a spray, or a pill.\n\n",

This morning I noticed a clear discharge from the tip of my penis, it was slight.  I'm not sure if it was discharge or some normal fluid.  I left this part out because I didn't want anyone to be uncomfortable, but my wife is experiencing the same stuff.  Her white 'molluscum' and lesion went away after a couple days, but the molluscum has returned twice with the last three weeks.  SHe said they then disappeared over night.  Of course, i'm calling it a molluscum just because it kinda looks like the pics.  It doesn't have a white dot on the top, it look more like a large herpes bump.  Again, there is no pain, only slight discomfort and a little prickly itch / burn sensation.  Last night I did experience significant itching.    Thank you, Skip\n\n",

Your going to drive yourself crazy doing that because each thing you look up on the internet is going to start to be a symptom & before you know it you have it all lol.  If it is Molluscum contagiosum, it does heal...but after months or even years. A lesion can be present for 2 or so months, & contamination & transfer to others is very easy. It is spread by direct contact, so avoid skin-to-skin contact with others as much as possible so not to spread it.  Some of the treatment options such as silver nitrate,tincture of iodin, retin-a, etc are not fda approved but they are options. The most common option is to have them removed as you would a wart such as curettage.\n\n",

    "title": "? PUBIC SKIN WART OR MOLLUSC",
    "content": "The simple answer to your question is YES.   In males, most genital warts occur on the penis, scrotum, urethral meatus and perianal area. Less often, they may be found on the pubic skin, upper thighs, or groin folds. Because genital warts frequenly occur with more than one lesion on one genital site and with lesions on different genital sites, it is important to examine the entire genitalia.  Molluscum contagiosum lesions are small, round, oval or hemispherical, pearly white or skin-colored papules that are centrally dented which may be found anywhere on the body, but in the genital region, they are usually seen on the pubic skin or penis. Your description is more suggestive of a mollusc, but diagnosis cannot be made on the internet.  When warts or molluscs are found in the genital area, they are usually sexually transmitted. The presence of  one  sexually transmitted disease raises the possibility of another - therefore, if either condition is diagnosed, a full STD screen and partner notification are advisable. It is the duty of patients who have an STD to notify their sex partners, including those without symptoms, of their exposure and encourage these partners to seek clinical evaluation.

The burn feeling is not going away and I have increasingly more and more pain as the day progresses.  Do you think this is a clear indication that I have a STI or could there be another possible solution given the situation?  My new partner also says that she was given a swab test two months ago and did not test positive for anything and she had not had sex eight months prior to that test.  I am really starting to worry.  If not a STI, what else could this horrible burning pain be   I have scheduled an appointment at planned parenthood for testing.  Any advice, comments, suggestions would be appriciated.\n\n",

    "content": "After someone becomes infected with HIV, the initial response of their immune system is to produce antibodies against the virus. The initial test that is used to determine if someone is infected with HIV measures these antibodies. Some people respond to the HIV virus by producing a lot of antibodies fairly quickly, and have a positive HIV test after only a couple of weeks. Other people respond more slowly and may not show a positive test for several months. The HIV test is called an indirect test because it measures antibodies to the HIV, not the HIV itself.  Since each person's response is different, the period of time it takes to develop enough antibodies to test positive for HIV can range from 2 weeks to 6 months. However, most people test positive by the 12th week. Unusual cases can take as long as 6 months.  It is very important to understand that unless a negative HIV test is obtained at least 6 months after the last possible exposure to the virus, no one can assure you that they do not have HIV.  I would recommend being tested yourself, just to be safe.\n\n",

He had no history of boils before sleeping with this person.  Normally, I wouldn't worry about this. It's his life, we're no longer  together, he did this to himself, etc. But me and him have been talking  recently about trying to work out our problems and it does worry me that  while he may not have herpes, she could've given him something else.

Sexually transmitted disease is no laughing matter at all. If left untreated, it could lead to complications aside from the stigma attached to one who has acquired STD.        Allow me to suggest that he get a medical check-up and screening for HIV/AIDS by getting an ELISA test if available there. With the advancement of medicine nowadays, ask your physician for any other alternative lab exams suitable or comfortable for him.       It'll also be up to you how you will approach him without offending him with regards to this sensitive and delicate matter. Cooperation,  your support and a sincere heart is needed for the both of you to have peace of mind, with no regrets later on.God bless.  M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "I had a lower risk encounter 5 months ago.  Four (4) weeks after this encounter I went to my Internal Medicine specialist and told him about it.  He then asked me to draw blood and give a urine sample.  I did so and he called me back three (3) days later to say all was good.  I went back to him at eight (8) weeks and asked him to check again. He repeated the test and said all was good -- \"urine clean enough to drink\".  At four and a half (4 1/2) months I went back to get my physical and thanked him for his help and asked him what test he ran.  He said he did not run a specific test for STDs, but did a microscopic urninalys to check for infection.  As the white cells were not out of range and the culture was fine he said I was clear of bacterial infection at both the 4 and 8 week period.  Following this I went to the clinic and had two batteries of test done for gonoreha, clamydia, syphils and herpes.  All came back negative with the exception of Herpes 1.    My question is that since some STDs will cure on their own, can I feel comfortable with the test he performed at the 4 and 8 week periods.  (I know I am clear now, but there was three (3) months in between.)  They showed no infections.  I am in a relationship and had intercourse after passing the 3 month window for HIV (negative as well).  I have talked with one other doctor and he said while it was not the best way to test, I can feel comfortable that I did not have a bacterial STD as the test were clear and I had no symptoms. I am a 53 year old male who has never been in this situation before.\n\n",

I also read that it is common for a negative IGG test and positive culture when you first get herpes, because of the lack of antibodies in the the blood.

    "content": "ok so, around 4 weeks ago i started to feel pain when urinating, i left it for a week or so before going to the doc as i was out off reach off a hospital for that time, when i went to the hospital i asked to saa a uroloigist, they asked if i had a any discharge which i did not i asked about Chlamydia as i had had sex recently where the condom broke. but was told it was unlikely because there was no discharge and it would be pointless to check if there was no discharge it would not show on the test, ok so they gave me Lexinor Norifloxacin and told me it was a urinary tract infection, they did give me a urine test at this stage and it showed hi white cells. ok i took the medicen but it did not help 7 days later back to the hospital, this time there was still no discharge and they still insisted on it not being Chlamydia, and gave me more meds this time a shot off ceftriaxone and 7 days worth off Rulid Roxithromycin. i have been taking this for 4 days now. does this medication sound correct to you.  Ok so the last couple off days i have been getting a small amount off discharge and i started to get a sore neck like i had slept badly, so i put it down to sleeping on the couch but the next day it moved down my back and arms, the next morning to my left hand, later that day it went down my legs and now i feel week and the balls off my feet hurt, could this be a reaction to the meds, or something totally differnt, the only other thing i have noticed is i have a slightly low temprature around 36.5.  any help would be greatly appriceated even just being told to see another doctor or move hospital, at present i am living in Thailand and i am using the best hospital in the country Suposedly !?.  so don't know where to go from here.\n\n",

    "content": "My first comment is that a urethral discharge is not always present in chlamydial infections. Chlamydial infections may often be asymptomatic, thus escaping detection. In your own case, it was important to be subjected to a screening for STDs because you had painful micturition after unprotected sex (condom failure).  The failure of response to a quinolone antibiotic indicates that this is not a UTI but possibly a sexually contracted urethritis. A further indication in favour of the diagnosis of urethritis is the recent occurence of a urethral discharge.   The treatment you require will depend on the results of an STD screen. See a genitourinary physician or venereologist for another opinion.   Dr Anthony Solomon Consultant Physician, Tropical & Genitourinary Medicine\n\n",

    "title": "NGU question",
    "content": "I have a question concerning a possible STI, I might have had.  The storyline goes like this: I had an encounter with a woman in which I used a condom, but about one to two days later noticed that my urine had become quite cloudy and sometimes pain accompanied..this continued on for about 5 weeks then I had a white milky discharge. I promptly went to the local STD clinic and they diagnosed me with NGU (Doxycycline for 7 days), I noticed that the symptoms cleared up. I went back after one morning I felt like I had another discharge but no definitive proof of what it was (semen or otherwise), but they did a gram stain and said whatever I had cleared up. About 1 week later, I got a girlfriend in which we would have unprotected sex, but I noticed somewhere about a month later that there was a slight cloudiness to my urine, eventually I had another white discharge and went back to the STD clinic. They gave 4 tablets of Metronidazole and 1 liquid cup of something else (can't remember the name), the cloudiness turned into little white floaty things in my urine. Of course, I'm afraid that the first round didn't fully cure the infection as it just seemed to make it more asymptotic and then I passed it to my girlfriend. In which we were both living with it for about 2 months. Also, the second time I went to the STD clinic (after having the second discharge) they said they were going to do a chlyamidia test, which came back negative (why they didn't do it the first time is beyond me).   So now my questions and concern is this...  1) Assuming that during the first 5 weeks of cloudy urine before any NGU was diagnosed is it possible for the bacteria from the infection be transferred to the anus without intercourse? Such as having cloudy urine, passing stool and having the urine splash directly up in the anal opening? If not, then what else could explain the slight bit of pain I have been feeling while defacating and the slight bit of stinging around the opening that seemed to begin after having the urine hit my underside?  2) During the two months it seemed that my girlfriend and I were living with this infection, what are the consequences of giving oral sex to each other? Such as the bacteria residing in the mouth?  3) Assuming the bacteria in both the mouth and anus, what is the preferred treatment to cure these ailments?\n\n",

Anal pain or burning can be caused by a variety of other conditions such as anal fissure, perianal dermatitis, thrombosed external haemorrhoid,  etc. A doctor's examination is necessary to identify the cause of your anal discomfort.  Chlamydial pharyngitis can be contracted by oral sex. This is the answer to your second question.  Diagnosis and treatment are not possible on the net.

    "title": "Rash or STD?",
    "content": "About three weeks ago i received oral sex without a condom.  The encounter was brief and i stopped it after about two minutes as i didn't feel comfortable without a condom.  The girl and i went to sleep in her bed where there was some minor, casual thigh to thigh touching (associated with cuddling).  There was no genital contact and no intercourse.  After sleeping there for about three hours i left and took a shower when i got home..  The next morning, i noticed a rash developing on my inner thighs consisting of red bumps/sores about the size of a dime.  These bumps don't hurt, burn, or itch much.  I tried using a topical cortizon cream on them but it didn't help.  The bumps aren't blistering, but it does seem that the rash has spread.  In addition, the only thing that i have found relieves the redness is allowing prolonged open air contact (i.e. while i'm sleeping)  After doing this, i will wake up and it will appear as though the areas are drying, but after work when i come home they have gone back to being red again.  The bumps/sores are red to pink in color and are fairly consistently colored from center to edge.  The edges of the sores may be a little darker red/pink than the other areas.  I am worried that this might be an STD but as there are no symptoms directly on my scrotum or penis and only on my inner thigh where there may or may not have been direct skin contact, i am confused and worried.  Any thoughts?\n\n",

    "content": "Rashes can be very tricky to diagnose.  It is not an STD; as a rash would not develop in a matter of hours, and on the thighs; even herpetic symptoms would take a couple of days, and there would be sores developing on your penis.   That's not to say an STD isn't possible, since you did have contact, albeit briefly.  I suggest considering the duration of the rash and its resistance to cortisone cream you see a dermatologist for an accurate diagnosis.\n\n",

The presence of one STD raises the posssibiliity of another, so a full STD screen then becomes mandatory, especially as you have never been tested. Did you show these \"bumps\" to the doctor who diagnosed an ovarian cyst, and what were his comments?  The lower right abdomen is the site of multiple structures - the right ovary, right fallopian tube, large bowel and appendix. A change in bowel habit associated with abdominal pain will require further tests under a gastrointestinal surgeon.   Dr Anthony Solomon Consultant Physician, Tropical & Genitourinary Medicine\n\n",

Expectedly also, she was  subjected to a Pap test to exclude cervical dysplasia commonly caused by HPV.   External genital wart treatment can be patient-applied or doctor-administered. You should select the more convenient approach and stay with the doctor who is genuinely sympathetic to your problem and with whom you are comfortable. I will mention Imiquimod Cream here only because it was prescribed for you and you mentioned it in your post. I do not prescribe on the internet and do not advise anyone to receive any treatment prescription on the internet without a doctor\u2019s examination. It is a topically active immune enhancer that stimulates production of interferon and other cytokines. Local inflammatory reactions are common with its use, but these reactions are mild to moderate. It should be applied once daily at bedtime, three times a week for up to 16 weeks. The treatment area should be washed with soap and water 6-10 hours after the application. You should be followed-up several weeks into therapy to determine response to treatment.  Dr Anthony Solomon Consultant Physician, Tropical & Genitourinary Medicine\n\n",

    "title": "CONDYLOMAS",
    "content": "There are two types of condylomas and I am not sure which one you are interested to know about, so both will be discussed.  Condyloma acuminatum is a sexually transmitted disease caused by the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV). It is also known as a genital wart and occurs in the anal or genital areas. Many lesions occurring at the same time are known by their plural form - condylomata acuminata.  Condyloma latum  is a secondary manifestation of syphilis, a sexually transmitted disease caused by the bacteria Treponema pallidum. It occurs in the anal or genital areas as a flat plaque. Many lesions occurring at the same time are known by their plural form - condylomata lata. Syphilis can also be transmitted from an infected mother to her fetus via the placenta.  The average incubation period of genital warts is 2-3 months.  The average incubation period of primary syphilis is 10 \u2013 90 days. Secondary syphilis occurs 4-10 weeks after primary syphilis.   In women, external genital warts are easily recognized by the specialist, but when they occur in inconspicuous places such as in the vagina and on the cervix, colposcopy is used to aid in detection. Some individuals with genital warts never become aware of their presence and therefore do not seek treatment until the disease is sexually transmitted to their partners.  Diagnosis of genital warts can be confirmed by biopsy, although biopsy is utilized if the diagnosis is uncertain, or the lesions do not respond to treatment or the disease worsens during therapy. Another method of diagnosis is the use of type-specific HPV DNA tests.  Dr Anthony Solomon  Consultant Physician, Tropical & Genitourinary Medicine\n\n",

    "title": "~Lump on Penis??",
    "content": "I noticed a lump on the right side of my penis about where i am circumsized...Not sure what it is...It's not any different color/doesn't hurt/doesn't itch...it's not huge just noticeable...if i pull the skin back i still see it...The only thing that concerns me is I am with a new girlfriend(2months) that was fairly sexually active before..although she said she got tested about 6 months ago and was clean... I myself have always used condoms and haven't been with that many people...So I think she might have gave me something...Does this sound like something transmitted or something normal????\n\n",

    "title": "Wits end!",
    "content": "Hello,  Well I'm about finished with the system. In January I went to see my Dr. because I had just broken up with my gf(A). I went to be tested for std's (as I do after every gf), and told my Dr. that I had burning during urination (I thought I had a UTI). He told me I didn't have a UTI and gave me 250 Mg of Ciprofloxacin 2x daily for 7 days. Didn't inform me of any std, or even hint to the possibility. Well, a few days later I started seeing an ex flame(B)  and I end up infecting her, as well as reinfecting myself.  After 14 days and several phone calls to an answering machine, my Dr.'s assistant finally decides  to call with my first test results, and I'm positive for Chlamydia.  It only takes 2 days for the results!!!! So instead of going through that again with my Dr., I went to urgent care, told the Dr. exactly what happened, the Dr. gave me 2 pills of Zithromax 500Mg each, taken all at once.  She said I wouldn't need a retest. I felt much better, after 10 days.  My gf(B), went to see her OB, and got a test result of negative. The Dr. didn't give her any antibiotics (unknownst to me).  So we resume sexual activity, and I go back to my normal Dr. for a follow up to find out I'm positive for Chlamydia again. Now my Dr. gives me 500 Mg of Ciprofloxacin 2x daily for 10 days, now its almost May. I left gf(B),  and met gf(C). I told her what was going on and we waited for me to complete my medication and get test results. I was tested 3 days after I completed my meds, and it came back negative (this is mid March).  Now, as of last week (beginning of May), I test positive again!!!!  This time it took several phone calls to an answering machine and a ex wife to get a call back. The Dr. is sending me to a specialist, which I wouldn't have needed if he would have told me from the start 'hey, you might have something infectious, don't have intercourse'.  It takes 7-10 days to get a referral (quite a long time when your urine feels like lava). So now, I'm at the end of my rope. I would like advice on dosages to clear this up. I'm 32, 6'4\" 240lbs perfect health (besides the Chlamydia). Following are the symptoms in order.  1st  time: Extreme pain during urination, after a couple weeks my testicles begans to hurt. Dr. felt the back of my testies an squeezed a little to see if it was painfull. It hurt a little, he said it was swollen.  2nd time: Burning, during urination. My rectum itched really bad, I can only attribute this to gf(B). She was masturbating, then later tried to use the same finger to stick it up my rectum   LOL   3rd time: Burning sensation isn't as bad (like a mild UTI). It died down, and comes and goes. The urine smells pretty bad. I had a little bit of rectal itch, but that went down, and comes and goes also. The new symptom is white milky discharge. Primarly in the morning I can squeeze it out.  Sore testies, was painfull in the beginning, now comes and goes also.  My primary Dr. felt my testies again and they weren't swollen (the tract inside), and it didn't hurt when he squeezed, he also said they didn't feel swollen as if an std infection was present.  If I don't get my referral this week (yes I've already called and left several messages), I will be ordering antibiotics online regardless, any guidence would be greatly appreciated. Yes, I know the risks, but I've had it.   Thank You Very Much     P.S. Save the safe sex speech please, I was monogamous with all my girlfriends and an ex wife for 15 years, and I get tested after each girlfriend.   My first one cheated on me after she said \"your the only one for me blah blah blah\". Thats how I was infected.\n\n",

The medical personal could give a crap about you or your well being. Your just another cog in their machine. Just google.com 'chlamydia treatment' then read what the cdc recommends for a cure. If your a male, make sure you don't have epididymitis, this is much tougher to fix, and should look up how to treat it. To get your drugs, go to xlpharmacy.com or another site that doesn't require a prescription. They send you drugs from India, at a reasonable price.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Doctor, Previously you have given me very good advise when I had UTI. Since then, I have had no problems at all and also practiced safe sex as you have advised. However, recently, after having sex with my wife, I developed a rash on my penis. Initially both of us thought it was just a mild thing and we cleaned ourselves etc. but eventually both of us realised that the rash is more than just a skin infection. Both of us panicked when we noted that in her vagina, a kind of whitish layer which is quite thick has developed and the skin was very red. As for my penis, the skin seemed to be peeling off with some red spots noted as well. There wasn't any pain but just some slight itch. There was also no burning sensation when we urine.   We consulted a doctor and the doctor said it was mild and maybe my wife just have the common chlamydia and I just have a skin infection due to abrasion during sex. The doctor gave my wife some insertions and since then she has recovered well. As for me, the skin has all recovered well and looked very normal but I still see a few red spots. It has been about 10 days since I completed medication. After that, I have never had sex.   The last medical checkup we both had, did not reveal any signs of STDs or UTIs. She did swab tests and I did urine test for chlamydia too. All our results were perfectly fine.   My question:  How come we can develop this kind of sexual disease even though both of us are clean (tested by the labs) and never have sex with anyone else?   What do you recommend me to do? Can I apply the lotion \"fucidine\" that is an antibiotic cream on the spots?   I really do not have confidence in the local doctors here as my previous UTI wasn't treated properly until I seek advise from you all.   Thanks very much.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Cachaca,  Thank you very much for using our website and for the vote of confidence.  This does not sound to me like chlamydia since chlamydial infections have certain characteristics including having inflammation of the urethra with urethral discharge.   i can not tell for sure what of infection you and your wife had at that time but since it is gone now i would not worry about it much.  Infections of the genital tract can occur in otherwise healthy individuals and since you and your wife are monogomous the chance of relapse is very small.  i guess there is no harm in applying antibiotics ointment if you still have some inflammation.  Once more, thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped and don't to post any concerns.  Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "title": "PERSISTENCE OF SYMPTOMS AFTER TREATMENT FOR CHLAMYDIA",
    "content": "The first line treatment for Chlamydia is Doxycycline, which possesses more than 95% efficacy, has a twice daily dosage and an occasional missed dose does not appear to alter efficacy. It is therefore a good drug for the treatment of your infection.  If symptoms persisted after the first treatment, (assuming that you were not reinfected by unprotected sexual activity during or after treatment), you should have undergone retesting (also known as a test of cure). Your post does not suggest this was done.  I am also assuming that your sex partners were notified, treated and cured  to minimize the risk of reinfection. The combination therapy you were prescribed as second course of treatment is highly efficacious. Therefore, persistence of burning during micturition may imply coinfection with another organism that does not respond to your current therapy.   If symptoms persist 3 weeks after completion of present combination therapy, a test of cure should be considered to exclude other causes of urethritis. It is also helpful to drink at least 2 litres of water daily while on treatment.  Sexual abstinence is important while on therapy and for at least 7days after completion of treatment.

    "content": "Follow-up is an essential part of the management of chlamydial infection because it provides reassurance, and excludes recrudescence. Detection of chlamydia during follow-up is greatest 3-5 weeks after completion of therapy, therefore you should wait for at least 3 weeks after treatment to undergo a microbiological test of cure. You must also abstain from sexual intercourse during this period. If your chlamydia test continues to be negative but symptoms persist, other sexually transmitted infections should be sought and appropriate treatment instituted.

I went on a 10 day treatment of doxycycline, that didn't help, so then I went on a 14 day treatment of doxycycline along with another concurrent medicine called metronazolimide or something like that.  After that I waited a couple weeks and then returned to the doctor for full blood and urinalysis.  Everything came back negative (hiv, etc.) except I'm still positive for chlamydia. So now I am taking Z-Pak.  Is this common that this infection can stay around for so long or is this an exception?  Like I said everything was checked and tested for but for some reason I can't get rid of this.  Hopefully after the Z-Pak things will get better.  Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "As my other post stated I have been one several courses of treatment for Chlamydia, none of which seem to be working.  My question is if I masturbate am I at risk of keeping myself infected (or re-infecting myself for that matter)?  A silly question I'm sure, but I'm trying to figure out why nothing I've taken has worked so far after 4 months.  Thanks\n\n",

This is not regarded as a re-infection, but as an unresolved infection.  It is not unlikely that frequent masturbation may have the same effect.   You should have posted this question in the same thread as your previous posts, to maintain continuity.   Dr Anthony Solomon\n\n",

Chlamydias are obligate intracellular organisms and humans are the only natural host. It is therefore most unlikely that they can survive long enough on clothing, towels or bedsheets contaminated with semen or discharge when you were infected, to reinfect you.  Patients treated for chlamydia must abstain from sexual intercourse for 7 days after single-dose therapy. They must also abstain from sexual intercourse until all of their sex partners are cured to minimize the risk of reinfection.

When symptoms do occur, generally speaking, usually are 1-3 weeks after exposure but are often mild and are easily overlooked. Some signs or symptoms of this infection may include vaginal discharge, painful urination, abdominal pain, etc. One of the complications of untreated chlamydia infections is pelvic inflammatory disease (infection of the uterus and fallopian tubes) It would be impossible for me to say whether or not you have recently contracted this infection or have had it for an extended period of time.

    "title": "TREATMENT FOR CHLAMYDIA",
    "content": "Hi,  Ideally, treatments for Chlamydia should have the following qualities:  be effective (with a cure rate exceeding 95%); be easy to take (not more than twice daily); possess a low side-effect profile; cause minimal interference with daily lifestyle.  In a female (which is not your case), the possibility of pregnancy should be considered, as it will affect antibiotic choice.  The first line treatment for Chlamydia is Doxycycline, which possesses more than 95% efficacy, is relatively cheap, has a twice daily dosage and an occasional missed dose does not appear to alter efficacy. The disadvantages are that it cannot be used in pregnancy and may cause gastrointestinal disturbance and photosensitization as side-effects.  Second line treatments include  Erythromycin,  Azithromycin, Tetracycline, and  Ofloxacin.   Erythromycin, is cheap and can be used in pregnancy. Its disadvantages are its lengthy dosing (four times daily), gastrointestinal disturbance which leads to discontinuation, and a less than 95% efficacy.  Azithromycin(Zithromax by trade name) .  Advantage:  once only dosing.  Disadvantages:  expensive; limited data on cure rate; unknown safety in pregnancy.  Tetracycline Advantages: cheap, more than 95% efficacy Disadvantages: cannot be taken with milk; cannot be taken in pregnancy; lengthy dosing of 4 times daily; no data available on missed doses.  Ofloxacin Advantages: good efficacy, more than 95%; good side-effect profile; once daily dosage. Disadvantages: expensive; cannot be taken in pregnancy; uncertainty about efficacy when doses are missed.   Biaxin (generic name Clarithromycin) is indicated for respiratory tract infections, skin and soft tissue infections, middle ear infection, and Helicobacter pylori eradication. The manufacturer does not list Chlamydia as an indication for the use of the drug, and I have no experience in its use for Chlamydia. Was it prescribed by a genitourinary physician (or venereologist) for you?  I have used the first three drugs for Chlamydial urethritis and cervicitis with good effect but my first choice has always been Doxycycline in males and non-pregnant females.  I hope I have answered your question.  Thank you for contacting our website.   Dr Anthony Solomon MB BS DTM&H DIP.VEN FRSM Consultant Physician, Tropical & Genitourinary Medicine\n\n",

    "content": "Your main complaint is that of a whitish vaginal discharge that is persistent but is not associated with any other symptoms such as offensive odour, vulvar symptoms (irritation, rash, discomfort), painful intercourse or micturition. Your last tests for STDs  were, according to you, essentially negative. You have not mentioned whether you have been sexually active after your last treatment and if  your partner/s was/were also tested/treated for STDs. I presume that you were not only tested for Chlamydia but other sexually transmitted diseases as well. The presence of one sexually transmitted disease raises the possibility of another.  Vaginal discharge may be normal or abnormal. Normal vaginal discharge is usually physiological and causes no discomfort.   Abnormal vaginal discharge may be caused by infection higher up (in the cervix)  or lower down (in the vagina). Infection in the cervix is termed cervicitis; infection in the vagina is termed vaginitis or vaginosis.  Cervicitis is more serious and it is therefore more important to exclude it to prevent complications. It may be due to infective or non-infective causes. Cervicitis due to infection may commonly be caused by Chlamydia, Gonorrhoeoa, Mycoplasma, Ureaplasma, and Genital Herpes.  Non-infective discharge from the cervix can be caused by cervical polyps and intrauterine contraceptive devices.   Cervicitis of infective origin raises the possibility that uterine infection (endometritis) with or without tubal infection (salpingitis) may also be present, which could cause you additional symptoms such as lower abdominal pain and tenderness. You have not complained of these symptoms.   Abnormal vaginal discharge may commonly be caused by trichomoniasis (TV), bacterial vaginosis (BV), and vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC). These produce additional symptoms such as vulvar irritation, redness, rash, swelling or discomfort.  In both TV and BV, there is additionally an offensive odour. Again you have not complained of any of these symptoms. VVC is characterised by a combination of any of the following: vaginal discharge, vaginal soreness, vulvar irritation, vulvar burning, and painful intercourse. The discharge is typically cottage-cheese-like in character but may vary from watery to thick. Odor, if present, is inoffensive and minimal.  I believe you will benefit from a further visit to a Genitourinary Clinic (also known in some areas as STD Clinic, Venereal Disease Clinic or Sexual Health Clinic)  where further tests can be conducted to exclude the conditions I have listed here.  Thank you for contacting The Doctor's Lounge and please let us have an update after further tests.

I recommend you be tested for chlamydia before engaging in any more sexual encounters.   For you information though... Chlamydial transmission usually is caused by sexual contact through oral, anal, or vaginal intercourse. The incubation period is 1-3 weeks. So I guess it depends on WHERE you kiss her doesnt it?

    "content": "Dear:dullybugg: Yes you should get tested. Taking antibiotics without being sure of the diagnosis is foolish.  For your information concerning Chlamydia here are some facts: Chlamydia is common among young men, who are seldom offered screening. Untreated Chlamydia in men typically causes urethral infection, but may also result in complications such as swollen and tender testicles.   Men, like women, may have pain during urination, or they may notice a burning and itching around or discharge from the penis or pain and swelling in the testicles. Chlamydia is a very insidious disease because it rarely causes symptoms. People don't know they're infected so they don't get treated. Then they infect their partners who also don't get treated.  Doxycycline will cure both Chlamydia and ureaplasma infections. Two Doxycycline 100mgs capsules per day for ten days in most cases will cure Chlamydia.  Thank you for using The Doctor's Lounge\n\n",

    "content": "My boyfriend just notified me that he has contracted chlamydia (Been dating 1 month).  His doctor told him that since he has a heart condition that he cannot be treated with antibiotics.  I tried to do some reasearch about the two most common antibiotics used, but could not obtain any information on heart conditions and these medications.  To make matters worse I had just found (2 months ago) out that my former boyfriend gave me herpes.  I had told my current boyfriend about this before we had sex, but with this new STD coming about I'm afraid that my former boyfriend also gave me chlamydia, which would mean that I've had it for at least 2 months.  I'm going to my doctor tomorrow, but I know that infertility can result.  Any information would be helpful  Thanks\n\n",

Otherwise, i am not aware of contra-indications to antibiotics in cases of heart conditions whatever those conditions are.

The mode of transmission of herpes is by close personal contact, and infection occurs via inoculation of virus into susceptible mucosal surfaces (eg, oropharynx, cervix, conjunctiva) or through small cracks in the skin.   HSV-1 is transmitted chiefly by contact with infected saliva, whereas HSV-2 is transmitted sexually or from a mother's genital tract infection to her newborn.  So, the answer to your question would be yes, to all counts.  Hope this helps,  bill\n\n",

    "content": "Ramahluvsme, Sorry to hear about your boyfriend, I agree with Dr. Sohel, when treated early, there are usually no long-term consequences of Chlamydia although this cannot be guaranteed. Serious complications can result, however, when left untreated.  1. Long-term complications in men include:  Epididymitis - an inflammation of the epididymis, which is the tube which carries the sperm from the testicles. In very rare cases, where both epididymal tubes have been affected, this infection can cause sterility.  Reiter's syndrome - an autoimmune condition where sufferers have conjunctivitis or an eye problem known as 'uveitis', inflammation of several joints (polyarthritis) and rarely, a rash on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.  Fertility problems - past chlamydial infections can affect fertility but without necessarily causing definite sterility.  2. Long-term complications in women  Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) - an ascending infection that spreads from the vagina and cervix to the uterus and Fallopian tubes. PID can lead to sterility.  Perihepatitis - an infection around the liver.  Reiter's syndrome - see above.  There are no guarantees that treatment of chlamydia will prevent further problems occurring particularly when it comes to fertility.  As for the penile lesions as Dr. Sohel just said there is no way of helping you without a direct examination as it does seem rather atypical.  My best to you,\n\n",

How reliable are those tests?  And now I'm afraid, I have low back pain and pelvic pain.  What are the stages of Chlamydia and time periods?  Is it too late to prevent infertility?  Pllease I want to have more children!\n\n",

    "content": "winkychik25, How did your partner's discharge results come out? Was he diagnosed with chlamydia? What test did you get was it a cervical swab?  If untreated, chlamydia infection can progress to serious reproductive and other health problems with both short-term and long-term consequences. Like the disease itself, the damage that chlamydia causes is often \"silent.\"\n\n",

    "content": "I was needing to know some info on Herpes.  I need to know if a person can have a break out 2 days after unprotected sex.  I was recently diagnosed with herpes and I have only slept with 2 people.  One of them was my ex, and he has a girl pregnant and she slept with him around the same time I did, and she doesn't have it.  Then I recently hooked up with someone new, and when we had unprotected sex I had a cut down there, and I heard it's easier to get it when you have a cut or lession.  I need to know this info so that before I tell him to go get checked out I can be sure he gave it to me.  And one other thing he didn't have a break out or anything, so that confuses me even more.   Shanna\n\n",

You should go see your doctor to get treatment and be on chronic suppressive therapy/  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.
