    "content": "My 38 year old husband went to the ER last week due to vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain.  They did a CT scan and incidentally found a mass on his kidney that was 3.8 cm. The mass was confirmed through a renal US. After testing on his stool he was found to have Salmonella.  In the Ct scan he had done in the ER it stated \"prominent lymh nodes\".  The urologist wants to wait about 6 weeks before getting a CT scan with contrast in order for the inflammation from the Salmonella to be gone.  I am very concerned that prominent lymph nodes means the cancer has already spread, but the urologist says it could be from the Salmonella poisoning and it is best to wait so the results of the CT and eventual surgery are predictable and without complication.  Could it be possible that the lymph nodes around his kidney were prominent from a Salmonella infection, or do you think the cancer could have spread already?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Thank you for the post.  You say that the CT scan report said there was 'lymphadenopathy', but there is no mention of which group/groups of lymph nodes were seen to be enlarged.   In salmonella enteritis, apart from the diffuse wall thickening typically seen in the ileum(salmonella ileitis), there are frequently, enlarged \"regional\" lymph nodes-usually the mesenteric nodes, and at times, the periportal lymph nodes.It is very unusual to have enlarged lymph nodes near the kidneys due to a salmonella enteritis.  Your urologist naturally, would prefer to wait and see if the nodes would subside with the treatment for salmonella enteritis (they are likely to), before attributing the nodes to the renal 'mass'. Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 34-year-old female who was diagnosed with renal cancer March - April 2007 (32 at the time) I had a partial nephrectomy of my right kidney after which a biopsy said it was actually pre-cancerous. what does that mean, really?  I was never refered to an oncologist, though our hospital (small town) did have an oncology department. I was alone at school and had no advocate or support system and things essentially just \"happened\" to me. It was an incidental finding and very small. I had earlier CT scans only a year before and no cancer was seen then. So was it just new and is there any way that this could have come from some other area in my body? Noone has ever checked, and now I have moved, have new doctors, etc. The only thing I can find is that apparently this is more of a \"geriatric\" cancer, though has been found in people in there 40s. I have looked up the risk factors and possess NONE. I have never smoked, or drank alcohol, or taken drug; I have never been on any medications, I am not a man, I am white and way younger than 60 years; I exercise regularity (though not excessively), I eat healty, I rest enough, I even practice yoga...  My question is two-fold:  How could I have even gotten this cancer? and Do I need to worry about any cancer in the future?  Sincerely, MC\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Firstly let me try to appraise you of some of the reported features of renal cell carcinoma (RCC).  Unlike many genitourinary malignancies, premalignant lesions in the kidney are scarcely described. Intratubular epithelial dysplasia has been sited as the most common precursor of RCC.   In von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL) where the evolution from a simple cyst - - atypical cyst with epithelial hyperplasia- - to cystic or solid conventional  RCC is well described in the literature.  An adenoma-carcinoma sequence has been recognized in the genesis of papillary RCC  with specific genetic changes.   Familial and genetic factors are well documented in VHL disease, in hereditary papillary RCC, in the tuberous sclerosis complex and in familial RCC.  One other thing worth noting is the observation that the familial renal cell carcinomas tend to occcur in younger individuals and could be bilateral.  Also, the incidence in women is on the increase and approaching that of men.  In the absence of more information (such as the histological type of your tumor, results of genetic studies (if any), it is difficult to predict the future course of your disease. Let's hope for the best.Good day!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello and thank you in advance.  I'm a 44 year-old male diagnosed with stage II renal cell carcinoma in 2000 (at age 37).    My physician stopped providing follow-up care for this in 2005, stating that I had made it to the five year mark and the cancer is guaranteed not to come back.  It has now been two years since I have had follow-up testing of any kind and this does not feel quite right to me.  Further, I have never had a follow-up CT scan since my nephrectomy.  Only chest x-rays and bloodwork until 2005.  This is disconcerting to me since the original tumor did not show up on my bloodwork at all... only on CT scan and by accident.   So how can bloodwork and chest x-ray alone be a reliable indicator?  I would be grateful for any advice on proper follow-up care for renal cell carcinoma.  Sincerely,  Dig62\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I am writing on behalf of my father, I'm just simply helping him out in his search for an answer, as well as my growing curiosily for Oncology studies.   Last December (2004) my father had a radical nephrectomy on his left kidney. The surgery did also reveal that the tumor was not only on the kidney, but also streching into the vena cava. They removed what they could, but the surgery got complicated (uncontrollable bleeding), so they removed what they could, but they did tell us that the cancer may come back.   So now it's a year and scans reveal that there is a tumor in his lung (from what i know 2cm), and his liver (1.7cm), and on his toe (not sure but at least 2cm). I've already researched and from what I know the Stage IV RCC spreads to the lung and liver, but nothing about a toe...but I have been told in extremely rare cases it does, but I have not found any information on it.   The thing is either my father is lying, but the tumor is shrinking. A couple of months ago he went for scans. Lung and Liver tumors were revealed. Lung tumor size is 2cm and the Liver is 1.7cm. Now hes had another round of scans (mainly CT, no MRI because of surgical staples) and they show that the tumors have shrunken down. Lung is not 1.7cm and the Liver is 1.3cm. Is this possible? From what I know it's not but...  Either that's the case, or it hasn't grown over the past few months.   He did have a tumor ressection[sp?] on that toe, me and my father are aware that there is a very high chance it will come back (on the toe), so he is going for biologic therapy (another Stage IV criteria for treatment) to strengthen the immune system.   My questions are: 1. Is it possible for a tumor to start shrinking, or at least stay the same size? 2. How rare is the tumor on the toe after a RCC nephrectomy? 3. Any other possible treatments apart from biologic therapy? 4. Any clinical trials availible in Australia, or would overseas be a better bet? 5. Chance of life over a 5-year period? Or an approximate year life span? 6. This is the first case of cancer in the family, am I at risk? 7. Is his cancer truly a Stage IV RCC?  Original Kidney Tumor size: 7.5cm  Regards,         Angel C.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Neo776,  About 5% of patients with renal cell carcinoma have renal vein or inferior vena caval involvement at presentation.  Surgical resection is the treatment of choice in such patients. Studies showed  66%  5-year survival rate for patients who underwent radical surgical resection for their primary tumors.  Renal cell carcinoma is an immunogenic tumor. Spontaneous tumor regressions have been reported in cases of renal cell cancer.  Those who develop solitary metastasis after a disease free interval of more than one year have also better survival.  An aggressive surgical approach should be considered for this type of patients as long as the general condition does not preclude surgical interference.  33% of patients with solitary metastases who underwent surgical resection, survived for more than 5 years in a study.   Chemotherapy and radiotherapy did not show any promising results in renal cancer patients. Immunotherapy showed promising results and Interleukin-2 is the only FDA-approved treatment in metastatic renal cell carcinoma. New immunotherapeutic approaches under investigation for the treatment of advanced renal cell cancer.  Since your father did not undergo complete surgical excision, there is a higher risk for local recurrence as well as distant metastases, although his tumor behavior and the natural course of his disease is good (one year disease free plus spontaneous regression),  he would benefit from immunotherapy in case of evident recurrent or  metastatic disease.  Regarding the toe metastases; although rare, metastases to the small bones or to the soft tissue of the hands and feet (acrometastases) have been reported.  I advise you to follow up with the oncologist and keep us updated. Best regards,\n\n",

Is a form of chemo always done in metastasis cancer? Considering it is the liver would a correct paln be an aggresive one? What is the survival rate this type of cancer.

At least 4 hereditary syndromes associated with renal cell carcinoma are recognized. In the majority of them the disease tends to be multifocal and bilateral.  First of all he has to complete his work up to be sure that he has solitary liver metastases. If this is the case then, a surgical oncologist should be consulted for the possibility of surgical resection.  A small subset of renal cancer patients have solitary metastasis either at the time of presentation or develops during follow-up after nephrectomy. In general patients with solitary metastases have a better survival.  Those who develop solitary metastasis after a disease free interval of more than one year have also better survival. An aggressive surgical approach should be considered for this type of patients as long as the general condition does not preclude surgical interference.   33% of patients with solitary metastases who underwent surgical resection, survived for more than 5 years in a study.
