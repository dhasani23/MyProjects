Genetic predilection,sun exposure,presence of atypical nevi,fair skin with excess uv exposure,too many melanocytic nevi are all risk factors. Though I could not see the photo,sice it did not down load I would advise you to consult a physician if abnormal features above are present, for a screening. Dermascopy is a simple non invasive test for suspicious moles. Best wishes.\n\n",

It eventually became a bump but I thought it was from the glasses and did not seek medical advice until a year later.  That was 4 years ago. The dermatologist's nurse tech removed the lump, sent it for biopsy and then did a procedure in the office using scraping and heat.  I asked the dermatologist if I can go for Mohs and he said I didn't need it.  Six months ago I noticed a small red area on the suture line. It was positive for basal cell and I had Mohs surgery-which was a wonderful experience.  Every doctor seems to negate the possibility of metastasis but I am very, very worried.  I recently went to the doctor for a cough when I speak which has had a 11 week duration, so far.    He took blood tests and my liver enzymes are slightly elevated and amylase is 160 and I was told norm is 130.  I had an abdominal ultrascan which showed nothing except a cyst on the  liver.  My doctor wants to wait 10 days before he retests my blood and takes further action.  However, every medical pro thinks basal cell does not metastasize which is contrary to what  I have been reading.  I am very nervous\n\n",

    "content": "Hi kswife, Basal cell carcinomas can be very slow growing tumors.There are sub-types which also differ in their aggressiveness. Usually, these are slow growing, 'locally' invasive malignant tumors but rarely metastasize.   The incidence of distant metastatic basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is very rare\u2014 0.003% to 0.5% of the population.  Large, neglected, ulcerated, locally invasive and uncontrolled tumors are most prone to metastasize . Metastases usually occur after multiple local recurrences.  Therefore,it is mandatory to treat BCC promptly and adequately and to have regular followups to avoid the risk of metastasis to regional lymph nodes or distant sites(The lymph nodes, lung, bone, skin, spleen, and brain are sites of metastasis).  If excision (preferably Mohs') is successful, then perhaps, one only needs to be follow up regularly and carefully. Best wishes!\n\n",

When i roll my hand over it, it is painful and when i tried to squeeze it nothing comes off. I don't think its a pimple since i cant see a head and the lump is under my skin. Now I was wondering if it was skin cancer or something else even tough i read somewhere else that cancer lump are not painful. Is it true?   My second question and equally important is in regards to the nature of cancer lump. Now if I decided to wait before i could see a doctor in the city and the lump goes away, will it still be consider a cancer treat or not? In other words, doctor, does cancer lump goes away after ew days or does it stay longer and gets bigger? will a lunmp that gets smaller and goes away consider a cancer threat or not? to be more clear is that i was wondering if this lump goes away on his won after few days do i have to still be worried about it? the reason im asking you this is to be able to have a certain idea of my situation because if cancer lumps does not go away that easily and gets bigger then I will have better state of mind till my next doctor visit.\n\n",

Each one would go through a stage of turning black and crusty, then beginning to hurt and bleed. Their usually rounded edges would start to become jagged and seem to lose color into my surrounding skin. Eventually the black would scale off and some of them look normal again but some look multi color brown now. The mole locations vary from one on my face, one on my upper back one on my upper arm, one on my lower arm, and 2 on my hip. Each one going all weird on me at a different times except the 2 on my hip that started changing together most recently. I've had these mole forever and some are tiny and some are pencil eraser size. Up until now they've always been perfectly round and one solid color brown.

    "content": "Hi there.  I'm a 36 year old male, with an olive complexion. I'm bald and use a set of clippers to shave down the areas on my head where hair still grows.   Last week, I noticed a pink, inflamed cluster of bumps. I thought it was razor burn, but the cluster got a little larger over the next couple days and kind of formed into a flattish, raised lesion. Now, the lesion seems to be getting smaller. but I've also noticed it getting slightly scabby and red on spots. The area is somewhat sore and hard to the touch.   I recalled that I had used WD-40 on the clippers before using them (a lubricant I hadn't used on them before) on the day that I noticed the spots. I also went to a public water park that day.     So, naturally I'm wondering if this is some form of cancer or pre-cancerous growth or if it's just a kind of dermatitis, eczema or psoriasis. I've had little patches of eczema on other parts of my body in the past and have had a few rounds of blepharitis.   Here's an image of the lesion taken today (the small spot in the back/middle of my head has been there forever, I'm referring to the pink spot nearer the front of my head): http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3492/389 ... 3ab21a.jpg  Thanks so much.\n\n",

The fact they showed up rather spontaneously suggests they are innocent and probably due to some trauma to the heel of your hand, as this does sometimes result in the sort of lesions you describe.   However...if these do not disappear in  fairly short order (in a week or so), you probably would be wise to have a dermatologist look at them, since once in a very great while something problematic is found this way serendipitously.   Hope this is helpful to you. Good luck, and please follow up with us here  as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "how do i keep myself safe?",
    "content": "Ever since all the risk factors for skin cancer were made known to me (at least 5 years ago), I have tried to be really cautious with my skin and sun exposure. I have blonde hair, really light blue eyes, very fair skin, and lots of moles and freckles. And it took a lot of trial and error to realize that only SPF 50 sunscreen keeps me from getting burnt. Well, the only thing I didn't have was family history, except for my great aunt.  Well, last year my dad was diagnosed with melanoma. He caught it very early and luckily didn't need any chemo or radiation. they just removed a huge chunk of skin, so now he has a big scar on his chest. The only problem, the melenoma was not at all \"textbook\", if you know what I mean. It was three small red freckles on his chest. He just got them checked out because he never saw them before, but the dermatologist who looked at it just wanted to biopsy it anyway, but assured him that it was probably not melenoma. Well, it was. So basically, I have learned that it's not just the ABCD thing that determines melenoma.  So now I'm a bit scared. My dad hardly went out in the sun without loads of sunscreen. He grew up in canada too, and never really went to the beach or pool. I have been to the beach every summer of my life for vacation and grew up where it's a lot sunnier. I have been burnt a lot more than him.  I'm pretty sure I don't have any serious skin anomolies right now, just some round freckles, a few \"beauty mark\" type moles on my back and shoulders. But it's kid of hard to keep track of what was there before and what is there now. I guess I'm just really scared that I'll end up with three small red freckles too and not even notice if they were there before or not. Most of my freckles/moles are on my back, and shoulders, places I can't see very well.  I just turned 18 and my parents before didn't want me to get a skin cancer screening just yet, but I plan to get one as soon as I can. But my main question is how can I be sure that my skin is fine? It seems to me that skin cancer is inevitable for me and I don't want to find out too late. My dermatologist (for acne, about a year ago) recommended a routine skin cancer screening once a year, is that enought to keep me safe? I don't know, maybe I'm just being paranoid, but I don't want to catch anything too late. Any help on how to stay safe, if there is anything more to do, would be greatly appreciated. Thanks lots.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  In absence of randomized studies that provide definite standard methods or recommendations for screening and early diagnosis programs for malignant melanoma, many physicians agree that highest risk individuals (e.g. those with a strong family history of melanoma) should follow frequent self-examination and annual professional (primary care physicians or dermatologists) skin evaluation.   The screening examination is done with a source of bright light and a magnifying lens. It takes a few minutes, is safe and allows visualization of areas that are difficult to be seen by self examination like the back and posterior legs.  Some dermatologists use a dermoscopy (microscope like) that may improve the visualization and the evaluation of a pigmented lesion.   There is no recommend age for starting the screening program and you better follow up with your doctor for better evaluation and to be reassured.  Hope you find this information useful. Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

The skin around may feel warm and you may have a low grade fever.  This can be improved if you follow local antiseptic measure and apply local antibiotic ointment.  If this will not improve the condition, you should follow up with your doctor, who might prescribe systemic antibiotics or recommend its removal or drainage accordingly.  I would advise you to follow up with your doctor and to discuss with her your concerns.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

Most of them are small, only 2 of them are bigger (0.5cm wide)  They are now itchy and i managed to squeeze out some of the puss inside. But the lump increased in size afterward.  I also experienced excessive sweating on my scrotum when I am outside. This caused extreme itchiness and it is very warm around that area.

    "content": "Hello, You are right that squeezing these cysts will only compound the problem since it creates a wound in an are that is typically full of bacteria.  Most cysts will resolve on their own when left alone but in rare cases of multiple and large cysts, excision might be necessary to avoid further infection of surrounding tissues.  You should see a dermatologist who can remove them if needed or advise you otherwise.  For home care of the cysts, use an antibacterial soap and bathe regularly with it.  Apply warm, wet washcloths to the lumps for 20 to 30 minutes, 3 to 4 times a day. If you prefer, you can also use a hot water bottle or heating pad over a damp towel. The heat and moisture can soothe the lump, increase blood circulation to the area, and speed healing.  If by chance you are not eating a healthy diet, important in preventing and healing infections, you should be certain to take a vitamin to help.  Vitamin A, C, the Bs and Zinc are all important in healing so a daily multivitamin might be a good idea.  You may be experiencing other problems relating to the excessive sweat such as a yeast infection but it is unlikely caused by the cysts.  Yeast overgrowth occurs in a warm, moist environment such as the groin and can cause itching as you describe but can be treated with over-the-counter topical antifungal creams and powders.  Keeping the area as clean and dry as possible will help prevent future outbreaks.    Best wishes.\n\n",

I haven't had a surgery in almost a year now, I haven't injured myself in any way and I havent done anything remotely dangerous enough to make them bleed. I read somewhere that skin cancer is a possible cause of unexplained bleeding, is that an option I need to look into here?   As for past diagnoses the list could seem to never end, some of my past diagnoses include but are not limited to: heart failure, heart disease, cirrhosis of the liver and now I have a cancerous tumor on my liver as well. I was recently diagnosed with epilepsy and I have some nerve damage. As of right now I'm also recovering from viral meningitis.   Past surgeries include: a heart transplant, aortic valve replacement, and in January '08 I'll be undergoing a liver transplant as well.   Some of the medications I'm on include: diuretics, small doses of Tegretol, cholesterol lowering medication, ACE inhibitors, and occasionally I take aspirin. Other than the medications i absolutely have to have I don't introduce anything else to my liver because of its condition.

Some of your medines, the ace inhibitor and particularly the Tegretol, can cause platelet problems that can lead to increased bleeding.  Your doctor can do a CBC to look at the platelet numbers and some other tests to look at your ability to clot.  Also, if your liver is not functioning well it may not be able to make some of the needed clotting factors to keep you from bleeding (or more appropriately, stop you from bleeding).  I would look for something like this before being too concerned about skin cancer.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Imissmom,  I don't have any pictures to show you but I can tell you what we look for when determining if a mole is concerning.  A good way to remember these characteristics is using the ABCDE mnemonic.  A=asymmetry.  A mole that is different on one side than the other is more concerning.  B=Borders.  A mole with irregular borders rather than smooth borders is more concerning.  C=Color.  A mole with multiple colors is more concerning than one with a uniform color.  D=diameter.  A mole greater than 6mm is more concerning.  E=elevation or evolution.  A mole that is raised is more concerning.  A mole that is changing is more concerning.  The more of these characteristics that a mole possess the more concerning it is for being melanoma.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Dr. Lowe, Thanks for the info! I have come across this guide before, so pictures would be more helpful, of course.   The 2 moles I'm concerned about are on my shoulder & lower right shin.   The latter is about 6 mm and is slightly raised, but has none of the other red flag characteristics. I'm worried because I haven't always had it...just in the last 10 yrs. or so.   The one on my shoulder is 3-4 mm, slighly irregular in both symentry & border, brown in color except for 1 tiny light brown bump that is slightly raised, but it isn't changing and is not new.   Both areas have been sunburned multiple times.  Any other info you can provide would be much appreciated.  Thanks again!\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 28yr old female who was just diagnosed with a spitz nevi that was removed 2 weeks ago by my dermatologist. When my dermatologist told me of the diagnosis he was very unsure and said at least we got it all anyway...just in case.   I would not be worried about the diagnosis, but I have been feeling ill for the past year and a half. I have been having intermittent deep chest pains and been very fatigued. I had also noticed around the same time that I have an enlarged lymph node on my neck. My doctor is sending me to a specialist to have a look at the lymph node.   Should I be getting a second opinion on the spitz nevi diagnosis? I hear it is very hard to determine melanoma from spitz nevi. The mole that was removed was flat, dark, with light brown around the edges (almost like bleeding into my good skin) and it had a light brown spot in the middle.   Thanks so much.\n\n",

Typically, when a mole is removed it is sent to a pathologist for analysis to definitively determine what the mole was.  If it was melanoma it would be picked up this way.  Following up about the lymph node will be important.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Greetings:  A couple of weeks ago, I noticed some dark areas and a raised, jagged spot on my husband's back.  Husband is 41.  No previous surgeries.  I talked him into going to a dermatologist for consult, and after shave biopsy of three (3) spots, the diagnosis was Seborrheic Keratosis, Acanthotic Variant.  Pathology goes on to say:  \"In each sample, levels through the tissue designated \"x,y, and z\" are examined on one slide.  Sections demonstrate a seborrheic keratosis, acanthotic variant, characterized by acanthotic expansion on the epidermis with variable keratin cyst formation.  There are no malignant features identified as sampled.  H and E stained preparations are utilized in the evaluation.  The microscopic findings support the diagnosis.\"  My question is this:  to a layperson, this sounds like a great diagnosis, but I have Googled all this and have proceeded to alarm myself that this could potentially be pre-cancerous?  Is this a firm diagnosis of benign origin?? Is there anything else I should ask his physician?  We do not see him until July, and I am fairly alarmed, as he has more of these \"lesions\" that were not excised, and his physician said he has extensive sun damage on his ears.  Any help will be greatly appreciated!  Brandi\n\n",

    "content": "Seborrheic keratoses are benign lesions of the skin.  They are often darker than the surrounding skin and have a raised appearance to them.  It's almost as if they are glued on.  Acanthosis is a condition that basically is very similar and involves thickening of the skin.  It, too, is a benign process.  There is another condition known as actinic keratosis.  These lesions are considered precancerous and should be treated to prevent them from becoming skin cancer.  They can be easily frozen with liquid nitrogen by your doctor.  These spots generally are less raised and have a more rough feel to them, almost like sand paper.  I would recommend you have your doctor take a look at the spots to see if they look like actinic keratosis or a variant of seborrheic keratosis.  Seborrheic keratosis (any of their variants) will only very rarely develop into skin cancer-mostly they are just annoyances.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Smartpatrol9, I respect that you have been educated enough to recognise that it is of great value to use licensed technicians and estheticians for your body art.    Techniques employed by the artist should include \"aseptic technique\" which is a means of creating an environment that reduces the risks of infection.  The licensed provider has been specially trained to know how to do so.  The use of a new needle is a critical component, as well as proper cleaning or sterilization of other associated equipment.  Equally important is hand washing and the ink supply itself.  You have not indicated if the tattoo site is reddened or hot to touch, if the needle site is oozing at all, or if you are having a fever, or increased pain at the site.. These are all possible indicators of a localized infection.  Nausea that passes on its own (that you state seems triggered by your thinking about the possibility of infection) is not typically linked to a skin related infection - in the absence of other signs.   If any of these signs manifest, I would ask my primary physician or a local urgent care center to evaluate you and make appropriate recommendations.  If your friend is a good artist - I would also recommend that you strongly suggest they get a license so that they may continue to practice their art safely, for his/herself - and for the client.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 39 year old male.  I have no personal or family history of any type of skin cancer, but I have had a four dysplastic moles removed in the last 5-10 years and also had some others shaved but the biopsies returned normal.  I have dozens of other normal-appearing moles over by body as well.   I am otherwise healthy and taking no medications.  Since my first dysplastic mole, I have been checked by a dermatologist every year or two.  At a recent vist, I asked him to look at a mole on the underside of the shaft of my penis (he shaved that- biopsy was lentigo simplex).  At the same time, he asked about some spots on the top of the  head of my penis.  He seemed a little concerned but didn't go so far as to recommend another shave biopsy.  They have been there for some time, but I can't honestly remember how long.  My best guess is at least a couple years but probably not 10 years or more.    There are three of them and they appear like dark freckles or even small moles.   They are 1-2mm in diameter, slightly irregular in shape with fairly well defined borders.  They are colored a somewhat darker red/brown  than the surrounding tissue.  They are completely flat and not raised above the skin, there is no itching, peeling, pain or anything else unusual.   There are also a couple other lesser blemishes nearby, barely darker than the surrounding tissue.  I'd call them \"old age\" spots for lack of a clinical description.  They do not look like \"Fordyce\" spots that I've found in some photos while searching for information.  Does this type of spot seem unusual in this location?  Is it advisable to get another opinion from another type of specialist rather then a general dermatologist?  I'm a little reluctant to have a shave biopsy there for obvious reasons, unless it is clearly suspicious or unusual.  Obviously I'm watching them for changes, but have noted none in the few months since I became concerned about them.  Thank you.\n\n",

These are localized, macular, dark hyperpigmentation at site of a previous inflammation. They occur at any age and are a reaction to trauma (physical or chemical injury), skin irritation, or dermatoses. They maybe associated with an inflammation of skin because of underlying injury or condition at the initial time of occurrence.  Call the doctor that examined you and tell him about your concerns. If he tells you he thinks you shouldn't worry about it then all that will be required is to keep an eye on them from time to time. From your description it does appear that they are harmless.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "title": "This just in: new mole discovered, pain & uncertainty re",
    "content": "Hi! I am 25 years old and have recently been having strange back, armpit and breast/nipple sensations/pains for the last two weeks (isolated to the upper left quadrant), and I am at a loss as to what it could be. My dilemma, as with too many Americans today, is that I am presently uninsured, being between graduation from college and professional school. So doc appts are a last resort right now. Of course, I have had more health problems during this short period than I have over the course of my whole life -- go figure.  Anyway, this is probably just me overreacting and not knowing nearly enough about body systems or disease processes, BUT.. I recently found a mole-like thing in the area of the back where pain is coming from. It is kinda big, not dark (that's why I haven't noticed it) and is scaly/flaky and irregular in shape, slightly raised but not appearing inflamed or very weird. I think that just about everyone's biggest fear is cancer, so of course I just keep going through the list... \"I hope I don't have breast cancer, etc.\" so now I'm on to skin cancer. And I want to rule it out, but I can't find enough info online to really do that. I don't think my symptoms, which include pains, burning sensations, hypersensitivity (esp of the nipple, skin of the breast, armpit) could really indicate the presence of a skin cancer, but I dunno.  BTW, no lumps can be found in the armpit or breast, but I did notice a dimply like indent on my side (not near the breast). have no clue about what that could be, but no bumps detectable near it.  So I am just wondering: would a cancerous mole/growth change appreciably before causing problems like these pains, like become more nodular or larger? It's only about the size of an eraserhead right now. Also, I had a CBC recently which was just fine -- would this mean anything in terms of diagnosing skin cancer or something of the like? I personally am leaning toward a mechanical/muscular problem (like from poor posture which I have plenty of and is getting worse by the day), but I just wanted to see if other worries could be ruledout.  Thanks to anyone who can field this :)\n\n",

It of course would be wise of you to have an evaluation to assure that there are no concerns. There are many low cost or free clinics offered in most areas that provide access to health care for individuals whom are uninsured/underinsured and are typically based on income. There are also a variety of cancer screenings (including skin cancer) offered at different times throughout the year. For example, Click here!

    "content": "Hello,  I'm a little concerned about a slightly raised brown spot I have on the left side of my penis. It's about the size of a capital letter, \"O\", if one was using size 14 font. It's, in fact, the only spot I have on my penis. I'm currently 33yrs old and it's been there about 11 years. I've asked 2 doctors on separate occasions about it and they both feel that it's an age spot. One of the doctors said it doesn't appear to be forming a root deeper into the tissue so it's probably nothing to worry about. It has stayed relatively oval-shaped, but appears to have been getting a bit larger within the past 6/8 months. It's never ulcerated nor has it ever itched. Now, sometimes it appears to crater and then heal itself, but its never had any pus or any of the like. If it's not cancerous, and it is just an age spot, can this be something that I can have surgically removed? Is it about time for another doctor visit regarding it?   Thanks so much for having a place where queries and concerns can be  answered.  Good day\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Outrider,  There is no replacement for direct clinical examination, But according to your description,  It could be a condition known as Fordyce spots .  Fordyce spots are not infectious and their cause is unknown. They are abnormally dilated blood vessels, covered by thickened skin. They can appear on the glans, shaft or scrotum. They may be solitary, but frequently appear in crops of 50 to 100. They are usually small (1-5mm) in size and may present as bright red or purple papules, painless and are not itchy.  Fordyce spots usually affect younger men. They may cause embarrassment because of their appearance, or a fear that they might be sexually transmitted. They may bleed if injured or even during intercourse.  Although a number of approaches have been tried, there is no simple, reliable treatment to remove them. Troublesome bleeding spots can be sealed with a device that uses a small electric current (electrocautery).  Only by complete history and physical examination, the correct diagnosis can be reached.   Hope you find this information useful.  Best regards,\n\n",

I also have a history of stage III cervical dysplasia (3 years ago).  I have had a solid, fixed mass just below my right mastoid process for at least a year.  It seems to have gotten bigger, however when mentioned to my pcp, he stated that it is probably nothing.  Should this be of concern?  I have felt a tingling-like pain in this area, as well as severe pain in my right ear (not infection related, but more of a sharp pressure pain) for over a year.  Also, when I put my finger in my right ear, I can feel something close to the opening, whereas I cannot on the left side.    The mass feels alot like bone, but this is not present on the left side.  I also had a neck x-ray done recently for neck pain, and it did not seem to show up on the films.    What should I look for in regards to lymph nodes, and should I be concerned about this mass?  Possibly get another opinion?    Thanks for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear tiggersprings,  It is probably a Lymph node as it occurs in a Lymph node region, however this must be confirmed by your physician.   Palpation is the first step to confirm the presence of a Lymph node enlargement.  Nodes are generally considered to be normal if they are up to 1 cm in diameter.   Abnormal Lymph node enlargement tends to commonly result from infection / immune response, cancer and less commonly due to infiltration of macrophages filled with metabolite deposits (eg, storage disorders).   Infected Lymph nodes tend to be firm, tender, enlarged and warm. Inflammation can spread to the overlying skin, causing it to appear reddened.   The postauricular Lymph nodes (if my guess is correct according to your description) are located behind the ears. They drain the external auditory meatus, pinna, scalp. Common causes of enlargement include local infection.   You did not mention where the excised melanoma was. If it is in the drained area of this lymph node, then it should be taken seriously for more investigations. In such cases the nodes are from firm to hard in consistency.  An increase in nodal size on serial examinations is significant. Hence nodes that continue to grow in size are important and those that regress in size tend to be more reassuring.   A Conventional US study with or without Doppler can help in confirmation of the nature of this swelling. CT scan also would confirm the presence of a Lymph node.   The personal and medical history as well as the clinical examination gives a good idea about the possibility of this node to be of malignant Origin. Further investigations include, US, CT scan and FNAC or biopsy.  Hope you find this information useful. Do not forget that, here is no replacement to a direct clinical examination. Only by complete history and physical examination, the correct diagnosis can be reached.   Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I am a 34 year old woman and have a small slightly red lump on my shoulder.  I have had the lump for a while, it is not painful and hasn't changed.  However, I was concerned about it and asked my general practioner to look at it during my annual physical a few months ago.  He said it was probably an Actinic Keratosis and gave me a topical cream.  So, I used the cream and it was successful in eating away a few layers of skin and making the area look worse, but I can still feel a lump.  My doctor doesn't seem concerned and said he doesn't think it has the characteristics of melanoma.  My question is, does a general practioner know enough to make that determination?  Should I still be concerned or should I get a second opinion?  I do have an appointment with a dermatologist for a full body exam, but he can't see me until September, I'm afraid if it's cancer I could be dead by then.  I'd just like your thoughts....Thanks.\n\n",

The dermatologist's PA-C stated the one on my back was large, very black and had a red \"halo\" around it as though it were inflamed or irritated.  She then immediately performed what I thought were \"SHAVE\" biopsies on both lesions and covered them with tiny, circular band-aids.  The one on my back was not entirely covered by the dressing.  I was left with circular depressions of raw areas that have now formed scabs.  I've since read that if malignant melanoma is suspected, shave biopsies should never be performed, but I can't find the reason why this is.  Could someone answer this for me?  My results came in today as both being \"BENIGN,\" and the fact that a shave biopsy was indeed performed, was confirmed.  Without my saying anything much, the tech went on to say, \"Amy's real good at shave biopsy's, she got the entire lesion, didn't she?\"  I didn't know how to respond to this.  Should I now be comfortable with a \"benign\" diagnosis even though I know shave biopsies were performed on suspicious, pigmented lesions?  Could someone please, pretty please, take the time to answer these two questions?  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Befallingdusk, Different types of biopsies can be done to diagnose  a suspected melanoma. The preferred one is excisional biopsy since the whole layers of the skin can be chesked to see the exact tumor thickness which is a very important prognosti factor for cutaneaous melanoma. In shave biopsy, the epidermis and the most superficial part of the dermis are shaved with a surgical blade. it is not generally recommended if a malignant melanoma is suspected. An exception is in the case of lentigo maligna in which the the risk of misdiagnosis is higher if deeper biopsies are taken, a broad, paper-thin shave biopsy is prefrred. An expert dermatologist can recognize lesions that are more likely to be malignant and would recommend excisional biopsy. Congratulations that the pathology results in bengin lesions. Good luck,\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 40 year old woman.  I had a lump under my skin on my lower back for some years now.  It grew really fast and then hasn't for a few years.  My doctor took it out today in his office, he didn't know what it was.  It was hard and white and about the size of a pencil eraser and kind of round.   I couldn't move it around under the skin.  He said he had to cut it out and then he scooped a little lower to make sure he had it all.  What are the chances that this is cancer?  It was never painful or red.  Just a lump.  It appeared to be dense white tissue.  What do you think it could be?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi birdy, most lumps and swellings are benign. Frequent causes of skin lumps of the back are sebaceous cysts, lipomas, skin cancer, abscess, and melanoma. Skin cancers, including melanoma, have different behaviour and appearance from the lump you described. An abscess is painful, and develops in a few days, and has distinct manifestations, others that the one you had.  Lipomas are the most common benign tumors of the body; they are growth of fatty tissue cells and can develop in almost any organ of the body, but most commonly in the subcutaneous layer (fat) just below the skin. They grow slowly and are nonpainful. Sometimes, depending upon where in the body and what surrounding tissue or organ the lipoma has affected, they may swell and grow until inflammation goes away.  Other common cause of lumps in that site are sebaceous cysts, also called epidermal or epidermoid cysts. Sebaceous cysts most often arise from swollen hair follicles and are usually found on the face, neck, and trunk (back). They are slow-growing, painless lumps beneath the skin. At times, they may become inflamed and tender.  There are other less frecuent causes of back lumps, and most are noncancerous. I believe it is a lipoma or other benign tumor. But as always, the pathologist has the last word. Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "My husband had a stage II malignant melanoma on his knee in 1986 and had it surgically removed.  He underwent a gallium scan and was told to do so every year to look out for reoccurance which he hasn't done since the first one.  He does get basal cells and squamous cell carcinomas regularly removed every year as he is very fair complected and is out in the sun minimally.  Is it possible that he is cured forever of melanoma?  I've heard that melanoma can come back inside the body even after many years of original removal from the skin.  Is this possible?  Any help would greatly be appreciated.  Concerned in NV\n\n",

Regardless of whether his risk factors are determined to be low, intermediate or high risk, just the fact alone that he has had melanoma in the past places him at risk for recurrence. If the advice of his physician was that he is to have yearly scans and follow-up evaluations then it would certainly be in his best interest to do as he was instructed. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "content": "I myself have just recently found some unusual moles on my back and I went in to have them looked at. My doctor said he didn't think they were anything but since I was a Nurse and we tend to \"watch things\" (as he put it) he removed most of both of them and sent them to be biopsied. Well they came back as Clarks dysplastic Nevi. This means that theyre not cancer but are more likely to become cancerous. He recommend me to a surgeon to get the rest removed just to err on the side of precaution. I would recommend the same thing to your Mom. Better safe then sorry. It doesn't sound like a Melanoma but more like maybe a Basal cell or a squamous cell carcinoma. Maybe it's neither and it's just an ugly mole but I would demand they remove it and have it biopsied. I know people don't like to do that with Doctor's sometimes, especially older people, but sometimes that's what you have to do. Sometimes you have to MAKE them ake care of you. What's it gonna hurt them to remove it and send it away. That's my advice anyway. Hope everything goes well and it turns out to be nothing.\n\n",

If your lesions go away after taking topical steroids then they are most probably allergic. If they don't go away then she may remove any more lesions that she suspects.

We are endeavoring to respond to all questions, including old ones.  As more of us are responding to questions, we hope to be able to respond to new questions in a timely manner.   Retreatment with interferon can be done, especially if it worked the first time it was tried.  Without knowing the specifics of your case, it is difficutl  to answer your questions with specifics.  Retreatment with interferon may not be as successful as the first time or may not last in its benefit as the first time.  The standard does to use is not 100% certain, although the literature would suggest that higher doses give better initial responses, but that the toxicity of higher doses can be difficult to tolerate.  The long-term benefit of high doses versus lower doses is not 100% clear.  Have you been evaluated for any type of vaccine study?  I don't know if your situation applies to such a study, but it would not be unreasonable to explore that option.  There may also be various clinical trials looking at experimental drugs that could be next options for you.  The larger hospital systems have such trials.  My best to you.  Jeffrey A.

    "content": "Dear sirs,           I am an Italian 32-year-old mechanical engineer and I am very happy to have found your website, where it is possible to receive professional and competent answers to medical problems about dermatology.       The answer I need does not involve any problem of health of me or any member of my family but it is of prime importance for my private life, therefore I hope that you would not regard my question as trivial.       During the past years, I have been involved in reading books about religion ( I am a Christian Catholic ) and specifically about miracles; these matter is now of  big importance for me and I am reading in my spare time everything I can find about the official miracles that the Church regards as \" scientifically non-explainable \" and as \" result of direct intervention of the supernatural powers \".       Specifically, I have been involved in reading everything I can find about Dr. Manuel Nevado Rey, orthopedic surgeon, who is said to have been miraculously cured  from chronic radiodermatitis in 1992 through the intercession of Josemar\u00eda Escriv\u00e1.      Thia fact has been later on the basis for the canonization of Escriv\u00e1 in 2002.       I admit that this fact has interested me tremendously: according to the Vatican, Mr. Nevado Rey in the beginning of the 90s suffered from \" advanced cronichal dermatitis \", an illness with \" no known cure \" that is always \" chronic and progressive, heading towards malignancy, never towards recovery \".      After having received a prayer card of blessed Josemar\u00eda Escriv\u00e1 de Balaguer, Dr. Rey\u00b4s illness \" began to improve and after approximately a fortnight, the damage caused by the disease disappeared and my [his] hands became perfectly healed \"      The complete review of the whole process can be found here.      Here is the link of the Vatican site on the argument:  Click here!  In case you do not have Internet access available, I can send you both of the pages.      Other information are available on the internet on the subject, even if I could not find all the photos about Mr. Nevado\u00b4s hands or other evidence about what happened.       Regarding all this, I would like to hear your opinion about if advanced chronic dermatitis really is an illness with no known cure.       What is stated in the site http://www.vatican.va and in the site http://www.josemariaescriva.info  is enough evidence to state if what happened to Dr. Nevado has to be considered as a miracle or not or further elements are needed ?       Moreover, I have read in some publications that cancer can, in some very rare case, get cured spontaneously (i.e. without surgery or pharmacological intervention \u2013 I think this is called \u201c spontaneous recovery \u201c); can this be the case of Dr. Nevado?       In the Vatican site is stated that \u201c to date, no case of a spontaneous cure from cancerous chronic radiodermatitis has ever been recorded in medical literature \u201c, is this true?       At last ( I hope I did not abuse of your patience ), where is possible to find more documentation and clinical evidence of any case of spontaneous recovery from cancer reported in the medical literature ?       I deeply thank you if you can provide me with some help about this subject and, again, I hope I am not abusing of your time.       I would welcome any suggestion or opinion from you about the subject as well.

I would suggest that you speak with a Dermatologist or a cancer specialist whom specializes in the skin.  regarding your question about spontaneous cures of cancer, that is something that doesnot tend to ccur in the vast majority of patients.  However, there have been reports ofver the years of such occuring.  Many cancer doctors have had a patient now and then with a cancer that has appeared to disappear with treatment.  For most of those patients, the cancer really is not gone, but only with a residual microscopic area that cannot be seen, only later to grow and to reappear.  However, sometimes a recurrence does not occur.  Perhaps there is something with the body's immune mechanisms that kicks into gear.  There is a lot about this topic that is not understood.

Melanomas can arise in areas other than the skin.  There is an interesting phenomenon seen in some cancers, including melanomas, in that the sites that have spread to other areas of the body can feedback and cause the original site not to grow and thus not be detected.  Also, there is a phenomenon seen in some cancers, including in melanoma,in  that the immune mechanisms of the body may be able to deal with the primary site of disease but are not able to deal with the sites that have spread.

So, I don't know exactly what I was searching for on the net last night, but I stumbled upon this page.  He freaked me out a bit. Mind you, he's NOT a doctor. He's a 'researcher' and philosopher. All his sources seem to be from the internet too.   He's basically saying everyone should say no to a biopsy because that actually spreads the cancer if what you have tested is indeed cancer. Does anyone believe this guy or know if this has any merit? Or is he just a guy who holds no credibility?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Fearful, I viewed the link to the web page and in my opinion I would put very little faith in one who has no medical backround not to mention that it is incorrectly posted information. Breast cancer and prostate cancer is the most commonly \"diagnosed\" cancer. However, the \"death rate\" from lung cancer exceeds both and kills more men and women. To discourage breast self exams is ridiculous, as this is sometimes the reason for many women being diagnosed at an earlier stage. Initially because of their different or abnormal findings. The reason different types of cancer are being diagnosed is because of better technology. As for discouraging any biopsy, types of cancer are identified, and the best treatment options for that particular type of cancer are initiated. As for the question \"about believing this guy\" I don't.  As for your other post about bacitracin. Bacitracin ointment is an antibiotic/bacteriocide that is absorbed in \"minimal\" amounts through normal skin (not large open areas from burns etc.) and causes no harm, unless of course one is allergic to the drug. The reason substances may be absorbed through the skin is because of its vascular nature. The only true overdose with the medication bacitracin (not the ointment based which by the way is never taken internally) is with the intramuscular or intraveneous form which use has been mostly replaced with such medications as  penicillins, cephalosporins, and vancomycin. I hope this was helpful. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "content": "To reply to your comment, I don't think there is much difference between home sunlamps and tanning beds. Any time there is more exposure to harmful effects of the sun's rays even if they are man made, the body has a negative reaction to it. I think that you should limit your amount of exposure to these lamps and make sure that you provide yourself with the necessary protection with sunscreen of spf of 15 or higher. You should also try washing your face with Phisoderm or another gentle soap. This helps with acne. And don't scrub your face hard. Wash gently because scrubbing will more than likely make your face break out further. You can also try using non-comedogenic make-up products. (They won't clog your pores.) How bad is your acne, and does stress cause it to flare up? I would avoid these sun lamps until they have been studied further. I worry about skin cancer with the use of these lamps and that is much worse than having acne that will change once your hormones decide to settle down. Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Fearuvhorses,  If you mean that there is a causal link between angina and malignant melanoma. i have not heard of one.  The most famous relation between malignant melanoma and heart disease is that malignant melanoma is notorius for sending metastases to the pericadium (membrane surrounding the heart).  So, if a patient has chest pain and history of malignant melanoma, i would suggest doing an echocardiogram to see whether there is any pericardial effusion (fluid) surrounding the heart which will be an indication of this possibility.  If this patient is known to have coronary disease, a new diagnosis of malignant melanoma could have put a stress on this patient and hence precipitating a new attack of angina.  The prognosis of malignant melanoma is actually determined by the depth in the skin to which it has grown not by the surgical margins and whether the tumour has metastasized to any where else.  If malignant melanoma has metastasized to distant organs, the prognosis is usually bad as most of malignant melanomas do not respond well to treatment whether chemotherapy or radiation.
