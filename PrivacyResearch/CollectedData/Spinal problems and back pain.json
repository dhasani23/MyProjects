If your arm feels numb and useless, this may be a sign of significant nerve injury or damage in the cervical spine.

    "title": "Treatment for pinched nerve caused by lumbar spinal stenosis",
    "content": "I have been diagnosed with a pinched sciatic nerve caused by lumbar spinal stenosis.  After x-rays were taken, I was diagnosed in 2003, and the pain was usually mild and sporadic... until recently.  For the past 2 months, I have had severe pain radiating from my right buttocks all the way down my leg (to my calf area).  The pain is the worst when I stand or walk for more than a few minutes.  The pain is so bad that I have found myself unable to do many of the things I should be able to do without even a second thought - such as grocery shopping or walking from my car to my office building.  I am desperate for relief.    I have seen 3 different regular doctors in the past 2 months.  I have been given Vicodin, Naproxen, Mobic, Flexerall, steroid dose packs - medrol, and had 2 steroid injections.  I have also started seeing a chiropractor (so far I have had 5 visits).  I also do exercises given to me by various doctors  - stretching/etc.    I feel like what I am doing is not working.  The pain should have decreased by now if not gone away completely.  What should my next step be?  I can not continue seeing doctors who just give me pain killers or chiropractors if it is not going to make any difference.  I have spent over $350 in the past two months in copays.  Any help would be appreciated.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Treatment for pinched nerve caused by lumbar spinal stenosis",
    "content": "Hello, Lumbar stenosis essentially is narrowing of either the central canal (where the spinal cord and its cords are located) or in the outer areas of the vertebrae (where the nerves leave the spine and supply muscle and other tissue with impulse - along with sending message to the brain from these tissues). So if one of these nerves are pinched, the goal is to open the narrowed area. Sometimes lumbar traction via physical therapy will work.  Other times, a surgeon opens the narrowed portion.  In other cases, the affected spinal segments are fused.  You may consider consulting a neuro surgeon to discuss more options to treat the stenosis.  They may recommend therapy or discuss surgery...will depend on the full picture of what your back is doing.  Take care.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: My spine fusion failed. Will my back deteriorate?",
    "content": "Hello, First, if the area is indeed infection, you will need treatment.  If the infection is in the bone, IV antibiotics are indicated.  Surgical debridement (cleaning up of infected tissue) is sometimes needed.    Second, if there is a floating piece of unattached bone in the spinal canal area, it is best to remove it... granted you are fit for surgery.  A floated piece of bone in or near joints can limit function.  In the spine, you should also be concerned about the nerves and spinal cord.   Infection and floating bones left unchecked can cause lasting pain, loss of motion and weakness not only in the low back but in the legs.  In particular, infection left unchecked can ruin bone tissue and more importantly seed in the circulatory system and cause severe illness.   Consult your physician for extensive details on all your treatment options along with risks and benefits.  Take care.\n\n",

There was scarring in both upper lobes of my lungs, but no active TB there, but the bacteria was found in 2 salivary glands, cervical lymph nodes, inguinal lymph nodes, my right ovary, and now they think my spine. I was getting a physical done (for nursing school) when the Dr noticed my spine was crooked. I have had other scoliosis screenings done in the past and all was found to be normal. Given my situation, they are thinking that the TB has started to cause curvature in my spine. They did a scoliosis series of xrays to determine the exact degree of curvature, etc... it isn't too extreme now, but my General practitioner thinks it may get worse over time. She referred me to an orthopedic surgeon for follow up. The problem is I don't have insurance. Most of the surgeon's i have contacted require a huge downpayment in order to even be seen by their practice in an initial visit. My question is: is it absolutely necessary for me to follow up? I am on treatment for the TB now ....so the damage is done right? Isn't a ortho surg. just going to tell me to keep an eye on it?? Or do you think surgery is a possibility. I just don't have any money and I can't decide how necessary it is for me to go to this Dr.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It sounds like two separate issues - one involving the lumbar spine or sciatic nerve and the other involving the wrist or carpal tunnel. It would be good to check with a physiatrist (one who specializes in physical medicine), he would be able to determine the specific cause of the leg and hand symptoms. Dropping objects with the hand lends itself to consider carpal tunnel syndrome - a common inflammatory and neurological problem of the median nerve in the wrist often the result of repetitive motion e.g. typing, line work in the factory. But cervical vertebrae problems can also cause the hand symptoms.   There is no direct connection between the lumbar spine and the hand so probably is two separate issues. (Diabetes or thyroid issues can cause some numbness or tingling sensations in the limbs so this should be screened).  Take care.\n\n",

    "title": "11 year old with Scoliosis",
    "content": "My girlfriend's 11 year old daughter was recently diagnosed with a moderately severe case of scoliosis. The doctor seemed to feel that is was early enough to attempt to treat it using a brace that she only has to wear overnight for a period of three years.  After having it fitted, she was told to return after two weeks to see how it's working out. On the appointed day they returned and the doctor shot another x-ray. In addition, the technician that actually fitted her for the brace remarked to the mother (right in front of the child) that in cases like hers, the overnight brace rarely works. This resulted in the little girl going to pieces over the prospect of having to wear the brace during the day. This part was of secondary importance.  My question is this: With a brace to be worn for three years, could the doctor realistically expect to see ANYTHING after two weeks? I'm not a doctor and don't profess to be, and perhaps it is standard procedure because there is something to look for. If there was nothing to be gained, then perhaps she should find another doctor?  Any help would be appreciated. This little girl (and her mom) and understandably very upset.  Thank you! Angelo\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Bracing and surgery are the only treatments shown to prevent progression of scoliosis.  Ideally, bracing when indicated should be done day and night.  Most current braces are of a low profile and comfort that allows for inconspicuous wear under clothing.    Bracing is considered when the curve exceeds 20 degrees.  Bracing between 20 and 30 degrees also depends on the bone maturity level (Risser grade).  Over 30 degrees bracing is done and in the extreme cases surgery.  For observation of curve stability, x-rays are done every 6 months.   For specific evaluation and treatment especially with curves of 30 degrees or more see a pediatric orthopedist.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Not really sure where to start! I'm a 23 year old female and I've just recently had an x-ray which found a lump on the right side of my neck.. on my spine. I had the x-ray (and some blood tests which were fine) because I was experiencing pain in my wrists.. sadly, I checked the blood tests but didn't get to check the x-rays because they weren't ready.. then my husband's grandmother passed away, so it was all forgotten for about a month. Then about three weeks ago I started feeling horrible pain in my whole arm.. I assumed it was because of the way I'd slept on it but it continued and kept getting worse. The whole arm ached and there was sharp pain in my palm, fingers and elbow. So, I returned to the doctors and was then told there was actually something wrong with my x-ray and I'd have known had I checked it. I was told they don't call you even if something's wrong.. great. (My fault, anyway..) The doctor pretty much told me there was a lump on my spine and that they were sending me to see a specialist right away and that I would get a letter with the date.. then ended the appointment. Just as I was leaving she suggested painkillers as I can't even sleep at night, anymore.. so, I'm now on co codamol but sadly it only helps part of the time (I take two at a time three times a day). I also take ibuprofen in between. Yet I'm still experiencing pain and find it hard to get comfortable.. and work has just become a complete nightmare!  So, I have no idea what's going on.. and the pain is getting worse. My back now gets shooting pain as does my neck and I've started getting really bad headaches. It's only been 4 days (I went on Wednesday) but it feels like forever..  Really all I'm curious about is what it could be? I hate not knowing. I'm not sure if anyone can help or not but figured it wouldn't hurt to try. Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello  Approx. 3-4 years ago, I visited a chiropractor who upon examining me and taking an x-ray, told me that I had an 87% loss of curve in my neck (I always knew I did, I just didn't know how bad). Over the years, my loss of curve seems to be getting worse and I have developed TMJ and an under bite, as well as my upper and lower jaw being unaligned.  I don't remember having tmj or an under bite until my neck started to lose its curve. Can tmj and an under bite be caused by a cervical loss of curve?   Also, I can't afford to see a chiropractor for the extent of time that it takes to correct the loss of curve. It is simply too expensive for me and I don't have insurance. I have been looking at some different cervical traction devices. Will any of these really work in returning the normal curve to my neck? I did buy a posture pump at one point but it was much too uncomfortable for me to lay on the ground for 30 minutes while using the thing.  Can someone please recommend something that is known to work and isn't as uncomfortable as the posture pump?  Thanks for reading my long post, I really appreciate any help I can get.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Loss of curve in neck and tmj",
    "content": "Hello, It is important to look at the cause for the loss of curvature in the cervical spine: e.g. muscle spasms, chronic poor posture, degenerative changes in the vertebrae itself.  In any case, the basic day to day treatment will be maintaining or restoring normal functional movements in the neck and correcting abnormal posture especially in chronic or static positions.  So, performing active range of motion exercises and stretching tight muscles and strengthening weak muscles around the neck area are important. Posturally, to restore lordosis (the normal curve of the cervical spine), simply using a towel roll inside a pillow case should help - may start with a few minutes supine then progress the time to wear sleeping with the pillow roll is comfortable.  For more specific assessment and instruction see a physical therapist - even for 1-2 visits to teach a home program.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "I was in a high impact car accident in 2004. I was stopped on the freeway in morning rush hour traffic when a person rear-ended me. They believe he was traveling at 55 mph at the time of impact. I have had MRI's, X-Rays, Chiropractic care, Nerve conduction tests, trigger point injections, physical therapy, massage therapy, acupuncture and nothing has helped the pain in my neck or base of the skull where it connects to my neck and nothing shows up on the tests either. I now have severe chronic pain on both sides of my neck, across the base of my skull, along my shoulders and mid back. I also suffer from migraines 2-3 times a week. I have three hard bumps on the back of my neck in different areas. I am trying to determine what the cause of the bumps are and what might be able to be done about them. The bumps are hard and not sensitive to touch or pressure. When my neck pain gets worse it usually triggers a migraine and the bumps become larger at times but also smaller on days when the pain is decreased. One bump is located on the left side of my neck right on at the hairline and is about the size of a dime and sphere shaped, one is located under the bottom of my skull on the right side of my neck and is about the same size and shape. The last one is located about three figures behind my ear directly bellow the skull line it is about twice the size of the other two but about the same shape. They are all very hard and when I apply a lot of pressure to them, it helps to relieve some of the pain. I also become nauseous when the pain is worse. I have been told all my muscles in the upper part of my body are extremely tight. I have been trying to figure out what might be the cause and if it is related to my pain or migraines. I am in constant pain and have been to over 10 specialists trying to determine what the cause of my pain might be and a solution. So far no one has been able to help decrease the pain. Any ideas would be very helpful or even suggestions on the type of specialist I could consult would be wonderful. I really need some input and advice! Thank you so much for your time!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, To best view a cervical fracture both old or new, I would suggest a CT scan of the neck. Regarding imbalance: yes narrowing (stenosis) of the central spinal canal in the neck can cause imbalance - stenosis if present will show up on CT scan. Other consideration for imbalance include inner ear syndromes: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), Meniere's disease and vestibular neuronitis.  Central nervous system problems (e.g. stroke or tumor) can cause imbalance but generally cause other neurological signs.   For a full evaluation especially to diagnose properly the imbalance cause, see a physician...but a CT scan of the cervical spine (and perhaps the head) is due considering history of a work accident.

    "title": "Re: Lower back/spine problem.  MRI results.",
    "content": "Hello, Essentially the MRI says that the two discs are L4 through S1 are bulging with some of the L4/L5 disc material just outside the dural sac.  The dural sac encases the spinal cord from the upper cervical region down to about L2 (Lumbar vertebra #2) level.  At the L4 level, the sac houses the nerve roots (but not the spinal cord) which eventually exit the bony vertebrae (at the foramina aka holes) and into the pelvis and lower extremities.  If you have neurological symptoms: leg numbness, tingling or pins and needles; leg weakness; decreased tendon reflexes then you will need to see a neurosurgeon as the bulging discs hitting the sac may be causing the symptoms.   Watch out for cauda equina syndrome - a rare but serious condition where the contents of the dural sac are compromised and causes significant leg weakness; numbness in the area of the groin and skin between the anus and scrotum - essentially the area that would touch a saddle when riding a horse and inability to urinate.  If these occur, see a doctor asap - a neurological emergency.  Otherwise for treatment, consult a physical therapist. They will evaluate your current status and predict your prospects of continuing sports.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Some testing of the cervical spine and the neural tissue would be in order.  This would include: cervical x-ray clinical testing: deep tendon reflexes (DTR), muscle strength testing in the upper extremities (myotomes), and sensory checks in the upper limbs (dermatomes). Also, do some specific neck range of motion and compression/distraction testing...palpating and inspecting the muscles and cervical motion too.  All in all a thorough assessment of the neck and upper limbs is in order to accurately assess the cause of the problem. This can be done by a physician or a physical therapist.  Without neurological symptoms, the condition would likely be classified in the mechanical neck pain category and treated conservatively with NSAIDS, hot/cold packs and theraputic exercise.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello I was working out about a month and a half ago and my lower back started to accutely hurt. I'd had this happen a couple of times before as well, twice before in the last 3 years I'd say and have had physio treatments each time because of it. I went to the doctor and he got me some blood work done and said that he ruled out Lupus and Ankylosing Spondylitis. However that my ESR rate was slightly high (13mm/hr) and CRP was normal (5mg/L). My X-Rays came out okay, he said that there was a minor curve in my lower spine that could explain the pain I'd been having on and off the last few years but he thought that it was very minor and likely there since birth. My SI joint showed minor useage (wear and tear). He put me on Naproxen and told me to take it for a month once a day and get another blood test to see how I was doing.  It's been about a month and a half and the pain is much better. I've been doing back stretches/exercises everyday as instructed by my physiotherapist and have been going in for weekly sessions. I'm still not 100% however I'm able to do things much better than before. However my blood tests state that my ESR is a bit higher (16mm/hr) and now my CRP is a bit high as well (14mg/L).  He's referring me to a specialist to see, however that could take weeks/months to get a chance to see him, I'm wondering what this could be, as my levels don't seem extremely high however they are moderately high and as I said my pain is BETTER than before, however still there somewhat.  Please advise, thank-you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The sed rate and CRP (C-reactive protein) are called acute phase reactants.  They increase in the blood stream in response to inflammation.  So the concern when these general and non specific markers increase for a prolonged period of time is that a disease process is causing the signs and symptoms - e.g. in your case - lingering back pain.  With a negative screen for connective tissue or autoimmune disorders e.g. Lupus - there is less expectation of underlying disease.  Again, it appears the physician is making sure with the elevated acute phase reactants are not caused by an underlying disease process.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "A few days ago my wife was hit by a car as she walking through a parking garage and as a result of the accident was diagnosed with a mild to moderate fracture of T-11. She has been told that she will be fine after approximately 6 weeks but everything I have been reading suggest that it could be closer to 12 weeks or longer.   Since the injury she is complaining that her right side is very painful to touch and she gets and excruciating pain if she accidently bumps it which radiates the pain everywhere on her side. She keeps telling me that it feels like something is poking her in her side under her skin.   She is 44 years old and in pretty good overall health. Can anyone tell me how long she is looking at having to wear the brace, how long it takes for that type of fracture to heal, and have any ideas what the pain in her side may be.   Any help would be greatly appreciated I am just trying to make her as comfortable as possible.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Fractures generally take 6 weeks to heal...healing time depends on the location and the characteristics of the fracture. For a T11 fracture which I assume is not displaced nor causing neurological compromise (i.e. hitting a nerve or spinal cord), at least 6 weeks seems a reasonable time frame for healing.  The ribs will need to be assessed too with x-rays for fracture or dislocation.  Frequently the intermuscular area of the ribs get strain or pulled during mid back trauma.  Treatment is conservative with analgesics and hot / cold packs.  It is also important for her to practice deep breathing exercises as pain can cause decreased lung capacity.  Take care.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Back and Shoulder Pain due to Breasts",
    "content": "Hi, Because a majority of breast reductions are often done for improving appearance rather than for health-related reasons, it is not normally available on the National Health Service (NHS), which is the publicly funded healthcare system in the United Kingdom.  Unlike the procedure of breast enlargement (augmentation) surgery (which is considered strictly as a cosmetic procedure), breast reduction surgery is offered through the NHS due to the fact that overly large breasts are capable of causing morbidity(physical and psychological distress).   For one to qualify for breast reduction surgery through the NHS, the following criteria must be met. - first, one must be referred by their GP to a specialist plastic surgeon,  - have a consultation with the plastic surgeon and  - be assessed by a psychiatrist or psychologist.  The final decision is usually reached at a meeting by a panel run by your primary care trust (PCT). The panel will take into account the overall information from your assessments and review your individual case.  If the panel concludes that your physical or psychological well-being is being directly affected by the size of your breasts and that there is enough social, physical or psychological benefit to justify surgery, only then, they will clear your case to go ahead with the reduction mammoplasty through the NHS.  If you are convinced that your symptoms are mainly, or only due to the size of your breasts, and that you need reduction mammoplasty through the NHS,then please contact your local GP as the first step.  PS:  I am not aware of any changes that might of occurred to this protocol of late, but in any case, your GP will be able to clarify. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "I\u2019m in horrible pain. It started months ago in the middle of my shoulder blades, with the sensation that I can\u2019t crack my back. And then cramping of my muscles in my neck, shoulders, and back became constant and painful. Then I somehow damaged my neck, not sure how. The feeling was like sleeping on my neck incorrectly and the resulting pain in the morning. However it was way more intense than that feeling has ever been for me before and it happened suddenly, while I was reading in bed, not from a position kept all night. I\u2019d practiced yoga that day but felt fine afterwards and can think of no explanation for this. While the intensity of that neck pain as faded it has never completely left, I\u2019m growing used to the mild discomfort. But now I\u2019m experiencing pain in my left foot. It\u2019s in the heel somewhere and seems to differ from side to side on my foot. I can\u2019t quite pinpoint what hurts. And I\u2019m having sever muscle cramps in the back of my left thigh that are increasingly painful. I\u2019m also cramping in both calves and right foot arch. I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going on but I suspect that it is all interrelated. Right now I need to get my foot to stop hurting so I can walk properly.  Probably unrelated but I also have issues with my arm, it is the soft area directly above my elbow. Frequently just placing my elbow on a table will cause this \"shocking\" sensation that is very uncomfortable. I also have found that while preforming certain activities, most notably chopping food for meals, I will have the oddest sensation of-- it is hard to describe. It is the same feeling but is running up and down my forearm, like the nerves or tendons maybe. I don't know what it could be. I liken it to an electric shock but that doesn't perfectly describe it. This is most likely a problem for a different forum but if I'm wrong and it is related, I share it here now.  I'd also like to mention that I am 5'1\" tall and weigh 170 lbs. I\u2019m a 27 year old woman, and over weight.\n\n",

First, cramping in the neck, shoulders and back and...cramping in the calves and right foot... these symptoms in a 27 y.o. may simply be relieved with increased hydration and some physical exercise.  However, if it has been some time since your last doctor's visit, you ought to see him.  With a history of heavy drinking and on going multi body part symptoms, some blood work (comprehensive metabolic panel, thyroid hormones, and complete blood count...perhaps iron studies) would be indicated.   The elbow and forearm symptoms may be due to ulnar nerve irritation, lateral or medial epicondylitis or local inflammation of tendons or ligaments.  Treatment with ice, NSAIDS and gentle exercise would be indicated.  Occasionally, a corticosteroid injection into inflamed tendon insertion site relieves symptoms.  In any case, see a physician for accurate diagnosis and management.  Take care.\n\n",

    "title": "long term back discomfort",
    "content": "Hi, For about a year, I experienced back discomforts. I do wrestling (team) and basketball, but I haven't had any severe injuries to the back. However, when I stand for a period of time/sit for a period of time, my lower back just dies. I feel a mixture of weak/tired lower back muscles, and uncomfortable bones (spinal cord).Even though I had an x-ray, and they said nothing was wrong, i still feel it.   To mitigate this pain, I have to stretch my back out. I do this by hanging on a bar. This relaxes my muscles a bit, and here, my spinal cord bones all crack and pop around (like cracking a knuckle) Especially when I try moving my back around while hanging on a bar. This does help mitigate the pain a bit after a long period of stress and discomfort, but hanging on the bar doesn't take everything away. The hanging on bar part is uncomfortable itself, because it seems like my back bones never are stretched enough and there's always potential for more popping, even if there are no pops.  Sorry for this mess, I just wanted to know what I can do, cause it's really bothering me.  thanks\n\n",

    "title": "Re: long term back discomfort",
    "content": "Hello, Thanks for writing in.  You have reported one year of back pain which worsens after prolonged standing or sitting and improves somewhat with stretching.  Hanging from a bar makes back pop and crack, a bit uncomfortable, but provides some relief (this activity provides traction on the spine relieving compressive forces on the discs and small joints in the back plus elongating muscles and fibrous tendons).  Activity includes wrestling and basketball.  Xrays are normal.  From your history, I assume no radiating leg pain, no leg or foot pins/needles or numbness.    I would classify this as mechanical low back pain.  I would also consider seeing an experienced orthopedic physical therapist who will evaluate the back and prescribe specific exercises.    Your sporting activity may also contribute to the back problem.  Wrestling is an aggressive sport which places high demands for flexibility and strength on all the limbs, shoulders, hips, and spine.  A weak or injured area will suffer more if not rehabilitated properly.    Basketball places strain on the spine during jumping and landing.  Lots of big men have suffered debilitating back pain as a result e.g. Larry Bird and Charles Barkley.  For sport participation, it will be important to first: rehab the back, second: condition the back to return to sport, third: maintain a healthy back during sports.   The first two phases should be taught by a professional trainer or therapist and the third part on your own.   If your rehab goes poorly or if the back pain worsens, you may consider an MRI which will show soft tissue structures (nerves and discs) and the spaces they do and do not normally occupy.  All the best to you.  Keep us posted and take care.\n\n",

    "content": "This is extrememly late, but I am new to the site. I am an 18 year old female with scoliosis (thoracic curve is 62 degrees and lumbar curve is around 20-30 degrees) I was diagnosed around the age of 14 and have had  very bad back pain for as long as i can remember, however, as I have had it for so long i have managed to live with it (however the curve is progressing and getting more painful each day). I do not take any pain relief as i don't want to have to rely on it. Instead i see an osteopath which really helps, but only for a few days, but it has reduced the progression of the curve, in short; through manipulation of the muscles pulling my spine downwards and twisting it, releasing the tension of these muscles which therefore helps.  HOWEVER, since seeing a surgeon a few months ago (for the 3rd time- consultations mri's, xrays etc) he has advised me to research into surgery to make a decision as to whether have the surgery or not. I am really scared of paralysis (risk is 1 in 1000 which i think is pretty high, albeit apparently that is low), and also the fact that i will be out of action for 3 months, bored, frustrated and in pain (and pretty strapped for cash as i won't be able to work lol!)  I was wondering if you have had any problems post surgery, such as pain, unsuccessful fusion, any really. The surgeon told me that there is no garuntee that after the surgery (after fully recovering 1+ year onwards) i will not have back pain...This worries me as I would only be having the surgery to relieve the serious pain i am in 24/7, not for the cosmetic side. I am an active person (qualified fitness instructor), and I would just be so worried that my dream of working and managing a gym/fitness environment could be ruined if something goes wrong during surgery or that i won't be able to perform at the same level as i can now.  Anything, literally anything relating to this information would be GREATLY appreciated, I think it's wonderful that you're offering your experiences to help others.  Thankyou!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Inversion tables are generally safe for low back conditions including bulging discs.  The principle is that the weight of the body provides traction and relieves pressure on nerves and discs.    After one time trial, you will be able to make sure the positioning doesn't worsen your back symptoms - I would expect some relief rather than exacerbation.  Take care.\n\n",

Observation is the treatment at this point and remeasure in 12 months - depending on you and your physician's comfort level.  A lot of skeletal growth will occur over the next few years so remeasuring will be needed.    You may check with your local physical therapist for an exercise program.  Bracing is not needed at this time.   Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, You have some positive findings on cervical MRI.   These structural changes will not change but you may help progression with excellent health including good posture.   Since the spinal cord signal is normal and you have reported no neurological symptoms (arm numbness or tingling, arm or neck pain and poor upper extremity strenght) then there is less concern for fixing the structural changes and you can resume activity as tolerated.   Best cases scenario is that you attain and maintain excellent overall health and the neck discomfort decreases and no further problems.  No surgery.  No rehab.  No medicine.   Worse case scenario is that the central spur worsens or the disc protrusions worsen , deform and compress the nerves so that neurological symptoms develop...and require surgery.   Good bone health requires well balanced meals, regular exercise and fair amount of sunshine.   Take care.\n\n",

Epididymytis, prostatitis, or any inflammation of the male genital tract, may cause a number of symptoms, back pain, testicular pain, difficulty voiding, just to name a few. I would suggest another evaluation, not to mention some diagnostic studies, to rule out a chronic infection or any other anomaly. If it's actually related to a back injury this can be identified by, for example, by a MRI. Regardless of the problem, you need re-evaluated.  Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

The next day it increased and then I started having pain in my left testical.    The day after thanksgiving I had to go to the emergency room.  After a shot of morphine and a shot of valium, I was still in pain.  They first said it might be a hernia and they ordered an ultrasound of my testicals.  Nothing showed up.  They recommened I get an MRI.  I did and nothing showed up that would cause the pain.  I went to the doctor who said it might be epidymitis.  He put me some some meds, but it continued.  Next test, I had a spiral CT, which came back as normal. Next, they said it might be a kidney stone.  I did the dye test and had x-rays.  Came back normal.  Finally I was sent to a neurosurgeon and he said he could not find anything wrong with me in all the tests that I had done.  He was clueless and sent me to theraphy.  Before I went, I visited my chiropractor.  The next day after the adjustment, I was 50% better and the next day I was back to 90% of my normal health.  I explained this to the therapist and he said he was probbaly my sciatic nerve.   I only had a little soreness if I didn't exercise of stretch.  Well, a year to date, I am suffering again.  I have very little testicle pain in the same testical, but my back is killing me.  I am seeing the chiro 2 times a week, but still hurting.  So here I am trying to find out something else.  Feel free to email me if you want to discuss further.\n\n",

Mine is down low - on the lower lumbar region, but is NOT centrally located. Its starting point is actually just to the left of my spine, 1 - 1.5 inches or so. The pain starts there and shoots directly to my left testicle as well. Other ways the pain manifests its self is that it radiates out, flat, across the groin region. It feels somewhat similar to having my testicles lightly compressed; like my shorts are too tight and riding up. Does this fit your scenario as well? You can contact me here or at - AZQIII@HOTMAIL.COM. My initial diagnosis (after x-rays & MRIs showed no problem with the physical structure) was a 'muscle spasm'. Acupuncture helped immensely I must say, but it has recently returned. I suspect there is a nerve in there that is the culprit. Hey, I'm open for any suggestions. Thanks everyone!\n\n",

This procedure is estimated to take about 20 times for completion; however after the first time, the pain in my testacle was reduced from a painful squeeze, to a uncomfortable pull.  Things have only gotten better.  5 visits done, and the pain is now localized in my lower center back (a good thing).  What I appreciated about this chiropractor is that he told me after this process, if results were not were I wanted them to be, he would find me a pain management doctor and a surgical consult, odd from a chiropractor but reassuring.  Good luck to each of you, I know how miserable you are.\n\n",

First mri's results came back normal, however, just recently another MRI was conducted (18mths later) my L5/S1 had a moderate central and left paramedian focal disc extrusion.  It measured 25mm transverse x 8mm AP x 10mm crainicaudad. It's encroaching upon displacing the left S1 nerve root posterior and laterally to the left.  This was just given to me last week and I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO CLUE what it means!!  I was told spinal decompression was not an option - surgery was my only fix.  Is that true?? and why?  Can someone tell me what the MRI results show?  Keep in mind my pains existing many years before the findings, so I suggest to keep testing until they find something.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Basically, you have a bulging disc hitting a nerve.  Unless you are having major symptoms (leg numbness, tingling, weakness, and pain), you may consider trying conservative treatment like physical therapy first.   If you have inability to pee, numbness in pelvic area (\"saddle paresthesia\") and unilateral leg weakness as a result of the pinched nerve then surgery is the first option.  Sometimes an EMG or Nerve conduction velocity test is done to judge the extent of nerve involvement.  Incidentally, spinal decompression is spinal surgery.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "After 2 years with the same pain, \"travelling\" one, that was thought by doctors to be some neuropathy, they said that my only option was surgery, even though the MRI didn't show anything out of extraordinary.  I went to a n acunpunturist, didn't help much, for 5 months, I did more than 1 year of physiotherapy, and the pain would relieve and come back again. Sciatica, lower back, testicular swelling, middle back pain, muscle spasm. Had it all, and sometimes would not even be able to get out of bed. After searching the internet about 'cures', I found out about TMS (Tension Myositis Syndrome). Then read about Mind Body Syndrome. After reading Sarno's book, I was cured... simple as that, just a couple of weeks 'reprogramming' my consciouness. I couldn't believe it was so simple, and Sarno does say so in his book. TMS will act exact like that, everything, all exams and testings will come 'clear', but will still have the pain. After ruling out the REASON that is causing the pain, and realizing that the pain is, afterall, a mild oxygen deprivation to the muscle caused by the brain, you will understand that is more a social thing than a physical thing. Just read the success histories at TMS Help forum, you will be amazed. People that have been 13 years in pain, cured, and as fast as 2~3 weeks\n\n",

The main area of pain is the lower back, buttocks, testicles and top of legs.  I visited the doctor who put me on painkillers to see if the problems went away. After 2 weeks and the back pain was still present the doctor tried other medicines and sent me for an x-ray and ultrasound of the bladder/kidneys. results came back okay.  I've had an MRI scan which shows that I have bulges in my lower back. I was put on Tramadol and sent for hydro and physiotherapy. Nothing helped. I was sent to a back specialist who checked me out and was sent to a pain specialist. Got no help there!   I've visted the doctor every 3 weeks in the past 15 months. I've had problems urinating and visited a urologist for a cystocopy. This was fine. I've had my prostate checked, slightly swollen but nothing to worry about apparently! I had an ultrasound on my testicles which found that I had too much calcium?   Anyway afterall this I'm still in alot of pain. I've been taken off the tramadol and I'm on morphine patches. They don't help!! The pain I get in both testicles (more pain in right usually) is unbearable! I actually have to grit my teeth and usually end up screaming!! I've not had sex since the back pain started because it is too painful and the pain in the testicles can increase when I have an erection! I'm finding it really difficult to motivate myself now. I was off sick from work for seven months and now work a quarter of my hours each week to try and stay active. I'm 24 years old and have had no other medical problems previously. I have no social life anymore and find that on most days I can hardly move!!   Any suggestions or help would be greatly appriciated. Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "I've had back pain for 4 years now, am almost 30 and have had surgery to L5S1.  This has been a long journey but with two years of physio, exercise and medication it's getting \"better\".  The key for me is getting over the hump and exercise with lots of walking, stay mobile or you'll seize up. If I take more than a couple days off not walking my pain increases significantly.  Back in the summer I tweaked my back again and went to the emerg because pain was on the right side (lower lumbar shooting down to foot).  This was cause for concern as my pain has always been on the left 99% of the time.  As this pain was new, it felt extra sore and I was getting a tingly, shooting down my right butt cheek, wrapping under the right leg and up into the groin where my testicle felt extra sensitive.  After a month, this tingling went away but now has come back in the last week.  I got it checked out by my doctor, checking for lumps as well and found one spot where it was particularly sore, but was soft tissue.  Anyway, she said that there is a causal link between back pain and pain in the groin but this is very painful...like getting kicked in that area but 15 minutes after the fact, nauseous, throbbing pain.  I'm going in for an ultrasound to check everything out just to be sure.\n\n",

I have a list of medical problems that include RA, Fibro, RLS, Pernicious Anemia, Scurvy, Facet Joint Syndrome.... But I recently have injured my back and it's KILLING ME! Here's the story - My 18 mo. old daughter came up behind while I was bending down and hit me in the back (towards my left side.) I swear, it feels like I have a broken rib! There is no bruising. And my doctor truely thinks I am nuts! I went to see him 3 days ago, which was 2 days after the injury. I was in pain (And I take 40mg of Percocet a day.) And it still hurts just as bad today. Hurts when I cough, sneeze, laugh, breathe, etc. I am having trouble sleeping because it hurts so bad. And due to my Facet Joint Syndrome, I can't lay on my stomach. I tell ya, I'm a medical mess.  - My doctor looked at the area and pushed around it (OUCH!) And he just said that it was my muscles from the Fibro and that my daughter couldn't possibly damage my ribs. (I had to take her to the doc with me when her grandma canceled at the last minute. And he's looking at this sweet little toddler and thinking this woman is crazy!) But toward the end of our visit she was getting restless and ready to open every drawer and she even tried to untie his shoes. Putting a baby in an 8X8 room with lots of shiny new things everywhere with a mom that can't bend or get out of the chair very quick to stop her is a bad idea!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I been on Tramadol for about 2 years (Also were on Celebrex and Lyrica), seen 5 Orthopedic doctors, had 3 MRIs, 2 epidural injections, and one that I don't know the name but it is similar to the epidural.  All three MRIs show that I have 2 herniated disks, very bad looking. I have numbness, acute/cronic pain, tingling on both testicles, the pain feels to come from the Epididymis. The herniated disks are on the L5-L4, and L4-L3 disks. I do not have pain or muscle weakness (that I noticed) on my legs, it only goes to the testicles/groin area.  I just started researching on my own, and just found that I pretty much have all the symptoms for \"Cauda Equina Syndrome\", except Bowel and bladder disturbances.  I would like to ask if any one here thinks that there is a great possibility that I might have it. Pain medication does not do much for me, but it helps. Pain sometimes can be so strong that I'm immobilized until it passes, both on my lower back and testicles. Also if needed I do have the images for the first and last MRI. The first one is about 2 years old, and the last one was taken on Friday (Nov 6, 09)  Thank you so much for your help. I'm very worry as this would mean emergency surgery.  I will talk to my doctor on Monday, hopefully if I'm able to. This is just to have another opinion.\n\n",

If this is the case and physical therapy (PT) helped, I would suggest continuing PT. I am not clear why you were taken out of PT but again can only assume that it was due to insurance reasons. If you have no neurological symptoms: leg numbness and tingling, leg weakness, or loss of sensation in either leg then not only continuing PT but adding a walking program is best.   As a matter of last resort, you may consult with the neuro surgeon to consider back surgery: e.g. discectomy (partial removal of the disc) or decompression/laminectomy (relieves pressure from a pinched nerve).  Yes, the back could have been further injured (depending on your activity level) but would need another MRI to confirm plus checking some clinical tests for neurological symptoms.  Take care.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Grade 2 anterio-listheseis of L5 over S1",
    "content": "Hi, 'Listhesis' means to slip or slide. \"Spondylolisthesis' refers to sliding of one vertebra over the one beow it. This could be forwards (anterolisthesis) or backwarda (retrolisthesis).  One well known way of classifying this condition is as - congenital (dysplastic),  - spondylolytic (isthmic), - degenerative,  - traumatic, pathologic, or  - iatrogenic (ex, postoperative).  In Isthmic Spondylolisthesis: usually the  L5 slides over SI vertebral segments and present with  L5 nerve root compression or tethering the L5 nerve root by anchoring it to the anteriorly displaced vertebra (traction).  Degenerative spondylolisthesis usually occurs between the L4 and L5 vertebral segments (L4 slides in relation to L5).  Most patients with spondylolisthesis are asymptomatic.   Symptomatic individuals usually present with low back pain, and this is usually attributed to isthmic or facet pseudoarthrosis or disc disintegration. Rarely, patients will also have radicular symptoms due to involvement of the spinal nerve roots 9pressure or traction).   Neurological signs are unusual, and are generally limited to sensory changes in L5 dermatomal distribution. Severe anterolisthesis can stretch the entire cauda equina over the border of the lower vertebral body and can result in neurogenic claudication, perineal pain, perineal  numbness, or bladder or bowel  dysfunction. Any neurological deficit  necessitates further evaluation to exclude other more serious pathologic processes.  In general, management of patients with this condition depends on a good number of factors such as...  - age of the patient, - the symptoms,  - neurologic examination,  - bone quality,  - stable or unstable anterolisthesis  - co-morbid conditions & overall health.  Usually most orthopedic experts recommend a non-operative management to begin with.Customized exercise and pain management programs  to help the patients to get back to as normal as possible  pain-free life. These programs generally (2-3 times/week ) last for approximately 1-2 months based on individual response. These consist of electrical stimulation,ultrasound, or modalities such as massage, heat, manual therapy, ice, and graduated core stabilization and strengthening exercises to recondition the back and abdominal  muscles.   Re-aligning the spine by postural training, ergonomic changes to decrease straining at work, injury prevention, back safety education on proper lifting and repetitive motion, support braces as needed, breathing/relaxation techniques to reduce pain & muscle tension and, and lifestyle modifications are other strategies often employed.  Operative management may be needed in some of the following situations - If a trial of non-operative management fails, - if dynamic radiological assessment shows excessive abnormal mobility of the involved verteba (during flexion and extension),or - if there is progressive neurological deficit.  In your case i do not know if the services of a physiotherapist have been sought so far (recommended by most).Whether you need surgery or not depends on the above mentioned factors. Your orthopedic surgeon perhaps is the best person to guide you.  Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "I had a hard fall onto a tile floor 1 yr ago landing directly onto my right hip. FYI I am an active ( or was)  64 yr old.  Now one year later I have developed a limp ( my husband describes it like Grandpa Amos of the Real McCoys).  If I take pressure off my right leg (ie when I use the grocery cart in a store as a \"walker) I can walk with less pain.  Pain is primarily sacral, mid buttock and a tad anterior (groin area).  It is constant and will at times prevent sleep a/o wake me from sleep as well.  It does not cause me discomfort to sit upright in a hard backed chair  but I am extremely limited on rising to standing and begining my stride to walk.  Pain eases a bit with walking but never goes away.  I have full back flexibility ( front bend to floor). Lateral hip raise causes some pain (sacral and hip joint). Lying down the position of comfort is external rotation of the hip with slight bend of the knee.  Pain has progressively worsened over this last year.  I get relief from Ibuprofin and hot water bottle application.  I rarely medicate, endure the pain...thus the limp gets worse.  I'd appreciate your advice on direction for me\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Limp,hip & sacral pain",
    "content": "Hi, The one possibility that first comes to my mind is a 'missed'/old 'impacted fracture' of the neck of your right femur.  A fracture may be considered 'impacted' when the broken ends do not displace during movement.  This type of fracture (also known as Type 2 fracture of the femoral neck), can occur in following minor falls generally in older individuals (osteoporosis is a risk factor).  Whereas most people with a displaced hip fractures cannot walk or stand, many with impacted fractures may be able to stand up or even walk.  Impacted femoral neck fracures have been considered generally to be simple to treat and complicated rarely by non-union or avascular necrosis.  The optimal method of treatment of 'fresh' impacted fractures of the femoral neck is still debated.   Proponents of conservative treatment point out that because most of these will unite under proper supervision without internal fixation & the hazards involved in operation (disimpaction,displacement & avascular necrosis of the femoral head) and the displacement that occurs in only a small proportion of cases.  Others are of the opinion that because impacted fractures often displace spontaneously in the recumbent position or on early weight-bearing, and also because it is impossible to predict which of  the fractures will do so, an internal fixation is warrented.  As it is more than a year since your trauma, your pain may be due to  - avascular necrosis of the femoral head or - secondary osteoarthritis of the hip joint.  You need to consult your orthopedic surgeon to have you examined to exclude this posibility. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Spinal Cord Stimulator",
    "content": "Hi,  Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) can be described best as an 'analgesia on demand'.It is - usually used when other options fail.  - it reduces the cost of pain medications, their side effects & the cost of treating those side effects.   The disadvantages are, - it is effective only in about 50\u201370% cases, - it is an invasive procedure, with potential complications such as bleeding,infections, dural puncture, risk of disconnection or equipment failure.  In any type of surgery, one very basic consideration is 'patient selection'. Better the patient selection, the results are generally believed to be superior in terms of 'patient satisfaction'.   Psychological/psychiatric evaluation is a part of patient selection. For certain procedures, the patient selection is more stringent than in others.  In the case of  Spinal cord stimulation,the need for a psychological evaluation has been driven largely by insurance requirements.  There is a lot of controversy among specialists in pain management as to the role of  psychological evaluation as a prerequisite for SCS.The ability of a psychological assessment to predict outcomes, has been questioned by some.Others point to the estimated 20% of all patients (in some studies) found misrepresenting their response to 'trial stimulation' of the spinal cord before definitive SCS. Based on this observation, some feel that psychological testing may not add significantly to the elimination process.  In some countries psychological testing is mandatory.For example, studies from belgium have shown that psychological testing does enhance the % of successful outcomes.   Pain is not a diagnosis but a symptom.The diagnosis is the primary indication for SCS. If the diagnosis is uncertain,the mechanism of the pain should be determined ( ?ischemic, ?neuropathic) to aid in decision- making.  Ischaemic pain responds most predictably to SCS. Many  neuropathic pains do respond, but unpredictably. A psychiatric opinion does help in case selection.   So, at present,there seems to be no consensus regarding the status of psychological/psychiatric testing in patient selection in individuals with psychiatric illnesses for SCS. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Here's everything about my back problem:  I'm a teenager, a girl, I'm tall and thin, and I've been having lower back pain for over 2 years now. I play a lot of sports but recently had to quit because the hard contact caused me extreme pain and I could not continue. I tried to rest my back for long periods of time and I thought it helped but once I went back to playing sports the pain returned. The pain is gradual. It starts out as an ache and then it starts to feel like I have to stretch it, but stretching doesn't work. In fact, it might make it worse, but I can't be sure. Then it turns into sharp pains that I feel when I twist or turn quickly. Sometimes it will be the left lower back that hurts, and sometimes the right side, it tends to alternate sides. I've seen so many doctors I can't even count them all, and they mostly say that I need to rest for a long time and that I might have to just stay out of sports. but I CANT to that. I can't live with hearing that this back pain is going to keep me from playing sports at the level I want for the rest of my life. Just when I think the pain has gone away, I push myself a little further than I have in the past, and everything I've worked for is gone. The pain returns, and I'm out of the sport. Somebody PLEASE help me. I'm out of ideas. Painkillers work for a day or two, but then my body becomes resistant to them. I tried a back brace but it doesn't do anything & it's so uncomfortable. help me!!!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Harrington Rod Fracture",
    "content": "Hi,   Management of rod fractures varies between spinal surgeons. Most believe that the clinical management of rod fractures must be individualized for each patient.   In the view of some of the spinal surgeons, in patients who have early rod fracture with total loss of correction and overlapping of the rod, re-instrumentation and fusion may be indicated.In patients with a rod fracture who have minimum or no loss of correction and minimum or no associated symptoms,removal of the rod is usually not indicated, even when there is an overlap of the rod ends. Overlap can result from rods slipping out of the hooks at either end. Unless symptoms occur, this is also not considered as an indication for rod removal.  There are some surgeons who advocate routine removal of the rods about an year after surgery (they routinely fuse a short segment + insert the rods) .It is their opinion that the spine becomes reasonably stable by this time and mobilization may be commenced to the advantage of the patient.  Some of the absolute indications sited for rod removal  are a) total loss of correction,  b) loss of correction in the thoracic area with anticipated pulmonary compromise, and  c) symptomatic pseudarthrosis with or without loss of correction.  As to how long one should immobilize following the initial surgery(insertion of the Harrington rods) itself is controversial.The type of immobilization as well as the duration is highly variable. Therefore, for me to hazard an opinion as to how long your back will need to be immobilized following removal of the rods and the likely recovery time may not be appropriate. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "pain around/under the left shoulder blade",
    "content": "This pain started in February 2008. It was not caused by injury or accident. One morning while driving I noticed a pain in my left shoulder blade. It was a dull somewhat aching pain like I had slept wrong. However this pain never went away. Now some history of this pain. The pain is located on the side of the left shoulder blade. Sometimes the pain feels somewhat \"underneath\" the shoulder blade. The pain will also extend to between the shoulder blade and spine as well as up to the shoulder or down to the tip of the shoulder blade but always \"feels\" localized to the side or underneath the blade. Very seldom it will radiate to the front of the chest.   The pain is a constant dull ache with occasional \"spikes\" of sharp pain. The oddity of the pain is that I am for the most part unable to make the pain worse intentionally. Some movements, such as sitting down, and then arching my back forward and my head down will intensify the pain slightly. Pulling my left shoulder forward while leaning forward while breathing deeply will intensify the pain as well. However, sitting up straight will most of the time provide some relief. Deep breathing sitting up straight provides no pain. Over the last two years the pain has never become worse, it has always remained as explained above. On the 1-10 pain scale, the pain all the time is a 2-3 with the quick spikes being a 4-5. The pain doesn't interfere with regular activity, exercise, or lifting. Although after some activities (like painting) the pain seems to become aggravated, raising the dull aching pain to a 4-5 for a day or two. Range of motion is not affected and no normal movements, push ups, extending the arm ect do not make the pain worse.   This pain actually led me to quit smoking. I smoked on and off for about 8 years, at most 1 pack per day. However when I was smoking, smoking a cigarette in the morning would make the pain worse within a few minutes which led me to quit.   Dealing with this issue over the last two years has given me a certain level of anxiety as well, not knowing exactly what it is. Since February of 2008 I have seen multiple doctors. I saw my primary doctor who did a bi-lat chest xray as well as a back x-ray which were clear. She said muscular-skeletal issue and put me on ibprophen and muscle relaxers with no relief. Tried another doctor, another chest x-ray, clear. He then sent me off for an MRI. MRI of the cervical spine had to findings. Doctor suggested physical therapy. One session seemed to make the pain worse. I refereed myself to a spine specialist. The specialist sent me for another MRI of the thoracic spine. Results were all normal except he noted a \"left renal cyst - likely simple\" Again, left without answers, the specialist told me that he says this some sort of small muscle group within the back left shoulder blade that is muscular skeletal and that there really is nothing that could be done. Now 1.5 years into the issue with no real answers, I kept having anxiety about the pain and its cause, and of course the horror stories you read on the internet about back and shoulder pain could be lung cancer. The imaging center was offering free chest screenings so I went for one. The low dose, helical CT scan was normal. Radiologist only reported mild fatty liver, no suspicious nodules, and no adrenal gland issues.   Now that you know the history, my basic questions.  What is this pain and its cause? I have had 3 chest/back x-rays, 2 MRI's, and a Chest CT all with normal findings, yet I still freak out about cancer. I do suffer from mild OCD and sometimes think all these scans have missed something, or the tech's mixed up my results with someone else, is that possible?   My doctor keeps telling me that two years with a pain - if serious - would have developed into something something more by now. True?  Is there anything that I have not tried that I should?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: pain around/under the left shoulder blade",
    "content": "Hi, Musculo skeletal problems and pains arising from the vertebral column can be frequenty frustating for the patient as well as for the clinician.  There are times when major vertebral anomalies are discovered incidentally in an asymptomatic individual (and severely symptomatic individuals at times have no identifiable abnormality!- Perhaps, you may belong to this category).  The shoulder girdle is very complex in its construction and function.It involves movements at the  - shoulder joint - acromio-clavicular joint and - the sterno-clavicular joint.  Many muscles have to work in a co-ordinated fashion for optimal function. Conditions that affect this girdle (muscles, joints, nerve supply etc) can result in pain and functional impairment.Apart from these, pain may be referred to the (Rt)scapula from the biliary tree.  As all your investigations have come back negative, the odds favour a diagnosis of musculoskeletal pain.I feel that you should (in consultation with your doctor) consult an experienced physiotherapist and put yourself through a program for chronic pain relief. If you comply with regular physio, you have a fair chance of recovery.Also, if you quit worrying about this being lung cancer, it would certainly speed up your recovery. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "a few days ago i turned to close my front door and felt a *POP* in my lower back, followed by a sharp pain. the next 12 hours my movement was severely limited, any bending or twisting was impossible due to pain localized in the lower vertebrae, mainly right side. gradually my ability to bend forward at the waist has improved, but it's still difficult and painful. i can lean to one side (at the waist) without pain, but the other side is quite painful. no numbness or tingling anywhere. -could this be a slipped or herniated disk? -could this be related to scoliosis? lower curve: 40 degrees, upper curve 32 degrees. -should i be wary of this happening again?   thank you for the help!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, From your description, it appears that you have a fairly severe scoliosis.Considering your age, itis possible that you have idiopathic adolescent scoliosis (AIS).  AIS are arbitrarily and conveniently classified by the age of onset  \u2013 infantile (from birth to three years), -  juvenile (between four and the end of the ninth year) and  - adolescent (begining at or about ten years of age, or later).  Is is posssible that you perhaps have the  adolescent type?   Scoliosis may not by itself, cause pain but the affected surrounding tissues such as the tendons,muscles,and ligaments can. You have not provided the details of the curves of your spine (convexity of the curve pointing to which side).  It is probable that  the pain of your right side which perhaps is also the side of the protruding (convexity) may be due to the over-stretching of the para-spinal muscles(which are already in a state of constant stretch due to the curve of the spine).  The pain is likely to be worse with sitting and any forward bending movements because, this will cause more stretch to the muscle.In other words, anything which stretches the muscles further, is bound to aggravate the pain.  You describe a \" *POP* in my lower back\".Generally, disc herniations are not 'felt' as a 'sound'.  However, fracturing bones do at times, cause sounds wich a person may 'feel' or even 'hear'.  However, there are case reports of fractures of  - transverse processes of vertebrae and - fracrures of the 'apophysis' of the iliac crest in the context of scoliosis(especially if ossteopenia is associated).Chronic strain on the iliac crest may be pre-disposing to this event.These fractures have been reported in persons who have undergone surgery for scoliosis(you have not mentioned if you have undergone surgery).These fractures may occur in people without scoliosis as well.  Please consult your orthopedic surgeon immediatly to have this sorted out.  Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "I have, for the past 10 days, been experiencing pain across my mid back.  At times it goes into my chest and feels as if it is at the top of my rib cage.  I had my gall bladder removed several years ago.  The pain gets wrse if I move a certain way and especially when I try to lie down.  Once I am down it gets better.  My doctor took blood, ordered xrays and a urine culture.  He has not called to give me those results yet.  However, he did find some pus in my urine and prescribed Bactrin twice a day for a week.  I have been on it for three days.  The pain has not lessened and at times is worse.  Does this sound as if I have a back problem or could it be related to my kidneys?  I have never in my life had a problem with my back.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, This certainly could be a kidney infection.  If so, bactrim may not be \"strong enough\".  With upper urinary tract infection which can progress to the kidney, we often prescribe another antibiotic like ciprofloxacin.    However, the pain changes with movement which is not typical of kidney involvement.  Is there tenderness with palpation?  It may be wise to treat this as a dual etiology - UTI and mid back strain.  Most acute spine pain resolves in 30 days with heat or ice, acetaminophen, and gentle activity.  Another consideration for the source of pain is the lungs.  Your physician probably ordered chest xray to rule out pneumonia.  Your physician also probably asked you questions about any risk for deep vein thrombosis (blood clot) which can lead to pulmonary embolism.  Let us know how things turn out.  Take care.\n\n",

However, the pain has continued and when another urine sample was taken there was still pus, and now blood, in my  urine.  I went for a CT scan on my kidney and liver.  Haven't gotten those results yet.  I am still in pain but not as severe as before.  I have been resting and not doing any type of lifting so it may very well be in my back.  I am scheduled to have both knees replaced in March.  I am wondering if all of this pain could be caused from the severity of the condition of my knees.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Essentially, the blood work is normal - many asymptomatic folks have positive rheumatoid factor.  May need to retest that in the future is hands and feet become stiff and sore.  Regarding the back pain, it may be worthwhile to see a physical therapist who specializes in backs or sacro-iliac problems. They would be able to better pinpoint the problem given a negative MRI.  The option consideration is the hip which can sometimes cause this type of pain.  It would be worthwhile to rule out hip joint problems with an exam and x-ray.  Actually the P.T. could clear the hip with initial examination while your family doc can order the x-ray.  It does sounds like the source of pain is mechanical in nature and should improve with rehab.  Take care.\n\n",

Part of the care with high thyroid is checking bone density to judge risk of fracture especially as you are going through menopause.  Unfortunately here in the States we do not use the carbimazole so I am unable to look up adverse reactions so I need to defer to your family physician.  With all the joints (shoulder, hip and knees) hurting simultaneously, I think about a systemic cause including medicine. Other considerations if the problem persists after medication changes is some form of arthritis (rheumatoid or osteo) in the joints.   Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I have a few quick questions regarding my back problem. I am 36, in good health otherwise. I have had back pain since I was in my 20's, this was always put off as muscle pain. Recently I had an MRI and I am having trouble understanding the conclusions. L4-L5 is just disc degeneration and mild bulging. L5-S1 shows disc bulging, broad-based right posterior extruded nucleus pulposus encroaching upon the right lateral recess, of uncertain significance. There is bilateral outlet foraminal encroachment, right greater than left, and mild facet joint osteoarthritis. My question is, the nucleus within the disk that is extruded, is this herination? or simply just extruded and has not leaked out of the disc? Is foraminal encroachment serious? I do suffer from pain everyday. Some days are better than others. Sometimes if it gets aggrivated enough I can feel pain radiation in my right buttock, and my right leg feels \"different\", no pain to foot. Just wondering if this is more serious than I thought, or common. Thank You for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi All,   Its a longshot by coming here and asking but I figure it cant hurt, considering I have 5 doctors and 2 neurologists working on it and no one can figure it out yet.  So here I am,, Hoping one of you have heard, dealt with or read about anything similar..   9 days ago I was riding passanger in our car doing about 5 mph cause we were going over speed bumps.  We went over one bump and I got a piercing pain in my lower back. It took my breath away.  through out the rest of the day I kept having pain in the same spot.  The next day it was worse, I could hardly stand up straight.     On the third morning I woke up and my back and buttox was numb, by the end of that 3rd day my left thigh was also numb.  I called and got a doctor appt for the 4th day, it was tuesday of last week.  Dr sent me for back xrays, they were negative.  The Dr. made another appt for me for the following thursday.   By thursday my whole back was numb all the way to my armpits, both legs were numb (the left being more numb and also weak), and my scalp was numb.  When I say numb, I mean like after you get a filling at the dentist and the shot they gave starts to wear off, that falling off your face itchy feeling is what my whole body felt like.     The Dr. Sent me for a CT scan, again it was negative.  I went to see him friday and the olny change in my condition was the numbness in my legs had moved to my ankles and the left foot. Plus left leg still very weak.  Dr. sent me to hospital to get spinal tap, test came out with white blood cells in the fluid, telling the drs that something was there, but was not giving a clue as to what. Dr. then Sent me to the closest MRI unit, a 2 hr. drive, and that came up with nothing in my lower back where my pain is, but they did find a bulging disk touching my spinal cord.  The neurologists didnt seem to think it had anything to do with the pain in my lower back.   I seen the Dr. again on saturday, they only gave me more pain killers and talked about giving me a neck brace. I told them no brace, my neck has NEVER bothered me.  I spent all day sunday in bed.   So I see the Dr again today, Monday, My condition has not changed, I have not gotten any number, but the numbness has not gone away.  My left leg is so weak, I don't trust it to keep me secure.  And my back still screams with pain almost every time I move.   The doctors have said it is possible that I have an autoimmume disease or a neurological disorder.. They also said I could have MS but the spinal proved that wrong.   Any ideas out there anyone?    Thanks All.\n\n",

    "content": "Have you ever heard the saying \"The straw that broke the camel's back\"? Sometimes we go along in life abusing our spines by twisting, turning, lifting and carrying things that are too heavy but since we don't experience any pain we think we are fine.  Then one day something minor happens to us and all of a sudden we have back pain as if we had been lifting a ton.  The reason for this is because we through years of abuse to our backs have caused damage to our disks and the vertebrae surrounding them, but we don't feel the damage.  When we finally do the last thing our backs can handle, then a disk collapses or bulges, fractures of the vertebrae develop etc.  It seems that may be what happened to you.  The spinal cord is made up of nervous tissue with many large and small nerves coming off it to ennervate every part of our body.  We do not necessarily have to have a disk bulge against a nerve to have pain or numbness.  The opening from which the nerves come out from the spine is the exact size we need due to the fact that the disk works as a spacer between the vertebrae.  Through years of overuse or misuse of our backs these disks can thin out or rupture  and cause the space, for the nerves to exit from the spinal cord to the body, to become smaller and then the vertebrae themselves start squeezing the exiting nerve. When that happens we feel severe pain and/or numbness.  If the pressure on the nerve is severe we can even develop paralysis.  If the location of the nerves is in the low back are we may develop incontinence of the bowel or bladder. Another possibility for the cause of pain is that our muscles can go into spasm when we have an injury and the spasm itself can cause an irritation to the surrounding areas including the nerves.  There are as manydifferent types of therapy as there are reasons for the pain.  Some of the more common ones are physical therapy, botox injections into muscles that are spasming, surgical decompression of the disks to reduce the pressure on the nerves, epidural injections into the spinal canal to reduce the inflammation of the nervous tissue, etc.  What would be the most beneficial in your case, would have to be determined by your physician who has all your information.  I would recommend  you suggest to your physician that he refer you to a Chronic Pain Management doctor who will work with your physician to find the best  combination of therapy and pain relievers to help relieve your pain.  I wish you the best. Regards, Carolyn\n\n",

    "title": "Severe nerve root damage and rib cage slipping forward",
    "content": "Hello  I have had problems with degenerative discs since my early 20's (am now 53) some days better then others. I lost 150 pounds about 5 years ago and the degeneration stopped. It did not get better but it stopped. Then a few months ago I started getting a burning (on top of pain that is normally in my lower back, although the degeneration had stopped I still experienced pain) right in the very low back. I went to see a doctor at a walk in clinic (mine was on holidays) and told him that the pain was not only there but there was a burning now and pain in both my leg joints where it joins the hip. The left leg was much worse then the right. He said it sounded like arthritis and sent me for xrays of my hips and sacral ileac areas. It came back as normal. He was quite surprised so sent me for xrays in my lumbar area and this time it came back as severe degeneration of L5-S1 disc with severe nerve root damage. He suggested I get in touch with my doctor which I did. She told me to not do anything at all that involved any twisting, any bending at the waist.. nothing. She sent me to a physiotherapist that she uses and that I have seen in the past. We had talked about doing Prolotherapy previously for my back. I had had that done about 15 years before with success.  I went and saw the Physiotherapist who when he checked my back asked me if I had problems anywhere else. I told him that by this time I had been waking up for the last few weeks with really really bad headaches and pain in my shoulder blade area leading up to my head. I thought it was my pillow and got an ergonomically correct one but there had been no relief. I told him it was much worse if I ended up sleeping on my back as the pain would wake me up. He said he asked because it looked like my right rib cage had slipped forward. He asked about xrays and I told him I had had lumbar ones done and the results. He told me I needed to go back to my doctor and have her send me for total back xrays so that he can see why it is like that.  So now I have an appointment but not for a few more days now. The pain in my shoulder blades is so much worse then it was a week ago when i saw the Physiotherapist. I have a portable TENS machine that I manage to hook up on my upper back and that gives me a little relief later in the day but when I try to do it first thing in the morning, the area is so painful it actually sends spasms along my upper back.  I have 2 questions.. what is your feedback on Prolotherapy? Although I had it done as I mentioned in the past with success, I didn't have nerve root damage before. And secondly if my rib cage has moved forward what would have caused that and what can I do for it to tide me over till I go see my doctor and then wait to go for xrays etc.  Thank you for listening and for your time.  Sally\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The ribs would be turned forward from a twist in the spine.  I would expect to see a scoliotic spine if the the rib cage was more prominent on one side.  Regarding prolotherapy, I have not used it in my practice but have read of some success cases but these were in the peripheral joints and not in the back. Since the problem is deep within the spine, it would be difficult to reach the disc or tissue surrounding it.  Most spinal injections are done under flouroscope and therefore spinal prolotherapy should not be done outside an interventional radiologist's scope.  Take care.\n\n",

A friend of mine was recently diagnosed with a lumbosacral sprain, causing severe but intermittent back and leg pain, radiating down from her lower back to below her left knee.

I know PT is often proscribed for a herniated disc as well as a lumbar sprain, but are there any other possibilities you can think of where PT would not be advisable?  Thanks again!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It would be hard to miscount cervical vertebrae on xray.  There may be an extra lower cervical vertebrae ie after C7 and before T1 ...a transitional vertebrae.  With the lateral hand numbness, it would make sense.  The lowest cervical intervertebral nerve root would supply innervation this area of the hand - typically C8 nerve root.  Perhaps with the extra vertebrae there is some compromise or pinching of this nerve root.  The EMG will help reveal any nerve involvement.    An MRI may also be helpful.  Let us know how it goes.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for your response Tom.  I had the EMG yesterday, and the neurologist told me to wear pads on my elbows.  When I gave him a confused look and asked what that had to do with my neck, the neuroligist was silent for a moment and said \"well your neck is fine too\".  So I guess that is good.  At least there is no nerve damage at this point.  My OT thinks it is because when I use my arms, I isolate them, and do not use my shoulder muscles and upper back to help.  So the ulnar nerves are getting aggravated from that.  I did get to look at my rads compared to a normal neck, and sure enough there were 8 vertebrae in mine.  So from here, it is therapy to learn how to \"live with it\" and continue on.   It sounds like the prognosis is good for me.  I am feeling better and less anxious about the whole thing now.  I just wish it made me taller, I am only 5'2\"!\n\n",

    "title": "Will a herniated disc with migration heal itself?",
    "content": "I am a 46 yr old male.I have diabetes,hypertension and I smoke.On March 18th 2009 I suffered a back inury.I am a paramedic and was on shift.I was taking a 360lb pt out of the back of my ambulance.The cot had a malfunction and I ended up dropping the cot with the pt on it.I was the only one who had a hold of the cot and when it fell it went all the way to the ground with me holding on to it.Since this happened I have been in terrible pain.I have had an MRI and it states L4-L5 is herniated and L5-S1 is herniated and that both have moderate migration.I have been experiencing sever pain not only in my back but also down the right sciatic nerve associated with some right leg pain and numbness on my right little toe and toe next to the little toe.On occasion my right leg will give completely out and if I do have hold of something will fall to the ground.I have seen an orthopedic surgeon and he seems to think it will all go away on its own and that I will be able to return to work in a couple of weeks.Since the accident happened it seems to me like it is getting worse and not better.The pain is getting worse.My leg and sciatic nerve pain are getting worse.It hurst to walk,sit,stand,couch,sneeze,drive and I only sleep about 3 or 4 hours a night because I cannot get comfortable and the pain awakens me.Also in the accident I injured my back around T-7 and my cervicle spine around C-4 but the doctor doesn't seem to think they are worth looking at so I have no idea what,if anything,might be wrong with them.I understand that it is workers comp and they have the say so in what gets treated.But they have aggred to an MRI of my T spine and C spine but the doctor doesn't feel an MRI is needed.Am I being to critical of the doctor or should I be more aggressive in my desire to be treated for all my injuries?Should I attempt to seek out a different doctor who is willing to treat all my injuries?And will a disc herniation with migration heal itself?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, First about the lumbar disc herniations.  The radiology report should say something about any impingement (yes or no) of the thecal sac or nerve root impingement - this may explain the sciatic symptoms.  Usually neurosurgery is a better consult than general orthopedics.  You may also consider EMG study to determine the extent of nerve damage into the leg. Weakness in the leg is a concerning sign especially if it is caused by nerve impingement in the lumbar spine.  This would be an indication for surgical repair.   For the cervical spine, an MRI would be reasonable especially if any radiating arm pain, numbness, or tingling. Take care and let us know how it goes.\n\n",

    "title": "Neck and Shoulder Pain...",
    "content": "Had no luck in the General forum so thought I woudl try here...   Over the past few years, I have had an increasingly painful neck and shoulder problem on the right side. Here is a list of the injuries I have had to this area...   1 - hit back of head (base of skull, right side) on the corner of a table, very hard (2000)  2 - tore the deltoid in my right arm (2003)  3 - cracked rib, right side (2002)  4 - hyperextended my right arm at the shoulder, believe it was the trapezius I strained (2001)   So, as you can see, I have had a fair bit of trauma to this area. I wake up every morning with a very stiff neck and it takes a few stretches to loosen it up enough for me to continue my day. As the day goes on, it get stiffer and more painful, sometimes causing headaches. At times I get a bit of numbness in my right arm and fingers, the odd time it goes to the left hand and fingers. On some occasions I get very sharp pains shooting through my head and neck area when I move or turn a certain way.   I am at my wits end as I have seen about 4 different doctors and specialists for this and they all tell me it is nothing serious and I just need to do some physio to fix it. This is where the problem lies, I have done Physio for months at a time on two seperate occasions to no avail and now, at the point my pain is at, I can't handle doing any type of shoulder or neck excercises at all as it hurts and I get a headache the next day. I've had massage therapy, chiropractic work, used NSAIDS, etc. and nothing helps it. I have had x-rays which show nothing and physical examinations which reveal nothing.   My last resort is to request an MRI to see what's going inside my neck and shoulder. Seeing as it will take about 3 or 4 months before that will happen, I was hoping someone might have some ideas or suggestions as to what I can do to help the situation. Or thoughts on what might be living inside my neck and shoulder!!   THANKS!!\n\n",

    "content": "Update...  I saw a rheumatologist a week ago and he can also be added to pile of doctors that think I am fine and nothing is wrong with my shoulder or neck.   I sat and told him the exact information from above and he simply said that 90% of my problem is my pillow!!! He gave me a prescription for an orthopedic pillow (which I've tried before, but he ignored that bit of info) and sent me on my way. All he did for an examination was bend my arms and legs a bit, turn my head, tap my joints and listen to my breathing. No x-rays, nothing else. He completely ignored what I said about my years of pain in this area and brushed me off like I was nuts.  Needless to say, I will not recommend him to anyone as his bedside manner is horrible. He is not compasionate to the pain one might be going through and acts as if he knows everything about you just by glancing at you.   Anyway...  I will be getting that MRI on August 6th and hopefully it will reveal the cause of all this pain I have. I will try the pillow again, but I find it hard to believe this could be the cause (90% worth) of my pain!!!  Is it possible that with all the above injuries, numbness, tingling, stiffness, etc., etc. my choice of pillow and sleeping habits is the cause of all this pain?? I know for a fact I don't do any acrobatic moves while I'm sleeping!! Or any head stands, head buts, heavy lifting etc...my wife says I am a relatively calm sleeper (once I fall asleep, I do tend to have trouble getting comfortable, but that is another issue all together).  I'll post the MRi results in August...any ideas about my pillow would help.  Thanks,  Antoine\n\n",

She found some things the doctor didn't. Anyway, have you ever tried acupuncture? I've been going to an acupunturist for quite some time (until I went on WC anyway) and it can really help with pain. I was nervous at first because I REALLY hate needles but once I had my first treatment I was able to really relax and enjoy it...it not only helped with the pain but helped my energy level and mood as well. It may not be your style but it's something to consider. Hope your MRI gives you some answers and you can find a treatment that helps.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear ajpaivu, I am so sorry you are having this problem. I have been where you are at and suffered many years until I found the right doctors to diagnose properly my exact problems. I had to leave my home state and move to another, but it was worth it. I am now post-op 9 weeks from a C6-7 discectomy and fusion with instrumentation.  I woke up from this surgey minus all the pain and other symptoms from my problem. I was losing the use of my hands. I would drop everything I tried to hold. I am so delighted that my team of doctors found the problem and gave me way to iliminate all the symptoms. I am now without the pain and able to use my hands again. I am an artist and this was important to me.  I am sure this MRI you are having will give your doctor a good picture of your problems. I also had a CT Myelogram to further diagnose the disc and nerve involvement. I also had an EMG to diagnose the amount of nerve damage.  I am being followed by a Neurosurgeon, an Interventional  Pain Management doctor, and I will see the physical therapist as soon as the Neurosurgeon says to. I follow his orders to a tee. I am still wearing my neck brace as well.  It took me years of listening to doctors who told me my pain was in my head.  I made a concerted effort to locate these doctors I now see, even leaving my home and relocating in another state. I had spine problems all my life, and only after a bad car accident did I require the additional surgeries. I have had 4 altogether. My pain mgt dr gives me transforaminal nerve blocks, and I am on medication to insure some quality of life.  I am interested in the results of your MRI.  Please remember, there are solutions to your problems, you just have to locate and treat with the right doctors. Please hang in there. I know you are taking a proactive approach to this and you will succeed.  I did !\n\n",

My MRI went well (on the 6th) and it has been just over a week, so I hope to get the results sometime this week. I'm very anxious to see what they found and worried at the same time. I now have some new symptoms which worry me as well. The other day I was having coffee with some friends and asked one of them to pass me the creamer across the table. I took it in my hand and it began to shake so much I just about dropped the creamer. It's not like it was heavy, it was a creamer for pete's sake!! I guess it was jsut the way I was holidng it or something, but I am sure it has something to do with my head and neck.  Well, we will soon find out!! I must add that my current family doctor is great and is the main reason I have gotten the appointment with a rheumatologist and my MRI. He is very proactive as well when it comes to finding out the problem. He wants to learn what it is is almost as much as I do.   Keep you posted!!! (Hopefully soon!!)\n\n",

    "content": "Please check out this web site. http://www.spine-health.com/topics/cons ... /chd1.html    I had similar problems and found my symptoms and a lot of answers here.  My pain began in July beginning in my left shoulder.    My Diagnosis and Treatment:  X-rays of wrist, arm, shoulder, and neck ordered.   \tResult: pinched nerve two areas \u2013 C4 & C6    Pain medications ordered. Day time and evening  \u2013 Morphine, Lodine, Darvon.  It takes all of this and a heating pad to make the pain tolerable for a couple of hours.    MRI ordered \tResult: confirmed above, due to bone spurs  Dr ordered intravenous medication to knock me out for a couple of days to give me some relief from the severity of the pain.    Treatment: Spinal epidural injection of cortisone to relieve pain and inflammation in a series of 3 injections 2-3 weeks apart.  I had 2nd injection done last week.    1st injection resulted in 20% relief of pain in left arm but pain developed in neck and shoulder, and headaches.    2nd injection resulted in total 80% reduction of pain.  However, pain has started in right arm \u2013 wrist and elbow area, more headaches, pain still in neck and shoulder.    New sharp stabbing pain on right side under rib.  Research on the internet indicates spine and neck involvement.    Dr said pain was present in other areas but the severity of pain in the left arm masked the other areas.  I was beginning to think I was crazy.    3rd injection scheduled next week.    Today I opted to schedule surgery to remove the bone spurs in December.  I don\u2019t want the pain to come back ever.  I am tried of the pain and drugs, not to mention the emotional and physical toll this has taken on me.     Best of luck to you!!  Hope it helps.\n\n",

    "content": "Sorry for the long delay since the last update...I've been very busy and finally got to see my doctor for 5 minutes the other day.  Apparently, the MRI showed nothing at all wrong inside. My doctor said that this would indicate a muscular type of problem if nothing showed up. What does this mean? I have to visit him again as I only got to sneak in to see him for a few minutes. I really am beginning to think I am crazy and all this pain is in my head? What does muscular problems mean? Are they torn or strained. I don't think it is a weakness problem as I have very muscular and broad shoulders. What kind of tests can be done to the area to see what's wrong with the muscles?   I am guessing that I will be told to do physio again, but what do I do if physio makes the pain worse? Do I fight through it and hope it gets better?  Well, I will send through another update once I finally get in to see my docotor for a real visit. This is really starting to take it's toll on me mentally. I just bought a house and I am having trouble renovating because the pain forces me to limit the time I spend there.  Thanks for the web site info ibcruella!  Ant\n\n",

    "content": "FIrst of all just because a muscular injury doesn't show up on an MRI doesn't mean that it is all in your head. Not everything can show up on tests. I have been fighting with a hip/leg pain problem for 3 years that is undiagnosable, physio doesn't work, but the pain is real and reproducable.  Your pain is very real and you need to be treated for it. This isn't my specialty, so I am not going to suggest specific diagnostic tests for you, but I would definitely suggest consulting a pain clinic. Even if your doctor is unable to diagnose exactly what is happening muscularly, the experts at a pain clinic will be able to help you to significantly reduce your pain. Keep going to your doctors and working for a diagnosis, tell them about your episode of weakness with the creamer, and also try to hunt out a pain clinic. Don't give up. Keep us posted.\n\n",

    "title": "Bilateral Sciatica after a hill run",
    "content": "Hello  I am a healthy 30 year old female who does alot of road running.  On 15h April 09, I did a hill run, instead of coming down slowly I got carried away and flew down the hill (uneven ground for a good few miles).  The next day I had pain in both my hips, weight bearing on either leg sent a sharp pain through my hip, the left was worse than the right.   I rested for over 3 weeks. Started running again (no hills) and the pain returned. GP sent me to physio which is still on going.  They initially treated me with accupuncture saying i had ITB injury, I have never had knee pain, everything I read about ITB talks about knees. My pain has not gone away, it has eased slightly in that I no longer get the sharp pain through my hip when weight bearing, but it has changed slightly.  It has been made worse recently following a six hour drive.  My pain now is  like sciatica which is mainly in my glutes its bilateral and there all the time, sleeping is becoming a problem(, I get very occaisonal pins and needles in my big toe.  I also have new low back pain and still the pain in the hip area. THe pain is made worse by prolonged sitting or running.  My glutes feel numb after I have been sitting for some time and some tingling is also felt.   I have had sports massage and in one particular area in both glutes when he presses quite firmly It makes the sciatica pain worse - it shoots right through my glutes just to the top of my hamstings.   I have had weekly massages since may on my ITB, glutes, hamstrings and Piriformis.  I also do alot of stretching.   Could this be bilateral Piriformis?  or is there something else going on.  GP has refered me to an orthopaedic Consultant have been waiting since 8th July appt not till 23rd Sept.   Only other pain is in my pubic symphisis this just become uncomfortable after a hard/long training session.  Please help I want to this pain in my Glutes to go so that I can start to enjoy running again.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Bilateral Sciatica after a hill run",
    "content": "Hello, Certainly piriformis syndrome can cause the sciatic nerve pain.  The sciatic nerve in most people runs under the piriformis - when the piriformis tightens or spasms, the sciatic nerve can become compressed or irritated. The other possibility is some structure in the lumbar spine.  Running downhill (especially at high speed for a long distance) places a large amount of stress on the lumbar (and sacral iliac) joints.  You might even say that it overly extends the spine - again placing lots of stress on the small facet joints in the lumbar spine. An MRI of the lumbar spine may help rule out any lumbar pathology.  Otherwise, continuing with conservative treatment including abdominal strengthening and hamstring stretching should add to the rehab as this places the hips and trunk muscles in better balance especially in runners.    Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Thought I would update you on my injury.  I met with the Orthopaedic Doctor in September - he thought I might have  FAI ordered MRI of hips and Pelvis - MRI all ok.  Got XRAY or lumbar spine  - Dr says I have an odd looking SI joint (what this means I don't know) and I have Spina Bifida Occulta.  He thinks the pain in my buttock/hip area is coming from my back, he thinks the facet joint is the problem and has been damaged during the hill run.  I am now on the waiting list for Facet joint injection.  Looking forward to pain free running.   Unfortunatly instead of resting I have been doing some running, only small mileage say 4 miles a couple of times a week, also doing some boxercise, thought it was important to keep fitness up.   Doing this I think I have been over compensating when running as have hurt my knee.  I bent down to reach something and I got a loud click in my knee followed by very sharp pain on the inside of my knee.  Now squating down and standing up result in this sharp pain on the inside of my knee.  I tried a run today - I know very silly, but I was aware of slight pain in the knee as I started running and this then eased after a couple of miles.  When I stopped running it was again sore.  Just medial side of left knee.  I am taking antinflamatory's and I put ice on it when I got home - any ideas what I have done?\n\n",

    "content": "I have this pain/tenderness in my thoracic spine (6 mths), started out hurting upon waking up, & it would be so bad, I couldn't go back to sleep and would have to get up to keep it from getting any worse, after awhile being awake, the pain would improve. Exercise or bending over makes the pain worse. It is now constant & won't go away. Sleeping still increases the pain. New mattresses not helpful. Putting ice on it just aggitates the tenderness increasing the pain.  It's down in my spine about to the point where you could reach back there with your hand & it's sore to the touch. The pain pulls upward usually into my left shoulder, neck, jaw, & I think it may be causing the cheek pain & headaches also. I've had tingling in my back, back of head, legs. Occassional numbness in neck & face. Twitching in my back. Pain esp with walking goes into my left chest & causes shortness of breath.  The pain is not severe but occassionally can be. It's very hard for me to believe it could be anything serious like a slipped disc/pinched nerve, I did nothing to hurt my back. Could muscle strain bring on these symptoms? My dr did not try treating it, no physical exam or tests & blamed it on my mattresses. That wasn't very helpful.\n\n",

    "content": "Wow,   When I first read this I thought I had written it myself.  I have been struggling with this dull, achy mid-thoracic back pain for almost a year now.    I was a former professional weight lifter who specialized in olympic and power lifts and for many years I did repetitive motions with heavy weights.  Fast forward to now - I'm in my upper 30's and about 7-8 months ago I started waking up in the morning with a dull achy and very uncomfortable pain and stiffness in my mid-thoracic region of my back.  I did not injure this area and I hadn't been exercising either.  I was slightly over my ideal body weight but still active.    At first I thought I'd just give it a month to resolve itself and the stiffness and achy feelings just got worse in the early morning hours.  I would have to get out of bed and then I would get relief, along with a hot shower.  I went to the chiropractor for 6 months and got no relief which was unusual because I've had a lot of success with chiropractic.  I started stretching and doing pilates.  No relief.  I used heat and ice and ice didn't help much either.  My posture was my next focus and those muscles around that area really struggled to maintain posture for long periods of time.   Then I went to my physician.  We tried muscle relaxers and ibuprofen - they did nothing.  She did regular x-rays and they came out normal.  She suggested physical therapy and/or massage therapy and that's when I started actively working out again doing pilates, cycling and stretching.  I have lost weight and it hasn't helped.  I bought a very expensive tempur pedic bed and pillows.  Didn't help.    I am quite familiar with the anatomy of this area and my thinking is that since the only thing that gives me relief is getting out of bed and taking a hot shower that it's a soft tissue problem.  Massage therapy and heating pads are next on my list and I have a started a regimen of nutritional supplements as well that I hope offer some relief since muscle relaxers and ibuprofen don't work.   I don't have any other symptoms to speak of other than this dull achy uncomfortable stiffness in the morning and then later in the day going into the night.  Any suggestions as to what type of problem this may be?  Arthritis?  Inflammatory process?  I have not done an MRI yet, that was my doctor's next tool but I am going to wait until I try massage therapy.  I'm just trying to avoid more doctor bills if I can figure it out on my own.  So far nothing has helped and it's truly frustrating to be in pain every day.    Thanks  Candy\n\n",

Swimming may be fine but freestyle involves repetitive head turning in order to breathe. Squats and push ups should be fine.

    "content": "Dear Doctor,  I have been having sharp pain felt at the lower part of my back (probably the lumbar/sacral) segment which will sometimes cause pain radiating to my right leg as well ever since I injured my back from break dancing. After the injury, i went for an electrical surgery but the pain is still existent probably because I injured it again.  The periodic sharp pain will come once every 3 months accompanied by nausea and vomiting of water. Each episode will last for at least 1 month and I will have difficulty walking. However, since I am a full-time dancer, I have not stopped dancing despite the pain using painkillers to suppress the pain when I dance. Recently I went to see the doctor and he told me that I had to go for surgery and told me that I may be paralyzed if I do not do so.   I am reluctant as it is not 100% and also, i would have to stop dancing after the surgery for 1 year or so. I would like to know whether the fact that I am constantly having these periodic pains shows that the slip disc problem is worsening, whether there are any other treatment options other than surgery that would help to improve my situation and if I can still continue dancing since the pain is periodic and not on a daily basis. Thank you so much.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, If the surgeon told you surgery was needed to correct the back injury and you risk permanent neurological damage then there must be significant structural damage in the disc, nerves or spine itself. Intermittent pain does not change the damage and if your occupation increases your risk of further damage, you should consider the risks and benefits of surgery or no surgery.  You may also consider physical therapy for conservative rehab.  The only contraindication for P.T. is  moderate to severe spondylolithesis where the spine is actually shifted forward due to fracture.  Take care.\n\n",

In general, post partum low back pain can occur in the sacral or sacral iliac area and/or epidural area. Treatment is conservative: ice and hot packs, NSAIDs, and exercise as tolerated.  If the symptoms persist, see your physician.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "I was in involved in a minor car accident (march 2009). My neck and right shoulder was very painful. I do have a history of neck pain. I immediately started phyiscal therapy-neck improved-shoulder did not.  After doing a strength test evaluation again in Aug 09, I started to have lower back pain. I never had a history of this. During the strength test, I was laying on a gurnie that separates if not locked properly.  While doing one of the test the bottom part of gurnie slid back and forth. The therapsit locked it in place.  We continued with the test evaluation, the gurnie moved again.  Could this be the cause of my lower back pain. I noticed while standing, my pelvic area is more forward. What can be done to correct this problem as I stand all day at work. After an MRI, they found a herniated disc in the thorasic area. I do not believe the thorasic disc is a result of the test...but I never compalined about lower back pain when I first saw this therapist.  I also had a severe bladder infection for the first time, I am 50 years old. The back pain started with this and has continued since.  Please help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello  This is my first post. I have been searching the internet for answers to my back pain questions and this forum looked like a great place to find some solutions.  To start off I am a young guy only 27 years old. about a year ago I started having major sharp pains in my lower back, with stiffness in the muscles. (this happened after my wife and I moved from our apartment.) I'm a lacrosse player so pain can usually be walked off or easily ignored, but not this time. My general practitioner sent me to the local hospital for an MRI and and also to see an Orthopedic. Who recommended physical therapy. The therapy treatments seems to reduce the pain for a short time but keep coming back. (even doing the exercises at home, I have not been playing LAX.) The pain is no worse or less then when it first started. The orthopedic has also given me medications several times for my back skalactin, and flexiral (not at the same time). they don't work at all. I get the impression the doctor does not believe my back really hurts as bad as it does. i've been missing days at work (thank GOD its a family business.) Can someone please take a look at my MRI report from almost a year ago an explain to me what going on with my back in plain english. I've taken it apon myself to see a acupuncturist and chiropractor but still nothing.... this has been going on for months and months now and i'm just wasting my money and going crazy from the pain because I cant find relief.  REPORT:  Lumbar reticulopathy  L-spine MRI without gadolinium  T1, T2, PD, STIR sagittal, T1-T2 axial MR images lumbar spine  Findings; no compression fracture or suspicious marrow signal change.

    "content": "Hello, I agree that the MRI report does not reveal too many problems.  The main finding is a bulging disc at the L3/L4 lumbar (low back) level which is pressing slightly on nerve tissue.  Certainly, conservative treatment with mechanical traction and lumbar extension exercises for a month are indicated to reduce the disc. I would also suggest an rigorous walking (not running) regimen - at least 120 minutes a week walking at a moderate to brisk pace.  You should notice a difference in pain in two weeks. If no change or worse with traction, lumbar extension and walking after two weeks, see a neurosurgeon. Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a reasonably healthy 38-year old male that was involved in a car accident two weeks ago. Someone rear-ended my vehicle at 40mph. I refused treatment at the scene but felt typical signs of a sore back/back strain the next day. A few days laters, I had x-rays at a doctors office. No problems were found to the bones and the doc told me I had signs of routine back strain. My back 'pain' and soreness lasted only a week. However, I have been suffering from constant back spasms or 'twitches' in my lower back about 4 inches above my belt line ever since. I am not experiencing any numbness in my limbs. These twitches are extremely irritating and makes it difficult to sleep at night. I feel them mostly when I lie down or sit at a computer desk. It feels like someone in my lower back is sending morris code. Hard to describe. What is most likely going on here? Many thanks for you time.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Low back symptoms (pain, spasms, twitching, stiffness) from a car accident (rear end collision) can last some time despite negative x-ray or MRI.  Basically the ligaments and soft tissue and small joints get overstretched or over-strained.  Since there are no neurological symptoms (leg numbness or tingling), this is good sign.  Activity as tolerated, NSAIDS, hot/cold packs and gentle stretching are the mainstays of treatment.    Over time the twitching and stiffness should resolve.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "About a week ago, I noticed the top right side of my foot has been numb on my right foot including my pinky two and the one next to it.  The numbness goes slightly up my right front of my leg.    I gave it a few days thinking it would just go away, maybe a pinched nerve or something.  The part of my leg that was numb has come back, but the foot I still can not feel  I don't have any pain in my foot or leg, its just numb.  However, I did injure my lower back and tail bone in a car accident 12 years ago...but had it checked out and they didn't find anything , just strained muscles.  That part of my back has been very tender to the touch and weak.  I think I may have re-injured it wake-boarding a few years back as it popped and shot pain down my legs and lower back. It felt  like someone was twisting the muscle around my lower back and tail bone.  I didn't have it checked out then....which I should have probably. Not sure if any of this would have caused the numbness in my foot, where it happened a few years ago....but would really like to have the feeling back in my foot.  If you have any ideas or thoughts of what may be causing this, it will be much appreciated.  Thanks petey7803\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I am hoping you can shed some light on the recurring lower back pain I have been getting ever since I had my son, never before.  I had an epideral that was topped up for 14 hours as I had back labour. I then had an emergency C-section. I can remember in the OR, my neck seizing in pain all of a sudden and I couldn't move it, I remember a nurse trying to inject a needle in my back 3 or 4 times and it didn't work, (kept getting blood I think?), so I was put completely under. Now my back has gone out about 7 times since and my son just turned 3. The pain is always in the same spot, lower middle left. It feels reminiscent of the pain I felt when I was in labour. I can usually feel twinges before it hits full on but the one I have now came with no warning and is the worst one I have had. I am wondering if there is a relationship between my labour and the injections I received, and my back going out.  I went to my family doctor and thought of this possibility after the visit. I am going for an X-ray but thought perhaps you could share your expertise please!  Thank-you for your time.\n\n",

    "title": "Sciatic pain for 1 year",
    "content": "I've had sciatic pain for more than 1 year now after explosively lifting 150 pounds from shoulder level to overhead. Originally, it was on my left side and radiated from my lower back to my left knee. It slowly improved by perhaps half a percent per day until I resumed physical activity. Then it switched to my right side. Sitting is usually not bearable for more than a minute. Standing is a little better, 5-10 minutes can be tolerated. Laying down alleviates the pain, but it returns immediately after standing.    My primary care physician said my back was spastic because I was unable to touch my toes and she prescribed various exercises. I've followed these fairly diligently, but with marginal improvement after several months. I had experienced an absense of pain after 6 weeks of treatment from an accupucturist; however, after squatting around 200 pounds several times, I felt a sudden movement in my back and the return of pain, which has not abated.  Several muscles are tight: the ITB and hamstrings especially, quads, and periformis. I'd describe the pain as feeling like tight rubber bands around my right knee, about 3/10 in severity, but continuously aching. Sometimes sharp pain emmenates from the middle of the calf. Only occassionally do I feel pain directly from the lower back. My health is otherwise excellent in all respects.  My question is why is this taking so long to resolve itself (six weeks recovery seems typical) and what, if anything, may I do to accelerate recovery?\n\n",

If the spine is structurally sounds, then employ physical therapy for 4-6 weeks of specific rehab.  This should include lower extremity stretching and core strengthening. Afterwards, gradually return to regular exercise program.  Weight lifting may need to wait awhile depending on your rehab.   May look into a walking or swimming program for good spine health.

Across hips, and jolting in my left hip, and down the front of my left knee, as well as down the back of my left calf.  I also get waves of softer numbness on my right groin, and my but.  I still have no achilles reflex or knee reflex in my right leg.  I was bedridden for approx 9 months total and finally walking and moving (sortof) 2 months after the fusion, but its 6 months since that surgery, and I am still tremendously limited on what I can do in a day, I can only sit for MAYBE an hour and doing so causes increased nerve pains.  I also get on a few occassions when I sit, one or both legs go DEAD numb, to the point if I try to stand my ankle will roll cuz the leg is dead and it takes 5-10 minutes for it to come back.  It feels dead in sensation, then comes back like when your hand goes to sleep and pins and needles horribly til it comes back.  What could be the reasons I have terrible increased nerve pains, surgeon stopped PT, wants EMG and MRI, awaiting scheduling.  What is the likelihood of reherniation of the L3/4 now that it has added stress due to the L4/5 fusion?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Herniation of the disc or nerve impingement at any levels below L4 would be the likely cause of the pain.  MRI and EMG are indicated to help with diagnosis.  Nine months in bed is too long post op.  The muscles become weak and takes at least 4 months to recovery some strength.  We recommend a walking program post op in most cases.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The numbness in the lips could be caused from hyperventilation however it sounds like it starts in the limbs and works its way up the neck to the tongue and lips.  Also, this is not a usual pattern of nerve disorder from a neck problem.  The mouth numbness is probably a part of the aura that coincides with the migraine.    Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Juli, You posted a history of a couple bouts of flu and constant back pain. I understand the \"flu\" as being diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, body aches, chills, fever, headache or was this influenza (a respiratory infection). You also report dizziness.  I do not see a clear association with flu symptoms and low back pain besides general muscle or body aches.    If any bacteria or viral illness were to cause spine pain (e.g. meningitis), the neck would classically be stiff or painful.  Meningitis (an infection of the covering of the spinal cord) causes fever, headache, neck stiffness, and nausea/vomiting.    Most acute low back resolves in 30 days without any specific rehabilitation.  We treat symptoms with ice or heat packs, analgesics, and gentle exercise.  If symptoms of leg weakness, pins and needles, numbness, or inability to pee develop then further testing is needed to rule out nerve damage.  It is important to see your family physician who can hear your case, examine you and give you a diagnosis with appropriate treatment.   Let us know how it goes.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 20 year old female who has done gymnastics for most of my life. My back started hurting when I was in 6th grade (2000). My family and doctors used to think that it was because of gymnastics, but over the years we have found other reasons. I was diagnosed with Scoliosis in 2000 when I went to a chiropractor. He also told me that my top two vertebrae were twisted and blocking a little bit of blood flow to my head with caused headaches. In 2006 I was diagnosed with Scheuermann's Disease, three thoracic compression fractures, and schmoral nodes.   I stopped gymnastics full time in 2003 and only did high school gymnastics (3 months out of the year). I graduated 2007 and have not done gymnastics since and my pain is still here. I even have more symptoms (there's a lot and I'm not sure if they are relevant but I will list them anyways): constant lower back pain, hip pain, fatigue, morning nausea, constant joint pain (comes on randomly in different joints), headaches at least two or three times a week, tire and weaken easy, very painful spots in my neck when I wake up (sharp shooting pains when I move it but usually goes away in an hour), neck is still sore and stiff throughout the day, worsened memory, and I get colds frequently. Some of these symptoms come and go, but they are usually pretty frequent. I have done a routine blood test and everything was normal.   The reason I am on here is because none of my doctors will do more tests. I really want a brain scan just to make sure there is nothing there because that is pretty much the only place that hasn't been scanned. I am afraid to ask my doctors because they keep blowing me off and think there is nothing wrong with me because I look healthy. I have been in constant pain for at least six years and I have learned to deal with it, so I can hide my pain very well. Truth is, my whole body hurts sometimes and I just want an answer. Does anyone have any ideas or at least tell me what direction I can start in? Should I ask my doctor for a brain scan or should I not worry about it?  Thanks in advance!\n\n",

My doctor sent me for a neck x-ray, and they told me i have lost the correct curve to the spine in the neck. I was told it was caused by muscle spasms. My neck was not examined, so how can they know it is due to this? Could it be for another reason? I am 37 years old. Thankyou.\n\n",

    "content": "Besides bony changes which would show up on xray (eg ankylosing spondylitis of lumbar spine), nothing else comes to mind that would cause a straightening of a normal lordotic curve of the cervical spine.  Muscle spasms certainly would cause this.  All this means is the neck muscles are keeping the neck stiff to prevent painful movement.  There is probably a strain or sprain in the neck area causing the symtoms.  Usually time, rest, heat, OTC analgesics, and gradual gentle range of motion resolves the condition.  If you develop numbness, tingling, or weakness in either arm consult your physician because this may mean nerve tissue is being pinched or inflamed. Keep us updated.\n\n",

Also, if i've been sitting for a while, when i stand up, i can't straighten my back immediately, i am bending forward for a minute. I am 37 years old, my doctor said we get back ache because we walk on two legs, but i am worried i have some kind of arthritis. I am sure i shouldn't feel so old already! Should i go to a specialist, and should i have any tests? thankyou.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The hypertension is not likely related to the back problems or night sweats.  However, you should report the symptoms to your doctor.  Infections such as TB can cause night sweats but you can also get these due to hormonal fluctuation, especially if you are entering the perimenopausal period.  This is a condition of reduced estrogen with symptoms that sometimes last up to 10 years prior to actual menopause.  So, while you are young for this, it sometimes happens.  I would see a doctor for a complete physical examination including thyroid, hormone levels, pelvic exam and TB testing.    Best wishes.\n\n",

My blood pressure has remained at around 105/65 for the past few months (i took the beta blockers months ago). Don't know if i mentioned a neck x-ray showed loss of the normal cervical curve. I've now had a numb ring finger and little finger, and part of my palm for 3 weeks now, though it is only mild. A doctor told me to take movatec for a week, but this has not helped. Don't really know if i should go back to the doctor. I'm also having some kind of panic attacks every few weeks, where i feel really weak, it's a really terrible feeling. It feels like i can't move properly, and i need to urinate a lot. I feel better when i drink a lot of water. This seems to happen late at night, and it may be linked to eating high salt foods. These attacks started about 2 years ago, but they used to be only occasional. Do you think this is all psychological?  thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Irene, The numbness in the legs after sitting on the loo or in a regular chair for long periods of time is a normal event for many people without back problems.  What is of concern is the loss of balance and quickening of the numbness with sitting.  I would be suspect of nerve involvement in the lumbar spine.  You may even check the cervical spine as stenosis there can cause loss of balance.  The next step would be an MRI of the lumbar spine and perhaps cervical spine which can be ordered through your family physician.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "I woke up in the middle of the night with a very stiff and sore back. At that point i couldn't go back to sleep because the pain was pretty bad. I had previously bought a workout video and had been working out the previous night. I'm very active, I jog, workout with weights, swim and bike in the summer time. Also, my job is very physical as i clean houses five days a week. I always had mechanical sore back for many years, but for some reason i feel like this pain is different. I've seen a chiropractor for two weeks and did the ultrasound, but no result and it actually hurt more after the treatment. I then did physio for a couple of weeks and i was given stretches for my top front left muscle who is pretty stiff, but that didn't work and it hurt more after. I then had a x-ray done and it showed nothing, but maybee my pelvis twisted a bit. I also, had a pelvic/stomach cat scan done in case of internal problems. Now my doctor put me on Naproxen 500mg for inflamation and i also take Tylenol 500mg when the pain gets too bad. I can't do any activities that were mentioned. I still work, but i've cut back on my hours and have already lost a client over this problem. My doctor says that it's probably mechanical, but why is it that i was jogging and working out the night before without any problems and now if i even attempt to do any of these activities it doesn't hurt at the time, but usually does for 2-3 day after. I'm concerned that this problem as been going on for over 2 months and no one can tell me why i have this pain and some inflamation.\n\n",

I'm now scheduled for a bone scan and it scares the heck out of me. Since then I've felt some really weird pains all over my body, It's like pains in my bones everywere, but they only last for a day and then they go. I've now stopped working to see what would happen and the swelling has come down some, but the sacrum still looks kinda swelled up. There's also a gland under my left armpit that is kinda giving a hard time. It swells and hurts, but I know that I've been under alot of stress with all of this so maybee It's part of stress. I'm so scared because my brother in-law passed away 2 summers ago with a big tumour in the sacrum area. Please if anyone can give me a idea what this problem is feel free to answer back...\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, This sounds like a flare up of the mechanical back pain.  Most of the activities you describes are high intensity and you may need to slow down a bit and allow the back to heal while maintaining a certain level of fitness.  For example instead of running, walk.  Ease up on the weight training.  Continue swimming.  And continue stretching.  Ice and moist heat may also help. With time and these measures, you may find some relief.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you very much for your reply, I still worry as this problem as been there for now 3 months. I now stopped taking the muscle relaxant and the anti-inflamatory because they wern't doing much. The swelling came down a bit, but not all of it is gone. I now know that the problem is comming from the sacrum area. My doctor feels that the problem might be from bone and not muscle anymore so last week I had a bone scan and will find out the results later on this week. I'm so scared that this might be cancer now because I was watching the monitor as I was being scanned and noticed that I had a white spot on my spine, one just past my last rib cage and my sacrum was like a white ball. When I got home I then went on the internet to see what that ment and it said that those can be hot spots like cancer. I have less swelling and pain probably because I cut my hours at work in half and do a little walk around the lake everyday and feel that it's not too bad. Also, with the swelling down I can sleep better at night. Please do these symptoms meen anything to you? Besides that I'm very healthy, I eat well and I haven't lost a pound. The only thing I should add to this is that I don't have any recent injuries, but I do have a fractured tailbone from a previous injurie from many years ago.\n\n",

The pain has changed slightly over time. I went to walk in medical on the weekend as the pain was intense. Due to my past history of narcotic abuse I was simply treated as \"there for pain medication\" and told I pulled a muscle. Left with medication I never filled.  Over time it just got worse. I went to my PCP. He suggested I see a Gastro Dr. for and issue I have with swallowing. Food or drink tends to get stuck (not in the throat) and goes down hard (painful). The upper gastro shown three narrow areas which they stretched. It is recommended I return to have the stretching done again.  Also it was suggested I see and ENT about my \"clearing of the throat\" often. Nothing was found.   My PCP had an abdominal Ultra Sound ordered, and blood work. The Ultra sound showed nothing interesting.   However, while the Ultra sound was being done she would go near my ribs it was very uncomfortable, and I mentioned \"I wish you could just turn me over on my side and go up higher and take a look (all under the rib cage). But I already knew she was not allowed.  Under my ribs are where my true discomfort was. Feels like someone put 10 lbs of sand in 5 lb sacks and put them under my ribs.   Ultra sound was fine, bloodwork came back with a small amount of blood (nothing to worry about), and a chest Xray came back with \"spots on lungs\" ... a few weeks later another X-rays showed nothing.  It was then recommended if I have more pain to go to the Emergency Room.   Months later the pain has grown more intense and a bit different. I feel at times almost like something swelling or a strange feeling. Upon that I feel what I call a \"lump in my back (cannot feel or see) and this lump seems to \"contract\". The pain is not radiating, but it is always under and round my entire rib cage. The center of my spine in that area feels like its being pushed on.   The pain again just kept getting worse. Now my hands and arms tingle. My face and lips tingle. My Blood Pressure has been going up and stable at 140's to 160's. I attribute this to pain.   Pain was so intense (it has been at least six months since my last Doctor visit) I decided to go to the Emergency Room. I was seen by a young female Doctor. She approached me and her exact words were \"You know you should not be taking Narcotics for this, right\". I was actually shocked that she would even assume what I do or not do without even meeting me yet?  I knew from that very moment she read my history of opiate abuse and immediately targeted me.  I quickly informed her I did not appreciate her assumptions and that I could care less about her pills and I'm here because I want answers, and I from that moment I flat out refused any pain medication she might give me. I also told her I am honest and I tell Doctors what I'm taking because I fear if they did not know I could be seriously hurt by mixing medications and more. I also know that if I am not honest my medical insurance company can deny my medical bill claims. So, due to my past I am willing and I will carry the label with me, but I will NOT tolerate that type of instant judgment.  She began to take her knuckles and knock on my spine going up and down and she said \"Well it is NOT broken\" (I believe she was annoyed with me from my comment). I said Yes, of course it's not broken but there is something wrong and I just want some answers. She began to press on my upper sides of my back saying oh yeah, yeah I feel that  yes. I said I have no tenderness there, and the pain never went up that far nor radiates up towards that area. I was trying to be specific on the pain, but yes I understand its hard as pain can radiate. In the end I could tell she was being sarcastic with me. My husband also was extremely annoyed and being as patient as he is... he was ready to say something to the Doctor in my defense. I began to cry to explain to her that I am just so very tired of the discomfort, and I just want some answers.   That exact treatment is what kept me at home in pain for so long. I would rather not be treated like that so I hesitate to seek medical help!  I mentioned that I would be so happy to get a CT Scan or a MRI or something far better than the few things that have been done. She made it very clear she finds no reason for any such tests and will only offer a Xray, and a urine test. She said she would give a muscle relaxant. Later a nurse arrived with 10mg of Valium. The medication did help somewhat, but only for a short time. I cannot take Valium everyday and I wont.  The Dr. returned and said she found a very small amount of blood in my urine, but nothing to worry about. She also said that my Xray shows there are no broken bones, and that she will send me home with some medication, and to follow up with my PCP. She never told me, but she did write it down that she diagnosed me with Myofascial strain. Told me that she suffers from chronic back pain, but she lives with it and so should I because we are strong women (with a smile on her face).   Here is where I am at today. I am tired, in more pain, and not getting anywhere. The pain is worse, and I tend to spend most of my days home in pain, and rarely venture out anymore (I work at home). Depression is starting to take over. I have not taken any of the \"medication\" she prescribed (it does help to a point) but I cannot work and juggle my daily life with Valium.   My heart acts up so much more often these days, and I do not know if it is from stress or whatever else. I feel pressure up the sides of my neck, and a dull headache often. My heart beats so hard and fast at times it feels like I have a cold ice pack in my throat! It is a scary feeling. I did not have medical insurance to continue with following up with my Cardio, but yet my husband made to much to get any type of help. I fell out of the loop, and have outstanding bills with them. This is what keeps me from seeing them again.  I've been on a Methadone maintenance program for some years now. I've been an outstanding patient on this program, and was considered to \"mentor\" other patients due to my record. I've not accepted as I have no interest at this time in my life. This program has saved my life, given me back my family, and I am now a productive mother, wife, and citizen. My family is proud and are now so sad to see me in such pain. I've been safe, and productive for over 14 yrs now.  I fear that something serious could be going on or something so simple and easy to treat, but yet it will never happen because I am denied the tests that I feel could help me and my Doctors find the right treatments for me. I am fully aware what the Insurance Companies will allow and what they will not. I also know a Doctor can \"recommend\". I feel I may have said to much to these Doctors as to my symptoms which makes them feel I'm a nutter. However, I was always told write down everything, and tell the Doctors.  This is my plea - my last hope that someone could please give me some ideas on what I can do to help myself. I'm not stupid and I know this is not an official \"Doctors Visit\", but maybe some advice to put me in a more positive direction?  I sit here now in pain, with the heating pad on my back, and holding my breath 98% of the day due to my pain. I was unaware that I was doing this until friends have told me they see me doing this and I actually \"Squeak\" like a mouse at times. I think it all ties together and it is far from funny. I was always so proud of not being sick and beating the flu when everyone else around me had it!  I am only 39 yrs old, and I worked hard to get where I am today. I just want some answers so that I can live a happy - life. Can someone toss me a bone here?\n\n",

    "content": "I would like to add an update.   On the pain scale of 0 - 10, my morning pain is pretty average at a 4.   During and after eating my pain level would rise to 6 and 8.   I decided to try something on the next day. I held off on breakfast and lunch, and planned to eat my dinner at 3pm. I had baked chicken cutlets, pasta, and green beans. While I was eating I could feel that contracting lumpy feeling in my back. The pain scale started to get higher and the flank fullness feeling would drastically increase (this is most uncomfortable)  After eating the pain would rise to an 8, and just stay that way until I would fall asleep. I find sitting up and getting into a comfy position allows me to relax enough to deal with the pain so that I can get sleepy for the evening.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It sounds like the location of the pain is in the mid back and off to one side?  The pain worsens with a deep breath.   Any other symptoms?  Cough, chills, fever.    In other words, there are lots of questions that should be asked before coming to a diagnosis.  I think the best physician to work with is your primary physician.    You may consider a chest and thoracic spine CT scan.    Also, consider something straightforward as pleurisy which can cause pain which increases with deep breathing.  Again, your family physician can coordinate your care plan.  All the best to you.\n\n",

    "content": "The pain is more of a pressure. The best I can explain this is to be a fullness, almost like someone put a football between my stomach and my spine. I can feel it contract at times. Sometimes the pain/pressure is so intense I can't bare it. I found when I eat the pain starts to get worse.   No, no real cough, no chills, no fever. The pain/pressure I complain about on breathing is because my flanks feel so full (stuffed) so I think I tend to hold my breath without me even realizing I'm doing it (due to the fullness feeling)  I truly believe its my stomach. Whatever it is right now feels like it is pressing on my spine. Once in a while I will wake up to this feeling of air in my stomach as if I was about to vomit, but without the nausea. What helps is getting something to drink. However, I did post an update to this post, which most likely has not been updated yet. The post was to explain what happens when I do, and do not eat. The pain/pressure begins to get worse while and after eating.   I'm tired of Doctors saying its a Myofacial Sprain in my back. If it didn't make me look like a nutter I would do tumbles, jumping jacks, and more in front of them to just prove I have full range of motion, and no pain in my muscles with this type of activity.   What I wish would happen is they listen to \"ME\" and I say it is my stomach or gallbladder. However, the ultrasound showed my gallbladder was of normal size. I still feel something could have been missed. Whatever it is ... it has been getting worse over the past two years.   Thank you in advance for taking the time to answer. I do check often to see if there is an update. I'm so eager to at least hear something on this. THANKS!\n\n",

I have had 3 children the last was in 2004. when i was pregnant with my first child, at around 8 months, i slipped on ice and landed on my tailbone. (very painful) I was also in an fender bender at 8 months. with my second child I was in a minor car accident, no injuries, at 8 months. my second child was very hard on my body. the doctors said she dislocated my hips when I was having her. when i got pregnant with my last baby in 2004 the doctor put me on bed rest at 3 months. i have been in a couple of car accidents, one was a roll over in a 1ton flatbed duely.   I have severe pain in my spine most of the time. I can't sleep on my back or my stomach and throughout the night roll from side to side. I can't put my arms above my head I get dizzy and can feel myself blacking out. many times standing or stretching causes me to get dizzy and intense pain in my head. In 2003 i was putting something away in a cabinet above my refrigerator and passed out. My husband at the time described it to me as, all of a sudden i passed out when he tried talking to me he said that i was shaking like cunvulsions and that my eyes were open. I could hear him calling my name but i couldn't move or talk and he sounded really far away. after this episode i became very caustous of holding my arms over my head.  i went to a cyraprater and he told me that all my bones were out of line and that I would need to come in at least once a week.(to exspensive for my budget) I constantly have hip pain and pain in my tailbone(especially when sitting) I have 2-3 discs in my neck that slide out of place. when I pop my back it relieves some of the pain. i can't let any one pop my back. When they get to poping my back between my shoulder blades and up my neck i feel like i'm going to pass out. What could be wrong????\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Certainly there is a lot going on with your spine.   The primary concern is the passing out spells with change in head position and sounds like cervical extension worsens the symptoms. Therefore it is important to xray the c spine to look for any fracture, dislocations, or spondylosis (abnormality of the spine). Also, the integrity of the vertebral artery should be questioned.  A good test to see the structure is MRA (magnetic resonance angiography).  A problem with the vertebral artery (which runs through the cervical spine) can cause some of your symptoms. Given your history of multiple MVA's, it is worthwhile to check.  Secondly, the low back pain may be stemming from the SI joint.  Often this joint in pregnant women becomes shifted out of alignment in pregnant women due to laxity of pelvic ligaments.   A competent orthopedic physical therapist can assess the sacrum and correct any abnormalities.  Thanks for writing in and take care.  Let us know how it goes.\n\n",

From the sagital view, there is a mild disc bulge but should also be compared to the other levels and correlated with clinical symptoms.  If there are no neurological symptoms, then conservative treatment is indicated (hot/cold modalities, activity as tolerated, physical therapy, NSAIDs) otherwise consult with the neurosurgeon.    This is likely a lumbar strain versus a herniated disc causing the low back pain.    Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "A lumbar strain can cause radiating leg pain if there is acute inflammation in the facet joints (small intervertebral joints).    Yes, disc protrusion can cause radiating pain if is touching a nerve.  This should be reported by the radiologist upon MRI review.  If the leg pain continues or worsens despite physical therapy, pain management may be the next step.  They can do spinal injections to alleviate pain and inflammation.   If you back and leg show severe physical deterioration then a trip to the neurosurgeon would be next.    Take care.\n\n",

At the earlier stage the pain was at my lower back  if i walked or sit for a long time.Before some months the pain started  at the upper spine at a particular point and i feel like its effect is radiating to hands too as pain and other difficulties like weakness. And also have pain and the same difficulties with legs also below the knees. When I consulted an orthopedic ,he asked for the x-ray of ribs and lumbar spine. He told like the ribs are crowded not causing any serious problem & there was nothing with spinal x-ray. Also i feel struggle to breath when getting some preasure on the body while massaging or doing physiotherapy. Also feel some difficulties with legs and gasping when climbing the steps.Then am asked for MRI. I havent done it yet. for the last one month i have frequent urination also particularly in night or when am taking rest on bed.I kindly request to help me to know my actual problem.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I am 20 years of age, male. I have an extreme pain in my mid to upper back( thoracic region) up to the area of around my shoulder blades. The pain is on both sides of my thoracic spine region, but it is far far more painful on the left side. It hurts the most when I am twisting my body and also when I am tilting my head downwards towards my chest. This problem has been for 3 years now, but it has flared up bad just recently. Sometimes the pain gets so bad that the area of pain becomes numb. I only get this pain when I am standing, I can sit all day with no pain. I have seen my family doctor about this but all he prescribes is some anti-inflammatory oinment. I have seen a physiotherapist and he has given me stretches and strength training which have been little to no help. I have seen a chiropractor who all he does is crack my back and tells me to come back next week, the relief is only temporary (couple hours). I have had deep tissue massages which gives me relief temporary as well and I have as well have ultrasounds and TENS treatment (Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation). All of these treatments did not really help. Is my only option now to see an orthopedic surgeon and consequently surgery? What do you think is wrong with me? Thanks doctors, and I hope to hear from you soon.\n\n",

It sounds like a musculoskeletal problems in the muscles around the spine or in the joints connecting the ribs to the thoracic vertebrae.

You may also consider pain management who can do corticosteroid injections based on the MRI results.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "I've had back pain ranging from mild to severe for about a decade. My back is susceptible to injury, but my biggest complaint is pain while sleeping. It keeps me awake, and 4 out of 5 mornings I wake up with a stiff back. Sleeping flat on my back is uncomfortable, and sleeping on my side strains my back. The less I sleep, the better. If I take sleeping medication that really knocks me out that is sometimes better. I've tried a few different mattresses, but that didn't help (the one I'm using now is medium-hard).   Further info: I went to a physical therapist a few months ago who showed me how the muscles on the left side of my back are much stronger than those on the right, and how this has been pulling my back out of alignment for years. Although walking helps my back generally, other exercises that I used to do, such as swimming, now seem to only intensify the problem because I rely on the left side muscles. I'm now in the process of trying to reverse this through stretching and exercises, but not having much success.  Thanks much.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I think may be a matter of time as the exercises to balance the back muscle will take 6 weeks bare minimum to lessen the pain.  You may try some liniment and moist heat 20 minutes prior to sleep and perhaps Mobic (an NSAID) at bedtime.  This may get you through until the muscles start to balance out.  I would add some lower extremity stretching.  In general men tend to have tight hip and leg muscles with weak abdominals.  This would be another area to focus on balancing the muscle - stretching the legs and tightening the abdomen.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Kidney pain is lower and is not reproducible with palpation so this must be in the muscles or skeletal areas.  The history of kyphosis may tell us something.  It is possible that the kyphosis is still present or has resumed and causing some pain.  It would be worthwhile having a physician check out the spinal alignment in office and with radiograph.  For pain relief, try NSAIDs and ice or heat.   Specific exercise can be prescribed by a physical therapist.  Take care.\n\n",

I could not lean on my back and i usually carry my backpack on my right shoulder and i was not able to do this because of soreness  after a few more days the pain subsided but did not go away and every few days the pain would get stronger, i still feel soreness every few days, and im wondering what could be the cause.  I amd right handed, play no sports and have not had any surgeries or diagnosed diseases  my ideas are: carrying my backpack/purses only on right side soreness from sleeping on it incorrectly that is taking a long time to go away or a fall that i had several months ago. i had slipped off of a school bus landing on my bottom, the only pain or bruising that i significantly remember was on my bottom and my elbow however i have heard that such falls can cause misalignment and im also wondering if its possible that this is a pain or soreness form that injury that i just hadn't immediatley noticed.  and is  this a pain i should be concerned about?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, You have done an excellent job in assessing your condition.  The fall and the back pack could both cause the pain you are feeling.  This back pain would be termed mechanical or musculoskeletal in origin (versus neurological eg a disc bulge or pinched nerve or arthritic).  So time usually heals these types of back pain but you should wear the back pack over both shoulders to prevent future pain.    In the short term, use ice and NSAIDs for several days.  Moist heat as needed after 72 hours of using ice.    This will also give you some incentive to start a walking or swimming program (general exercise) for overall good spine health - at least 3 days a week.  If the pain continues, see your family physician for an evaluation.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Sciatica can cause shooting pain from the lower back ... so can sacroiliac problems.    You may need an adjustment of the back (chiropractor or osteopath) to re align the bone (either lumbar or sacro iliac joint).  For short term pain relief, use NSAIDs and ice.  After 72 hours switch to heating pad.  Some liniments like Aspercreme (salicylic acid compound) and menthol base ointments mixed together with a heating pad is helpful.  For the long term, maintaining good spine health is important.  This include good body mechanics, low impact aerobics, core strengthening, stretching tight muscles and good nutrition.    Take care and God bless.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The pain near the bra line with difficulty breathing is likely from muscle spasms secondary to the sciatica flare up (right leg symptoms for 2 weeks).  The immediate plan calls for muscle relaxation and pain control with medicine and/or hot and cold packs.  Then it is activity as tolerated and gentle exercise.  If needed physical therapy for a few weeks.  If symptoms worsen despite conservative treatment you may need to see a back specialist (orthopedist or neurologist).  Take care.\n\n",

I don't have any swells or bruises around my rib... so what exactly is disturbing me.  I notice if i don't stay in one spot for long time, and if I don't develop sexual feelings the pain is very mild or is not there at all but still it batters my to feel that mild pain.

    "content": "Hello, I would certainly see if a neurosurgeon - perhaps the same one who did the initial surgery - to review your case.  You have enough symptoms to at least warrant a neurological evaluation including images of the spine and perhaps another EMG.    If there is instability in the spine causing symptoms, surgery is likely the best course but you should discuss your options with the neurosurgeon.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello...I'm not sure that I posting this question in the right spot.  I have undiagnosed issues where I fall often and land hard.  In the last year I believe I've fallen at least 6 times and have messed my back up considerably.  I fell again 2 weeks ago and was experiencing extreme lower back & knee pain (i landed on my eft knee hard & went to muy doctor who gave me medicine.  My back started feeling better, not great, but better in the last 3 days and all of a sudden I started feeling this discomfort in the back of both legs.  It starts mid thigh and goes down to the bottom of my heels and walking feels FAR from good.  Today I also discovered the formation of 5 new bruises, yet I've hit nothing or run into nothing to cause them.  3 are on my upper (back) arm and 2 are in the vacinity of my right ankle and right calf (back).  does this sound like something I should be concerned by?  Thank you so very much.  God's blessings!\n\n",

    "content": "For a month and a half now, my boyfriend has been suffering from SEVERE, stabbing pain, which started after a long drive in the car. It wasn't as painful at first, but has gradually gotten worse over time. It does not go away, and is causing some SERIOUS problems in every aspect!  He began seeing an orthopedic doctor approximately 3 1/2 weeks ago. First, an X-ray was taken--and came back fine. It was another 2 weeks before the doctor finally even prescribed him an MRI, and in between he had to visit the Emergency Room.  He's been diagnosed with 2 ruptured discs (maybe herniated, whichever \"leaks\" the fluids from spine) and the doctor says the liquid is spilling onto a nerve (not the sciatic). In the past 3 1/2 weeks, he's been prescribed 7 or 8 different medications--4 different pain killers, anti-inflamatories and muscle relaxers--and not ONE has worked ... Nor, has the combination of several together.  He hasn't slept for more than 2-3 hours a night in about 2 weeks, now. It hurts him to sit, stand, or lay down. The pain--which is in his right \"cheek\", not his back--has now shot down his entire leg, to the heel of his foot. He says his whole leg is numb to the touch, but that he CAN feel the pain. His bowel movements have slowed to about once a week and his urinations have become hard to control.  The doctor--a real !@$#%^&%, if you ask me--has now told him he needs Physical Therapy. HOW WILL THIS HELP A MAN WHO IS IN EXCRUTIATING PAIN EVERYTIME HE MOVES??? Can someone please explain this to me??? My boyfriend was in the army for 12 years and has broken more bones in his body than humanly possible ... He's no wuss when it comes to pain, so I know this is serious. He says 'the doctor knows what he's talking about', but I keep insisting he get a second opinion. (MEN!) If Physical Therapy IS the answer, how long will it take him to stop hurting? Is surgery safe? Are there faster methods that aren't very risky? Someone please help ...\n\n",

The rate that my ribs pop out I am constantly in pain and needing to visit the chiropractor, however I don't want to put a bandaid on the issue, since it keeps happening. I'm wondering as well if there is a surgery or procedure that will pin or screw my ribs in place. I have a one year old who is  only going to grow and become more of a handful.

    "content": "Hello, The costochondritis may be related to rib dislocation.  In other words, a dislocating rib may aggravate the anterior attachment of the rib.  Ribs which pop out of place tend to reoccur and can be difficult to keep in place.  Chiropractors or osteopaths can relocate and may need multiple visits as needed to relocate the rib.  The lumbar discs do not affect the rib dislocation directly.  Besides the chiropractor work, a general exercise program will be helpful including upper body i.e. anterior and posterior chest conditioning.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Anytime a bulging disc is seen on MRI the radiologist will report the severity (mild, moderate, severe) and whether or not the bulging is pressing on a nerve root or the spinal cord.    Bulging discs along the entire spine is unusual.  More typical is bulging disc in the cervical and lumbar spine.  The first step is to consider the severity of the bulging disc and whether they are causing the symptoms.   Most of the time, physical therapy and pain management is attempted before surgery.  And your family physician can coordinate your care.  All the best to you.\n\n",

I was tired and sleep-deprived so I stupidly decided to sit down with my upper weight on that thin pole, thinking it would be just uncomfortable. Instead, when I put my weight on that thin pole, a pain shot through my back and my reflexes allowed me to get off the chair. My middle and lower back was aching throughout the day.

In 2004 I had an MRI that showed my ACDF failed.The doc wanted to perform 2 levels but I declined. Also I was DX'd with an enlarged left ventrical after I told my internist that my heart skipped beats. 3 tests showed ELV 50%.  So,the last several days I have awakened with severe dizziness to the point of falling into walls when I first get out of bed.Also my hands are both asleep. I always sleep on my side but have awakened on my back and that is when I feel dizzy. This morning it was so bad that I could not go out to feed my horses for fear of falling.I had to sit for almost 2 hours. This afternoon I took a nap and awoke dizzy? Also I get intermitent pain radiating on my left shoulder and jaw so I don't know if it is my heart or my neck? Double edge sword. For years when I sit and bend over to tie my shoes I hear the blood swooshing in my neck. A cT showed a smaller vetebral hole on the left so that could explaine the blood swoosh? The dizziness has me scared now since I never had this sensation before when laying down. I did suffer a car accident last Dec. and totaled my car and was taken by ambulance to the hosp. and they CT'd my whole body.They said no fractures but to seek a doctor if worse. I have not been checked since. I only get my pain pills from my internist once a month. I take Vicodin ES 4 times daily and Soma 350 1 to 2 times a day. Also 2 Anicin daily. I have been on these meds since 2000.Please if you can explain the sudden dizziness I would be very appreciative. I am 60 yrs old,5\"7\",123 lbs.Spirit\n\n",

    "content": "I am 33 years old an am having an issue with some neuropathy. This is how it started. I began a new job in July of 2008 and it requires sitting for 10 hours on a daily basis. Anyway my butt muscles seemed to get really sore and hurt to the point of not being able sit long. I would fidget about trying to get comfortable. I just thought it would go away. After about 2 months of this i noticed that I was getting a creepy crawling sensation in my calf I had what felt like pin pricks around my knees. It seems to be worse on my right side and it hurt to sit on that side. So I adjusted sides. I began to sit on my left side. This too began to bother me in the same way that the right side did. Anyway after a little while I noticed that I was having this burning sensation in both buttocks and it goes down to the top of my thigh. the sides of my legs have this burning sensation to them and my skin feels hypersensative. I also have the burning in my calves and within the last few weeks I have been experiencing tingling and burning in my toes. It feels better when standing up almost to the point of being not existent. I cannot ride a bike or an exercise bike because of the excruciating pain and burning when sitting. When I stretching it feels ok when stretching but as soon as I let my leg go I feel a tingling sensation that runs down the back of my leg. I also notice that when I take a shower the tingling is there as well. I am at the point now that when I sit I literally cannot sit. I burns so bad that my legs feel like they are on fire. After a 40 hour work week it is insane! Over the weekend however I do notice an improvement since I am not sitting down as much. I am taking lyrica but that is doing absolutely nothing. The neurologist thinks it is small nerve disease but I am thinking this is a bunch of bunk. This has been a very progressive thing starting last July. Icing it helps out a lot and stretching the piriformis muscle hurts to stretch on either side.   Also during all this time my upper back now tingles and spreads into my arms. The left arm is the worse. I believe that it is probably pinched up there with me trying to get comfortable when sitting. I tend to lean to the left side the most.   Any suggestions? I go the neurologist this week and am taking some info on the piriformis syndrome. I have almost exactly what I am reading and know that if I can get the pain in my buttocks to go away everything will start feeling better. The more I sit the worse the supposed \"neuropathy\" in my legs get.  Joester\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Joester, Yes, it certainly sounds like piriformis syndrome.    Treatment is conservative: hot and cold modalities to relieve pain and inflammation, stretching and strengthening, and NSAIDS.  During the work day, standing every 30-45 minutes for trunk extension stretching and standing piriformis stretch is important.    The goal during work is to get as much blood supply to the buttock area throughout the day.  With prolonged pressure, from sitting, the area needs blood and oxygen - for healing and for preventing further pain.  Exercise is the way to go.  If needed, see a physical therapist for detailed instructions and rehab.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I would need to know more about what the MRI shows.  Apparently there is a stable degeneration in the spine to warrant the suggestion of a discectomy.  Discectomy aims at relieving pain down the leg but does not guarantee reduced back pain.  Again, the prognosis is dependent on the extent of damage, general health, etc.  Some experts propose a regular walking program.  For those with spinal stenosis, this is limited but for others it is the ticket to a better back.    Discussing all the options with the neurosurgeon is helpful including expectation of pain management.   Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I am scheduled to have a Cervical Spine injection tomorrow, under anesthesia, but yesterday I broke out with a cold sore.  I already know of the risks of a receiving a spinal injection during a skin infection such as a boil, and the potential danger of transferring the infection into the spinal cord (meningitis).  By tomorrow morning, I have to make a decision about whether it's safe to go forward with the injection while I have an active herpes simplex infection with a blister on my lip.  I did consult both my doctor and my pharmacist, and was told it is safe to start my Acyclovir 800mg twice a day, which I did as of yesterday afternoon.  I realize that the rest of my life could be affected if I make the wrong decision. I am very grateful for your assistance.  ~StillStanding\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I am not sure what is causing the pain in the spine.  It seems somewhat confusing what the physician told you - one of the discs is missing while there is a growth between two of the vertebrae --however no recommendation was made.  There needs to be more information gleaned from your test results and from the history and physical exam to make an accurate diagnosis.  I would recommend discussing in detail with your physician the results of the imaging and your treatment options.  Also important to talk about pain control measures.  Take care.\n\n",

The deteriation may be from the vertebral levels above and below the defect working overtime to compensate for loss of a vertebrae.  It sounds like you are getting matters settled with appropriate testing and surgical consideration.  Once a consult with a neurosurgeon is done, you should have a better idea of the pros and cons of operative treatment.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  I agree this sounds like a complete coincidence, as  there is little to nothing that would conncect the disc deneration and the staph infections. The lower back problem didn't happen overnight, although it doesn't become apparent until it reaches a certain critical point. People often say \"I never had this before\", and all one can say in response to that is \"You have it now.\" Most such conditions, especially degenerative ones, do take a long time to develop, while a staph infection can literally develop overnight.   The staph infection of course will need not only to be treated, but there will have to be some effort to determine how your husband has managed to catch this twice, or at least have it recur (it may not have been  fully eradicated the first time).   The lower back problem will require very different therapy, and may well require surgery. While it's fairly unusual for someone so young to have such advanced disk disease, it is a defined, distinct medical entity, and it does happen. Hopefully this will be managed with minimal problem, and he will be back to full functionality quickly. The staph infection will have to be cleared up first, of course.  I hope this is helpful to you. Good  luck to your husband. Please keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "I hope I can explain this to you better than I understand it.. I am only 29 and never had back problems. I got up one morning mid- January and my back hurt bad, thought I slept wrong. By that evening I was in tears. I finally gave up trying to sleep, I had taken the 800 MG of motrin plus the 1000 Mg of tylenol that you can take at a time. SO I had all the pain medicine I could take and still hurt so bad I couldn't stand it.  Next day went to chiropractor at 2:30.  I couldn't eat or drink anything I was in so much pain so I hadn't eaten since lunch the day before. he has me do these tests. Stand up bend this way and that way, then go in for X-Ray and some other tests I had never had done. Never had been to a chiropractor before.He tells me that I have 5 herniated disks, yeah 5!  He says it will take a few visits to fix it. hooks me up to a tens unit, then adjusts my back.  Now I am having to walk out of his office on my tip toes because I can't put my feet flat, barely able to move my feet. I finally get to the jeep and sit down and it hit me. Spasms so fierce I could not move! He went in and told hubby I needed something for pain and the doctor said no pain meds. we didn't make it 3 minutes down the road before hubby was calling 911. they got there and called another ambulance to help. They had to use the seat to get me out because I couldn't move! So after morphine and getting the seat ready they got me in the ambulance.THey wouldn't even try to move me without something for pain.The man in the ambulance gave me morphine a couple of times before we got to the hospital to keep from from screaming in pain. I was scared to take it at first but hurt so bad I couldn't say no.The hospital was packed and my pain meds wore off, so back to screaming.They finally bring me more pain meds, carry me for tests. At 11 that eveningI am in ER hallway because there are no rooms left. Doctor shows up, they had to call in a specialist, he okays me eating thank goodness. They get me in a room, in the kiddy ward beacause they didn't have another room open! Not that I knew. After eating I was out. My husband sat beside me the whole time pushing my morphine button so I wouldn't wake up in misery. The few times I woke up I do not remember. I did get up after about a week, couldn't eat since I went without for a week. So they had my specialist come in to talk to me. I had to eat, they would bring me whatever I wanted as long as they had it in the hospital all I had to do was ask for it. He tells me I have MRSA the staph infection. It was on the inside not the outside. It caused another infection, then an infection in my heart, and to top it off I had menegitis. After all the meds I had a type of anemia where my blood stops making hemoglobins so I had to have a transfusion as well.  So i was in the kiddy ward a little over a week, then moved to the heart ward for the rest of my stay which was almost a month. Then I got to go home. I was still on IV for about 2 months,then I get more news. the infection ate at some things in my back and has caused something to seperate causing it pain. That last part I have yet to figure out, been trying but not getting anywhere. Am still seeing doctors for it. So I do think MRSA can cause lots of damage, they told me when an infection is that bad it can eat away your bones and ligament.\n\n",

He spent a month in the hosp. and re-hab. He came home and was walking with the aid of a walker.He also had bed sores on both heels and low back from the hosp. Then one day he couldn't walk anymore and his sores would not heal. He also had diabetis so the docs said it was diabetic sores. Well,after tests he was dx'd with MRSA. He was given a pick line and I gave him dailyI V's of Vancomycin. He would screem in pain that his back hurt so he was put on the Fentynal patch. Then he went septic...twice. Rushed to the hosp. then sent home. Finally,his veins collasped and he needed a line in his neck so he went to a skilled nursing home. He passed May,21,07.:( He had too many medical problems and the MRSA won. Please don't take it lightly,I believe it does cause back pain as he was in agony. I do hope you get better.

    "title": "Neck compression due to bike crash",
    "content": "Hello,   On Sunday (two days ago as I write this), I entered a mountain bike race and crashed. The crash sent me over the handle bars and skidding along the ground until a tree stopped me. Luckily (?), most of my forward motion was spent sliding on the ground, with the result of some superficial scrapes that I am not worried about. However, I did ultimately slide head first into a tree. I was wearing a helmet, so I have no head injuries, per se. But I think I have what would be called a 'compression neck injury'. Adrenaline and false pride enabled me to finish the race (I didn't win). Shortly after the race, my neck started to become sore.   My treatment thus far has included: ibuprofen, marijuana and stretching (within hours of the crash), and a massage (the day after), as well as generally taking it easy.  The massage therapist said she did not find any unusual muscle disfigurations, which makes me worry that something occurred on a skeletal level. The pain is not severe, but there is considerable discomfort particularly when I turn my neck the left.  Thanks for your time and expertise!  Sincerely,  \"Bike Crasher\"\n\n",

    "content": "I have had problems with my left leg and especially hip area for the last 3-4 years along with back problems. I have extreme pain when trying to stretch my left leg completely out while sitting or trying to bend over with my feet close together. I am overweight and know this is the main cause. About 2 weeks ago I started having back pain. It got progressively worse and then became extruciating to try to walk, sit, or lay in certain positions. I had severe pain radiating down left leg all the way to my ankle/toes. I went to the doctor and was told that I am having Sciatica pain due to a pinched nerve. My doctor prescribed me anti-inflammatory drugs and muscle relaxers. It has been a few days now and I am able to walk, sit, and stand much better and my back pain is nearly gone. The only problem now is while walking, sitting, or standing my left leg goes numb with sharp to minor pain every once in awhile and no matter what position I lay in, my left leg has extreme pain and muscle spams and I am having a lot of difficulty sleeping. Is this normal and is there anything I can do to help it?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Sciatic nerve pain because of pinched nerve",
    "content": "Hello, Your description of pain and numbness down the leg is classic for sciatic nerve impingement.  The question becomes where and how is the nerve being pinched.  In the buttock, where the sciatic nerve exits the pelvis, it may be compressed by a muscle called the piriformis - piriformis syndrome. In the back itself, nerve roots (which make up the sciatic nerve) may be pinched by a bulging disc or bony spur.   An MRI of the spine may help rule out any central source of sciatic nerve impingement. It is important to treat the cause of sciatica since nerve damage can cause leg weakness, muscle twitching, loss of sensation and pain.  Take care and let us know how things turn out.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Back surgery is major surgery.  If there is spondylysis (fracture in the pedicles of the vertebrae) without anterior slippage then conservative treatment may be the way to go.  Rehab for the disc protrusion is tricky since you do not want to cause the vertebra to slip forward (spondylolythesis) causing instability, pain and potentially worsen the neurological symptoms.    I would talk to the neurosurgeon to see what conservative treatments can be done and if surgery can wait.   All the best to you.\n\n",

    "content": "I know this can be a slippery slope. I have a bulging disc pinching the nerve at L5-S1.  I have been in agony the past 3 weeks.  I had a lumbar epidural injection today, but the pain management doctor said the results of the injection would take 3-12 days.  I stretch each time I cannot tolerate sitting or walking, this is about 4-6 times daily.  I use lidoderm patches to get me through work...a desk job.  I was given Darvon by my primary care doctor. My expectation of \"pain management\" is to take my 8-9 pain down to a 3-4 and tolerable.  I understand some pain will help remind me not to move in ways that may further injure me.  The pain management doctor gave me Parafon Forte and said it would help more than the Darvon.  Thusfar, it has not and I'm still in agony.  I don't act out, or scream and cry.  I'm very normal, but I'm in extreme pain, I've always had a high tolerance to pain.  I'm wearing thin and I just don't know what to do until the effects of the injection begin to work.  I'm frustrated and tired, this interferes with my sleep now and I suspect this is part of the problem.  I need to know how to ask the doctor for something. I know it is short term.  I'm familiar with long-term pain management for cancer patients.  I'm stumped.  I'm not trying to be difficult, but I'm tired of this.  I really could use a break.\n\n",

    "content": "I saw the neurosurgeon today. He gave me Soma.  It did about as well as the other stuff I've been taking.  I think where it helped the most is I was less \"stiff\", but pain is still an issue.  The disc in my L4-L5 is ruptured, before it was on the right...now the left.  I have been scheduled for a microdiscectomy (my 2nd...the first being last year).  The pharmacist asked me what I was taking for pain, when I told her 'this' (Soma), she was pretty shocked.  She said it is a muscle relaxer with a mild (at best) analgesic effect.  She thought I was taking it in conjunction with something else.  Soon, I'll be in post-surgical pain.  I've done that, it is better than this even feeling like I've been hit in the back with a sledgehammer right after surgery.  He did say if I have problems with my back again, I'll need spinal fusion.  It sounds like this may be what they are talking about for you.  He said I may need the procedure in 5-10 years...basically if the disk ruptures again, it is fusion time.\n\n",

Do some other types of exercises (swimming, walking, stretching, push ups, squats, lunges) and see how it feels.  If it reduces then it is probably your routine.    Consulting an athletic trainer may help with your program as your technique or intensity may need some tweaking.  Take care.\n\n",

If the spinal cord were being compressed in the cervical region, you may also complain of imbalance; plus the imaging should show any stenosis.  There is no diabetes.  My next step may be to get an EMG or NCV of the lowing limbs.  RSD seems unlikely since there is no trauma to the symptomatic limb.  Take care and let us know how it goes.\n\n",

The stiffness especially if worse in the morning may be due to arthritis.  The mild disc bulge is not too concerning unless associated with neurological symptoms.    Conservative treatment is the best way to go unless the symptoms are overwhelming and progressive.  Unless, there is a specific neurological or bony abnormality, I would treat this as mechanical neck pain with some arthritis.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I was diagnosed with a T9 compression fracture almost 2 years ago, caused by blunt trauma to my back (it was an accident).  I am a 48 y/o female, who has recently been diagnosed with osteoporosis and am currently on the 2 year tx of  Forteo as well as D2 and Calicum.  The one thing I've noticed though, is that I have a numbness to my left upper back to mid lumbar region (not all the time, but when I move a certain way, such as leaning forward while cooking over the stove), I know that the long muscle that supports the upper back was severely injured (possibly torn, since there was a large lump there).  I'm wondering if this muscle can still be causing spasms from the accident almost 2 years ago, or possibly can a small bone fragment be aggravating a small nerve that shoots out from under T9 (intercostal nerve?).  The spinal cord is fine and has no injury there.  I did have an MRI only of the thoracic region, it was done without contrast and showed a 50% compression.  Do you think that with contrast it would show exactly what happened to the nerves from T9?  I've been to see one neurologist and he suggested an MRI wth contrast if the numbness did not improve.  I saw an orthopedist the other day and he gave me a script for PT 3x's a week, and hot/cold compressed for strained muscles.  Which of these sounds more feasible?  Should I see another orthopedic physician?\n\n",

It is possible to have spasm in the back two years post accident and certainly could result from torn paraspinal muscles.  The compression fracture can also elicit spasm.    P.T. sounds reasonable at this point to control pain and spasm and restore function.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, If the spine hurts until you pop it may mean the spine is mal-aligned at the intervertebral level.  Chiropractors specialize in re-aligning the spine however you should add spine stabilizing exercises after any adjustment.  Chronic laxity of vertebral joint that slip in and out of place puts you at increased risk of arthritis in the spine due to shear forces on the facet joints.  Therefore, diligence with stabilization exercises is important.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, A lump which is hard and doesn't move should be evaluated by a physician.  It is seems to be in the skin, then an excisional biopsy may be needed.    If it seems deeper than the skin, then imaging the area with x-ray or CT scan would be needed.  Without examining the area it is difficult to give a diagnosis therefore it is important to see a physician.    Indeed a hard immobile nodule is more concerning than a soft mobile lesion.  Take care and let us know how it goes.\n\n",

    "content": "I had surgery on my back in 11/2006. For the first year my back was fine not much of problems besides at cold weather time. Now towards winter my back is acting up. I noticed a change. My left nerve in my leg hurts. Starts at the just above my surgery site. If I lift anything it hurts. Bending over hurts. I have pain going down my left leg. I am also getting weakness in my left leg. That is intermittant. I believe it is my siactic nerve that is giving me the problem. I can sit down but I can not straighten my left leg out straight. It hurts from my upper buttocks area down my leg. He has said that the nerve is damaged from the buldging disc there previously. He has no idea when or if it will heal.   I have had cuddle injections (ESI). Is there a difference between a nerve block and this ESI?   I have had a few for the past 2 years. They seem to only work for 2 weeks or less then I am back to the way I was. The last one did not do anything to it. I have a tens unit. Cold compress only works on my back. It is only temp. I work in a sit down job. My back seriously does not like the chairs. You can bounce a coin off of them. And catch it.   I am at a lost. They put me on different meds. Either makes me gain wieght either that it makes me not want to sleep. They just put me on lamectal and over the week. I increased my dosage as per scribed. Then I started to get headaches. The headaches made me feel like I had to vomit which does not help my spasms in my back. That lasted for 2 days. It was not even a migraine. Those are different feelings in my head. I sweat in places I normaly don't.   I honestly feel that my dr has given up and does not know what to do anymore. He is a pain mangement dr. I am seriously thinking about changing drs since I am getting that vibe. I did express myself to him that I am frustrated. I feel like I need to give up. Seems like there is no light at the end of the tunnel for my pain and it may be something I need to deal with the for the rest of my life which is my nerve pain.   I am seriously thinking about getting a second opinon to find out weather if there is something someone can do or something that they might feel that is going to be good alternative. Like I said I am at a lost right now and not sure what I should do.   Thanks, wpfk4life\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Thanks for writing in.  You have reported a history of LBP with surgery in 2006.  The back has been doing well up until this winter when the sciatic nerve is bothersome.  The pain starts in the back and radiates down the leg.  Worse with sitting and bending.  Pain management has been marginally effective.   I agree that this is sciatic nerve involvement.  The question becomes where or how is the sciatic nerve being affected.  Therefore an MRI would help reveal any disc bulges or intervertebral foraminal stenosis - both can cause sciatica.  If a disc is bulging and pinching the nerve, then injections probably would not help - it really depends on the placement accuracy of the injecting needle.  Once the MRI results come back, then the next decision can be made: conservative treatment vs surgery.  All the best to you.  Keep us posted and take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I just wanted to add a few things. You say that the chairs at work are very uncomfortable. There is something you can do about that. According to the law that covers people with disabilities, the ADA, your work place needs to provide you with a comfortable chair. Under the EEOC ADA Title I ACT (1992) an employer who has over 25 employees is covered under the act and they must provide \"reasonable accomodation\" as long as it causes no undue hardship on the company.  Under the ADA law reasonable accomodation may include \"acquisition or modification of equipment or devices\". Buying you a chair that is comfortable and ergonomically correct, as in it fits your body and provides support while you work work is not considered an undue hardship. this website has info on the ADA law.  http://www.dol.gov/odep/archives/adahea ... tm#general  I agree that you need another MRI as you may have excessive scar tissue that is now causing the same sort of symptoms as a disc herniation.  It is not uncommon to have an excess of scar tissue cause compression or pressure on the sciatic nerve. Another test to consider would be a Nerve Conduction Study of your legs which would tell your doctors which of your nerve roots is irritated and causing the flare up on the sciatic nerve.   There are additional treatments available and I would definitely see about another doctor if you are not satisfied that your doctor is trying to solve your problem.   Let me know what  your work says when you ask about a new chair. Please let them know that it is an ADA requirement. They are not allowed to retaliate against you in any way for requesting the accomodation of a better chair.   Thanks, Kim\n\n",

    "title": "Diffuse Idiopathic Skeltal Hypertosis (DISH)",
    "content": "Hi, first let me apologize for being a internet researcher. I was diagnosed with PCOS back in 1991 by a military doctor in Europe and when I came back to the United States I found out that not many doctors even believed in this condition or knew about it, let alone treat for it. So I was without treatment and had to do my own research and teach a willing to learn doctor about it 10 years after being diagnosed. Ever since then I have kept researching PCOS (PCOD) to keep up to date on the many, many symptoms and correlated conditions, one of which I have discovered but not yet confirmed scientifically my latest condition DISH. Allow me to explain. I did some research on DISH and found out that statistics show that males over the age of 50 are the norm to get DISH and less than 5% of females over the age of 60 get this condition. As my research of PCOS, the statistics showed that kidney stones are also the norm of males over the age of 50 but I got them in my late 20's. I figured that it has to do with the Endocrine system of my body that is irregular due to my PCOS which the reason why I have so many symptoms and correlated conditions of an older male and female. (Diabetes, kidney stones, hirustism, early menapause, and so on.)  In 2006 I had a auto accident and in my radiology report it was noted that I had Diffuse Idiopathic Skeltal Hypertoisis in my neck all the way down to L-5. I had a lot of pain in my lower back and my neck was very sore and stiff. I went to Physical Therapy until the PIP Insurance ran out and it helped a little but got worse after stopping the therapy (no health insurance to continue). My medical treatment is by a volunteer clinic which is wonderful to have but limited in what they can do.   In 2008 I had another auto accident and the radiology report says; Extensive ossification of the anterior longitudinal ligament and  to a lesser extent, the posterior longitudinal ligament as well as the posterior ligamentous complex of the atlantoaxial joint. There is straightening of the cervical curvature. There may be disc degeneration in the lower cervical spine not seen due to body habitus.  Mineralization/ossification of the anterior longitudinal ligament is seen in the lower thoracic and mid to lower lumbar spine. Facet osteoarthritis is seen at L5 - S1, moderate in degree. Symmetric degenerative changes of the SI joints are noted.  So this time since the Physical therapy didn't really help a whole lot, I thought I would try a Chiropractor. I felt worse when I left the chiropractor then when I went in so I quit going.   My question is what is the best/current treatment for this condition? I am currently getting anti-imflamatory meds for the pain and a muscle relaxer for the stiffness. But these are not helping me get better. My mobility is limited and getting worse as the months pass. I am unable to stand for any length of time past 15 minutes let alone walking (which I know would be good to help with mobility), my upper back and neck seem frozen when trying to reach up, down, sideways or even around my own body. So I am asking what can I do? Should I see a specialist and if so what kind?   Sincerely,\n\n",

I would try to maintain range of motion in the spine with gentle regular exercise.  The pool would be a good place to do a spine exercise program.  Heat modalities should also help.    Massage may also help with any muscular tension or spasm secondary to the spine pain.    In sum, gentle, easy and consistent exercise is the way to go.  I would not recommend chiropractor work.  Take care.\n\n",

Discuss the results with your neurosurgeon who can give you the risks and benefits of another surgery.  In general, lumbar surgery tries to eliminate leg symptoms but can not guarantee no more localized back pain.    Take care.\n\n",

    "title": "MRI shows nothing on my back pain",
    "content": "I have been experiencing back pain for around 10months. The pain often occurs around the lower back and when it gets very bad I may feel pain at the middle part of my back too. It will always happen when I stand, stood, bend slightly forward for too long, running, jumping and carrying heavy loads or exerting strength. I will feel the pain when I do any of these and the pain will cause my back to feel VERY VERY weak that I will want to immediately sit down to rest my back. Sitting down only help a bit. I need to totally lean my back against a wall or something to allow it totally rested. And the pain often continues and causes me to not able to sleep well during night.  I have seen a specialist regarding this issue and did a MRI scan on my lumbar spine. The MRI report was: ----- Sagittal T2, T1 Flair images of the lumbosacral spine with axial T1, T2 weighted from L4 to S1 were accquired. Reference made from C2 with superficial marker placed at the level of T11/12.  Conus medullaris terminates at the lower border of L1. No focal abnormalities are seen in cauda equina. There is preservation of lumbar lordosis, intervertebal disc height and morphology of the vertebral body.  There is mild loss of posterior concavity of the disc at L4/5 and L5/S1 though there is no disc protrusion demonstrated. The lateral recess and exit foramina are not compromised.  MRI shows no evidence of degenerative disc disease in the lumbosacral spine. -----  Apparently, the doctor told me that the MRI shows no problem and has no idea about the pain that I am having. I have been going through physiotherapy for the past few months but the improvements are mediocre. As I am a sailor, my job requires me to use a lot of strength which often hurt my back very much.  Now that I go back to the specialist doctor, he would often just tell me the MRI scan on my lumbar spine is fine and there is nothing to worry. But I am still feeling the terrible ache.  What other possibilities could my symptoms tell? And what could be the next thing I could request the doctor to do for me apart from telling me everything is fine and taking pain killer all the time.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The MRI looks good however the back is not improving with physiotherapy to the degree expected.   The diagnosis at this point is chronic low back pain probable mechanical in nature.  Treatment is conservative: physical therapy, NSAIDS, and activity as tolerated.  In order to work, you may need a lumbar brace in addition to the physical therapy treatment.  Another options is Tens unit - to use at night to help with sleep - your job may not allow the use of a Tens unit while on ship???  Sometime an injection in the lumbar facet joint(s) helps.  This can be arranged through your family physician.  Take care and let us know how it goes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Mild disc space narrowing by itself is not an alarming finding.  Many healthy painfree people may have disc space narrowing in the spine.  Part of this may be the time of day, week or month.  The disc heights change with levels of hydration in the disc.    Now, pathology may also cause disc space narrowing. e.g. a disc herniation may result in narrowing of the disc space.  If the pain is localized to the back and causing no neurological symptoms (numbness, tingling, burning radiating pain into the leg) then treating the pain with hot/cold packs and NSAIDS for a week is reasonable.  If symptoms worsen or neuro symptoms start, doing an MRI may help determine if the disc space narrowing is causing the symptoms.  In any case, see your family physician for a clinical exam and any needed further testing.   Take care and keep us posted.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, With pinched nerves in the neck, a sign of improvement is the centralization of symptoms.  Therefore, the fact that the thumb numbness has gone away and none just neck pain is a sign of improvement. The prognosis of the pinched nerve depends on the cause of it.  A severe disc protrusion causing nerve impingement is different than nerve inflammation verses a bony spur in the neck pinching the nerve. An MRI should be able to show the cause of the pinched nerve. For the neck, some physical therapy may help including a home exercise program.  Cervical traction may help with the neck pain too. Take care and let us know how it goes.\n\n",

    "content": "For the past 3 months, my hands, arms, legs, and feet have been falling asleep for what seems like no apparent reason. Usually, the limbs are either only mildly constricted, or not constricted at all when this happens. The sensation is that of pins and needles, numbness, and severe discomfort upon attempting to move the limb. A few days ago, I got out of bed and stood up, only to immediately collapse because my right leg was completely numb. I saw my doctor about these issues, and he said he couldn't detect any circulation problems, and then diagnosed me with carpal tunnel in my wrists. However, my hands are definitely not the only problem -- as I said, my arms, legs, and feet have been falling asleep and experiencing numbness too. Sometimes I even wake up feeling the back of my neck and part of the back of my head have fallen asleep too.  In 1994 I had an upper spinal fusion to correct Kyphosis. I haven't had an problems or complications from the surgery aside from soreness and muscle pain. I am wondering if the problems I'm having with my limbs could be related to the fusion. Thanks so much for your help.\n\n",

Of course all of this would be considered and ordered through your family physician not to mention a thorough history and physical exam.  Take care.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Clumped nerve roots / Always arachnoiditis?",
    "content": "Hello, Many of the MRI findings listed as mild are not too alarming and may/may not be contributing to the left leg calf pulling and muscle cramping.  For example, conditions like stenosis certainly can cause these symptoms however many people with stenosis are asymptomatic.  The arachnoiditis can be associated with scar tissue development as the result of the laminectomy. Infection in which case a CBC and constitutional symptoms should be evaluated is also a consideration.  Yes arachnoiditis can present with neurological symptoms (similar to what you desecribed) since the inflammation is located in the sheath housing the spinal cord.   Has there been a consideration that the arachnoiditis could be a early re development of schwannoma?  To assess the peripheral nerves in the legs an EMG and NCV may be helpful.  This may help determine if the problem is caused by the nerve tissue or by facet arthritis which may also cause these symptoms.   Take care and let us know how it goes.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 29 y/o male 5' 11\" 196 lbs. I have had two lower back surgeries. First surgery was just a lower fusion of L4-5 in 1989. Second surgery (2005) was a full laminectomy, bilateral decompression of the L5 and S1 nerve roots, instrument fusion L5 and S1 using 4565 screws, transforaminal interbody fusion completing 360 degree fusion through the same posterior infusion, posterior lateral fusion using DVX allograft and local bone. Coming around to 2008 I have had alot of back pain and severe leg pain. I have gone through all types of PT, NSAIDS, at home treatment therapy. The pain continued to become worse where it would take me 20-30 minutes to move in the mornings and get out of bed. Now going through pain managment 7 months to date. Ended up having a Medtronics spinal stimulator permanently implanted, after all other types of injections/nerve blocks etc. were performed and no relief was sustained. The implant worked great on my back pain and although did not take away 100% of the back pain it has made daily life more manageable.  I am now on 10/325 Percosets 6 a day. And 30mg of oral morphine 3 times a day. As of now that makes things manageable. The leg pain is affecting my work and home life gradually.  I have had nerve conduction studies done all came back fine. CT's came back fine. I don't feel normal 7 out of 10 days. My leg pain still continues to get worse ( a feeling of dead weight with occasional numbness/tingling with no diagnosis and increasingly becoming more opioid tolerant to my meds. My feet stay ice cold and almost purple alot. Also had a CT recently and nothing showed up. My eating habits change all the time. Bowels are never regulated sometimes I go once a day most days it 3-4 times a day. Have a feeling of fatigue, joint pain in my knees. I get stomach cramps mild chest pain on occasion. Climbing stairs is the worst. I am now starting to have uncontroled muscle twitching in my left arm and leg. My legs feel like dead weight and that they are going to explode. Any suggestions or comments on what might else that I should look into as to what else might be causing my leg pain so I can begin to feeling normal again and being able to get off narcotics completely if I can feel normal without having to take anything anymore.  Thanks for taking the time to read this A~\n\n",

She cannot have an MRI due to a cardiac pacemaker (put in because of the golf course fall) but a CT scan and myelogram showed she has spinal stenosis, degerative changes in lumbar area, and generalized arthritis and bone spurs. An emg pointed to L5 the worst area.She has had multiple steriod injection at the spine clinic (I think they were called nerve blocks)the last injection was an epidural last week at a major orthopedic hospital without any relief.  She continues to have left \"butt cheek\" pain  -- severe when she tries to walk -- which radiates around to her groin area.  It does not go down her leg but she does have some numbness in her foot.  I have had her to orthopedic doctor, spine physiatrist (at the spine clinic) and to a neurosurgeon who suggested scrapping the bone spurs, and PT. She does not want to have surgery.   One doctor sends her to another and that one sends her to another and they all send us to her primary who suggests another specialist.  I know they probably look at her age and don't want to do anything but her life went from very active golfer to barely able to even walk in a matter of a few months.   Do you have any suggestions? Thank you for any help you can give me!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Prednisone for sciatic nerve taper",
    "content": "Hello, Recap: unilateral buttock pain after faint/fall on the golf course in an active 82 y.o. female.  Increased pain in buttock with walking.  Some unilateral foot numbness. Pain radiates into the groin. Imaging shows spurs on the spine, spinal stenosis, and general degeneration.  It will be important to xray the hip on the painful side as hip arthritis and pathology can cause buttock pain that wraps around to the groin.  The foot numbness may be from the spurs or stenosis or from arthritis.  I may want to see an EMG done to see if any nerve damage is occurring.    It is also important to palpate the sciatic nerve in the sciatic notch (buttock area) to see if it is inflamed and tender.  Some physical therapy may be enough to relieve her symptoms.   Two doses of 60mg prednisone then stopping is probably safe.  Just watch for nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, weakness, belly pain, change in cognition, and dizziness - these symptoms following abrupt stopping of corticosteroid may indicate adrenal insufficiency.    Take care and let us know how it goes.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: sleeping on the floor good for the spine?",
    "content": "Hello, Sometimes people with neck pain position their neck to relieve pain.  However, if the \"comfort\" position is poor posture, it may start to affect the lower spine i.e. between the shoulder blades or in the shoulders.  So, the solution starts with the neck and seeing if posture, range of motion, muscle strength and flexibility, and any tenderness can be improved or corrected.  Often this helps the shoulders and midback. The floor question is excellent.  Culturally, people who sit on the floor for activities (like meals) have less back pain than those who sit at tables and chairs but floor people may have more hip and knee pain.  This may be a difference say between Orientals and Westerners.   Lying on the floor may help low back pain: usually people lie on their stomachs (prone) and place heating pad on the lumbar spine.  Prone position places the least amount of stress on the lumbar spine. However, if you have neck pain, stomach lying may be painful or harmful.  When you lay your body on the floor facing up (supine), it is important to bend the knees.  This decreases the stress on the low back.  For back exercises, supine is one of the best starting positions.   Hope this helps.  Take care and keep us posted.\n\n",

The open-mouth view on the patient shows a slight discrepancy in the space between the dens and the c1 level masses. The Lateral masses of c1 and c2, however, do align appropriate, and i believe the slight discrepancy of this space relates to a slight degree of rotation and the fact the patient does appear to have a scoliosis of the thoracic spine convex to the right which is in fact significant.  Impression: slight discrepancy of the Atlantodental space is likely related to a slight degree of rotation for the X-ray and the fact that the patient has Thoracic Scoliosis.

    "content": "Hello, You will need an x-ray of the thoracic spine both standing and recumbent to see if there is any scoliosis.  I see where the odontoid (part of C2 vertebrae) is shifted to the left.  You may have been positioned at a shifted angle during x-ray. The concern about the C2 and C1 relationship is a fracture in this area can not only paralyze you but make your diaphram stop working.   So it was determined there is no fracture.   You are left with checking on the thoracic spine for scoliosis which should be done just in case the curvature is severe and needs rehab or bracing.   Take care.\n\n",

    "title": "Lower Lumbar Stenonis (Moderate)+Disc Bulging at L1-L2,to S1",
    "content": "Good Day; I am a 55 year old white female, 5'8\" tall and 195lbs due to medications making me hungry.  I was 217 and had lost 30lbs.  Normal weight has always been around 140-145lbs.  My Father had Cervical Stenosis and Lower Lumbar Stenosis. He was always very private about his health so I do not know much more; he DID have surgery for the lumbar stenosis too late and became paralyzed from the waist down within a year.  Diapers and catheter, bed-ridden.  I too, have been diagnosed with moderate Lower Lumbar Stenosis from L-1 thru S1.  I was first diagnosed over 20 years ago.  Just had an MRI last week and understand that said stenosis of the lower lumbar is still moderate but MRI showed some abnormalities this time.  I do not know all the info, but I do know that for the last 3-4 years I have had to walk with a cane, take a myriad of narcotic meds to try to help with the constant pain and a muscle relaxant (Skelaxin) several times a day for this time period.  I have even tried Methadone, which eleviated the pain, but left me, for lack of a better term \"bumbling idiot\".  Since 1985 (approx) I have had over 5 'trigger point' injections and one epidural injection of steroids, which, as it turns out 'triggered' a manic psychosis for the day of the injection and for several days after. (Was only psychotic for first day.) I will not be having another epidural steriod injection, due to the side effect aforementioned and the procedure was extremely painful, almost intolerable.  If I have another epidural injection of some sort, I will be asked to be given a strong sedative. Further, when I saw my Internal Med Doc last week, I told her of some new symptoms and she diagnosed Fibromyalgia, which I know nothing about, pain, I am familiar with.  I am also plaqued with Bi-Polar Disorder and ADD and this Disorder and the pain dictate my life.  I am no longer in control.  Now, I have just begun to experience numbness in my R buttocks, topically and deep into the muscle.  I was told that I had major issues with both L&R SI joints.  If touched or palpitated these SI areas are again, extremely tender.  Further, the 5 trigger point injections that I had over a period of several years, where given directly into the surrounding tissue.  I have also just found out from said MRI that I have discs bulging in the L1-L2, L3-L4, L5-S1.  My Internal Medicine Doc is referring me to a 'Neuro-Surgeon', I beleive I will go to the same Doc that performed my Gamma Knife Procedure for my mengioma that surrounds the L olfactory groove, which has cause me to loose my sense of smell significantly.  I have many questions and just a few.  I am overwhelmed with this information.  My Father, who had a strong influence over me all of his life, NEVER wanted to have back surgery. Thus I am terrified of the experience.  I have done quite a bit of research that suggests NOT to have surgery too soon, but not to allow nerve damage, which I beleive is occuring in my R buttock.(Wouldn't you know, I would have something wrong with my butt? (humor).  What can you tell me, without having knowledge of the Radiologist Report re my MRI that might be of good news?  I live alone and I haven't been able to stand long enough to cook, do laundry, make my bed, daily activities for about 3 years now.  I am living on Social Security Disability that allows me $1036.00 per month to live on, to include all expenses, insurance, co-insurance, prescriptions (Medicare Part D).  I wish to stay independent, however, due to the high doses of hydrocodone, muscle relaxants and other meds (see med list) my Doc has asked me not to drive.  I can not afford 'in home help' and I have 'too much money' to qualify for assistance.    I am up that creek without any paddles.  Please tell me something, honestly, that I may look forward to regarding my personal health.  I am not asking you to look into the 'smiley crystal ball'.  Tell it to me straight, Doc.  Most Sincerely, gnatelee\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Spinal stenosis can cause neurological problems.  The question is whether the stenosis is central of peripheral.  Meaning: is the central spinal canal narrowing or is the intervertebral foramen (openings where the nerve roots leave the spinal cord and vertebral column) pinching on nerves. Usually with central stenosis, leg pain especially in the calves occurs with walking.  This is called neurological claudication.  Other symptoms can include back pain and ataxic gait and leg weakness.  Central stenosis often affects both legs while peripheral stenosis or a pinched nerve causes symptoms down either leg. Surgery is used as a last resort unless you are unable to pee or severe leg weakness to the point of not being able to stand or move from one place to another - these are worst case examples but do need surgical consideration. You will be able to discuss all of this with the neurosurgeon during the consult.   Let us know how it goes. Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Muscle tears in the mid scapular areas are rare.  MRI certainly will show the discs and vertebrae in the spine.   I do not know off hand how far out the scan will go laterally toward the scapula however the radiologist should know.   If there is any shoulder blade discomfort with arm movement and/or the muscles near the scapula are tender, you may focus the attention there and request some physical therapy.   Without further details or being able to evaluate the shoulder first hand, it is hard to tell exactly what is going on with the spine or shoulder.   Some other ways to differentiate scapular problems from thoracic problems is to isolate the different parts during movement.  For example, does pressing down on the thoracic spinous processes hurt.  Does manually applied movement solely of the scapula hurt. Coughing, sneezing, or deep breathes can affect both areas as the underneath scapular muscles attach to the ribs.   Hope this helps some and keep us posted.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 21 year old male. I have been suffering with chronic back pain (severe burning pain) at the top of my spine, in between my shoulder blades, and slight neck pain for nearly 3 years( it came on gradually). There was never any known injury or trauma to the area or anywhere for that matter. I have had 3 MRI's, One of the cervical, one of the thorasic and one positional MRI of both with contrast. The MRI shows 3 degenerating discs in my neck (bulging but with no stenosis) but nothing abnormal in my back. The pain in my back is constantly present and is very severe almost all the time. The pain in my neck is nowhere near as severe as my upper back pain. I have lost weight, I am loseing sleep , and i hardly can manage to  make it through work, let alone do chores around the house. I have seen about 5 doctors but not one of them could help me figure out what was going on. Most of the doctors acted like i was \"making this up\" or told me \" there is no way you could be in this much pain\". One of the doctors actually told me to \" do arm circles\". I have seen physical therapists, tried creams and patches, i have tried ice/heat Stim and heat, Ultrasound, trackton and most likely everything else. I am now seeing a chiropracter (3 times a week!) that realizes there is a problem, and understands my pain but has been unable to diagnose it. The chiropractor does manipulations on my spine and massages but the pain returns about 30 minutes after i leave. The chiropracter says i have severe muscle spasms and my back and neck muscles are extreamly tight. She tells me that \" there is ovbiously something else going on here\" and realizes this isnt just normal aches and pains. I also should note that the burning in my back starts right next to my spine and spreads outwards covering most of my upper back. The bones in that area feel sore aswell and i have a habbit of cracking my back which can be done just by leaning backwards or forwards. Everytime i do this my  back makes a pop sound and the pain goes away for about 5 seconds. This is basicaly the only relief i can find and i have developed a nasty habit of constantly doing this. I am perscribed Amrex 15mg (2/day) and vicodin 5mg ( 1-2 every 4hr as needed).. i don't think i could survive daily life without this..  Does this sound firmiliar to anyone? Can any doctor give me a lead in the right direction? I have an appointment with a neurologist who is going to do something called an EMG. I am praying that someone can identify this problem so i can get proper relief   Suffering on the east coast\n\n",

The muscle spasms are a good clue that some underlying tissue or structure is involved.  Plus, since cracking the back provides some temporary relief, I think this is a small joint problem. You may check with the pain management team.  Sometimes they can precisely inject steroids into these joints. Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "My dominate hand is right and i have mid to upper back pain just to the right or maybe even a bit on the spine.  It is more or an ache or a burn than sharp pain and i have had it for 5 days straight.  I have gotten this before and usually get it on and off. I don't remember it lasting this long before though.  One of the vertebrae on my spine hurts to touch but i think its a bit hight than the spot im talknig about.  it is hard to pinpoint the spot and i cant tell if its muscle, bone or whatever etc.  I play hockey and i use the stick on the right side of my body to shoot so i thoguht it could possible be a muscle problem from shooting in hockey since it is just to the right of my spine and i got it around the same time i last played hockey.  Thanks for any advice Michael\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The small disc protrusion should not cause too many symptoms down into the legs especially if it is not compressing the thecal sac (contains the spinal cord and the central roots).   It is important to evaluate the neurological function in the legs which may include EMG and Nerve conduction velocity test and then compare to pre op results.  It is important to see why the leg is tingling and pins and needles.  Laminectomy goal is to decrease these radicular (radiating) type symptoms.  So continuation or worsening symptoms need to be evaluated thoroughly.  Take care and let us know how it goes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I'm a 19 year old male and have noticed that my posture is getting pretty bad. When I look in the mirror, my back is very hunched. I can stand up straight if I want to, but it feels unnatural. I recently decided to try correcting my posture by forcing myself to stand up straight and sit correctly in chairs. The only problem is that this has been causing me quite a bit of lower back pain. When I go to bed, the pain goes away. When I stop worrying about how I sit and stand, there is no pain at all. But, when I spend the entire day trying to stand straight and sit with my back against the chair and my legs forming 90 degree angles, my lower back hurts quite a bit. I should also mention that my neck is bothering me a bit when i turn my head right, but this may be unrelated. Anyway, here's what I'm wondering...  Is it normal to feel lower back pain from forcing yourself to sit/stand straight? Should it go away over time?  And, is this a viable method of fixing my posture? should i try something else?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It sounds like your thoracic area rounds or is kyphotic due to poor posture.  When correcting during sitting the low back hurts.  This makes sense.  When you try to straighten the mid or upper back, you are hyperextending the lower back placing increased stress on the small joints in the lumbar area.  The remedy is balancing the entire trunk musculature...and yes the neck can be affected too. This will take education from a trained professional like a physical therapist to help you rehab your entire back.  The program will be tailored to your condition and should see 50% improvement in 4 weeks.   Exercise and conditioning however should be over a lifetime. Take care and keep us posted.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Last question first: acupuncture may help with the pain but will not change the disc degeneration. Xrays will only look at space between the vertebral bodies and not give the best image of the discs themselves.  Xray would show spurring too however since no spondylosis then no spurring.   In terms of terms, spondylolithesis is a slipping forward of one vertebrae on another.  Spondylolysis is a fracture on the vertebrae which may cause spondylolithesis.  Spondylosis is general term for back abnormality.  Confused yet? Anyway, I would recommend a bone mineral density to check for osteoporosis.  And to reassure you that this left low back wrapping around pain may or may not be directly related to the discs.   May want to try some water rehabilitation as this would take some weight off the spine.   Let us know how it goes and I hope this gives you some direction. p.s. An MRI may be in order as this views the disc much better than xray.\n\n",

    "content": "This back pain was fairly acute for the last 4-6 months not really bothering me that much except for certain periods when it began throbbing quite harshly, so much so that I had to hold on to something to regain my senses although usually it would go away all on it's own.  I might mention that for the last 3-4 months I have been sitting in front of a computer for 10 hours daily, sometimes more.  Three days ago I decided to finally get outside and get some exercise, things seemed to be going fairly well though I was slightly winded.    About twenty minutes of running around shooting hoops and I decided to call it quite, I tossed the ball against the backboard and as I bent down to pick it up I got excruciating lower back pain, I would call it sharp and it certainly made me stop and think I might be having some horrible fracture.  I was able to walk home fairly easily although the pain was throbbing quite severely, the pain has continued steady for the last few days although every now and again I get that terribly sharp lower back pain \"usually because I am leaning on something for too long or sitting in the computer chair, I have found that putting both my legs underneath me in the computer chair brings almost total relief for a few minutes.    I might mention that I met with a neurophysiologist who gave me a physical strength test which was fine, but when he ran a certain instrument \"Sorry I don't know the technical term, looks like a small pizza cutter\" across the outside of my legs my left outside leg was far more numb than the right. Several months ago I ignored numbness on my left left leg and last two toes on my left foot that eventually went away on their own.   Also the only procedure that seemed to be able to momentarily recreate the pain was when he pushed quickly and with force on the back of my head.      Really hope someone can help with these symptoms I am feeling and let me know what's going on.   20 years old 5,11 210 LBS\n\n",

If you have any family history of early heart issues (heart attack, stents, bypass, stroke) and you have risk factors (smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes, abnormal cholesterol), then it is important to visit a physician for evaluation of your heart.

    "content": "Hello, Lots of times, loss of curvature in the neck is due to muscle spasms.  The pain and swelling in the neck due to a torn caroitid artery would be extremely rare and would be the result of high impact trauma...not poor posture.  Tumor is unlikely as well.   The best test to get is a simple cervical xray with flexion and extension views.  This will show any gross abnormalities (if any) and if normal give some reassurance.   If the meantime, keep up with the NSAIDS and heat/ice packs. Expect the physician to ask questions about numbness/tingling in the arms, arm weakness, location and character of the pain, what makes it better or worse.  The examinatin should include reflex testing, muscle strength tests, sensation check (all done on the arms); neck range of motion, palpating the tissue in the neck. He may recommend a CT or MRI but probably will check cervical xray first- depends on your history and physical results. Oh...yes the jaws and head in general can hurt with neck pain - very common.  But have him check the TMJ joints too.  Let us know how it goes.   Take care.\n\n",

I don't know if they started when the pain started but it's definintely been in the last 5 days.  I have them most often when I've been laying in bed and I move my legs from a bent position to straight position or vice versa.  Once I move my legs my muscles in both legs and it seems up to my waist tighten suddenly at the same time, just for a moment. Usually the tightening of the muscles is accompanied by a feeling that I need to have a bowel movement.  I haven't had any numbness in my legs and no incontinence.  The muscle spasms have been continuing even though I don't have any pain right now.  I am on a muscle relaxer currently.  Thank you\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Thanks for writing in.  You have reported recurrent low back pain which now radiates into leg hip and leg, and  muscle spasms.  Currently, taking muscle relaxers.  Pain worsens straightening the leg from the flexed postion laying supine.  It is important to consider the source of the pain (hip vs lumbar spine)...perhaps pelvic area too since the spasm feels internal.  Your family physician can order hip xray or pelvic ultrasound as needed.  This decision depends on the rest of your history and any extra symptoms.    Straightening the leg from flexion not only moves the hip but also increases stress on the lumbar spine so spine pain and muscle spasm can increase with this maneuver.    You may consider a course of physical therapy and if no change or worsening then do imaging MRI or CT scan.   Analgesics and heat/ice packs may also help with the pain and spasms.  With back pain, it is important to keep stools soft.  Low back pain and spasms can result from straining during bowel movement.    Take care and keep us posted.\n\n",

Sometimes the pain just hits other times its starts with a craping feeling in the muscles in the lower back and the pain sets in. Some times the pain so bad that it takes my breath away. I was told that it is Costochondritis but when i research it Ifind out it is all with in the chest and upper back not the lower so could this be a mistake or could this actual be the problem?\n\n",

Muscle weakness due to disc bulging or protrusion is a concerning sign.  This indicates severe neurological damage and may be permanent.    Decompressing the nerve through surgery usually helps with radiating leg pain, numbness and tingling, and muscles weakness.  Surgery does not guarantee resolution of localized back pain however.   Conservative options are physical therapy, lumbar traction, and pain control.    An EMG would help define the extent of the nerve damage to the leg and allow you and your physician to judge if surgery should be presently pursued.   Take care and keep us posted.\n\n",

    "title": "Simultaneous Neck and Hand pain",
    "content": "Hello, I am a 25 year old female with a long history (12 + years) of lower back problems.  I am a dance teacher with a very flexible spine and lordosis.  My official diagnosis is Degenerative Joint Disease, though I have not ever been to see a spinal specialist.  My last MRI (about 18 months ago) showed a mild disc bulge and degenerative changes in the L-5 region, with facet arthropathy.  My pain is currently under (relative) control, though I go through periods of severe, debilitating pain radiating down my right hip and leg.  I can feel what my physical therapist told me are the facet joints actually getting stuck and I have to consciously \"unstick\" them numerous times per day.  My question today, however, has to do with a relatively recent problem I have been having with my neck.  I have not yet been to see a doctor about my neck problem, and I'm wondering if it is something I should be concerned about.  Neck tension, stiffness, and cracking are pretty common for me, but two months ago I woke up with unbearable pain in the right side of my neck, traveling up into the back and top of my head, down my right arm and hand, and down the whole right side of my torso.  I'm not sure how I mangaged to get out of bed (it took several tries) because I literally screamed with pain every time I moved any part of the right side of my body.  I couldn't drive, work, or sleep for over a week, and I could barely dress myself or shower.    It took nearly two months to finally feel almost normal, though I still have some lingering pain and stiffness on the right side of my neck.  The main problem that I am now having is a deep, burning pain in the right side of my neck that comes and goes.  What is strange is that every time I have this burning pain, I feel the exact same sensation in my right hand, near the base of my thumb.  When the pain in my neck stops, so does the pain in my hand.  Also, my neck makes all kinds of crunchy sounds when I tilt my head (not just one crack, but lots of small sounds every time I roll my head around).  Using my hand on my chin to tilt my head to the left and crack my neck, which is probably not a good thing to do, nevertheless does seem to stretch out the right side of my neck and bring some temporary relief from the pain.  From what I've read online, it seems possible that I may have experienced a cervical hernia . . . does this seem likely?  It's hard to find much information on Degenerative Joint Disease . . . is this a progressively worsening condition that could be spreading to my neck and causing my problems?  Is it time for a follw-up and maybe a consulation with a specialist?  I've been told that I have the spine of an 80-year-old woman, even though I am only 25.  Between my back problems and now my neck pain, I'm living in almost constant discomfort, sometimes severe pain, and I'm not sure what my next step should be.  Any suggestions?  Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Thanks for writing in.  You have described chronic low back pain with hypermobility and lordosis.  A history of degenerative disc disease and facet arthropathy confirmed by MRI.  Dance teacher.  Recent sudden onset of neck pain radiating to hand (thumb) and up to head.  Improved symptoms in the neck but snaps, pops, and cracks with occasional flare up including thumb pain.  I think the problem you are having in the neck is caused by the same problem in the low back - hypermobility ...and perhaps lordosis.  The thumb pain is related to the cervical level - C6.  Arthritis in the facet joint can refer pain down the limb and of course so can a pinched nerve and/or a bulging disc.    Therefore, an MRI of the neck and a clinical examination of the neck and upper extremities (reflexes, sensation, and strength) would be prudent.  Treatment will proceed the MRI results.

    "title": "Re: upperbody posture",
    "content": "Hello, Thanks for writing in.  You have described difficulty maintained upright posture when walking more than 10 feet.  History of spine fracture 40 years ago.  No history of scoliosis confirmed by MRI but some curvature noted when bending forward.  Muscle relaxers have been prescribed.  Since pain does not appear to be an issue then we start thinking about a couple of things.  One, the muscles in the upper and midback may be weak.  Second, you may have a functional scoliosis.  Third, you may developing kyphosis.  A functional scoliosis (lateral curve of the spine) shows up during forward bending but not during supine or straight standing.    Kyphosis is a increased posterior curve of the thoracic spine.  This may be due to degenerative changes in the spine and life long postural changes.  In any case, an evaluation by a physical therapist would help define your condition and then focus on exercise for correction.    Unless you are having muscle spasms, the muscle relaxers will not change the bending forward.  If anything, a back spasm would make you stand taller and stiffer.  Another consideration is osteoporosis.  Loss of bone mineral density can change the structure of the spine and may lead to abnormal curvature or posture.  Your family physician can order physical therapy for rehabilitation and a bone mineral density test for osteoporosis screening.  Take care and keep us posted.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Spine popping toward ground when laying down",
    "content": "Hello, Thanks for writing in. Lordosis to a mild degree is normal for the lumbar spine however in some cases, like yours, there is an excess of lordosis.   Pain can occur with increasing the lordosis via extending the spine.  In your case, sitting up from lying on your back increases the pain (just the opposite). However, I think the pain is due to the lordosis.   When we lay down on our backs the spine flattens and the lumbar lordosis reverses.  Sitting up reverses the lordosis even more...ie flexes the spine (instead of extending it - increasing the lordosis).  So, for some reason, your back pops when you lay down and hurts when you sit up.   It is very difficult to figure out exactly where and why this is happening.  It may be prudent to talk to your physician about seeing a physical therapist.  With lordosis it is important to do daily back exercises but not just any exercise.  There should be a program developed personally just for you.  Take care and let us know how this goes.\n\n",

    "content": "I have had chronic moderate to severe back pain ever since I had surgery for Scoliosis in December of 2002. I also have a dislodged screw on the lower left side of my back, which I think happened a year or two after surgery. I have also suffered from 'pain attacks', which all I can describe as severely painful. The pain radiates from my spine area and wraps around my lower abdomen. I mainly feel the pain in my stomach muscles and ribs. These 'pain attacks' come on gradually and for no real reason. They have also increased in how long they last, my last attack a couple months ago lasted about 6 hours and it was about a week after surgery when the first one happened, they used to last anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes. I also have deep pain in my right hip that seems to radiate from my lower back. I have a numb spot on my right hip/outer thigh area and another one that spreads just below both shoulder blades. I have also had unexplained bruising that appears mainly on the middle/upper right side of my back, but it has also appeared on the middle/lower left side and they usually run along side my surgery scar. I also have a lump that appears on my lower left back, where my screw is dislodged. That usually appears when I have been doing a lot of bending, or playing with my son. It doesn't take very much to upset my back pain, or to make that lump appear. I'm also very sleepy a lot, even if I've had enough sleep. My back is also very itchy all of the time, I don't know of that matters but I thought I'd add that anyway. I have been to my orthopaedic doctor, but he doesn't know why I'm in all this pain or why I have these strange symptoms. His advice was to go to a pain management clinic, but I would really like that to be a last resort. I have also tried physical therapy, but it only increased my back pain. I would really appreciate any advice! Thank you very much for reading my post.  Sarah\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you so much for responding to my post! Well, to answer your questions, I had my surgery in Baltimore MD, and since I live in Ohio and it's not very easy for me to make a trip to Baltimore. There's only one orthopaedic surgeon in my area and he has said that if the screw is not moving and/or the rods are not moving then he's not going to do anything about it. He has run a few different tests, mainly to look at my spine to see if anything is wrong with it, such as numerous X-Rays, a bone scan, and I believe if I'm not mistaken a CT scan. I can't be quite sure about the last one I listed because honestly I can't remember! I know they put me into a long tube and had me hold my breath. Anyway, I've never had any other tests then the ones I have mentioned above. With this thyroid, do you believe that it could possibly be contributing to my symptoms? Is there some sort of specalist I could request from my family doctor to be referred to? I'd like to try to investigate as many possibilities as I can before deciding to go to pain managment. The bruising has me very worried, I have one now as I write this. It feels very stiff and painful where the buise is and it's round this time whereas they are usually perpendicular to my scar. Like I said in my original post they appear for no reason, as this one also did. Anyway, no I have never tried aquatic therapy before, but a few years ago I was in a swimming class. The swimming didn't seem to bring me much pain, but this was before my pain and symptoms increased. I also forgot to mention that I had a baby in April of 2007 naturally with no epidural. Do you think that maybe by me having a baby that it somehow hurt my back? Wouldn't it show up on X-Ray or any of the other scans I've had? Again thank you so much for your time I greatly appreciate it!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Unless there were evidence from the xray showing a change in the spine or in the instrumentation, I would not think childbearing would cause a problem with the scoliosis repair.    A thyroid problem may contribute to the fatigue but not neccesarily the pain.  Your family physician can order a screening blood test (TSH and free T4) and palpate the thyroid for nodules or enlargement.  If bruising is a problem, may want to check a CBC (checking red blood cell and platelet counts).    Back to the spine, if the spine is structurally sound, then exercise within painfree limits may help.  Aquatic therapy would be a good starting place.   Keep us posted on your progress.\n\n",

If no relief or worsening pain withing one week, see a physician who can take a detailed history and do a physicial exam.    Mid back pain can be caused by: More likely because of pain with movement:  - muscle strain or sprain  - thoracic spine strain or sprain  - rib cage strain,sprain, or fracture.  Less likely but important to rule out with history and physical:  - Pulmonary etiology (eg.pneumonia)  - cardiovascular etiology (eg heart ischemia, aneurysm)  - kidney infection  If in doubt, see your family physician for an accurate diagnosis.

    "content": "Hello Sarah, Thank you for the inquiry. Your back pain description makes sense.   Sometimes young women suffer from hyperlordosis of the low back.  High jumping especially going over the bar requires hyperextension of the spine.  Together, your body may be telling you that hyperextension is a problem.   An orthopedic physical therapist or a sports medicine physician can look at the posture of your spine in various positions and movements to diagnose your back condition.  It will also be important to xray the lower spine to check for spondylolithesis (forward slippage of a vertebrae).   In the meantime, use analgesics, ice and heat to control the pain...and see your family physician who can recommend physical therapy or see a sports medicine physician. Take care and let us know how it goes.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: cervical fusion of c6 & c7",
    "content": "Hello, It sounds like the first two fusions were done with a bone autograft (using your own bone from the pelvic area to fuse the neck segment together).  Using screws and plates to stabilize the vertebrae is sometimes done when the previous method has failed (the bone fusion fails and allowing too much movement of the vertebral segment and thus more pain, numbness, and weakness).   It is important to note that spinal fusion or decompression does not guarantee decreased spine pain but the expectation should be to eliminate limb symptoms (weakness, pain, numbness, tingling, loss of reflexes).     It is also important to discuss the risks and benefits of the procedure with the surgeon before making your decision to have the surgery.    Good questions to ask the surgeon:   Will the hardware remain in my neck?   What could go wrong with the procedure?   How do you prevent this?   What result should I expect?   How long will my recovery be?   How long should the fusion last?   Will I need a neck brace?    Will I need therapy? How many surgeries like this have you done and how have the outcomes been?  Keep us posted and take care.\n\n",

    "content": "For the first time ever, I had excruciating ache in my lower butt region, on Monday 29th Dec. I had been fairly constipated for the preceding few days. I had no idea what was up, but thought it might be a bruised tailbone.  I went on Thursday the 31st to the doctor and a sports medicine expert examined me (a drop in appointment). He felt my back and then did an internal anal feel. He said it was a spot on the lower part of the sacrum that was very tender from outside, but he could not feel it inside because it was too high up. He suggested I try to treat the constipation and prescribed a laxitive. He said it might have also been caused by prolonged sitting as I was on holiday for a week.  I've been trying to treat the constipation for 2 weeks now with semi-success. Overall though it's still a bigger issue than I've ever had in my life with this. The ache went away on the 1st of Jan and has just retunred again today.  I'm worried that it's going to get worse.  Meanwhile I also am very late in my cycle (very unusual) and visited my doctor onMonday Jan 12. She gave me a blood test for pregnancy as I am currently trying to conceive. It was negative. My last period was December 4th. She has told me to schedule a pelvic ultrasound in the next week or so to ensure I do not have a cyst or something else. I told hr about the sacrum pain, but when I saw her it had not returned.  Are all these things likely related?\n\n",

About the pain, has it been directly over the sacrum or actually in the buttock musculature.  The sciatic nerve runs out of the pelvis and into the leg and can be palpated in the buttock area.  Does the pain radiate?    Is it relieved with bowel movement.  For constipation, folks have found success with warm ginger ale and apple juice (50/50).  If all else fails, a tablespoon of mineral oil orally will move the bowels.   Let us know how things turn out.\n\n",

I work at a computer and would consider myself to have bad posture. At work I view a number of different monitors, some of which are not in the most ergonomic position.

A skilled chiropractor or osteopath may be of assistance to xray the neck and make any needed adjustments.  For sure, correcting posture on a daily basis as well as postural exercises throughout the week will preserve you neck for years to come.  Very important.    Let us know how it goes.\n\n",

    "content": "I am 21, female. Average height (5'6) and weight (130 lb). Somewhat athletic. I was in a very serious car accident 3 years ago. My chiropractor noticed the accident moved a few upper vertabrae and ribs which are now back in line. I experience very slight lower back pain, neck pain, and pain in my right shoulder when I'm rockclimbing hard or backpacking for a few days. A doctor recently noticed I have very slight scoliosis but thinks it's unrelated to the accident.  My mother has had severe and debilitating sciatica for a few years, and today she was feeling around my lower back. She applied pressure to my sciatic nerve (she said it was the sciatic nerve...it was about 1-2 inches above my tailbone, in the middle of my back along the spine) and it really hurt! She did it again, and it hurt so much that I dropped everything I was holding. I've never noticed this pain until she did this. I've read a little about sciatica and I don't have any of the symptoms -- my legs and buttocks are fine, and I've always attributed any lower back pain to the accident.  So my questions are: could the tenderness be associated to the car accident? Can this lead to sciatica? Should I be taking preventative care and how?  Thank you.\n\n",

It exists the pelvic area just under the piriformis.

Loss of strength in arm.  Pain subsided over time by way of no further exercise, muscle relaxants,and anti-inflammatorys.  Strength in arm eventually returned afterwards through progressive weight training.  Six years later, I believe that I still have lingering effects.  My left scapula is winged, and still experience pain in my left rhomboid at times.  Pain is deep, and radiates through left side of my back, and mildly down the arm. When it flares up particularily bad, the rhomboid is noticeable tense to the touch in comparison with the right.   Deep massage has not given any permanent relief, nor has stretching.  Have not tried Chiropractor.  Is this problem with my rhomboid directly the result of the neck herniation years ago, or a coincidence?  Regardless, what would be a treatment for this?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Certainly, the winging and rhomboid pain can be secondary to the cervical issues.  With rehab, it is easy to neglect the scapulothoracic muscle.  However, it is important to specifically strengthening these (rhomboids, serratus anterior, middle and lower traps.)  The long thoracic nerve supplies the serratus anterior which prevents scapular winging.  However this nerve was probably not damaged during cervical surgery.  May just double check with your orthopedist or neurosurgeon.    So focus on strengthening the scapulothoracic musculature and given no nerve damage, you should make good stides toward a painfree shoulder.  See a physical therapist if needed for specifics.  Let us know how it goes.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Is it possible to fix bad posture?",
    "content": "Hello,  The answer to your question is yes and yes.  The arching of the back between the shoulders is called kyphosis.  Desk work causes rounded shoulders, forward head, and sometimes kyphosis.    Exercises to remedy poor posture include strengthening the muscle of the upper and mid back and stretching the chest and anterior shoulder muscles.  Also, general fitness is important to maintain good tone throughout the entire trunk (sitting for a long time promotes poor muscle strength and decrease cardovascular health).    While working, take a break every 30 minute to stretch your arms overhead.  Also, there is a classic door way exercise in which you place your palms on either side of a doorway and lean forward stretching the front shoulders and chest.  Lastly, stand with your posterior shoulders, back of head, and buttocks against a wall, and feet slightly out from the wall for a good posture stretch....progress from arms at your side to overhead while maintaining contact (head, posterior shoulders, and buttocks against wall).    If in doubt, see a physician who can refer you to a physical therapist.  Let us know how it goes.   ps Many elderly folks suffer from kyphotic posture - some of which started during their youth.  This hinders their mobility and ability to do daily functions.  So, good posture when young is important.\n\n",

    "content": "I have a Soft lump at the base of my spine, top of my bum crack on my left bum cheek. The lump itself is not painful to touch but the skin around it is. When no pressure is applied I feel no pain but sitting and lying on my back will cause it to hurt as much as applying pressure to a normal bruise would, so not \"that\" painful but still noticeable. The lump is about the size of two flat marbles and is soft. The skin on the lump is slightly red. Ive had the lump for four days, the pain has not got any worse but I seem to have only noticed the lump on the third day, though it is small. I sit at my computer a lot, but I do go walking along the beach/ take small breaks, but I'm still sitting more than the average person. I am 18 years old and slightly overweight (if that helps). Since there seems to be no change I'm afraid this may become worse but I don't know.\n\n",

    "content": "There are three possibilites: The first two (most likely) are epidermoid cyst and the other is a lipoma.  Both are benign.  Both are common. An epidermoid cyst (EC) is a bit firmer than a lipoma which is usually soft and mobile.    If bothersome, either can be treated in a physician office with excision or incision and drainage (esp EC).  Lipomas can grow.  If one grows beyond 5 cm then may suspect liposarcoma (malignancy). A third possibility is pilonidal cyst which is an local ingrowth of hair typically in the sacral area.  This cyst is very painful and should be excised.    See a physician to make definitive diagnosis  Keep us posted.\n\n",

    "content": "Ty for your reply, out of the three I'd assume its the first. It is fairly hard, not very mobile at all and not that painful. I've decided that I'd see how it goes, and so far so good. It seems to be getting smaller slightly every day. The pain has not increased nor decreased but I can easily ignore the slight discomfort. The skin around it had turned to a bruise which seems to be shrinking as well. Sometimes I see a yellow tinge below the bruise but it isn't always there and hardly noticeable. The pain is only felt while sitting/laying still and after I stand up it seems to slowly go away. Also, after sitting for a while, it could be my imagination, but it seems to go harder and after removing  pressure it goes a little more soft.  Its been a week and a half now, and I believe its getting better, slowly. Is this normal?\n\n",

Usually these cysts are somewhat mobile perhaps not as mobile as a lipoma.

    "content": "Hello, The symptoms that you report do not sound like a gall bladder problem which typically causes right upper abdominal pain which radiates to the shoulder blade (your pain starts in the blade and wraps around to the front - wrong direction).   Abdominal pain worsen after eating especially fatty food.  May have nausea and vomiting.  If the gall bladder becomes infected or gangrenous, you may spike a fever and symptoms will worsen.  Immediate medical attention is needed.  Pain that you described may be caused from a muscle strain/sprain in the posterior rib area, or in or around the shoulder blade.  Pressing or massaging a trigger point or knotted up muscle can caused tingling or numbness in the arm.    It would be good to have a physician take your history, examine your belly and upper back and make sure this is only a muscle strain in which case ice/heat, NSAIDS, time, and gentle exercise will heal.   Keep us posted.\n\n",

If severe, surgery is used to straighten the spine using rods.    Treatment depends on the degree of the curve which is measured using an xray.  Your orthopedic doctor or family physician can order xrays and have the angles of the scoliosis measured and then decide on appropriate treatment.  Let us know how it goes.  Take care.  ps When a child has a school or sports physical or well-child visit, it is important to screen the spine for scoliosis in both boys and girls.  Early detection and treatment are vital to long term health.\n\n",

    "content": "Tom,  Thank you for responding.  The disco gram was an intensley painful test.  However, it was the only  test that showed a tear in one of my discs.  I said I would never have a test like the disco gram again due to the painful expierence but I must endourage your readers NOT TO GIVE UP if MRI'S and X-rays are negiative.  HAVE THE DISCO GRAM DONE BUT BE PREPAIRED FOR VERY INTENSE PAIN IF THERE IS A TEAR IN THE DISC. Just getting the positive result for my pain did so much for my piece of mind, especially after all other tests were negiative.    Pain management doctors wanted to do the Endoscopic Microdisectomy or Disc Fx system at there office however, I have chosen to go to a surgeon and see what his opinion is. Things continue to get worse and I can now only stand for 10 minutes at a time before a rod like, vice griping pain starts down my spine and in my right leg. In addittion to the former, is am now getting bladder infections and burning along with painful sex?? This is all so confusing and I am getting exhausted from it.   On FEB 2ND I go to the suregeon (finally after the disco gram, 5 pain blocks, 2 MRI's and numerous x-rays. all within the past 11 months.)   The temperature on my right foot is a degree higher that the left and there is noticible swelling. The pain clinic Dr's said it can be a result from the nerves binding up that may turn my toes grayish?  I am anxious to see what the surgeon say's the cause is.  Thank you once again, Jan\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,   I recently moved. As I was packing canned food from a bottom shelf I twisted and felt a sudden, sharp pain on my left side of my back under my shoulder blade and ribs. I saw a family friend who is a physical therapist. I was told that I popped out two ribs and after he worked with me I felt better. A few days later when I was unpacking, I twisted in sort of the same way and I think I did it again. It is not as painful, but I can still feel it. Do the ribs have to be put back or will ice and NSAIDS be enough? If I should get it checked, do I go to an orthopedic doctor and since I just moved and don't know anyone how do you go about finding a good one???\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Your physical therapy friend may recommend a specific exercise or manuever which may place the rib back in place.   Best route to take for orthopedic referral is to go through a family physician who will have a good opinion of the best orthopedist.  Sometimes I ask the local physical therapist who they would recommend since the therapist sees the ortho patients post - op.  Your condition obviously is not something that needs surgery but should resolve on its own with ice, NSAIDS, and perhaps some type of rotational exercise or manipulation to re- locate the ribs (if indeed the ribs are misplaced).  Sometimes what happens with pain like this is the muscles under the shoulder blade or between the ribs get strained or sprained causing pain and muscle spasm.  Easing the pain and spasm with heat/ice and NSAIDS and gradual return to activity usually suffices.  Again if in doubt see your family physician.    Keep us posted.\n\n",

    "title": "Pain from Neck to Lower Back, Rib Tenderness",
    "content": "I currently have pain from my neck to my lower left back.  Starting from the top, my neck muscles are overly tight on a daily basis and sometimes become rock hard to the touch. I've read about trigger points and sometimes can cause the spasms to release by pushing on certain parts of my neck, but they always return.  My upper back has a constant ache between my left shoulder blade and my spine. If I lift my left shoulder toward my head a dull ache increases in intensity. I have a device called a Back Buddy and I can massage some of the muscles under my arm pit, where my arm and shoulder attach and to the inside lower right side of my left shoulder blade and this reduces the achiness temporarily.   My lower back aches right around the L3-L4 Vertebraes. I've had an MRI of this but the specialists I have shown it too have said it is normal to have some bulging in this area and the most adults do. Most of the time it feels like my paraspinal muscles are in extreme spasm compressing my vertebrates. I sometimes have pain down my but and into that op of my leg. The only thing I have found to help with this is by laying on my belly on an excercise ball, placing my hands on the floor directly in front of the ball, then while pushing my elbows into the ball allowing my lower back to get stretched by the traction I create. Often times I can feel the disc decompress and then it feels better for a little while  I often times have extreme tenderness in spots on my lower back ribs. Just really sensitive to the touch. I try to massage them out but it doesn't really work.  I twist my back often and it creates a feeling of realignment and often times it feels like discs are moving back in to place.  I have seen multiple Back Specialists, Physical Therapists, Chiropractors, a Kinesiologist and have had many massages and have also tried acupuncture. We have evaluated my posture, as I am a graphic designer, and have made adjustments to my posture and this hasn't helped. I have not spent an eight hour day in front of a computer in over a month and a half and the pain and tightness still seems to be the same. The pain is certainly worse when sitting as opposed to standing though. Nothing seems to work. I feel like I am in a constant state of stretching my lower back, neck or mid-back. My whole back feels like it is in spasm.  I'm wondering if there may be something chemical inside my body that is causing this. I did have a slight injury while snowboarding where I took a hard fall using my left arm to brace my body. There was some shoulder pain after that but that took place over a year before the onset of these more annoying symptoms. Other than that, there was no incident to create the onset of the back or neck pain it just slowly happened over a 2-week period about 3 years ago and has been the same ever since.  I am 31 years old and would like to know if anyone else out there may have some insight into this.  Thank you very much for your help!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Thank you for the case. Although your case is common, it is not easy to remedy.  If the integrity of the spine is good ie the MRI was normal, then you can have confidence about moving and exercising.  Stretching is important especially the anterior chest and neck muscles (scalenes).  Strengthening the core muscles (transverse abdominus, and multifidi) are vital. Checking for rib displacement is important.  These things can be done through guidance of an orthopedic physical therapist.    Otherwise, some folks have found relief with more activity vs less activity (eg a daily walking or swimming program).  Exercise is good for blood flow to muscles.  Muscles which are tight and painful tend to lack nutrients and oxygen.  So increasing blood supply to these areas is vital.  Hope this gives some guidance.  Let us know how it goes.    p.s. I do not know of a specific chemical which would cause muscle pain although muscles can become toxic from medicine like statin drugs used for high cholesterol.\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for the inquiry.    The cartilage in the spine is found in the small joints of the vertebrae.  These can become inflamed and arthritic and sometimes spurs stick out from them and can nerve problems.  The vertebral discs are pads between the main body of the vertebrae.  They are round fibrous structure with gel in the middle.  Sometimes they tear and the gel or fibrous portion bulges out toward a nerve or spinal canal.    Pain management physician are skilled at back injections.  They can inject corticosteroids (anti inflamatory) into the small joints or near an inflamed nerve providing pain relief.  Neurosurgeons perform a number of procedures on the lumbar spine usually to relieve pain from a pinched nerve.  Sometime they will fuse some vertebrae together to prevent painful movement. Another procedure called vertebroplasty effectively treats spinal fractures usually the result of osteoporosis.  An MRI of the back would help define any injured structures in the back.    Non surgical treatment includes physical therapy, pain management clinic, and general health measures including smoking cessation.    Cost of surgery is in the thousands.    Keep us posted on how things turn out.\n\n",

How do orthopedic doctors know if a person's neck or back is truly injured if there are no broken bones I ask this because people can say they have headaches or neck aches say from a fall or an accident---like a car accident say the rear end accident---but if no bones are broken how else can you tell?    I have been in car accidents in which I was in a car hit from behind a few times in my lifetime.  Each time---I didn't feel pain until a day or so later which began with a headache which would subsided with Motrin, but once the Motrin wore off---the headache was back. Within a few days of taking the Motrin---the pain seemed to get worse and the pills would not even help.  I told the doctor and he sent me for physical therapy in each instance.  If everyone gets degenerative disease as they age, and it shows up in x-rays, then can't it be said that the person's neck or back hurts because they have the beginning of degenerative disease instead of because they were rear ended.  Is there a way the doctor can recognize the difference?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Diagnosing a Neck Injury",
    "content": "You have asked some good questions.  With motor vehicle accidents in which the victim suffers a whiplash injury to the neck, it is common for the neck to present with latent pain.  The mechanism usually does not cause fractures or disc bulging (unless it is very high impact).  The tissues around the vertebrae over stretch and become inflamed causing localized swelling, pain, and stiffness.  Headache can occur too.  The symptoms can last for months and even years.  Some patients have even reported symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome and migraine headaches. Treatment includes maintaining normal range of motion; easing the pain with hot or cold packs, NSAIDS, and massage; maintaining good posture and general health including diet and exercise.  Injury to vertebral bone, joints, and disks can be determined by history, physical exam, and tests (xray, MRI and sometimes bone scan or CT).  Depending on the severity, injury to soft tissue  (tissue other than bone,joints, and disks) around the spine may be harder to spot on an imaging test.  In this case, we rely on the history and physical exam and response to treatment.  To answer the question about degenerative changes in the spine.  Most people will develop degenerative changes (bone spurs, decrease height of vertebral column, bulging discs) in the spine over their lifetime but many people do not suffer from long lasting spine pain.  Thus degenerative changes do not neccesarily cause spine pain.    One of the dilemmas in diagnosing spinal conditions after an injury is when the imaging tests show mild degenerative changes and the patient has symptoms in the neck, head, or limbs.  For example, is the pain resulting from what the MRI reports says \"a mild bulging disk\" (degenerative change) or is it from another structure.    Age of the patient matters too.   On imaging, we look for changes from previous testing; we look for moderate or severe deformities (eg bone spur or disc bulge narrow the spinal canal); and we try to correlate the imaging findings to the clinical symptoms.  Does what the MRI show match the patients symptoms.  Hope this helps.  Keep us posted.\n\n",

What other kinds of activities do you do regularly and have you changed any routine of late?  Any heavy lifting or repetitive back motions (bending, twisting, reaching overhead or to the side?). How long have you had the back pain?  Most acute low back pain resolves on its own within 30 days.  NSAIDS, ice and/or heat, and walking to tolerance are all indicated treatments.  Prescription strength ibuprofen is 800mg 3x a day.  See a physician if pain worsens, pain radiates into legs, pins or needles sensation in the legs, or numbness in the legs or lower pelvic area.   Let us know how things work out or if you have any more questions.  ps May change the row exercise position from a bent over row to a seated row with pulleys or on a row machine and decrease the weight and reps...or stop the row exercise for awhile. This would test the hypothesis that the bent over row is causing the pain.\n\n",

The surgury used bone from hip as graft material  I am now seeing a different surgeon who is going to perform a four-lever procedure in December.   I prefer the bone from my hip (both medical and personal reasons). However, the new doctor refuses because he claims there is no defference in success rates (maybe 1% he says) between hip bone and bone bank material. He also says since bone was taken in the first surgery \"there is not enough bone left in my hip\" to use this time. Both of these goes contrary to what I have read in my research (autograft has better success rate and there is enough bone in the hip to do many procedures - if nothing else, why not harvest the bone from the other hip?).  I consulted another doctor who agrees the procedure must be done and also agrees it should be done with bone harvested from my hip.  I guess my question is for a four-level discotomy (that has failed once already) is there any reason why the doctor should absolutely refuse to use my own bone? It seems like it should be more my choice?\n\n",

The fracture went straight across my pelvis from the left to the right illium, the left side being the worst. I was told me SI joint was completely \"blown out\". I had surgery 3-4 days after the accident and had 2 screws, a bolt, and a plate in my pelvis. One screw went through my SI joint. After a year, I had another surgery to remove the screw through my SI joint and a plate.   2 years later, I still have pain everyday. Long days on my feet and sitting increase the pain. The pain varies but is worse the busier I am. Laying straight on my back for any period of time hurts the most. It hurts immediatly to run or even walk at a fast pace. The pain seems to orginate from the middle of my lower back but spreads across my lower back.  I've seen numerous doctors and so far the only real solution I have been given is cortison shots or messing with my nerves. I do all my excersises that I was given from my physical therapist. Stretching defiently helps the pain. But it never elimantes it. I don't believe that the only solution to my pain is shots involving my nerves. I've had MRI's and x-rays done, my pelvis has healed the way it should.  Do you know of any reasons of pain after pelvis fracture and surgery? Also could my pain be involved with my SI joints being \"blown out\"? If so, what are the solutions?  Also do you have any back specialist doctors in Washington or Oregon you would recommend for my case?  Thanks!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: back pain 2 years after pelvis fracture",
    "content": "Thanks for writing and sorry for the delay in response.  It sounds like the pain is from the SI joint area.    Normally, during walking, standing, or running, weight (a vertical force) is transmitted up through the leg bones, through the SI joint and into the spine.  What keep us upright and supported is the rigidity of the spine, pelvis, SI joint, and leg bone with their respective ligaments and connective tissue and the muscles surrounding these bones.   When any of these structures are damaged, then normal function (walking, standing, etc) can cause pain.   Since the SI joint is a weight bearing joint which translates a great deal of force, it is important to support the area.  This is why our SI area was created with thick, bulking, strong muscles (the gluteals and iliopsoas) and dense and stiff ligaments.   Besides the treatment measures already mentioned, I would focus effort on aggressive strengthening of the muscles which support the SI joint.  This will include the gluteus muscles and iliopsoas.  Also strengthen all the hip and trunk muscles (abdominals and lumbar muscles).  This way not only deal with the SI area but condition the areas above and below the pelvis.   Give yourself 9-12 months to do this.  See a physical therapist if needed.  Starting off, aquatic exercises may be best as buoyancy takes weight off the legs and therefore the SI joint.    Land exercise should include deep squats, lunges, and a special exercise for the SI (With both hands, grasp an overhead bar so the feet are dangling off the ground. Bend both knees simulaneously up toward the chest.  It is like a reverse sit up. This will strengthen iliopsoas, abdominals and latisimus dorsi.  Use a step stool if needed and definitely do not hop down - gentle step down.).  Again, the idea is to strengthen the muscles around the SI joint.    Take your time and strengthen gradually.    Keep us posted.  ps I do not know of any SI specialist in the Northwest.  See an orthopedic physical therapist may be the best bet.\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for your inquiry and for your patience. The knot near the deltoid could be a reaction to neck or shoulder symptoms.  Nerve impingement in or near the spinal canal can cause numbness, tingling, weakness and pain in the limb(s). From cervical stenosis, there may also result ataxia (stumbling gait).   It would be beneficial to see a physiatrist who can do an EMG and nerve conduction velocity test to evaluate the status of the nerves leading from the cervical spine to and through the arm muscles.  This would also help differentiate if the hand symptoms are from a local (hand) problem or referred from the cervical spine area. Keep us posted.\n\n",

    "content": "I hope your back has improved by now.  Sorry for the delayed response. It is important in acute low back pain to take pain medicine.  Usually start with ibuprofen or acetaminophen; ice packs (in the initial 48hours of pain or injury) then switch to heating pad; and rest.  If no improvement, then see physician for evaluation and pain management.   Most acute low back pain resolves in 30 days regardless of treatment (chiropractor, physical therapy, bedrest, exercise, pain meds).  Too much bedrest however weakens muscles around the spine and can lead to chronic problems so it is important to move within painfree limits.   Keep us posted.\n\n",

    "title": "Chronic Lower Back Pain (Lower Right Side)",
    "content": "9-4-08 Jesse Sands Male, Age: 25 Body Composition: 5 ft 11.5 in \u2013 165 lbs. (Roughly 10% Bodyfat)  \uf0b7 I am having a problem with some Chronic Back Pain in the lower right portion of my back.  Background Info:    I am an athletic young man who works out (heavy weight training) 5 days a week, eats rather healthy (and supplements with protein and other weightlifting products), and I play on a competitive tournament paintball team.  I think paintball sometimes aggravates my back pain since I play a very physical position and sometimes dive and slide face first with the weight of my equipment in my right or left arm.  I need to get this back pain / injury resolved so that I can perform at my peak level and not end up with even worse chronic back pain in the future.    For 4 years I worked in an Auto Parts distribution Center and did a lot of heavy lifting daily, which could have led to my original injury.  The first time that the pain in my back became bad to the point I had to see a doctor and chiropractor was in October of 2006 after a rigorous paintball tournament where I felt pain early, but took pain pills and played through it.  I was in so much pain in the days to come that I could barely move around.  A MRI revealed that I had a Bulged Disk between my L4 and L5 Vertebras.  There may have also been some bulging between L3 and L4 and possibly between L5 and the Sacrum (I\u2019m a little unsure on those).  My hip bone was also very slightly higher on one side than the other (I cant recall the scientific name for this).  This did not seem to be a major concern though I was told I could put an insert in that shoe or something along those lines to help even it out and maybe put less stress on my back.                    To treat these injuries I visited a chiropractor 3 times a week to receive adjustments and also underwent Spinal Decompression for about 8 weeks or so.  At the completion of this I had a little lingering back pain, but I felt like I was near 100% recovered.  I returned to work after 9 weeks off and wore a back support brace and was always very careful when lifting heavy objects etc.   \tThe Problem and Questions:    Two years later I am now a computer programmer and sit at a desk most of the day.  I am still very active outside of work.  I have noticed the pain in the lower right hand side of my back start to come back.  If I have been sitting down for a while and I get up I get a sharp pain for the first moment when that area is moved.  If I lean forward as if to touch my toes standing up I feel a slight dull pain.  It seems like the pain will go away if I can get the bones to pop by keeping my legs still and twisting my torso one way or the other, but this is difficult for me to do and I worry that it could be doing damage itself.  I feel like if I do not do something to stop this pain from getting worse then in 10 years or sooner I will be having major problems.  I\u2019m too young and active to have this injury lingering!   What can I do to help heal this injury for good?  Are there stretching activities or other things I can do to help my body heal itself?    Do I need to begin seeing a chiropractor again to sustain full motion in that lower area?    I carry my wallet in my back right pocket normally (the side with the pain).  During the day at work I take it out and place it on my desk, but there are times such as driving where I sit on it.  Could this couple of inches of lift from my wallet be aggravating my back injury?   I understand how the spinal decompression process pulls the ligaments and vertebras apart to let in nutrients for the body to heal without surgery.  Is there a way I can mimic that or should I think about undergoing the treatment again at some point?  (It was quite costly and insurance unfriendly in 2006).  My father has an apparatus that allows him to hang upside down from his feet; could using that help me?   Thank you for any advice or suggestions you may have to aid me in resolving my situation!\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for your patience. I appreciate the precision and clarity in describing your condition. Well done. This back problem may be easier to fix than you think...but it will take some time and work. First:  Many people have reported relief from using the inversion table.  It should help. Second: Start a core trunk strengthening program.  By doing so, you will build inner abdominal muscle and lumbar intervertebral strength thus supporting the spine.  These exercises are very specific and take patience to build transverse abdominus (abdomen) and multifidi (lumbar).  See a local trainer or physical therapist if needed. Remember, this program will be much different than heavy weight lifting regimen but will compliment it nicely.  Lastly,  you may need an occasional adjustment of the spine via chiropractor but with time doing core strengthening the spine should become more stable.  Keep us posted.  ps The wallet in hip pocket may worsen pain...switch to other pocket.\n\n",

Taking Advil makes it a little better, but it still hurts to stand up or walk around, but sitting gives me the least amount of pain, where when i first hurt my tailbone sitting was the worst pain.

    "content": "Hi there -  You may well have a fracture of the coccyx (tailbone) and, while often nothing is done other than to treat it symptomatically, that is, manage the pain while the bone is healing. Pain management may mean not only medication for the actual pain, but orthopedic devices to use to help make you more comfortable (such as a donut pillow to sit on, since sitting often aggravates the pain), and teaching you how to sit more comfortably during the healing process if you aren't  able to use to donut pillow. Also, since this injury can cause a lot of discomfort at during bowel movements, you may want to use a stool softener (your doctor should be able to prescribe or recommend this, too).   Treatment, whether there is an actual fracture or not, is supportive and symptomatic. It was a very freakish accident, but then again, aren't they all? (We usually see these as the result of ice skating falls, etc.). The good news is it does heal. You should see your doctor or go to an ER if your doctor puts you off for very long, as the pain can be almost disabling at times.   I hope this is helpful to you. So sorry this happend! See your doctor for medication and accessories as needed and follow up with us as necessary. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  The diagnosis of sciatica fits perfectly, assuming the pain is traveling down the back  of the affected leg. The prolonged sitting, being overweight, the lower back origination, all are typical factors involved in sciatica originating at the nerve outlet in the low back.   An MRI would not be out of order, but PT may show early results, if appropriate manipulations and exercises are used (the sort which will place traction on the  lumbosacral spine). I'd personally want an MRI first, to rule out any displacement which could potentially be worsened by PT.  You'd be within your rights to request this, certainly. If the treating doctor refuses,  you'd also be within your rights to ask for a second opinion before starting PT.   Anti-inflammatory meds may help, but the muscle relaxant med could really make or break the doctor's case. I'm  inclined to agree with you that an MRI should probably be done prior to PT. Also, muscle relaxants are usually effective in direct proportion to their sedating side effects, which could make work and other tasks difficult.  I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  Although you've localized the pain well enough that is might seem possibly a herniated disk, the odds are it's not; more likely it's a muscle pull that's lying right across where you're pressing. However, with pain of the intensity you're describing, if this doesn't respond to over-the-counter anti-inflammatory pain meds (like ibuprofin or naproxyn) and doesn't resolve in a day or two, then yes, you probably should be seen, just to be certain you haven't suffered a herniated disk. Again,  it seems very unlikely, but if this lasts and especially if any additional symptoms develop downstream from the location of the pain (like pain or tingling in your legs, etc., depending on where the spot is along your spine) then it would need to be checked. I still think it most likely a pulled muscle and recommend something like  Advil first. If this helps significantly, or if it resolves on its own, it should be fine.  I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

If you can apply warm, moist compresses on it, or sit in a warm bath (not hot) it may help the thing to drain and heal, but it may require a doctor to drain it or prescribe antibiotics in order for it to completely resolve.   I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  A good internist should at least be able to refer you to the appropriate specialist, if not diagnose your problem first off. You've seen numerous doctors who've all given you random guesses, but no one's apparently taken much interest in the thing, which is odd. If it were a muscle spasm it would be unlikely to last three years. Same thing with soft tissue inflammation. It could, conceivably, be an arthritis cyst, but it should show up on CT or MRI. An abcess of some sort is also possible, but these usually won't remain stable for anywhere near three years either. More likely it's a calcium deposit or something that doesn't belong there. Have you had any imgaing done on this area at all? An MRI? Any sort of look or even palpation by a doctor to hopefully get an idea of what it is? Also, does it respond to over-the-counter pain medications such as ibuprofin? This would suggest it to be inflammatory in origin. That would be a help diagnostically.   Any good doctor in any specialty should be able to at least hazard a guess and point you in the right direction.  I'd probably start with an orthopedist,since it most sounds like an orthopedic (skeletal or muscular) problem. It's impossible to make a more educated guess at a distance. Feeling the lump should at least yield some clue. I'm  surprised no one has tried any harder  to diagnose and treat it.  Best of luck to you. Please follow up here as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Reoccurring Abdominal Pain",
    "content": "I've suffered from lower right quadrant (lower right abdominal pain) off and on since age 13. The pain has been attributed to ovarian cysts, constipation, and to having a spinal subluxation, depending on the professional examining me. Most often, there is no known cause. Historically, the pain is nagging and dull and sometimes intensifies to an extremely intense level of very sharp pain that lasts for about 2 hours.  One year ago, after a day of heavy lifting, I experienced pain in my right ribs. Over the course of a few weeks, the pain intensified greatly and began to radiate to my back and down to my hip. After x-rays and a CT scan, and failed steroid shots and narcotics, my internist sent me to a pain specialist who was also unsure of what the problem was. Though skeptical, I was desperate and saw a chiropractor. After one visit I felt about 20% better and after three weeks of seeing the chiro 2-3x week, I was 95% better. The pain was attributed to a spinal subluxation and scholiosis.   Currently, I am 15 weeks pregnant. I am experiencing lower right quadrant pain again, that originates from the area around my ovary, but is also associated with pain that radiates down my right leg. The pain on my side radiates around my back and down the right side of my hip. It is a dull pain that has intensified over the course of the day. The same pain occurred at 12 weeks. In that instance, after a day of toughing out moderate pain I went to bed, only to awaken in the middle of the night to very intense pain. After waiting it out for a while, I finally went to the ER. An ultrasound only revealed a very small para-ovarian cyst on the right side that, according to the doc there and my ob/gyn, could not have been the cause of such intense pain. Over the course of several hours, the pain subsided back to moderate levels and the next day was mild. Within 72 hours of onset, the pain was gone completely, until it resurfaced today, 3 weeks later.  Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Reoccurring Abdominal Pain",
    "content": "Hi there -  Given the history and what's been ruled out, as well as the current pain pathway, this sounds as though it could be iliotibial band syndrome. This  is often seen in runners but pregnancy certainly could precipitate it, especially in someone who might already be prone to it due to some misalignment as you've mentioned. It can begin as lower right quadrant or even inguinal pain, then slowly migrate around to the low back on the affected side, and down along the hip and the side of the thigh (as opposed to the back of the thigh as in sciatica). It can resolve spontaneously,  and may also respond to chiropractic, but often requires an IM steroid injection, which often will resolve the pain within minutes. However, being pregnant, a steroid injection may not be a good idea for you right now. This also may not be what it sounds like,  although everything you've mentioned does match up very well with this problem.  In a pregnant patient chiropractic or physical therapy may be the only acceptable treatments for this, if, in fact, this is what it is.  You might mention this to your doctor or chiropractor and of course run  any treatment plan by your ob-gyn as well.   I hope this is helpful. Please follow up here as needed. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "There is a lot going on with you.   To answer the question about why the right side only. Bulging disks, or pinched nerves, or spine arthiritis usually affects one side or the other...very common.  I am guessing that you are right handed.  Handedness and posture make a difference with spine pain.  A simple thing to do is watch how much weight you spend standing on one leg or the other.  Try to distribute your weight evenly over both sides.  Also watch for slumping rounded shoulders and forward head positions.  With anxiety and fatigue most people slouch.  This places undue stress on the spine.\n\n",

    "content": "Its been ongoing for since last around last october. I have a burning sensation that gradually turns into a sharp pain inbetween my left shoulder and neck, i guess you'd say its on my back because its not ontop of the muscle inbetween the shoulder and neck. The odd thing is, i asked my fiance to feel if theres anything she could feel wrong with it and she was immediately able to find the spot without my help because she said the skin was really hot in the area. Theres no swelling or limitation of movement, and most of the time she's noticed that small veins appear in the area when it starts hurting. Its not brought on by anything that i've noticed and happens randomly during the day, usually several times. I went to a doctor, and the emergency room on seperate occasions, both gave me an x ray, neither opted for a MRI because my workers comp insurance wouldn't approve it. I've since left the job and discontinued use of the doctor they supplied because he seemed more happy to get me out than listen to the what i was actually feeling (had the same problem in the emergency room). He gave me a cortizone shot which didn't really allleviate the problem at all because he said it seemed that the cause would be a tightness in the muscle (i didn't think pulled muscles could last this long). I've use ice and heat therapy, tried physical therapy at the suggestion of my doctor (with some kind of shock pulse machine, and exercise), and it seems nothings working.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  There are different causes that can give a clinical picture similar to yours. These include cervical disc problems, shoulder bursitis or shoulder tendinitis as well as muscle spasm or inflammation.  Cervical disc prolapse or herniated disc results in pain in the back of the neck, upper back, shoulder and can extend to the arm. Pain exacerbate after sitting for long time with bending forward or driving. MRI is the test of choice.  Shoulder bursitis is inflammation, and thickening of the tendons and bursa resulting in pain of the shoulder that exacerbate with movement (especially overhead movement). With direct examination, the involved muscles can make the diagnosis easier.  In these cases the pain is mainly due to muscle spasm and muscle rest for some time (24-72 hours) and pain medications are essential. Once the pain improves, other measures like physiotherapy and exercise can be started but it may take some time to reach a satisfying results.   It usually takes up to 4 weeks to get the pain completely relieved and to return back to normal activity. Steroid injections in the inflamed area are usually the next step to be used if these measures fail.  Avoiding positions that may precipitate the pain is essential. Also, try to regularly exercise as advised by your doctor.  When the pain is associated with numbness of the arm, it indicates nerve compression and your doctor should be informed to avoid complications.  Other causes like viral infections and improper positioning can causes muscle spasm that mandates following the same precautions.  In any cases if symptoms persist after these conservative measures, an MRI should be done and other investigations based on clinical examination. Orthopedic consolation is essential.  I would advise you to follow up with your doctor. Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 18 year old female. My Mom does not believe there is anything wrong at all and as I don't drive she is my way to the doctor. The times I have gone to the doctor about it he tip toes around my question for some reason. I had one back X-ray (an old riding injury) and when the results came back the doctor said I had a slight amount of scoliosis and that is the most he has ever said. I also have Kyphosis that I am getting worried about. I can't remember when it started getting veru noticable, probably between 8-11. At the top my spine turns in, pushing my head alittle forward. My lower back also bends in alot. My lower back gets very uncomfortable when I first go to bed, and it takes my awhile to find a comfortable position. My neck and shoulders often get very sore and tight if I'm sitting alot or very active that day. I am very not flexible. The closest I've ever come to reaching my toes is about 12 inches atleast above my foot.  I'm extremly tired of being a hunchback. I'm extremly self-coniouss and I just wish there was something I could do. But worst of all it seems to be getting worse and not only am I getting depressed, I'm getting worried.

I don't think it is particularly significant at this point.  The concerning part is that you say it is getting worse.  There is a condition known as Scheuermann's kyphosis that occurs beginning in adolescence.  You may have this (although there are other causes as well).  You may want to consider being evaluated by an orthopedic surgeon.  They are basically the skeletal experts.  At this point, I think it is unlikely that you would need to have any corrective measures taken but it is always good to get an expert opinion.  Best wishes.\n\n",

The spinal fusion he had they inserted two titanium rods on each side of his spine going from T-2 right down to L-2 so now his kyphosis is at a 50-55 degree which is alot better.    My son was in surgery for 11 hours and he also had blood transfusions but he had donated his own blood and his duration in the hospital was exactally 1 week he is still not back to school as of yet but we do have a follow up visit this Friday coming at the Shriners Hospital in Montreal Canada for x-rays and a checkup we will also see the Doctor who has operated on his chest back in May for a follow up.   We also just found out that my son is now diagnosed with Marfans Syndrome which I guess is all related to his chest and spine issues.  It just seems like one thing after another.    Anyway just wanted to let you know you are not alone with the hump on your back.  Please get it checked if you haven't already.  Good Luck irisheyes2006\n\n",

    "content": "My daughter, age 14, is sufferening from pain in her right arm, hand up upto the fingers for the last three weeks. She is feeling neckpain too. The pain in the arm moves its position, sometimes towards shoulder and sometimes near hand and sometimes in the whole arm. Sometimes she feels pulsating pain in fingers too. Consulted child specialist, general physician and neuro surgeon, all say nothing wrong. X-rays of c-spine show no indication of any problem with neck discs/joints. Her neck muscle feel hard, and when she moves her head towards right or left she feels pain in the neck. She used to sleep on a small sofa in a very auckward manner, she watches a lot of TV, and use computer for movie watching. Please suggest what to do so that she is relieved of this pain. All the doctors just gave pain killer liquids, and medicines containg vitamins or which are given to remove weakness. Her blood cp report is also ok. She has been absent from her school for the last one and half week due to this pain. She weeps due to pain in her right arm specially in the evening, she can't sleep upto late night due to this sever pain. She wakes up in the morning disturbed from this pain. Please help how can she get well. I being her father, seeing her in this condition, am very very tense.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Severe pain in the right arm and neck",
    "content": "Hello -  In  some people, especially the young, there can sometimes be muscle spasm in the neck, pressing on nerves which serve the arm and hand on the affected side. This  can result from improper posture, a sudden awkward movement of the head,  or even from cool air blowing on the neck at times. None of this would show up on x-ray unless there is inability to carry the head in the correct position, nor if there is no bulging disc in the cervical spine.  In young patients it often is simply a spasm which \"locks up.\" Sometimes inadequate electrolytes, especially potassium, can lend to this sort of spasticity.    It sounds, in the case of your daughter, as though a nerve serving the arm has been compressed (due to muscle spasm most likely). If the problem doesn't respond to pain medication, icing, or muscle relaxants,  then a neurologist my have to be consulted and perhaps even a nerve conduction study done (an annoying but non-invasive test taking about a half-hour, to see if a nerve is impinged).   Hopefully things will resolve on their own before it gets to that point, but in any case I hope this is helpful to you.  Please follow  up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Dr. Thanks a lot for your concernt in my case and in my daughter. I just wanted to let you know the happenings which I observed over the past few days. I would request you to suggest what to do as I don't believe here the doctors in Pakistan are paying any attention to this proble. My daughter use to perform the following excercises about 7 times a day with each session comprizing of 15 minutes.  1.She moved both her arms around her shoulder, clockwise and anti-clockwise, while standing on her foot finger side (She kept her toe above the ground) 2.While letting her both hands in free position (normal hanging arms), she moved her shoulders, both clockwise and anti-clockwise, while standing on her foot finger side (She kept her toe above the ground) 3.She fixed the fingers of both hands behind neck firmly and let her face and head move to extreme right and extreme left, while standing on her foot finger side (She kept her toe above the ground) 4.While sitting on the bed, she moved her head all around her neck, both clock wise and anti-clockwise.  The pain her right arm which used to be very severe, she always began to weep due to it, became bearable. After each excercise session she felt severe pain in the arm which remained for some time. But for the remaining time, mild bearable remained permanent.  Then I bought her a neck collar and told her to wear it all the time except when she performs excercise. Mild pain remained in her arm, and the pain gone a bit severe after each excercise session but it was not that severe that she could weep.  Then for the last couple of days, I told her to quit excercise and put on the collar all the time and see what happens. She still feels mild pain which sometimes boosts a bit but not much. But still she is uncomfortable to use right hand for writing and doing physical phytigue. The pain increases whenever she uses right hand. Otherwise the arm, hands, fingers are all ok, work well, sense well, just the pain.  Please let me know what to do? Should I take her to another neuro surgeon or what you suggest about excercise and neck collar. Would you suggest any other excercise?  I'll be grateful if you spare you precious time. You valuable suggestion means a lot to me and is the basis of my confidence and satisfaction that my daughter will get well soon by the Grace of God.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello again -  It sounds as though the exercises you've taught your daughter have caused some improvement in the muscle spasm of the neck. The cervical collar can sometimes also be a good idea, depending on the underlying cause of the problem, and also can certainly help prevent aggravation of the muscle spasm during daily activities.  You might want to have your daughter be seen by a neurologist or orthopedist if the problem continues, unless it is still improving. She may benefit from one of the more mild muscle relaxants, especially at bedtime, since these can sometimes make the patient drowsy. If the problem seems to become chronic, a neurologist could perform a nerve conduction test to try and pinpoint the area of trouble and this might help with forming a treatment plan, but it sounds as though you've done a good job of helping the muscle spasm loosen up on your own.  If there are further problems or questions, please feel free to follow up with us here further. Best of luck to you both.\n\n",

Here is the situation, she wrote the following herself:  25-year-old female. No past diagnoses or surgeries relating to back pain. Family history doesn't include any back issues. Current mediations: Ortho tri cyclin, Phentermine, levothyroxine.  Sudden and severe lower back pain, started about a week ago. I can't remember any incident where I might have injured it. It's the most severe when I first wake up in the morning or after exercising. Bad enough to make me gasp for breath, like getting the wind knocked out of you, but doesn't seem to limit my range of movement or physically prevent me from doing anything. Taking a deep breath causes some pain. I haven't found anything that relieves it in any way (Tylenol doesn't help, neither does rest, heat, ice etc.).\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Sudden and severe lower back pain",
    "content": "There are many causes of acute low back pain.  In general most acute low back pain is self limiting.  What is interesting with your case is that movement of the spine is not restricted nor painful.  This leads me to think of internal structures of the body rather than the spine itself e.g. kidneys, lungs, pancreas,uterus etc as the source of pain. It would be worthwhile seeing for family physician who can take a complete history and focussed physical with appropriate tests.  Red flags for acute low back pain are: numbness or tingling in leg or legs, saddle paresthesia (numbness in the groin area), leg weakness, inability to urinate.  In older folks, sudden onset, pain that wakes person at night, weight loss, fever, and hx of osteoporosis.   Some areas to think about: pain with urination, last menstrual cycle, hx of endometriosis, problems with ovarian cyst, pregnancy, diarrhea or constipation, nausea or vomiting, fever, cough, and abdominal pain or discomfort.    Musculoskeletal questions would be: Hx of scoliosis? Any pregnancies and deliveries - Sacroiliac joint problems occur more commonly in young and middle age women especially after pregnancy.  Again, follow up with family physician at this point is important.\n\n",

How much weight do you carry (how much do you weigh) Any muscle tightness in the legs especially hamstrings?  Any new shoes including athletic or dress?

    "content": "Hello,   This pain could be due to a muscle spasm from viral infection as your doctor mentioned. It is usually  accompanied with low grade fever and nausea.  Muscle spasm alone can cause this pain and can also be of an unidentified cause. Inappropriate posture for long time like traveling, driving and certain types of work aggravates the condition.  Self care and avoiding the precipitating cause will lead to a gradual but clear improvement in the pain. Home treatment includes the use of Analgesics, cold or hot therapy. Rest for maximum two days is also beneficial.   Another likely cause is pleurisy.Pleurisy is an inflammation of the pleura, which is a double-layered membrane, covers the lungs separating it from the rib cage. Viral infections like flu, are the most common cause of Pleurisy. The pain is felt as sharp pain which get worse by Coughing, sneezing, moving and deep breathing. Auscultation of the chest shows a characteristic sound known as pleural rub.   The condition is also treated with rest, analgesics, and plenty of fluids.  I would advise you to follow up with your doctor.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  I don't know the percentage of the population, but an \"incidental\" cervical rib is not uncommon and can cause a lot of discomfort and sometimes limit range of motion. It is an unintended extra, vestigial rib on the posterior part of the upper thorax, seemingly coming  off the cervical spine. It can cause a lot of symptoms similar to those caused by thoracic outlet syndrome, and certainly could account for your symptoms. Usually it is either treated symptomatically or, failing at that,  can be removed surgically.   I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

It does not hurt when i touch it but strangely the pain goes away once i get that area massaged or when i apply a heat pad..why is that? After i get it massaged and take deep breaths its fine but after a while it comes back again. when i use the bathroom its fine nothing looks diffrent. And i will add that it hurts when i lean forward and take deep breaths but when i stand up straight i feel no pain. I'm freaking out can anyone please tell me what it could be? Could it be cause i took too much Theraflu and medications because i had the flu over the holiday? Or the ackward movement when i was sitting down (because thats when i started feeling the pain) kidney problems?

    "content": "Hi there -  It sounds as though most likely you've injured an abdominal muscle. The fact that it can be  reproduced by certain maneuvers and started after an awkward movement which was similar to what causes it now, along with the fact that it responds to both massage and heat, suggests a muscle pull. At the time of your post it had been not quite a week, so it should  have begun to resolve shortly after that, although since it would seem to be a voluntary muscle in a \"busy\" area of your body (involved in breathing, twisting, etc.), it could be re-aggravated repeatedly,  especially by your testing of it.   If this doesn't resolve on its own within another few days, by all means see a doctor (for muscle relaxant and/or pain medication prescriptions). Otherwise, I think you can relax (and doing so may help the muscle to  heal more quickly).  I hope this eases you mind and that by now you're feeling fine. Good luck to you.\n\n",

The diameter of the pain ranges from the size of a nickel to the size of a silver dollar, depending on how long I wait before work it out.   How long have I had this problem:  Since about May 2007.  Cause of the pain: The pain builds over time while sitting.  After sitting for about 20 minutes the pain builds to a level where I have to discontinue sitting and move to legs and back out of the L-shape.  I have found that I can sit in a chair longer that 20 minutes with less sever pain if I do not use  the back of the chair to rest my back on. (Sitting on the seat of the chair and not letting my back touch the back of the chair.)  How does the pain feel: Like an internal soreness, not a sharp pain.  Sometimes tingly and sometimes burning. If I sit too long it feels like a knot.  It does not hurt to push on the area.  I do not feel any bulges or indents.  Nothing feels out of place.   It does not hurt to move any part of my body in any normal direction.  What eases the pain: Laying down, Standing up, Walking, Exercising, Stretching, Massaging the area of the pain\u2026anything other than sitting.  What makes the pain go away completely and makes me feel normal: Walking.  Questions: 1) What do you think is causing my pain? 2) Do you feel I would benefit from Physical Therapy? 3) What type of testing do you recommend I seek?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  The pain you describe sounds like muscle strain related at least in part to your seated posture. While your posture may not be defective in itself, if there is a misalignment of your spine then sitting in what seems at first to be comfortable may soon become painful and force you to move around. Of course you could have adopted a defective sitting habit as well -- it is difficult to recognize what we're doing subjectively such as sitting in relatively odd positions.   If I were you I'd either want  to see an orthopedist or at the very least a board certified chiropractor.  Either of these may be able to evaluate your posture and, if there is no problem there, then you could be evaluated for a lumbar or sacral disc bulge (a possibility here). Even with that diagnosis you might well be able to correct it with PT or chiropractic or simple floor and stretching exercises.   If there is an ergonomist on the staff where you're employed, this is often a good way to avoid future problems (by having the ergonomist make adjustments to your immediate working environment such as changing the height of your keyboard, chair, etc., things which seem simple but are widespread causes of aggravation of lower back problems among other things).  I hope you find this helpful. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I'm a 16 year old male who is having some back pain.  I am in good physical shape.  This afternoon I got some what started as some moderately uncomfortable pain in the upper left part of my back.  The pain can extend down into my lower back sometimes.  It's all on my left side.  I also notice I am breathing irregularly and the left side of my chest feels rather tight.    My parents are not sure if this is serious enough to go hike up to the ER and probably spend most of my night there.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  Hopefully by now the problem was diagnosed and resolved, but it could have been one of several things, some more worth the ER visit than others. Since the pain was one-sided and you were having some difficulty breathing, you might have had pleurisy (an irritation of the lining between the lung and diaphragm, and can be quite painful in the area you describe, especially when inhaling); you could have had a small pneumothorax, where a small \"bleb\" or thin spot on a lung pops, allowing some air into the pleural space with similar results. This would be worth ruling out at the ER.   Were the pain and tightness not one-sided I might have suggested asthma, which can sneak  up on some people with similar symptoms,  but almost always bilateral (on both sides).   Then  again,  you might have pulled a muscle. At any rate, I hope you are now feeling much better. Please do follow up with us and let us know how things turned out.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: long term treatment for severe back pain",
    "content": "Hello -  If nerve pain blockers have been tried and failed there are limited non-narcotic drug approaches. If you are prescribed opioids for the pain then they'll range from the relatively mild (tramadol) to long-acting morphine in capsule form, but these approaches (especially the latter) have their untoward side effects, especially as you move up the ladder in terms of their power to mask pain. You and your doctor will have to sit down and discuss all the pros and cons of opioid therapy, but only if nerve pain blockers or an injected nerve block have been tried first. You might also look into accupuncture, which is effective for a number of patients when medication doesn't work.   There is, of course, also the  possibility of further surgery, which again would have to be discussed in terms of risk vs. benefit. Each potential remedy has its pros and cons. Finding a doctor who specializes in pain management (often a neurologist) is probably your best bet.   Good luck to you with this.\n\n",

    "content": "My wife has injured her back at work. Although she does have a pcp and regular health insurance she was sent to a redicare type clinic and was eventually referred to orthopedics. She has had very little dr contact there and most of it was negative. She has spent about 1.5 hours per week in pt for the last two months. She did stop taking meds because of sever hives and mouth and throat swelling. When she told her Dr this she was told that she was bringing it on herself. When the Phys Therapist observed it she made some phone calls and told her to stop taking the meds. About a month ago she did have an mri which showed a little stenosis but nothing unusual Two weeks ago she was referred to a pain clinic who gave here the 6 most painfull shots she ever had in her life. (diagnostic Nerve block) There was no positve result from this. The dr did not contact her afterwards but simply scheduled a intraarticular SI injection. They haven't even explained what this is or why they want to do it. We do not feel comfortable that the PT was appropriate or adequate, that the orthopedics office worked well for us or that the pain center is being upfront about what they are doing for procedeures. She does not want to be one of their permanant customers. Question: Should we be concerned that the Pain Dr feels he has a green light to do extensive needle therapy, are there other alternatives Can and should she go to her PCP for a sort of treatment intervention and seek second opinions?   thanks You in advance JR\n\n",

I would definitely involve the regular PCP for a second opinion (or perhaps make it the first one, in reverse order).

    "content": "Hello -  Lack of insurance can be a huge hurdle sometimes, but when your health is the tradeoff then you need to bit the bullet. You injured your back and now, probably due to accomodation of the original injury you've gotten things more out of alignment. These things rarely get better on their own, as I take it you're now learning. Please do see a doctor and try not to anticipate the reaction due to your age. All ages of people  can have painful orthopedic injuries, happens all the time. Exotic pain meds may not be required. Perhaps a local steroid injection, physical therapy, maybe even surgery, would resolve this. There's rarely a need to resort to opiods up front. Many a patient goes into the orthopedist's in agony only to walk out a half-hour later feeling one hundred per cent better because of a well-placed steroid injection. Sometimes muscle relaxants are all that's needed.   Please give medicine a chance and allow yourself an opportunity to think clearly without so much chronic pain. It's more than worth it.   Please follow up with us here. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello  I am 32 years old, M in very good physical condition.  I don't smoke, drink or use drugs.  In December of last year I woke up to look at the alarm clock.  I felt my neck crack and it followed by a couple of weeks of stiff neck. I used ibuprofen to releve pain and inflammation.  Then in early Jan I developed sudden and more sever stiff neck with pain down my right arm and numbness in my first two fingertips.  I was sent to the dr  by  my employer.  Was initially treated with toradol and sklaxin.  No relief.  I had an MRI done that shows a herniated disk at c6.  I was then sent to a pain dr that did a steriod shot in my neck.  It worked wonders!  Virtually pain free with most of my strength returning to my arm. This whole process took about 5 weeks.  The pain dr said I may need a shot 2-3 times a year to remain pain free.  Now fast forward 5 months...  I was working yesterday and while I was lifting a 30lb panel shoulder height, I turned my head to look at the machine and I felt cracking and instant pain in the same spot.  Back to the work comp dr I go.  He does not think that it is the herniated disc, only pulled muscle.  I am having same symptoms as before, pain in neck and scapula with pain radiating down right arm and numbness in right index finger.  With some swelling last night in the area that is hurt.  I am using toradol and sklaxin again with very little relief.  I did have some left over norco and flexeril that the pain dr had given me that I took at bed time last night with more relief.  DR says herniated disc pain comes on slowly and does'nt just happen all the sudden.  I really feel that I need to be sent back to the pain dr for a follow up and possiblly another shot, however the work comp dr is saying 4-6 weeks of conservative tx first.     I don't know if I am getting the care I deserve and I really don't want to go through 6 weeks of pain when I could possibly get the steroid shot and get relief.  Would really just like your opinion about treatment on an injury of this sort.  Should I wait it out conservativly or push to see the pain dr?\n\n",

They are pretty much in the driver's seat when it comes to medical decisions, as they will approve (or not) what you'd like to have done, and are, of course, looking at the bottom line, as they are insurers and  the doctors can't really force the issue as they ought to be able to do.   Hopefully by now something has happened to get you the pain management you seek, especially since the steroid injection probably would once again work wonders. Good luck with this!\n\n",

It sounds like you may have some compression of one of the nerves of your back in such a way that lying flat or sitting puts extra pressure on it.

Moving in itself caused more pain making it nearly impossible to sleep.  In any case, the following day it took me a long while to get up due to the pain - thankfully I wasn't working. My mother who's a nurse, said I have to get up and get my muscles moving or else they might cramp up, so i did - although it hurt.   Today I'm feeling about 50% better; i.e. I am more moble, but there is still pain. I know it's hard to diagnose without an x-ray, but given my description, would you say that i probably pulled a muscle and, as you advised the young man earlier, need time to heal?? If so what else can i do to speed up the healing process?  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Krish,  I cannot comment specifically on your situation regarding substituting medications because I do not have access to your medical record, nor can I evaluate you directly so before making any changes to your medicines I would recommend you contact your doctor or who ever is on call for your doctor to see if it is safe.  In general, there may actually be a concern about changing from an injected mecobalamin to an oral one.  Usually this particular vitamin is well stored and easily absorbed so if there is deficiency it may be that there is a problem absorbing it from the GI tract.  There are various reasons for this.  The injection bypasses all these problems and restores the levels.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello everyone.  I have recently been having some left arm pain, and I know that it can be a sign of something with the heart.  It is the weekend, so I don't have a doctors office open.  I have had absolutely no chest pain, just arm pain.  It isn't really even that bad of a pain, it just won't go away.  It has been here for about two days, maybe three.  It is an achey kind of pain, Mainly from my elbow down to my hand (even into my fingers).  There isn't any tingling or numbness, so that's why it scared me that it's not nerve related because isn't there usually tingling with nerve pain?  It's not a muscular pain, I've had those before.  Could it be a vascular issue?  I did some researching online before I came here to see if I could find anything so I didn't have to waste you kind peoples time, but couldn't seem to find much other than blood flow problem, nerve issue, heart issue, but I don't know.  If there are any suggestions I would truly appreciate it.  I will go to the doctor on monday if it's still here.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Cowboy1978,  The location of your pain with no other symptoms makes a cardiac problem less likely.  It may be that you have some compression of a nerve further down in your arm (rather than at your spinal cord) causing your problems.  A vascular problem could potentially cause this type of pain but would be much less common than a nerve problem causing a little atypical pain.  Seeing your doctor is a good idea.

Degeneratve disk disease can cause significant pain.  Also, the mild cord compression and canal stenosis can put pressure on the nerves of the spinal cord causing pain.

First, I don't understand how a herniation could get better.  Could it go away entirely with more time?  If it did would these other problems go away too? I'm wondering if any of these are a result of this injury because I never had back pain before I became injuried. I'm assuming the cord compression is from the herniation, but is canal stenosis?  I should mention I am a 54 year old male, 6\" tall, 200 lb and in otherwise good health. My 80 year old mother has degenerative disk disease.  Could that be brought on earlier in life as a result of this injury? If so, it's been 6 years ago, will it keep getting worse?  I know I've ask you alot of questions...and I'm sorry, but I'm having trouble sleeping because I just can't fit the puzzle together in my mind. I promise I will be satisfied with whatever you reply this time and I won't repost any more.  Thank you again.\n\n",

A C.T. scan done on October 26,2007 showed a Lower Left L-5 Lamina Fracture. The written report stated it was an old stress fracture. I discussed this today with the Surgeon who performed the Spinal Fusion.He said that there was no need for any surgery on the fractured Lamina.  He also said that there appeared to be some new bone growth in that area around the Lamina. He said that the cause of my pain was probably Arthritis. My question is how can the fractured Lamina be no cause for concern ?.  I have tried various medications for pain control, including Tramadol, Percoset, Vicodin. None of these worked . I started taking 30 mg. per day of Methodone three weeks ago.  Only in the past 6 days have I felt some relief for the pain.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Jofama,  Generally, the spine is held together so strongly by the ligaments and muscles that a small fracture does not need surgical repair.  It will often heal just fine on its own, although it can cause pain.  Unfortunately, back injuries tend to result in chronic back pain, even if surgery is done.  Arthritis does set in and can be difficult to treat.  Physical therapy may be of some benefit.  If you begin to have shooting pains down your legs this may be a sign of a nerve compression that may need other treatment so you should see your doctor again.    One other thing you may want to look into is leg length discrepancies.  This is probably more common than we think.  Even a small difference in leg lengths can cause on going back pain.  Some relief can be felt by using a shoe lift to correct the differences in length.  Best wishes.\n\n",

You may find intermittent heat is helpful and some rest (not bedrest) and possibly nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen or naproxin should help.  If your doctor felt this was something more serious he would likely have ordered additional tests and if it does not resolve on its own may do so yet.  In most cases watchful waiting is the best thing to do because the body often repairs itself before the expensive testing needs to be done.    Good luck.  It is never convenient to have pain.\n\n",

Her injury happened when her feet were pulled up over her head in a backwards summer-salt action.  The injury was diagnosed 40 years ago as a neck sprain and was treated as such.  She was out in a matter of days playing and riding horses with no evidence of an injury with exception to the home-made neck collar that she wore.  She is now claiming that her neck was broken/snapped in the incident because she was unable to hold her head up.  This is a family debate that has come up often.

I have multiple earlobe knots. My feet are always ice cold & sometime my hands. Also, i've noticed when i look at my self in a mirror one shoulder looks shorter & higher than the other. & when i walk it feels like one leg is shorter/higher.

I have an older sister that has degenerative disc disease & i had a Great Uncle that was hunched over really bad, so i guess it could be in the family? Anyhow, any input would be appreciated! Thanks, NCRW40\n\n",

    "content": "For the past 3 days I have been having some weird symptoms, and I am not sure why. The middle of my spine gets these sudden achy pains that last for a few minutes. The ribs connecting to that part of my spine also hurt where they connect and just past that part. The upper part of my stomach also has the same achy feeling that coincides with my spinal pain. The pain has been getting worse, and now tonight I have been having the feeling of nausea. I noticed if I lie down or lean back in a chair it will hurt, but if I sit without support it is fine. About a week ago, I was lifting heavy boxes and the lower part of my spine hurt after awhile, but it is not the same part that hurts now. Could this have helped cause the pain I am having? And does this sound familiar to anyone? I am not sure if I sure be worried about it or not.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm 24, F, no dx as yet due to lack of insurance, arthroscopic knee surgery 10 yrs ago, family history of cancer, diabetes, etc.  I take hydrocodone, elavil, and motrin for pain; albuterol for asthma; a multivitamin.  Progressing over the last ten years but drastically increasing to a debilitating degree 2 years ago till now, I have had excruciating pain, stiffness, and limited range of motion (when applicable) in my spine (from mid-thoracic down), sacrum, hips, and knees (esp. R).  I also have muscle pain, weakness, and spasms in my legs.  It's unrelenting, even with medication.  Not to mention that the drugs completely kill my brain and make me even more low-energy than without them.  I do PT every day (stretch, strengthen, and light cardio when able), I eat well, I push myself like everyone says to, but most days it's difficult to leave my bed.  I've been prescribed crutches, but I don't use them much b/c my family (who I recently moved back with) has a negative view.  W/o assistance, I can't walk more than 100 ft without stopping to rest.  If I am able to get the resources to see a real doctor (as opposed to free clinic), how can I expedite the process to figuring out what is wrong with me so I can get my life back?  What tests, if any, should I request?    Any idea what could be the problem?  What can I do to increase my mobility, decrease my pain, and start participating in the world again?  I hate to say that, the way my legs are right now (severe pain and weakness), using a wheelchair seems like the only way I will be able to have a semi-active lifestyle again.  When I was in a manual wheelchair a few years ago, it was the most liberated I had ever felt--I could go and go without getting tired and I was happy and energized and could cope with the (reduced) pain.  Is this an avenue to pursue as a viable option or is there hope down another path?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Meridianblack,  It sounds like you are in quite severe pain.  Seeing a doctor will be very important.  I would recommend that you see either a primary care doctor or an orthopedic surgeon (bone/muscle specialist) first.  This way you can get a thorough evaluation that can help guide the work-up.  You may be developing some osteoarthritis although you're a bit young for this typically.  There are several rheumatologic diseases that can do this as well.  Using a wheelchair may be a necessary step for you, although it may not necessarily be permanent.  If it helps you to be able to move around and function then this may be something to explore even if for the short term.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Mafontes,  Basically, what this is saying is that you have a bulging disk at L5 due to the vertebra above it slipping and being compressed some. The vertebra is the bone and the disk is the cushion in between vertebrae.  The bulging disk is pressing on one of the nerve roots.  This is one of the main nerves that supplies sensation to the leg/foot.  This compression is what is causing the pain in your leg/toe.  Sometimes physical therapy can help this, along with rest.  In some severe cases, surgery may be needed.    Seeing your primary care doctor is a good place to start.  If needed, you can be referred to a neurosurgeon or spine surgeon for further evaluation.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Allison,  It sounds like you may have a pinched nerve in the back from a slipped spinal disk.  In particular, the shooting pains down the leg make me think this is the case.  The classic test for this is the \"straight leg raise\" where the pain is made much (often much, much) worse by raising the lower leg straight while sitting upright.  If this is the case treatment often is by rest and physical therapy but in severe cases more intensive treatment (or rarely surgery) may be needed.  I would recommend you be evaluated if at all possible.  Often there are clinics that can see patients on a free or reduced fee basis for those without insurance.  Your local health department can usually help find these clinics if needed.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I have had degenerative disk disease since being diagnosed in 1992. I have had one surgery in 2003 (April). I have also had just about every other treatment known and my condition keeps getting worse. I also have severe lower leg and foot pain in both legs that gets very bad just 10 to 15 minutes after standing up and then takes many hours to go away. I have been to every kind of specialist that would have anything at all to do with those body parts and it remains undiagnosed. This makes me think it's linked somehow to my back problems. I am currently 46 years old and have been on Social Security Disability since Feb. 2006, full, complete, and permanent, I think is how they put in on the paperwork I received from the Judge. I have been treated continuously for the last seven years strait for pain management (oxycontin 80mg x2, and Vicodin 5/500 for breakthrough) although from different doctors due to a few  moves. Florida to kentucky, back to Florida, then to Ohio. I never had any serious problems until now. All of my doctors have always told me under no circomstances will you ever let yourself run out of medication or try to stop without constant medical supervision because it can be very dangerous. Now the doctor I was seeing here in Ohio quit the practice and left the office. I went to my schedualed appointment Friday and was told the will no longer fill my perscriptions. I told them I can't stop taking it because of the severe pain and also I'm scared to death what will happen to me from stopping just all at once after all my other doctors told how dangerous that would be. I've tried to get in to another doctors office but they don't seem to care what's going on and they say I'll have to wait anywhere from two months to nine months to get in to see a doctor. What should I do? How can I get in to see a doctor in this situation with no cooperation from the previous office? Also, they gave me absolutely no reason for this. I have been drug tested and passed, have absolutely no history of abuse or any other wrongdoing. Isn't there some kind of ethical or moral obligation to continue treatment until a new doctor or pain management clinic can be found? Please help me, I'm terrified.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, There is no obligation for a doctor or clinic to treat you, regardless of your past history.  It is your responsibility to find care.  I know this sounds harsh but you will need to take charge here and find a new doctor.  Your treatment may be different than what you received in the past because each doctor treats according to his/her own knowledge and experience base so there are no guarantees you will get exactly what you ask for.    I don't know why  your doctor told you it would be dangerous for you to stop taking pain medications, except for the pain return itself, unless he/she is concerned you are addicted to prescription pain relievers and could have withdrawal symptoms.    You may research alternative medicine such as acupuncture, hypnotherapy, or chronic pain clinics to find something that will work that is not narcotic-based.  Constant use of narcotics does lead to long-term problems so if you can find another way to live with your condition, it would be good for many reasons.    If you believe your only success was with a doctor in another state and you insist on that treatment, you may have to return to the place you were to get it.  There are few things any harder to live with than chronic back pain.  I wish you the best in your quest for help.\n\n",

    "content": "The \"crunchy\" sounds could be due to a condition called \"crepitus\" resulting from joint degeneration.  This could be from osteoarthritis, autoimmune disorders or other problems.  If this is the case it probably can \"pop\" again immediately after in the same place.  If it cannot repeat again just as before within 15 to 30 minutes, it is more likely cavitation - like \"popping\" or \"cracking\" your knuckles and the vacuum needs a little time to recover.  The stiffness could be from your sleep position.    Some people get relief with a trusted brand of glucosamine (a supplement) in the former and/or adjustments by a chiropractor and intermittent heat application if it is due to sleep positioning.  Simple \"cracking\" is not harmful.    I won't pretend to know this is really what is going on here without an examination - it's just my best shot.  Good luck with it.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Tomosaka,  Lower back pain is very difficult to deal with.  It is, unfortunately, quite common and treatment often involves using non-steroidal pain medicines, physical therapy and in extreme cases surgery.  Surgery is generally a last resort because complications are somewhat common and occasionally the outcomes are worse.  The pain in your legs may be due to the nerves of your back being inflamed due to pressure on them from the degenerating disks.  It is also possible that you have some pain in your legs from the muscles tightening and trying to protect your back.  Subsequently, the legs hurt not because of the back pain but because they are constantly tense (basically getting a huge workout everyday).  I would recommend  you continue to follow up with an orthopedic surgeon.  Physical therapy may help some as well.  One important point is that when using pain medicines it is important not to \"over do it\" when the pain is better because the pain medicines only mask the issue and don't actually make it better.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I was assualted 4 days ago by another female who thought i was with her husband. she beat me pretty good. all the pain has gone away except my lower left back it is hurting so bad. i did not get an xray as I was ashamed and scared of her. I went home and laid down and it hurts so bad. I am not bleeding, i had a fever for 2 days and it does not hurt to urinate, or burn. I am afraid to go see what is wrong with me. but it hurts so bad I can sit for an hour but I have to go lie down. the darvocet does not help. we are in middle of an ice storm in oklahoma and I can not get to a hospital or clinic what should Ido?\n\n",

A doctor told me that my back MRI looked like that of a 70 year old (though i was 19), and that i had degenerative disc disease.  I had an epidural which relieved my pain almost completely.  I don't dance very much anymore.  My mom is having intense back pain, maybe arthritis or disc degeneration or something else, which has been really really impacting her life for a few years.  I am really concerned about having this sort of pain.  Is there any exercise or anything else I can do now to prevent this?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Lappel,  I would recommend you see an endocrinologist.  To have this degree of bone degeneration at your age is unusual.  The endocrinologist can help look for any conditions that may be causing you to loose calcium.  Taking a good calcium supplement daily may help some.  Basically aim for about 1500 mg per day.  Don't take it with iron or vitamins with iron because they can inhibit each other's absorption.  Taking it with orange juice is good because the citric acid helps increase absorption of calcium.  You are likely still at an age where your bone can still increase in calcium density so maximizing factors such as taking plenty of calcium may help prevent more problems in the future.  Follow up with your doctor is important.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Vipul,  Exercise is important at any age.  There is no upper limit.  There are some keys to staying safe during exercise, however.  Warming up is very important, particularly as people get older.  Start out any exercise routine by stretching the muscles involved well.  Since you are having some pain in the lower back area it may help to really stretch the lower back before exercising.  This can be done by standing and bending to touch your toes then bending down sideways on both sides and finally bending back (carefully).  Each stretch should be held for 15 to 20 seconds.  Stretch to feel the pull of the muscles but not pain.  When starting an exercise program start slowly and build up.  As an example, a runner should not start their exercise after not exercising with a five mile run.  Instead, start at a 1/2 mile run and slowly work up as the body becomes more conditioned.  Exercise is very valuable and has countless health benefits.  I applaud you in your efforts to stay fit.  Best wishes.\n\n",

My dad has sciataca (hope I spelled that right) issues and I am currently on 600 MG Ibuprofen and 800 MG Skelaxin for my lower back pain, which is only present on my left side, with slight pain that radiates from time to time into my rump.  No pain on the right side at all.  What I have is a dull ache that is always there, no matter what I do.  The Skelaxin doesn't seem to be working, and chiropractic visits have been a temporary fix for years.  I want to treat the cause not the symptom of whatever this is.  My doctor ordered an X-Ray, but I have a 500 dollar deductible to meet before it will be covered, and I'm nowhere near that 500 dollar mark.  I know that there is only so much info you can give me about this online, but both my chiropractor and I believe it to be my SI joint.  I'm in constant pain and want to ask for some pain meds, but, because I'm on Zoloft for depression, I'm afraid my doctor will think I'm just after pills, which I'm not.  I just don't want to hurt anymore.  Any suggestions?  Paul\n\n",

I have a chiropractic appointment Monday afternoon, and my doctor there has told me he can do the X-Rays for me at a lower cost (He treats me well).  My question is, and I don't mean to slight ANYONE here, but how likely is it that my general practicioner will go with the results found by my chiropractor?  I ask this only because I know some medical doctors don't believe in chiropractic medicine (I, however, am a firm believer!).  No disrespect is intended at all here.  I just want an idea as to how a general practicioner might treat these results before I plunk down my money.  Thanks again,  Paul\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for the advice doctor.  I went and had those X-Rays done and they showed some slight degeneration where my back is hurting.  My doctor prescribed me 800 MG of Skelaxin and 600 MG of Ibuprofen but it does nothing to help.  Doesn't even touch the dull ache that's always there..    I had some vicodins (like two of them) left over from a root canal I had done six months or so ago and they seemed to help, but I'm afraid my doctor will think I'm just after painkillers.  I'm not, but vicodin is the only thing that seemed to help.  What's the best way to ask my doctor for vicodin?  Dumb, loaded question I know, but I'm so tired of hurting.  Any help is appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Providence210,  With pain from the head to the toe, in order to isolate the problem to only one area, the problem would need to be somewhere higher than the brainstem.  It is pretty hard to tie all this together in one problem but a spinal cord issue would not be able to cause pain from head to toe unless it was at the very top (which is unlikely).  I would recommend you see a neurologist for further evaluation.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Your past surgeries potentially have caused some scar tissue to begin to form that may now be pressing on the nerve.  It's probably a good idea to have this evaluated by your doctor.  You may need some further imaging of your back like an MRI.  This is not imminently dangerous but sometimes the numbness can progress.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I don't have any arm or hand pain or paresthesias and I have not had any type of injury/no accident.  I was referred to a Neurologist and had x-rays and an MRI which showed degenerative changes at multiple levels (C3-C7) including multiple ruptured and bulging discs, posterior and anterior osteophytes, foraminal narrowing and a mild C6-5 spondylolisthesis (he said it was less than 1/4 of the vertebral body and not anything to worry about).  He also said the nerve roots and spinal cord were not endangered at this time and recommended an epidural injection (steroid) if the PT doesn't seem to help.    I have read that cervical spondylolisthesis is rare.  Just how unstable is it (how likely is it that it will slip forward causing nerve root or spinal cord problems) and would the epidural block symptoms that might otherwise be telling me that it is slipping?  My doctors seem more concerned about all the degenerative changes in my spine.  I am 47 years old.  Thanks, Nancy\n\n",

There are no guarantees for this - surgical or otherwise.  Some people benefit from physical therapy and/or injections, both minimally invasive,  in cases such as yours.  Your doctor would be the one to advise here. It doesn't hurt to seek a second opinion, especially where surgery is involved.  It also doesn't hurt to try the other treatments before opting for surgery.  Medicine is part science and part art.  Each doctor you see may have a slightly different view on your treatment.

    "content": "26/M, no surgeries or major injuries.  However for more than a year now, I have had intermittent severe tightness/pain in the mid-right part of my back.  Some days are better than others but it never goes away entirely.  Deep breaths hurt.  Sitting in a chair and twisting my body to the left is the most painful.  I think this originally stemmed from not stretching well enough before a softball game (after not being active for a while) and then compounded by landing hard on my back during a football game.  I've had x-rays done twice, everything looks ok.  I've taken muscle relaxants and anti-inflammatories.  Been to a Chiropractor - that didn't help at all.  Massage seemed to make it worse.  My PCP can't pinpoint it.  The general concensus (or hypothesis I suppose) is that it's a muscle or group of muscles that are in constant spasm.  But for over a year??  I've played sports all my life and I've been injured of course but I've never had anything persist even close to this long.  Is it possibly a rib or maybe even a lung?  If it is a muscle - how can I remedy this when stretching seems to make it worse?  Please advise, I feel like this is never going to go away...\n\n",

To aid healing in the future - after using ice for the first 48 hours for inflammation, you may wish to move to heat intermittently after that to increase the blood flow, thus facilitating healing.

I went to the store yesterday, trying to move instead of loafing on the couch.  I only picked up a few things. By the time I reached the counter I was completly exhausted and in horrible pain.  I was sweating like I had been running a marathon.  It took all I had to get to my truck crawl in (4x4) and drive home.  Yes I am over weight. Mostly to thyroid disease and 4 pregnancies and steriods and depression meds. I know I have several things going on.. However my weight has never stopped me before.. I know it's a huge issue and plays a huge part in some of my issues.  I will see a different doc on the 28, since my normal dr can't see me until the 12 of sept. If anyone can give any help to what is going on and if activity is okay for me.. I get so out of breath when walking this didn't start until the back issue..    Thank you for your time and any help you can give  ps I'm 32 with 3 children  ~Rhonda\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Rhonda,  There are a few things that may be going on.  I suspect that you may have something more than a simple pulled muscle although this would be possible.  Autoimmune diseases such as lupus tend to run in packs so it is possible that you may have a condition called ankylosing spondylitis that can cause spinal pain.    Your lupus may also be causing your symptoms.  I'm glad to see you have an appointment with your doctor.  This type of pain should be evaluated to see if further studies are needed.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I have been in one car accident (pretty bad) but that was over 5 years ago. taking percocet for pain! okay I have had this on going issue since i was a child my mom sent me to the doctor when i was really younge for it and they did not find anything but they ran no tests and just did a phsyical. When i had my chil di had to be rushed to the er because i could not move because of the problem and they had to induce me early because of it. I have this weird pain that i get it starts out in my bones it feels like...Like deep in my butt bones. all the way into my hips and my lower back. It starts out of no where  but gets worse if its very cold outside or if I walk os sometimes even sit to mich. once it starts to come on it take over 2 days to feel better. The pain is not like life threatening but it kinda feels like something it scraping at my bones. I can feel at time s it feels like the are grinding together but it does not feel like the excrusiationg pain that that would cause. it more like a internal scraping feeling. It also gets this numb tingly feeling in my bones. It has gotten worse from when i was a child. and now that i have a child i move around alot more nad it hurts more and comes on more. I would say i have about 10 to 15 experiences with this a month. Well the other day I was going to the bathroom just sat down to go pee adn I got the excvrusiationg pain in my lower back. I tried standing up and it hurt more i sat down adn it it more I tried moving and layign down and just anything that i thought would help adn it all made it worse it only lasted for about 2 minutes but it felt like my back was breaking in slow motion. It even hurt to breath. it came on so sudden! then a couple days later i was sitting at the dinning roomtable eating and it came on agin only worse. I have a very arhced lower back adn when i went to get up i realised that my lower back was completly straight which is very impossible i thought like someone was pushing through my stomach onto my spine to straighten it out completty like my spine got stuck. the wierdest feeling ever liek my back was breaking and like evry move i made made it worse. it has been a couple days since it has happened but I was wondering if the two things are symptoms of the same thing.  I am going to he doctor again saturday for this pain because it scares me! please just help me! what do you think is wrong with me!   thank you\n\n",

When spinous processes are painful to touch there is a possibility that there is a fracture or infection setting in.

I have seen many patients placed in halo's with good outcomes; however, with the displaced portions of the fracture surgery may be needed.  I would recommend you discuss this with a neurosurgeon that can look at your scans to see exactly how the fractures line up and advise you better on which approach would be most appropriate.

    "content": "About two weeks ago, I started feeling tingling sensations in my left arm. A couple of days after I noticed my left ankle began to swell. This lasted for about four days before I finally when to see a primary care physician. He prescribed Prednisone 20mg and told me to come back for a follow up in two weeks. The tingling has subsided, but my arm still aches and has a feeling of heaviness. I also noticed during the course of my predinsone that my ribcage felt like it was inflamed. The swelling in my ankle seemed to increase and spread to my upper legs and knees and now is affecting both legs. I normally weigh around 125 and have gained about 15 lbs. in the past two weeks and am now becoming worried. Was wondering if this could be an indication of something worse. I'm 24 years old and have never had these symptoms before, so needless to say I'm worried.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Terribeth,  There are a few possibilities I can think of off hand.  First you may have a herniated disk in your back pushing on the spinal cord.  Another thing that fits better is a condition called tethered cord syndrome.  It occurs when the nerves at the bottom of the spinal cord, which are normally loose, are bound to the bottom of the spinal bones.  Then, as the patient grows the spinal cord becomes stretched.  It causes pain in a \"saddle\" distribution along the inner thighs.  It can also cause problems with bowel and bladder function.  This can be tested for with an MRI of the lower spine.  I would recommend you see your doctor about this for an exam.  If there is suspicion of a tethered cord I would recommend you have an MRI.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I had shooting lower back pain, particularly on my left lower back/buttock area.  I went to the Chiropractor and he \"took x-rays and had re-aligned by spine\".  I have been for 6 visits so far in the last 2 weeks.  I am feeling better but still have aching pain in this lower back/left buttock area, especially in the morning.  I believe this area is just stiff but am seeking a medical opinion.  After stretching this area by doing the V sit and reach exercise and streatching my hamstring, the ache goes away until I sit for a decient period of time or relax for a long time?  Any advise?  Should I take an anti-inflammatory?  How much longer should I expect for total pain relief?  Should I continue to see the Chiropractor?  Should I use Ice or BioFreeze?\n\n",

No weight loss/gain just feel as though I am losing my mind.  My primary care said she didn't know what else to do.  She has ran a ct scan, bone scan and chest x-ray over the last 6 months and nothing shows.  No blood in my stool either.  Blood work comes back fine showing no inflammation is what my gyn said.

If your pain is cyclic with your menses it may be related to endometriosis.    If you are continuing to have pain that is not able to be diagnosed you may want to see a rheumatologist.  Best wishes.

    "content": "i will try to make this as short as possible...    to make a pretty long story short,,, i am 19 years old. when i was about 12 years old i took a trip to arizona to visit the west coast with my family and our first part of the trip was the grand canyon. on that trip i noticed when i walked for a while i got a weird pain in my lower neck/upper back that i let pass for a few years... it diddnt happen every day, just certain days the exact same pain would return.    well here i am at the age of 19, i had mri's... they were worthless, everything looked normal except for shmorals in my back (explaned to be almosty like golf ball divits in the spine, but no releviance to my pain or the area it was at).. i tried PT and the results were nothing, my pain just presists. im a pharmacy student now and in school i had to leave once because the pain was too great. it doesnt happen every day, but when i seem to stand for a while or walk or just be active, sometime it triggers the pain, its shooting, stabbing, burning, crippling... it hurts, a lot! i shaded a diagram to show the pain ( http://www.LVracetime.com/body%20pain.JPG ) its only in my back, not in the front. i have been to many doctors and it just seems like no one knows why my pain is there, what causes it. i have been to the ER recently and a doctor there suggested chronic muscle spasm, prescribed flexeril 10mg (1q8h prn for spasm and pain), and i elected to take Ultram instead of some other pain meds (100mg 1qhs prn pai n) because Ultram really works like a Narcotic, but provides me comfort in knowing that my diet, mental state, and long term safety is not at stake as it was when i had Vicoden ES and it just diddnt give me a \"long term drug\" kind of feel.    i went to my primay doctor, who is employed by one of the best hospitals in the USA (Lehigh Valley Hospital) and he wrote my ER meds (flexeril/ultram) with 5 refills each because i told him it helps... which is a breakthrough because i can actually fight the pain after onset. and feel comfortable. i have tried to get pain help before but some doctors let the DEA run them and label you as a seeker simply because of MRI's that show nothing so they think i cry wolf so to say ( Orthapedic Associates of Allentown - also reconised for famous athlete recovery ).    so here i am, 7-8 years later, posting this online with hope, with no answer to why my pain is there, it happens every other day or so, when i stand mostly, after onset it wont stop, i at least can semi-manage with my new meds... but i want to find out why and what could be done to ID and Treat my disorder/disease/condition...whatever it may be.  p.s. i have also considered Impingement Syndrome, but it is not in the right area for me to think that would be it.    -AJ    my pain diagram is at \"LVracetime.com/body%20pain.JPG\n\n",

I was confused about some of the test results, does it sound like anything needs fixed before I get the pain box?    MRI was from 04/07 :   At LI -2, there is mild degenerative disk bulge with no evidence for disk herniation or stenosis.   At L2- 3, there is grade 1 retrolisthesis, with the eccentric left paramedian disk osteophyte complex. Combination of findings produces moderate stenosis of left lateral recess, with possible slight mass effect on lateral recess L3 root, when combined with posterior facet hypertrophy. There is mild central stenosis at right lateral recess narrowing.   At L3- 4, there is mild degenerative disk bulge, without significant lateral recess or central stenosis.    CT on 6/07 :   There is severe L2-L3 disk joint space narrowing with vacuum phenomena. In addition soft tissue prominence centrally and toward the left L2-L3 perineural recess is identified. There is in addition thickening of the left L4 nerve root.    Changes post L1-L2 laminectomy and diskectomy. The presence of air within this space suggest active degenerative process. There is in addition defect to the contrast colon central and left lateral into the neural recess. This finding could be postsurgical. Clinical correlation is suggested.\n\n",

    "content": "I would recommend that you start with a complete physical examination.  Tell the doctor all your symptoms so he/she can help you in the best way possible.   For my best guess:  It is possible it could be coccydynia, which is really a collection of conditions with different causes and  treatments. The pain can disappear spontaneously or with treatment.  In some cases it can continue for years, possibly worsening. It is five times more common in women than men and it appears that in most cases the pain is caused by an unstable coccyx, which causes chronic inflammation.    Hormonal variations can also affect this condition and your varying menstrual pattern might also be consistent with this.  Blood would not necessarily be associated however, so we may be off base here.  I think it's worth investigating the possibility.  An orthopedic specialist would be the one to consult for this condition.    Good luck with this.\n\n",

    "content": "Age: 43, female.  I have had surgery to L4&5 about 15 years ago, and since then have suffered chronic mild - severe back ache on and off.   Two weeks ago I was unstacking my dishwasher, got up and felt horrific pain in my lower back. By 10pm that night it was so bad that I could hardly move. I went to A&E and was given a suppository and sent home. I went to my GP a few days later and he prescribed me co-codamol 30mg, Naproxen 50mg,  zydol 50mg and diazepam 5mg. He told me that there is nothing that can be done apart from pain relief.    I can tolerate the pain during the day, HOWEVER when I have been to sleep at night and wake up because I need the WC. I am in so much pain that it sometimes takes me more than an hour to be able to get up from lying down, to sitting, and eventually being able to make my way to the WC. The pain is burning, stabbing and it feels as tho my whole spine is \"locked\" The pain is so severe that my husband merely moving in the bed causes me to scream in pain.   I am really at my wits end and am in a situation where I am not wanting to go to sleep at night. I don't have any sciatic pain, but it does go into my hips / thigh and it hurts my hips when I walk.   My worry is that there has been no improvement in 2 weeks. I mentioned to my GP that perhaps I should have an MRI or CT scan and was told that it would take at least 3 months to get an appointment. I am in  the UK and at the mercy of the NHS. I am absolutely terrified that this could be something serious and may result in me having to have surgery in the long term.   Any advice would be most appreciated.   Thank you   Dids\n\n",

A good test for this is to sit in a chair and straighten your leg at the knee (carefully).  If there is some nerve compression from a slipped disk, one or both legs will cause significant pain with this motion.  (This isn't 100% but is pretty good.)  Physical therapy can often be quite helpful in addition to anti-inflammatories and rest.  Best wishes.  I hope you feel better soon.\n\n",

The other day I noticed a small ball like mass on the lower right side of my back where the pain has been occuring. I was just touching it when i noticed that it moves a bit, shifts somewhat but it is basically in the same place. My mom is making me a doctors appt. sometime this week but I'm very concerned and I was hoping you could give me a little insight into what it may be. Thank You so much!\n\n",

    "content": "Based on the location you are describing, I suspect that the lump you are feeling is a lipoma.  A lipoma is a small fat cell tumor that is non-cancerous and generally does not cause any pain.  However, if they are located just right, they may cause increased pressure on surrounding structures or be hit a lot during daily activities.  If they are bothersome they can be generally easily removed.  If the mass is just right and putting pressure on the muscles of the back it may cause some pain from the muscles.  Seeing a doctor will be helpful to figure out for sure what is going on but generally lumps in this area are not dangerous.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Back pain can be very challenging.  When one begins having symptoms such as numbness, it is indicative that there is some nerve involvement, usually compression of the nerve near the spine.  Surgery can be helpful sometimes but should really be considered as a last resort because back surgery is fraught with complications.  Sometimes physical therapy can be helpful.  I would advise you to get a second evaluation from another back surgeon.  Most spine surgeons are reluctant to operate unless there really is no other option due to the potential risks.  Sometimes there really are no other treatment options and surgery is the best choice.  In these cases, the benefits outweigh the risks and make the surgery worthwhile.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I have lumps in lower back area close to spine and have read on line that they most likely non cancerous fatty tumors.

    "content": "Dear rafikicon,  Muscle spasm alone can cause this pain which can be an unidentified cause but in many cases it is secondary to spinal or bone problems.  In these cases, self care and avoiding the precipitating cause will lead to a gradual but clear improvement in the pain. Home treatment includes the use of analgesics, cold or hot therapy.  Rest for maximum two days is also beneficial. If these measures fail to relief the pain or to improve symptoms in 48 hours, otherwise the pain is more likely to be due to other causes, like:  Herniated disk,  but your doctor has excluded this and your investigations are negative.  Have you been checked for osteoporosis which is common at our age.The best screening test is dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA).   You have also to exclude Renal causes.   Follow up with your doctor is essential.  Hope you find this information useful. Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "I suspect that the back and armpit are not related.  The back pain can certainly be caused by a compression fracture.  You may also need to have some imaging of your back such as an MRI to better look for any spinal cord impingement.    Regarding the armpits, there are many lymph nodes in that region.  If they become swollen or inflamed they can produce axillary swelling and pain.  They can become swollen for several reasons, most commonly while fighting of an infection.  Cancerous nodes tend not to be painful.    When you follow up with your doctor about your back I would recommend you mention your armpit issues.  If the pain worsens or you notice things seem to be getting worse I would recommend you be seen sooner.  Best wishes.\n\n",

It is generally felt that DDD is a condition where the disk of the spinal canal begins to breakdown and can cause pain.    The term degenerative can be misleading in that the disease is not degenerative to the body, only the disk itself will continue to degenerate and eventually scar down.   There are some treatments if pain is continuing.  You may wish to see an orthopedic specialist or a spinal surgeon to be evaluated and get some advise on treatment options.  Of note, surgery is generally considered a last resort and only for those with severe symptoms.  Other, less invasive treatments should be tried first.  Best wishes.\n\n",

There is an annuar disk buldge with a focal left paracentral protrusion that herniated both superiorly and inferorly almost to the level of the adjacent disk spaces. There is Severe acquired centra canal Stenosis and abnormal hihg T2 signal within the spinal cord extending from the level of the superior endplate of C5 to the Level of the midportion of the vertebral body of C6. There is Bilateral moderate to severe exiting neural foraminal stenosis as well at this level secondary to a combination of disc and uncovertebral degenaritive change. <-- This is from the Doctors MRI note. The Opinion is as follows. The Most Severe Level is C5/6 where there is a diffuse annular buldge with a left paracentral protrusion, as described above, that reults in severe acquired central canal stenosis with abnormal high T2 Cord signal indicative of myelopathic change at this level. There is bilateral moderate to severe neural foraminal stenosis at this level as well. \"The Myelopathic change merits urgent referal\"  Now my Symptoms are as follows.. 1 - Numbness in my left and right hands 2 - Numbness in my lower body from the Mid-Section to under my Toes. 3 - I have to hold on the things in order to move around - example to go to the bathroom I have to pull and drag my feet up the stairs. 4 - Loss of sudden Bowel Trouble ie: Not knowing i have to go as per the NO feeling or ability to push to relieve myself as there is No pressure i can get to that area. 5- Un-balanced, walking like i have drank 100 Beers or the likes.  Now for the weird part - \"I have NO NECK pain at ALL??. Why?? I am also a Type 2 Diabetic... Anyone have or had simular situation please reply ASAP as my surgery is for Tommorow at 10:30am at Hamilton Health Sciences here in Canada.  Thanks and for all of you i wish you all a brisk and speedy recovery...  God Bless You All.\n\n",

    "content": "I am male, 20 years old.  My problem seems a bit complicated to me. About 5 days ago I started having very light, not so painful stings in my lower right abdomen. I didn't think much of it until I woke up the next day with it again and it lasted all day. The pain isn't always there. The stings happen about every 5-minutes and they last less than a second except for a few that lasted for about 2 seconds.  I have also been having lower spinal pain more often with this new abdominal pain. I had it before, long before my abdominal pains and I am sure it is due to sitting down for long periods of time. The pain in my lower spine is more of a discomfort telling me to stand up and stretch, which I do and the pain goes away. But ever since the lower right abdominal stings the lower spinal pain seems to linger with some relief while standing and stretching but it doesn't go completely away.  I am able to sleep with no problems. The pain, spinal and abdominal, doesn't seem to happen at all while sleeping or laying down or atleast if it does its not enough to keep me up or wake me up. When I do wake up in the morning, about half an hour after getting out of bed the random stings and lower spinal pain start happening again. My first thought was a problem with my right kidney and I quickly looked up symptoms of kidney infection and I have none of them. So the fear of infection has nearly left me.  My question is, could the lower spinal pain be the cause of my lower right abdominal stings and what else has been known to cause sudden, 1-2 second minor stings in the lower right abdomen?\n\n",

    "content": "40 Yr old Male, I have been told by my Doctors so far that it is Fatty tumors, Cysts, and muscle pain. One shot of pain Med w/ steroids in the affected area helped for 6-8 hours, Family has history of fatty tumors. No Meds  In Dec I noticed a lump on my lower back 2-3 inches from the spine and have since found 2-3 more in the same area. I have had increasing back pain over/ in the right hip area over the last 2 years and only recently realized they may be connected. When I have a sharp stabbing pain (pain will stop me dead but then goes awayusualy in 10-15 seconds like it never happened) the main lump is hard as a rock and softens as the pain dissipates. This pain seems to hit me more when I walk over uneven ground or when moving from a sitting to standing position (1/2 way point), very seldom when I am doing heavy lifting, or strenuous activity, and is never consistant 2-7x a day, once a day, once in a week etc. The CAT scan did not revile anything and I have an MRI later this month. I have read a lot of people with the same symptoms, but never a possible diagnosis or thought other than Lymph node.\n\n",

This could explain why they cause more pain with walking, etc.  Generally lipomas are benign but can cause pain.  They can be removed surgically in a relatively simple procedure.  The MRI should give some good information for you.  Your doctor should be able to give you some good treatment options at that point.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Lower back pain/ protruding tailbone! Hello- I'm wondering if anyone would have any input on this...  This started almost a year ago, has been recurring, but has been constant and much worse the last few weeks.  It started with severe lower back pain.. now that it has been worse, I have felt my 'tailbone', which just does not feel right. It seems like (know it's not, but technically 'feels like') it is split in two! Possibly, not coccyx but sacrum? It is protruding and there are two huge bumps (heads?) to it, not one... a bruise/ discoloration line going up my 'crack' to this protrusion.. with a 'dimple' near/ between the bones.. I have also been very constipated lately, and feel this is all emanating from the distorted sacral area. The back feels better when bent forward, any arch in it whatsoever and it feels as if my back is going to break.. the pain is so bad. Lying, standing. sitting.. is all painful if not in the right position.. and the pain seems now to also radiate to ischium/ butt bones.. up the back.. down the legs.. tingling legs.. I could elaborate on additional symptoms, but this is the basis....  Any help would be appreciated ???? BTW, there has been no physical injury..  35 y/o female\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 40 year old female.  I am experiencing a weak feeling in arms, hands, and sometimes legs.  It comes and goes.  It can last for an hour or for days, and then will go away sometimes for months.  The first time it occurred was back in 2003.  I had a Cervical MRI and it stated that I had posterior annular disc bulge at c3-4, c4-5, c5-6 and c6-7 and a mild loss of lordotic curve.   It went away and basically hasn't bothered me often until the last few months.  The weak feeling is occurring more often and is often associated with neck pain.  If I lie down it doesn't bother me.  Again, it comes and goes.  I also occasionally have mild vertigo.  I just had an MRI of my brain with contrast and all was normal.  I am currently going to physical therapy.    Could the bulging discs be causing this weak feeling I am having in my extremities?  Should I ask that an MRI be done again to see if something has changed over the last 4 years?  Can the disc bulging get worse over time?  I was worried about having MS or ALS, but don't know much about them.  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Criskaz,  The symptoms you describe can indeed be caused by bulging discs.  The disc bulge can cause pressure on the Spinal Cord and leave you with general weakness in your extremeties, and sometime internal problems as well.  When you mentioned that \"it\" went away, I am assuming you meant the weakness.  I cannot give rationale for the going away, but typically if  the underlying problem - the bulging discs- have not been repaired, then the symptoms of the problem are still there, you may just have learned to live with them.  I hope you have consulted a neurologist for these concerns.  The loss of  the lordotic curve is also a concern, and it would be prudent for that to also be evaluated by either an orthopedic specialist or again by the neurologist.  There are surgical and non-invasive treatments for disc bulge, depending on the etiology and the needed corrections.  Please ask your primary physician for a referral to orthopedics and neurology/ neuro surgery.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 29 year old female.  About 4 years ago I got a few weird looking spots on my back in the middle of the left side and also had severe pain in that area as well.  Went to the doctor because I thought I might have shingles.  Doctor said could be but there were only a few spots and also thought my lung was inflammed.  I can't really remember exactly what it was.  Pain in the left middle area just above the bottom of rib cage in my back. It hurt/burned for over 3 weeks with 5 intense days were I didn't want to move, lay down, sit up, ect.  No matter how I was, I was in pain.    It has continued over the last 4 years with off and on pain, only 2 other times being as intense as the first time.  I've pretty much learned to live with it.  Now my neck is starting to hurt on the left side.  I have never been able to just turn my head and crack my neck until about 5 months ago.  Now if my neck/shoulder area is bothering me I crack my neck.  Sometimes it fees better and other days no matter what I do it increasingly gets worse through out the day until my shoulder starts to hurt and continues down my arm.  once I go to bed and get up it feels better until the day gets going.    Now my left middle back is starting to get worse again and more frequent along with the neck pain.  I do smoke about a pack a day and have been smoking for 11 years.  I know I need to quit but now I am concerned that this pain my all be linked together with some kind of lung problem.    The only surgeries I've had are open carpal tunnel release on both hands about 1 1/2 years ago and a dislocated hip from a car accident 9 years ago (right side).  I also have a heart murmur that was looked into about 13 years ago and was told I had a misshape ventrical.  My dad has lung problems.  I think it is COPD or something like that and my mom was just recently diagnosed with haveing a spine problem where her vertibre are crushing togther and giving her leg pain.  Any possible suggestions or causes would be appreciated since I don't have insurance and don't want to spend too much on unneccesary doctor visits.  Thank You, Tammy\n\n",

    "content": "Your initial symptoms do sound compatible with shingles.  This is typically one sided and quite painful with a burning type pain.  Often there are blister-like vesicles in the area of the pain.  There may or may not be very many.  Your neck pain may represent a pinched nerve from a slipped disk.  It is less likely for you to have a slipped disk lower down in your rib cage area, though not impossible.  It is also possible that you are having some pain associated with the shingles if this is what was initially going on.  It's possible that you have some underlying irritation of your lung causing the pain as well.  From your description I am less suspicious of this but it should probably be investigated.  I would recommend that you follow up with your doctor to have your neck and back evaluated.    Best wishes\n\n",

She diagnosed Sjogren's syndrome about 2 years ago.  She continues to watch for Lupus and RA, but I don't have enough criteria to be diagnosed with either.  She ordered the xrays because of ongoing back pain (located to the side over PSIS) and groin/hip pain.  Those x-rays came back showing the moderate sclerosis around both SI joints.  She mentioned spondyloarthopathies and wanted to get a follow up MRI of my SI joints/lumbar spine and hip which I just got the results of.  They showed osteoarthritis of the facet joints in my lumbar spine and no signs of erosive arthritis or arthritic changes in my SI joints.  My HLA-B27 test was negative.  Incidentally she also suspected a torn labrum in my R hip that was confirmed on MRI-arthrogram, I am scheduled for arhtroscopy in a few weeks.  I go back to see her in a couple weeks but don't know what to focus the visit on...too many things going on at once!  Should I not be concerned about the SI joints even though that is where I have most of my pain (SI joints/over both PSIS and in my R hip/groin which I think is probably the labral tear).

    "content": "Sorry for the late reply.  The only thing I really can think of is that you may have strained these muscles.    Infectious causes would be unlikely to cause a one-sided issue.  A blood clot could potentially do this; however, the area seems quite large for a blood clot.  One that is affecting the neck and down the back would likely cause other symptoms as well.  Let us know what you find out.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I am 36 year old male Have high blood pressure managed with Lisinopril Have a history of anxiety.  The past couple of weeks I've been getting a burning pain in my left shoulder and neck. Sometimes I can feel it up the neck on onto the side of my head even. On occasion the pain seems to center on my left collar bone.  It does not seem to be brought on by any specific activity. In fact, it seems to come on most when I'm not doing anything (i.e. driving, watching tv, etc.). Been getting it 3-4 times a day.  It was happening a lot a couple weeks ago and seemed to get less frequent and now has intensified again.  When it's not hurting my neck and shoulder seem fine, and my range of motion seems fine. I know I carry a lot of tension in my shoulders, especially on that side, but I've never experienced this burning pain before. If it hurt all the time I'd assume I pulled a muscle but it doesn't.  Can't figure out what to do. Any advice would be appreciated.  Thank you so much.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  According to your description, the pain could be due to:  -Neurological -nerve irritation- mainly Herniated disk and or  -Muscle spams   (the two possible causes are commonly associated and coexist).   Even so, in most of the cases with upper back or one sided neck pain, strain of the back muscles and ligaments, is the primary cause.   Muscle spasm alone can cause this pain which can be an unidentified cause but  in many cases is the result of inappropriate posture for long time like traveling, driving, overuse and certain types of work.   In these cases, self care and avoiding the precipitating cause will lead to a gradual but clear improvement in the pain.  Home treatment includes the use of analgesics, cold or hot therapy.  Rest for maximum two days is also beneficial.  MRI is of choice in the diagnosis.   The other causes to be excluded  - You have mentioned that your blood pressure is controlled, I advise however to check your blood pressure and to exclude any cardiac cause for this pain.  I advise you to follow up with your doctor.  Direct clinical examination is essential.  Hope you find this information useful.  Best regards.\n\n",

    "title": "Lower Back Pain- Radiating and Numbness and Tingling",
    "content": "1) 23 2) Female 3) None Relevant 4) None 5) None Relevant 6) Advil, Tylenol, etc.  Since 1999 (in October I was in a car accident, but if I remember correctly, the pain began during a shower in August or September) I have been experiencing excruciating lower back pain, which sends shooting pain down both legs, pain in my arms, etc.  My legs (particularly the left one) becomes numb when sitting, lounging or standing in one position for any length of time.  I won't always realize that my leg is numb until I go to move or accidentally touch it, which feels like touching the leg of somebody else.  If I read a book and hold it up (about eye level or sometimes even just above my lap), my hands start to go numb.  I have also been having pain in my left shoulder, short bursts of pain that quickly recede. I have a terrible time sleeping- no matter how I lay down, I have horrible shooting pain down my left leg.  When I do fall asleep, I wake up constantly to change positions, and I begin to have bad pain in my middle back, making moving almost impossible, but staying in bed completely unfeasible.  (I don't know if this is related, but I also urinate more than I used to, and more than anybody else I know.) I have been to doctors many times, and received a couple of x-rays.  Nothing came up.  Personally, I think I need an MRI, but can not afford one.  I am going to try to have the car insurance company pay for one, or to get medicaid, as I am currently unemployed.  It is hard for me to work because of the pain.  Sometimes my back \"goes out,\" making it impossible to stand straight up.  I bend over and eventually have to lean on things or  to sit or lay down.  The one doctor I went to told me that I just needed to lose weight.  I am overweight because excercise is difficult (sometimes impossible), but this was not always the case.  For a long time, I was the \"ideal\" weight for my height, and the back pain was as debilitating then as it is now.  I am as positive as I can be that something is wrong, and that my sciatic nerve is being \"damaged (?).\"   My mother and sister think that I am either making this up or \"embellishing\" the truth.  It hurts when people don't believe you.  Because of my age, most professionals think that I am exaggerating, or worse: drug-seeking.  For a while I was taking vicodin and then percocet, but when I was unable to afford the MRI and CAT scan, the only doctor to take me seriously took me off of it.  Truth be told, though it helped a great deal more than Advil, the pain was still there (just not as intense), and the numbness still occurred.  Obviously.   Anyway, I am trying to get this taken care of, but I wanted an unbiased, professional opinion.  This way, I can be informed when speaking to a doctor in the future, provided the car insurance company or medicaid approve my case.  Thank-you for taking the time to read this, and hopefully, reply with some insight.  I think that volunteering to help others free of charge is great.  So few people care anymore, and it's nice (especially around the holidays) to find a few who do. Happy Holidays and a Happy New Year! Sondra\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 34 year old male who has had no diagnosis, surgeries... involving what I think is a disorder.  But I do have a fraternal twin with the same problem.  I've always been more humped over than the normal person.  My spinal cord sticks out on my neck when I bend slightly, something which I don't notice in others when I test them bending.  My spine sticks out in the middle of my back.  But many bizarre things happen that I know involve my spine due to 100s of the same experiences yielding the same problems.  When I do physical activity or repeated bending, my visions goes off slightly.  When I bob my head in an open area too long like walking in a mall, my vision goes off.  When I lay say reading a book on one side my vision may go off.  The problem use to be a lot worse until I learned to be more upright and have better posture.  The vision will only go off for awhile.  Sometimes though it will go off for a week or longer.  I do wear contacts but the problem was there with glasses too.  Vision isn't the only problem.  Recently my hearing went out of my right ear for 4 months.  No I didn't get my ear drained because I new it was to do with my back.  This has happened before.  My back will really go off to the right or left sometimes and I can feel the top of the spine on the top of my head  to the far left sometimes.  When my spine straightened out some more or loosened up a bit my hearing returned.   As you can see I'm very sensitive to this problem.  Another trouble I have is my spine, if shortened when doing weightlifting, will cause my back to stay shortened for maybe weeks and along comes the impaired vision.   Also I notice that I have extremely knobby knees.  My hips are maladjusted compared to everyone because I see the way they sit more forward while I sit more back on my hips.  I notice no chair contours contour to my back.  Anyway I believe from head to toe I have a real problem.  I should have done something about in my youth but somehow I got through.   I would love to get some advice. Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  It is difficult to tell from your description the exact cause or correlation between your back problems and your vision and hearing disorder.  It might be two separate problems: You might have a Kyphosis which is a curving of the spine that causes a bowing of the back. An orthopedic consultation and a simple X-ray would help in diagnoses of the vertebral problem.   The second part (vision and hearing troubles) is due to Middle ear disorders.  ENT examination is also essential.   -lt  might be a Transient ischemic attacks associated with certain forms of spinal disorders (if any), although there must be other symptoms and signs of nerve compression.TIA is due to temporary decrease in the blood supply of the brain.   Complete neurological evaluation and a radiographic assessment for structural abnormalities in the cervical spine is advisable. Routine cervical X-rays, flexion/extension cervical X-rays, an MRI maybe recommended by your Doctor after complete physical assessment.  Keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, since december of 05 I experienced some upper to mid back pain, I couldn't keep an upright posture without serious pain and had to slouch forward or get relief from using a chair with a back rest. Since then the pain has pretty much gone, every now and then I will get a bit of aching in the area near the left shoulder blade. My main concern is the tingling that I get everyday when I use my left arm... even when I pick up a simple object like a cup I get this tingling (no pain) near my shoulder blade.  I start doing yoga but am unsure if I should continue... I thought the problem was probably due to sitting at the computer for many hours everyday and getting little exercise (weakened / tight back muscles).  Is this likely because of bad posture or something? I have no memory of getting an injury, this just came on sometime late last year.  Thanks   Matt\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,   Not all individuals with degenerative disc lesions have symptoms.  Certain types of work can cause or aggravate a preexisting back problem (disc lesions) . These types of work are more likely to cause muscle strain, which is considered to be the most common cause of back pain by its own.  Heavy physical work, lifting, bending or even standing for too long can result in more disc degeneration and back problems.   Some people who are discovered to have back pain due to degenerative disc disease, change the type of their work to avoid more damage and more complications.\n\n",

    "title": "Pars Defect and Degenerative Disc",
    "content": "My 17 year old son started having lower back pain 5 months ago.  He is 6'1\" and is a basketball player.  He has been diagnosed with a pars defect bilateral and a degenerative disc of the L5.  He has not had surgery and is currently undergoing PT.  Of significant note, he has extremely tight hamstrings, making bending and flexing a problem.   He now has periodic pain/numbness in his legs.  The pain is sporadic; does not occur daily or on the same side.  It occurs in one or both legs.  It happens freguently when driving, but has also occured when sitting or standing.  A second MRI does not show compression of the nerves.  Could this new symptom be indiciative of an underlying systemic problem or a normal symptom of his condition?  At what point do we become concerned that the disc is progressing?  Please advise. He's wanting to play varsity basketball this season and has been given the ok if he can tolerate the pain.   Thank you Lynn\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,   Not all individuals with degenerative disc lesions have symptoms. Athletes like basket ball players are more likely to have symptoms at some time as certain back movements can exacerbate any existing back problem.    In most of the cases the primary cause is muscle spasm. An associated Muscle spasm alone can cause or aggravate the pain due to disc lesions.  Physical therapy, certain exercises, epidural steroid injections, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, and regulating daily activities during pain period are the main approaches to control the pain non surgically.   The effect of treatment may be gradual but clear and periods of acute pain may last for 3 month.   Surgery for disc herniation is only considered if symptoms are not controlled after at least one month (6 weeks) of medical and conservative treatment, or in very complicated cases with serious symptoms.  MRI results are very important in the diagnosis of vertebral changes, but the clinical picture, I mean the complaints and the physical examination are more important to determine the management approach.\n\n",

    "title": "Severe middle back pain When I wake up in the morning",
    "content": "Hello, This is my first time posting here so be easy on me.  I have had back pains for about seven months now. I'm a 25 year old male, also i'm 6'0 215lbs have never had any health problems.  The pain in my back started in the lower right side of my back right above my butt.  It was mild for the first six months sometimes it would wake me up and I would get out of bed and walk it off.  Well in the last month now I have severe pain in my middle back on my left side mainly but also a little on my right when I wake in the morning,  It hurts so bad I can't lay in bed.  So i have my fiance rub it and that really has no effect.   The pain starts to simmer down and almost be completly gone at about 12 o'clock in the afternoon.  I have gone to my doctor many times and he keeps telling me that my muscles are locking up and I have asked him why he keeps telling me that he doesnt no why. So he took a lower back x ray and said that it looks normal and he gave me a perscription for muscle relaxer and some pain killer that my pharmacist told me I could just by aleve its the same stuff and also my doctor told me to stretch real good before bed.  So then I started taking the pills and doing a whole stretch routine before bed and still it keeps getting worse every morning.  It feels like i have been stabbed by a spoon and someone is twisting it in my back, also it hurts very severly to try and touch my chin to my chest it feels like something is pulling hard in my back.  So to continue on with my saga I talked to a couple people and they said go to the chiropractor,  so three sessions latter and 150 dollars still no luck, chiro said my back is setting fine but doesn't know why my back is spasming so much.  Also i'm pretty active with my job and I also ride dirtbikes so I can't understand why it is getting worse.  There is really nothing in my family history, only odd thing is my father past away last year of heart failure from severe septicema, hypertension, dyslipidemia, phenmonia and diabetes melliyus, and metabolic acidosois, which kind of a shockers cause I took him to the ER and they said it didn't look very serious and he died 8 hours later.  So I don't know if that will help any but any any help on what could be wrong with my back or what I should do would be greatly appriciated. Thanks for your time, Jason\n\n",

If these measures fail to relief the pain or to improve symptoms in 48 hours, otherwise the pain is more likely to be due to other causes, like:  Herniated disk, in which the inter-vertebral disc press on his nerves,  Spondylosis which is similar to arthritis but affects the spine etc.  MRI is of choice in the diagnosis.  In MRI negative individuals, inflammation of the sacroiliac joint is suspected and special tests and maneuvers can help in the diagnosis.  These are conditions that need specific therapy.  Follow up with your doctor is essential. Only by complete history and physical examination, the correct diagnosis can be reached.   Hope you find this information useful. Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for the responce, well since my last post I have had a few things looked at,  My doctor had me go and get xrays of my entire back and also mri of my lower and thoratic spine,  Sorry for the spelling.  He then had me seen by a nueroligist, and he looked everything over and told me he does not see anything to be worried about. the only thing he mentioned is he can see some wear in my thordic disc's and he said that is because of my life style,  as in dirt bike riding and football stuff like that he said is hard on your back and can wear it faster. But he said there is nothing abnormal in the mri or xrays.  So basically if have decided that there is nothing seriously wrong with me and i will have to deal with it.  but also during all this i was diag with high blood pressure so i just started taking meds for it and i will start an excersise program in the next few weeks to shed some pounds and quit smoking which my doctor believes is why i have high blood pressure. So basically i have hit a dead end,  I don't know what else to do.\n\n",

    "title": "Upper / Mid Back Pain",
    "content": "Hey all. I've got some pain in my mid/upper back. Probably if you went directly between my shoulderblades, and down 2\" or so. It's not so much on the spine, but right beside it (maybe bout 2\" to the side). I sometimes get a numb feeling there, and sometimes tingling. I've been to my doc who says it's probably just a pinched nerve, and that there's really not a lot they can do. The numbness and tingling don't really bother me though.  I believe it's probably muscle pain, as I normally feel it standing for long periods, when I sit or lay down the pain goes mostly away, and when I sleep at night I don't really feel it at all.  One thing I find weird, I can do an hour of cardio exercise at the gym, I can walk home from work (6k) and it's mildly sore, but nothing that would stop me. But ask me to stand at the cupboard and cut up onions or mushrooms or something, and it'll hurt like he**!  I am overweight, at my heaviest I was 350+ but have recently lost 80lbs (and still going). I was hoping my back would feel better by now!  The doc has asked me all the questions about my lungs etc.. He doesnt think it's my lungs causing the problem (only asked cuz the pain seems to be behind where your lung would be)  anyone else have pain like this? How long would it last if it's a muscle? It's been months for me...  27, male, approx 5,11\".  My job involves sitting at a computer all day, which usually extends into the evening.  Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  The back has a group of muscles that enable us to stand erect and to maintain the normal curvature and disc spaces.  Spasms in this muscle group results from many conditions.   Muscle spasm alone can cause this pain which in many cases may result of inappropriate posture for long time like certain types of work (long time computer users).  Muscle pain is always aggravated by certain movements and postures and is relieved by making them more relaxed in certain postures.  In these cases, self care and avoiding the precipitating cause (proper posture) will lead to a gradual but clear improvement in the pain.

    "content": "Hello,  Degenerative disc disease, is a gradual deterioration of the disc between the vertebrae in turn narrow disc space.  Degeneration of the disc tissue makes the disc more susceptible to herniation.  Each disc is formed of a central gel-like inside (nucleus pulposus), surrounded by an outer ring (annulus fibrosus).  When this softer component ruptures (herniates) through the outer ring it press directly on nerve roots and irritate adjacent nervous tissue.  Your report inform that: Degenerative changes at the level of the lumber vertebrae and the first sacral vertebrae with disc herniation at the lumber vertebrae (Third and forth) and between the lumbar vertebrae L5 and the first sacral S1.   If this bulge results in nerve root compression, pinched nerve it can cause back pain and numbness along the distribution of these nerves. In your condition it results in Sciatica.   Muscle spasm alone can cause this pain which can be an unidentified cause but in many cases it is secondary to spinal or bone problems.  It could be due to the accident or due to cumulative spine changes from your life style, sitting for long time for example.\n\n",

    "title": "Sciatica or Piriformis Syndrome?",
    "content": "male, 45, sciatica, no surgeries, no current medication. I injured myself playing tennis...serving specifically. I felt a knot in my hip and my leg almost went dead on me. (it didn't want to go) I limped to the car and had to help my left leg up into the car when I was getting in. It was painful for several days until I saw my Orthopaedic Dr. and for several days after starting medication. His diagnosis was sciatica. My Dr. gave me a steroid pack and some hydrocodone. About 6 days later after finishing the steroids I was feeling much better until I felt a pain in my lower back when straightening up after bending over. It was a shooting pain that was gone in a few seconds but it still shocked me as I've never felt anything quite like that before. I can't say for sure if it went from my back to my hip or my hip to my lower back. I have not felt that pain since...about a week ago.  I went in for a MRI on my lower back and it showed a 1 or 2 mm herniation on my L4-5.  My Dr. wanted to give me a Epidural Lumbar Injection but after some research on the  procedure, I don't think it's worth it.  Is it possible the L4-5  1 to 2 mm buldge is not the cause of my pain but rather  Piriformis Syndrome? My pain has been 99% in my buttock/hip/leg and I have noticed a burning aching pain there occasionally for several months usually after serving. From what I have read this can be tricky to diagnose...even if a MRI shows a herniation it may not be the cause of ones pain especially if minor.  The knot in my buttock is much better but still tender and my range of motion is somewhat  limited in my left leg. I can walk fairly normal and manage up and down stairs without pain.  Who would be best able to pinpoint the cause of my problem? My Orthopaedic Surgeon is a spine specialist. I am scheduled for physical therapy but do you think I should see a neurologist first?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  The sciatic is nerve is formed of a group of nerves that come out between the lumbar segments and the sacral segments as follows: Lumbar segment 4 and lumbar segment 5 (L4 and L5) is named the L4 nerve root. The second  between the L5 and Sacral segment and is named the L5 nerve root. The third group of nerves from the sacral foramen are called the S1, S2 and S3 nerves.  Sciatica occurs due to a nerve root (sciatic nerve) compression in the lower (lumbar) spine. The condition is due to a herniated disk in most of the cases in the low lumber spine. This compression results in pain along distribution of the muscles innervated by that nerve, so the pain radiates from your lower back to the buttock down to the back of the legs.  However, associated Muscle spasm alone can cause or aggravate the pain and the condition.  In most of the cases with back pain the primary cause is muscle spasm.   The piriformis muscle is a small muscle located behind the gluteus maximus,  the sciatic nerve passes directly below this muscle.  When thepiriformis muscle is in spasms it exerts  pressure on the sciatic nerve , a condition known as Piriformis syndrome. Individuals with Piriformis syndrome give similar to sciatica pain like:  A dull ache in the mid lower back Radiating down to the  back of the leg  Pain starts on walking up stairs or after prolonged sitting  Typically, rotation of hip reinduce  the pain.  Diagnosis is by exclusion when MRI vertebrae does not show any significant spinal changes.\n\n",

I have had back problems on and off for 20 years, however over the past 18 months, my problems have increased walking and standing have become virtually impossible after 5 minutes, pain is constant, varying in intensity, burning, tingling, numbness and spasms in my legs and a varying intensity in pubic discomfort likened to the sensation when one knocks ones funny bone. I have had various scans and physio all with vague results and conflicting diagnosis and advice. Some letters I have had this information. 1988 no evidence of old fractures, some disc space narrowing 1/2 and 2/3 area there was also signs of very early degenerative changes. 1992 sustained  significant injuries in 1986 head injury and fractures of the L2,3 and 4 transverse processes, episodes of collapse presumed to be from muscle weakness. The L5/S1 shows minor reduction  suggesting early disc dehydration. 1998 CT scan reveals a very minor localised canal stenosis at L4/L5. Apart from slight reduction in signal intensity in the upper mid cervical disc spaces no evidence of disc degeneration. I apologise for lengthy post. I would appreciate an interpretation of the above, unfortunately the original accident report is lost along with various other reports. Many Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hi!  I just had an injury at work that resulted in a central disc herniation between T9 and T10.  I have been seeing my chiroprater and using a TENS unit.  I have an appointment with a neurosurgeon in a couple weeks.  What I am wondering is what is a realistic prognosis for a herniation at this level?  I am far more familiar with cervial and lumbar herniations.   I know that thoracic herniations are somewhat unusual and that at this particular level, a good sneeze, coughing, vomiting, etc. can finish the job on the disc.  Will I ever be able to do heavy lifting again?  How long before I should expect to see a dramatic improvement in pain free days?  Any responses and/or resources wuold be appreciated!  Thank you!\n\n",

A brace is acceptable initially to help immobilization but long-term bracing is a voided.  Surgical decompression is considered in neurologically compromised individual with no improvement after 4-6 weeks of conservative management. Or severe cases from the start.  A spinal physician is the one able to determine if surgery is the best treatment for the patient.   Hope you find this information useful.   Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "My son who is 8 has had a backache for about a year now.It started out minor and now is chronic.It is around the end of the thoracic vertebrae and then into the lumbar part.Not all the way down though just about 3 inches total length of pain.It hurts to press on the spine or right beside it but nowhere else.Dr. had a regular x-ray which was fine and then he had a bone scan and it is normal. All the Dr. kept mentioning was cancer but will not do the CT scan now due to other Dr.s in the office feeling diiferent about what may be wrong.One wants a CT scan one says nothing one says physical therapy and let them find it.So my question is what could it be with the 2 tests he had already being normal?Can it still be cancer? What test would 100% rule out something like that and if he has had the backche for over 6 months isn't it unlikely to still be cancer? He has not sustained any injury and is to the point he lays on the couch all day after school and at school the teachers are not able to get him to play or do anything.Seems serious to me if it is hurting so bad but again I am no Dr. and just a very worried mom.The thought of cancer scares me and I have no idea what else to do but continue to fight with the Dr.s until one can make up their minds! He is otherwise a healthy little boy who just wants to be able to play again and I just would like to not worry as bad.If anyone has suggestions or answers to my questions or ANYTHING  I GREATLY could use it. Thanks, Shannon\n\n",

A new form of injury in school-age children is the overuse injuries and back strain that results  from carrying too heavy back packs.  If the pain after conservative measures and avoidance of  re-injury or there are other symptoms suggestive of (infection or tumor), further work-up should be done and consultation of specialist is warranted.

I have been to orthopedic doctors who have injected me with cortizone shots, and I have been to Chiropractors for traction and therapy and nothing has worked. The latest MRI results ara as follow:   At L5-S1, there is desiccation and bulging of the intervertebral disc. This is asymmetric to the right. It abuts the ventral surface of the thecal sac and bulges into the inferior aspect of the right neural foramen. I do not see definite evidence of nerve root impingement. I do not see a discrete disc herniation at any level.   The chiropractor that I am seeing now for the last 16 weeks (twice a week), insists that I stay with traction and therapy. Should I seek another opinion from a surgeon, or orthopedic doctor. Another round of cortizone shots or eipdural  is out of the question. It is a quick fix and actually gives you a false sense of security.  Please advise  Randall R\n\n",

I have no problem bending forward all the way down to the floor - but almost any movement back or sideways kills me. I walk bent forward sometimes because I cannot streighten-up.  I have found the following interesting facts: 1. Paddling (Kayaking) where I sit in an enclosed Kayak with a waist-line back strap as a back rest  makes my back feel better for several hours after which things get back to agony again. 2. I have been using a back-support belt ( like a girdle) which contains these magnets for several days now - and again - symptomatically - my pain reduces while I wear it and for a short time after I take it off. I don't know why this helps - but it does. The heating? The magnets? The Immobilization? Placebo? I don't know.  What long term medical options do I have that could help me suffer less? Considering the relief I get from the above two items - should I consider Vert. Fusion surgery? Please help... I cannot even hold my 8 month old baby doughter any more. Thanks.\n\n",

When I sleep, it gets very bad, and usually wakes me up at about three or four hours into the night and keeps me up for the rest of the night.  The pain occurs on the sides of my lower back, probably just below my ribs.  At night, when I take deep breaths, the pain becomes worse.  During the day, the back pain is just a dull ache all day long, but I also have moderate leg pain in both legs.  Advil helps to numb the back pain during the day, but nothing helps the shooting pain in my legs.  I've had x-rays and an MRI, but both show absolutely nothing is wrong.  I've been to chiropractic therapies and an orthopedic surgeon.  Neither have been direct in identifying what is wrong.  I have no additional symptoms (all other bodily functions seem to be working just fine).  Have any doctors out there seen any similar cases or have an opinion on what might be causing this pain?  I would really like to be able to sleep again at night, and I would really appreciate any help or additional insight into this problem.   Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear thought100,  It sounds like muscle spasm is the cause of your symptoms.  The back has a group of muscles that enable us to stand erect.  Spasms in this muscle group results from many conditions.   These muscles are attached to the ribs, being in spasm make the breathing difficult or painful.  Muscle spasm alone can cause this pain which can be an unidentified cause but in many cases is the result of inappropriate posture for long time like traveling, driving and certain types of work. In these cases, self care and avoiding the precipitating cause will lead to a gradual but clear improvement in the pain.   If the condition is not  treated properly, they can cause more disk compression, even herniated (ruptured) disc).  Other causes to be investigated include:  - Juvenile ankylosing spondylitis is another possibility and should be excluded, in this condition there is also pain on deep breath if the joints between the ribs and the spine. ESR is elevated in such cases.  - Inflammation of the sacroiliac joint which gives similar picture and MRI negative results.  Follow up with your doctor is essential.  Hope you find this information useful.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I just had a question about my boyfriend. He has been to the doctor for two bulging disks in his back.  He went in to the doctor twice for and both times they gave him shots of cortisone. The first time he said it didnt make him feel better. The second time he said it was a little better. He said his legs don't tingle anymore. It was causing him to always loose feeling in his legs.  When he went back for a follow up visit they told him that one of the disks had actually ruptured and the liquid inside had leaked out.  Well since all of this has been going on he has been having really bad night sweats everynight.  Could this be related, and if so what should we do about it?  He wakes up every single night totally drenched and cold.  Thank you so much for your help!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Ranjon,  Degeneration of the disc tissue makes the disc more susceptible to herniation (rapture).  Each disc is formed of a central gel-like inside (nucleus pulposus), surrounded by an outer ring (annulus fibrosus).  When this softer component ruptures (herniates) through the outer ring it press directly on nerve roots and irritate adjacent nervous tissue.  These conditions can be treated in the majority of cases with medical and conservative treatment (non surgical).   Non surgical treatment includes, physical therapy, certain exercises, weight reduction, epidural steroid injections, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, and decreased daily activities. The pain usually improves faster than the numbness and the weakness if present.   Surgery for disc herniation is only considered if symptoms are not controlled after at least one month (6 weeks) of medical and conservative treatment, or in very complicated cases with serious symptoms.   Having night sweat as you have described, is a warning sign this usually happens in systemic diseases like tumors and in infections with septicemia. Otherwise, it is anxiety related.   Initial investigations include:  CBC LFT CRP,   Ca level.  Follow up with your doctor is essential.  Hope you find this information useful. Best regards,\n\n",

After a while of bed rest i returned to the doctors with zero improvements. The doctor made me go to physical therapy for 4 weeks 3 days a week. I attended PT with no luck, the Physical therapist couldnt figure out how to help me. After PT they sent me for a MRI, the MRI Report found numerous problems including: 2mm anterolisthesis, with bilateral pars defects. Biforaminal stenosis at L5 impinging the nerve roots. mild broad based disc bulge. Mild disc bulge with chronic focal extrusion at L4-5. After the report my doctor recommened me to a neurosurgeon. After seeing him he thought that i was having muscle problems and not nerve problems, he recommened more PT. I attended PT for another 4 weeks with no help and more pain. At the different PT place they also had problems helping my problem, the symptoms seemed to worsen each and everyday. During my last week of PT i started getting pain that would not allow me to even walk, this lasted 2 days straight. I went back to my neurosurgeon for my follow up the following day. He told me that surgery couldnt fix my back or the type of injections he had, so he is sending me to see a physiatrist to try to help. He said this was the last thing he can do for me. Can someone please help me in figuring out what in the world can be done to help fix my problem...medication has Zero affect on the pain or keeping the spasms down...ive had over 15 different types of meds now...PLEASE HELP ME =)\n\n",

    "content": "Dear godolphins1985,  From the report of the MRI it seems that the only lesion that is more likely to cause nerve compression is the forminal stenosis. Symptoms of foraminal stenosis include:  numbness, weakness, and sensations of burning, tingling in the extremities supplied by the affected  nerve.  They should be treated to avoid sensory or motor loss.  Doctors usually start with conservative and medical therapy. Improvement is expected within 6 weeks of regular treatment as the majority of cases have the pain due to the associated muscle spasm and weakness. If these measure are unsuccessful , surgery- foraminotomy is considered for decompression.   It is not clear for me why your doctor excluded surgical interference. I am not a neurosurgeon, but you can discuss with him.  But, instability of the spine occurs in cases of spondylolisthesis., the neurosurgeon can determine whether , a spinal fusion should be added to decompression to stabilize the spine. You can discuss this possibility also.   Regarding the other lesions showed by the MRI as far as reported , they did not touch the nerves or caused nerve compression. However direct evaluation is essential.  I advise you to follow up with the consultant and to discuss with him this information.  Hope you find this information useful. Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 32 year old mother of a 2 and 4 year old.  A few months ago, after awakening (sleeping on my left shoulder), I felt some pain in my back and chest when bending my neck.  The chiropractor said my ribs were out of alignment and I have been having adjustments for the past 3 months.  Most of the rib pain is gone, and now I only feel it if I bend my neck forward while dropping my left shoulder.  For the past week, I have been experiencing intermitent burning or tightening like pain on my left side of the back in the thoracic area.  I don't know if it is a spasm or a cramp, but it does come and go throughout the day.  It is generally relieved when I sit or lay down.  I went ot my PCP and he gave my lower back exercises to do (but its not my lower back).  He also suggested massage, which I did yesterday and now it is much worse and the shoulder area discomfort seems to be back as well.  I did notice the back pain the morning after I had been bending over cutting out fabric and also doing some neck exercise.  I have no past diagnoses of back or spine problems.   My question is  1) How long should a \"muscular\" injury last- also when palpating the muscles in that area, they are not tender therefore I am wondering if it is muscular) 2) Is there a possibility this could be an issue with my spine 3)How long should I tolerate the discomfort before wanting further evaluation and who do I see then?

    "content": "Dear jenny2,  In most of the cases with back pain, strain of the back muscles and ligaments, is the primary cause. This usually results from wrong or heavy lifting, or following a sudden improper movement.   Muscle spasm alone can cause this pain which can be an unidentified cause but in many cases is the result of an inappropriate posture for long time like travelings, driving and certain types of work. . In these cases, self care and avoiding the precipitating cause will lead to a gradual but clear improvement in the pain. Home treatment includes the use of analgesics, cold or hot therapy.  Rest for maximum two days is also beneficial. If these measures fail to relief the pain or to improve symptoms in 48 hours, otherwise the pain is more likely to be due to other causes, like:  - Herniated disk, in which the inter-vertebral disc press on his nerves,  - Spondylosis which is similar to arthritis but affects the spine etc.  Thoracic outelet syndrome should be excluded also, although your symptoms are not typical but your other posts suggested similar clinical picture.   MRI  is of choice in the diagnosis. These are conditions that need specific therapy.  Follow up with your doctor is essential. Only by complete history and physical examination, the correct diagnosis can be reached.   Hope you find this information useful. Best regards,\n\n",

The pain did not feel deep- it almost felt like it was in my skin. I still feel a \"sensation\" this morning that it was there.  I had this same problem a year ago or so- I woke up regularly for about 2 weeks with this kind of pain- except it was on my right front/outer thigh, and I supposed it had to do with back pain I regularly have on the right side after a long night's sleep.  I was diagnosed recently with Sacroiliac Joint Syndrome. My SI Joint (right side) has always been out of whack- I've never been able to lay flat on a hard surface without pain/discomfort- even since teenage-hood. And now I'm told this problem is degenerating my L1/2 discs, hence the morning back pain.  Anyway- could this thigh pain be back-related? Or a separate issue?

    "title": "Crackling sounds when stretching back",
    "content": "Hi all,  I'm a 36 year old male with a slight curvature of the spine that  causes me some discomfort especially after a days work in the office.  I do try to maintain a good posture but I find it very difficult to keep it that way.  the best way to describe it would be to imagine your back being like a bow that you're trying to keep strait, when you relax it curves back again.  Anway..... I've noticed that over the past couple of years I hear a terrible crackling sound whenever I stretch my back or arch my shoulders & quickly snap back.  it sounds similar to someone crackling their knuckles.  Is this normal or is there something wrong that I should be aware of?  thanks\n\n",

When I stretch my back my shoulder moves as well & maybe the crackling noises are caused by my collarbone  Does that make sense & should I be concerned about my shoulder?  thanks\n\n",

In these cases, self care and avoiding the precipitating cause will lead to a gradual but clear improvement in the pain. Home treatment includes the use of analgesics, cold or hot therapy. Rest for maximum two days is also beneficial.   If these measures fail to relief the pain or to improve symptoms in 48 hours, you should visit your doctor for better evaluation and for exclusion of other causes, like: Herniated disk, Sciatica, Spinal stenosis etc. these are conditions that need specific therapy.

Nerve compression can be due to many reasons, including herniated disc, Spondylosis etc,. These conditions can be diagnosed by imagine studies like MRI (of choice). Since the nature and the character of the pain you experienced for year is changing you better have your self checked up. Take an appointment with your physician and see what he would advise you.

Then had fall from horse about 4 months ago.  Has back spasms so bad he nearly passes out at times.  (Spasms actually show up on x-ray.  X-ray also showed \"slight curvature of the spine to the right\")  He has some numbness in left foot.  Has tingling and pain in left thigh.  Also, pain now radiating from mid thoracic area of back around to front of chest.  MRI shows \"small herniated thoracic disc at T6, T7 level with some slight flattening of the spinal cord\".  Also noted to have some \"lumbar spondylolysis\" and \"facet hypertrophy\".  He has difficulty standing, bending, stooping, and has ALOT of pain when coming from a bend to straightened position.  Limited ROM in left leg also noted.  He has been to a neurosurgeon who noted all of the above plus \"multiple small disc bulges\" in the lumbar spine, however,  Neurosurgeon states he \"feels the pain is primarily muscular\" and put him on anti-inflammatories, narcotics, and gave him an exercise routine.  He has been following medical advice, but pain is getting steadily worse.  (Saw neurosurgeon about a month ago).  We left with the impression that this doctor was not really taking his pain seriously.  How long do we wait for some improvement?  Should we seek second opinion?  How serious can his condition be, and what are the chances of full recovery without surgery?  Thanks for your assistance.\n\n",

It really worries me because the pain will get so bad at times that i can;t move because it hurts so bad it feels numb. Like a white hot feeling. I haven't been able to go to a doctor and will not be able to until March 1st. I secondly don't know what kind of doctor to go to. Any help would be greatly apprciated.\n\n",

In most of these specific conditions, there are associated symptoms and signs that can indicate the possible cause. Lower back pain that is centered in the lower spine and radiates down to both legs is most probably due to compressed nerves. A condition that needs full clinical examination and investigations (including X-ray and MRI) to identify the underlying cause.

Sometimes when i lay on my back i can't get back up again because my back hurts so much and sometimes i get really bad sharp pains in my back. Any suggestion on what this could be?  Thanx\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Andrea359, In most of the cases with back pain, strain of the back muscles and ligaments, is the primary cause. This usually results from wrong or heavy lifting, or following a sudden improper movement. Muscle spasm alone can cause the back pain which can be an unidentified cause. In these cases, self care and avoiding the precipitating cause will lead to a gradual but clear improvement in the pain. Home treatment includes the use of analgesics, cold or hot therapy. Rest for maximum two days is also beneficial. If these measures fail to relief the pain or to improve symptoms in 48 hours, you should visit your doctor for better evaluation and for exclusion of other causes, like: Herniated disk, Sciatica, Spinal stenosis etc. these are conditions that need specific therapy. If the pain is intense, especially when you lay down, if it causes weakness or numbness of the legs, if it is associated with GI or bladder problems, or there is fever or unexplained weight loss, you also have to consult your physician immediately  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Husband age 35 began symptoms 2 yrs ago with slight abdominal discomfort, now has severe pain for 5/6 days per week, has had all  tests, barium studies, endscopy, colonoscopy etc, all normal as are bloods and urine and x rays.Cannot work due to pain which is now progressed to most of his abdomen and groin, ie, testicles and penis. Pain shoots down his leg and he cant walk. Gets tingling in lips and forehead and cannot eat as it brings on sweats but temperature is normal. A doc suggested it cold be a spinal problem, he scaffolded for ten years and lifted a lot of weight, however has had no significant back pain or back problems. Gets a cricked neck often. Morpihine and pethedine have no effect. Has blood in urine sometimes but kidney function has been confirmed normal. Has had CT & MRI but not on spine. Can someone suggest something, as our family life has been shattered, we are at our wits end. Ps.. Had an episode for 24hrs as a teen when legs were paralysed, could it be related.? He also weight lifted prior to becoming ill.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm not a doctor, but given all the tests he has already been through, and knowing how nerve pain can be, it would certainly be worthwhile to see a neurologist or orthopaedist who can evaluate him for spinal nerve pain if you haven't already. A good physical therapist can also help identify the location of the problem, but you need to look for one who understands spine problems. An MRI can help pinpoint the problems, too.  Nerve problems in the spine cause all kinds of seemingly unrelated pain.  If he is open to the idea you might ask your family doctor about antidepressants to help him manage the chronic pain.  And be sure to take care of yourself as well.  It can be overwhelming dealing with the chronic pain of a loved one.  Good luck to you and your husband, and God bless.\n\n",

    "title": "Sciatic Nerve questions",
    "content": "Hello and first off thank you for taking the time to read this and possibly help me out.  I am a 31 year old Male who 4 1/2 years ago had a quite serious motorcycle accident with quite a few injuries to both my legs. I will try and make this as short as possible but I think it definately will help anyone trying to give me advice.  I had dislocated my left knee to the point where my tib/fib was located about 4 or 5 inches up my Femur and it remained dislocated until they operated to stabilize it , upon which it dislocated when they woke me up and then they re stabilized it again surgically. I had also rather severely broken my right tib/fib and ankle in many (roughly 30'ish) places and although it was broken in so many places (spiral fracture) it wasn't a compound fracture due to the safety equiptment I was wearing.  Essentially I hit a wall with both legs first and my one leg fractured quite severely and the other dislocated at the knee from the force which I assume was rather severe.  So I guess the coles notes version from then until now is I spent 2 years and several surgeries non union in my right broken leg and finally at the 2 year mark after re nailing my leg and using an allograft and bone from my hip (lilac crest graft) I was showing bone growth. I then had some scope work done on my left knee from an excellent surgeon and then the same surgeon 1 1/4 years later scoped my knee on the broken right leg and removed the hardwear (IM nail and broken screws) due to it's location. I had broken several screws and the top of the IM nail was actually protruding into my knee so it's removal was needed for me to be on my feet for any length of time.  The last surgery (IM nail removal and right knee scope) was performed at the 3 1/2 year mark and I must say I felt like a completely new man and became very mobile and began my push to return to work. I really did feel incredibly well , all things considering,  So after about 6 months of regaining mobility and pushing for a return to work , which became a struggle to convince many I could do so, I started to have problems with a pain in my lower left buttox. At the time I just assumed I had pulled a muscle but this symptom hadn't been around during any of the 4 years up to this point.  I tried very hard to ignore this pain as I know pain will be a part of my daily life due to the nature of the injuries I had sustained but I am a very optimistic person who was happy to still have both legs and be able to walk and potentially work again at a job I loved.   This pain began to go lower and lower until it would run the length of my left leg. It also gradually became worse as far as pain. I don't want to understate the pain level as I have had many surgeries and injuries to compare it to and it probably ranks right up there with the worst I have had to deal with. Today at the 4 1/2 year mark I am doing a graduated return to work and I am trying my hardest to work around this problem but it's getting to the point where I am unable to sleep for more than a few hours and the pain I wake up in is excruciating. I am forced to get up and try to walk around in order to try and settle the shooting pain and numbness I have developed in my left leg.  My family doctor (who has been amazing) has realized that this is quite possibly irritation of my sciatic nerve and I am scheduled this week (friday) to have nerve conduction tests done. I am so happy that I may finally know where this nerve is being irritated and then hopefully work towards some relief of the daily pain it brings.  I presently take Celebrex 1 to 2 times a day , and have been prescribed muscle relaxants to help aid with sleep. MY doctor also gave me a trial pack of Larika but told me not to start using it until I have the nerve conduction tests perfomed. Physio has tried traction (55lbs so far) and temms treatment but even the traction takes the pain away but only while I am in traction.  I am quite sure this is sciatic related but I am not a doctor and I don't want to pretend that I am one. Everyone from Physio , Chiropractors and now even my family doctor are all agreeing. I just need and want some relief from this pain and want to be where I was 7 months ago , able to be mobile , relatively agile and able to sleep.  I guess my questions are goign to be slightly more specific when I finally know where my sciatic nerve is pinched or irritated but for now I am curious if there is anything I can do to better understand this condition or find ways to deal with it? Is there any new treatments available that I should ask about?    Thanks for reading this far and I would love to answer any questions that might help to answer any of your questions. I even have copies of my Xrays of my legs if that would help.  I will continue to watch this and reply any info requested by anyone in order to make better sense of this issue. I do find it odd that after 4 years and an almost full recovery that this sciatic  problem reared it's ugly head? Any ideas are greatly appreciated.\n\n",

Sitting is torture, standing is a little better, on bad days I can barely walk and laying down does not help.  In the last year I have stopped doing any activity that could possibly disturbed my back and have watched my quality of life steadily decline.  I no longer wear shoes with any sort of heal, I take a gelatin supplement, I bought a tempurpedic mattress and an orthopedic office chair.  I've had MRI's, X-rays, physical therapy, and chiropractic treatment.  I've been to orthopedic specialists, nuerosurgeons, nuerologists, etc  (I've also been cleared by my gynocologist).   No one can find anything wrong.  The chiropractor helped control the pain for a good amount of time but its effectiveness plateaud and then declined.  Tomorrow I am starting treatment with an acupuncturist.  I'm also going in to have my skeletal structure measured for symmetry.  If that does not work I plan on trying reflexology.  Does anyone have any suggestions or even wild guesses?    I will try anything and I'm not giving up until I find something that works.  (side note:  I did intensive gymnastics until age 12.  I have always been extremely flexible.  My elbows dislocate easily.  The first time it happened I was about 5 and no one knew what it was so we went and had it x-rayed.  The doctor said there was nothing wrong with my x-ray and had no idea why I was in so much pain.  It wasn't until they brought in the third doctor that someone figured out my problem.  Is it possible (or likely) that if a dislocated elbow won't show up on an x-ray, maybe there is something wrong with my spine even though it appears to be fine?)\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,   I am a 26 year old male and I have had problems with upper back pain intermittently since I was 12 years old.   The pain is quite local to the right side of centre of my upper back, sort of just above the height of my elbow (if that makes sense!) the pain used to radiate across the whole of my upper back, but recntly it feels really sharp and concentrated on one spot.   I have seen physiotherapists and chiropractors, and have worked to keep my posture straight and do all the excersises I am told. I have played sports pretty much all my life and am generally quite active. Up until recently my pain never stopped me playing sports, in fact the activity seemed to help. However, I am now finding it less manageable and it seems to be causing futher injuries.   I am sure my posture and the fact I work at a desk is part of the cause, but as much as I try to correct these things they are just as uncomfortable as the pain itself.   I was wondering if any of you could reccomend any other treatments, or have had the same problem and could maybe give me some advice.   Thanks for reading!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear foxymfc  I was wondering whether or not you have tried to use over the counter NSAID, like ibuprofen (Advil), or aleve. Many times , in such cases because of their pain relieving effects and their anti-inflammatory properties help solve the problem.  I f your pain does not improve with such medicines, i recommend that you see your doctor, it could be muscle tension or spasms. If that is the case your doctor will prescribe a medicine  known as Muscle relaxant for 5-10 days, and the problem will be solved.  Thank you very much and i hope you feel better soon.\n\n",

I went to a kineseologist and she gave me a few exercises to do, saying that it would make my vertebral column straight making me shrink about 4 cms.  The thing is that I never did the exercises like I was supposed to (for 3 months), and I still have back problems. I don't have health insurance, so I can't really afford going to the doctor right now, but I would like to do the exercises she gave me, but I don't know if that is advisable, since it has been a while and my problem might have changed. I would like to go back to see a kineseologist eventually, but for now, could anybody let me know if you think I should go ahead and work on my exercises?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I don't know if this will help you at all, but I am an 18 year old female whom was diagnosed with Scoliosis also.  After being diagnosed, my family found one of the best doctors around to help me.  My back got worse with time, which he said would happen.  He advised me to wear a brace which would slow the progression, but as I got older and more self concious about myself, I stopped wearing it, which led to me having to have back surgery.  As I said before, my doctor is one of the best and he has never told me to do any kinds of exercises for Scoliosis.  To be honest, I don't see how that would effect anything at all.  I've been dealing with Scoliosis since I was in the 3rd grade, so I do know a lot about it.  Needless to say, I've pretty much been through it all with Scoliosis.  Now, beings that you weren't diagnosed with Scoliosis until later in your teenage years, your situation may be slightly different than mine.  My advice to you, would be to get a second opinion from a really good doctor about the exercises.  Like I said before, I've never heard of that.  Just thought I would tell you my story and let you know what my passed experience has been.  Hope I have helped or at least let you see a different side to things.  Take care and good luck!\n\n",

    "title": "Diagnosed with Bulging Disk in lumbar region",
    "content": "I am 28 years old and over the summer started having these pains in my left calf.  Did not think much of it as it seemed to only occur when sitting.  The pain didn't stop me from doing anything.  I kept playing golf, softball, and walking/running on a treadmill 3-4 days a week. One morning I woke up and my back hurt like hell.  Went to the doctor and scheduled my for a MRI.  The MRI showed a bulging disk I believe in the T1-S5 region. The doctor referred me to a pain management facility and they basically wanted to give me an epideral block injection. From what I know the epideral only minimizes the pain and doesn't really fix anything.  I didn't do the epideral as i wasn't to thrilled about a needle in my back.  The pain lasted for a while longer but by the end of the summer the pain stopped.  I stopped playing golf and walking/running.  From about September to now I have not had any pain. But this week the pain came back.  It's either a tingling or pin-prick pain in my left calf or my left-buttocks hurts(basically a pain in my butt, literally). Also, my left hamstring is wound up pretty tight.  I can lay down and lift my right leg to about an 80degree angle before it hurts.  My left leg can only get up to about a 40 degree angle from the floor before it hurts. I am looking for ways to help cope with this.  I sit at a computer all day so I know proper posture should help.  I've heard that a bulging disk can repair itself if taking care of but don't know if this is correct or not.   It does not stop me from doing day-to-day things but my wife and I are having are first baby in July 2005 and I really would like to get a handle on this so I can enjoy fatherhood without having to think about this. Can a bulging disk heal itself and go back to its proper position releaving the inflammation on the nerve or is this something that I will need to deal with the rest of my life?  If it is something I will have to deal, what are some ways to minimize the pain?  Thanks for any input, appreciate it.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Hole-n-one,  I am sorry to hear of your discomfort.  I will try to help.  Lets what makes up your back skeleton first, to help understand what is going on here.  Your spine  made of small \"blocks\" of bones called your vertebrae and is able bend and twist because of the specialised joints and ligaments between these bones.  The disc is one such kind of joint. it is like a bag of jelly, and sits between the bodies of two vertebrae.  Behind the disc, the rest of the vertebra forms an channel (the spinal canal)  through which the spinal cord, and the nerves leaving the spinal cord lie.  The vertebrae are numbered in your neck from C1-C7, in the back of chest from T1 to T12, in your lower back from L1 to L5, then comes your sacrum which is lots of vertebrae fused as one bone without discs between them, and then is your coccyx...your \"tail bone\".  Your lesion is probably between L5 and S1 (rather than T1 and S5)  These discs are made of a fibrous bag containing jelly like material, and a weakness in the bag wall can make a part of the disk bulge.  This bulge can irritate a nerve in the spinal canal, and cause the sysmptoms your describe, sometimes also called \"sciatica\".  Irritation around the nerev is contributed to by inflammation (swelling) around the bulging disc, arthritis in other joints in you spinal column (the facet joints if you want to know), or the ligmants being thickened. Muscle spasm in you back may increase the stiffness and pain.  Essentially the canal in which the nerves lie is a finite space and a number of things contribute to there being less room for your nerve. Your bulging disc is just one cause identified on MRI, other contributory factors exist.  A prolapsed disc is when the jelly \"pops out\" of the bag, and lies in the canal, and is usually much more serious.  Becuase there are multiple contributing factors, not everyone with bulging discs have symptoms that you describe, and vice versa.  An irritated nerve gives you pain and pins and needles, and reduction in your ability to straight leg raise.  Nerve function is compromised when you have numbness or weakness, and if this is persistent, then nerve damage is occuring.   (Severe compromise of nerve roots can cause a situation when the nerves to your bladder and bowel sphincters get compromised and this is called cauda equina syndrome...but lets not worry about that for now, apart from saying that if these occur, you should seek formal medical advice immediately.)  Having said that thee are many contributary factors, it means that just because you have a bulging disc, you don't have to deal with the disc itself.  It does sometimes shrink, by itself, so often the pain is self limitting.  Just as often it is possible that the inflammation in this region is the easiest factor to treat.  Anti-inflammatory medication, epidural injections as well as rest help reduce this inflammation, and symptoms may subside until your body gets its act together and the disc dehydrates a little, and reduces in size.  Treating disc bulges themselves is not recommended, as the risks from surgery can be quite serious.  However if nerve damage is occuring, or cauda equina is present, surgery is mandatory.  In answer to your question, I myself don't believe that buging discs become normal again, as a dehydrated disc while certainly may not have as big a bulge, functions less well.  This is is not noticable in the majority of situations, but may contribute to degenerative processes in the future.  Treatments follows a ladder of therapeutic options, with each step up the ladder being more aggressive, and therefore with greater side effects and potential complications.  So the management should be rest, analgesia, anti-inflammatories and occassional muscle relaxants (to help reduce the muscle spasm ) intially.  gentle exercises after this intial rest, with a physio.  Epidurals if the nerve irritation persists despite these treatments, and as  a last resort surgery...unless there is a reason to bypass these less aggressive steps.   Hope this helps, and take care  Saif\n\n",

Dave As of yet I still know nothing about this and am still in pain.  Please, if anyone has an answer for me, either an axplanation of the problem or some way to treat it, let me know.  post here, or you can e-mail me directly at Wilykit11001@aol.com  Thank you!\n\n",

Then it says soemthing about moderate encroachment upon the lateral recesses bilaterally left side greater thatn the right. The other MRI with the contrast says: DDD and endplate spondylosis at L5/S1 with a broad based disc bulge in that area.  I have had a discogram and I don't know the results of that yet but this pain is terrible. Any insight to this.  I had back surgery in 2000 a laminectomy and doctor talking a possilble fusion. Is there anything I can take or do to get out of this sever pain, its is disabling I cant function and pain is bad. Thank you for reading and look forward to hear from you.[/b]\n\n",

    "title": "Are all these problems related?",
    "content": "Hello, my story is quite a long one so bear with me:  I am a 22 y o female. When I was about 7 or 8 years old, I used to complain about ankle problems. Back then, I had blood tests run, CT scans, and they even put a walking cast on my left ankle for a while. They never found a real problem, and the orthopedic surgeon called it \"growing pains\" and said I had flat feet also. I was given custom orthotics (at age 7 or .  Things stayed pretty much the same, growing up I always experienced some type of pain in my legs.  In 2000 (age 17) I started getting horrible throbbing pains in my shins when I walked (at a normal pace to class - I was in college).  Being used to leg pain I didn't really seek help for it.  A coulpe months later, I started having stabbing pains in the bottoms of my feet. i could barely walk so I went to the doctor.  I was then diagnosed with plantar fasciitis and ordered physical therapy for both that and the shin splints (which consisted of stretching and icing).  The shin splints never got better, so I went to a podiatrist and had custom orthotics made again.  Suffice it to say, after a period of 5 years, I've been prescribed therapy, blood tests (to rule out arthritis), bone scan, and MRI, orthotics, and even had the orthotics readjusted and I'm still having the shin pain.  Then about 3 years ago, I started having a pain in my buttocks.  It's a dull pain that stays there always, is worse when I'm sitiing, and sometimes is severe (about once a week).  I've been th the GP and orthopedice surgeon, have had the same tests as above, and still nothing.  So my question is could all theses things be related, and what could it be?  I've been to a podiatrist, GP, and orthopedic surgeon, physicla therapist, and nobody has come up with anything.  These seem more like runner's injuries to me but I have never been a runner.  For the past 3 years I have been going to the gym regularly (3-6 days/week), but I don't do anything high impact.  Sorry for the long post, I hope somebody can help.\n\n",

Unfortunately, DDD is degenerative, meaning it gets worse gradually, as the discs are losing the fluid that absorbs the shock between the vertebrae when active.  When it gets to the point of the vertebrae rubbing together, there is surgical intervention to consider.  Are you taking a daily antiinflammatory?  If the antiseizure meds don't work, those will usually give you some relief.  Did your doctor give you back excercises to do?  They help immensely.  If he didn't ask him for a handout describing them, or look them up on the internet.  I am sorry to hear that you're having to suffer at such a young age.\n\n",

A tiny central annular tear is present however. The annular fibers that surround the disc are torn, but minimally at the L3/L4 disc  Axial scans through the L4-L5 level show a central disc herniation minimally indenting the thecal sac and extending behind the superior endplate of the L5 vertebral body.  When the disc tears significantly enough, the nucleus pulposis inside can squeeze out into the spinal column. This is a significant disc injury and most likely very painful. Axial scans through the L5-S1 level show diffuse disc bulge to the left side without significant nerve root compression. There is mild degenerative facet joint disease present. This disc has a mild injury to the fibers causing a \"bulge\" like what a balloon does when you squeeze it.  There is a small synovial cyst seen posterolateral to the right L3-L4 facet joint.  This is a lump that forms in the ligaments around right L3/L4 joint. Probably insignificant.\n\n",

    "title": "Bulging disc in Lumbar",
    "content": "Hello, I'm a 42 year old letter carrier. On 1/11/05, I fell while walking my route hitting  my left hip on concrete. Other than a severe bruise, I thought I was OK, but a few days later I develop some mild discomfort in my right hip. This progressed over a week until I was unable to stand up straight or extend my right leg without excrutiating pain. My family doctor thought it was related to my hip, but she found nothing wrong through x-rays and an MRI. She referred me to a PT who recognized that it was spine related and referred me to another doctor who had an MRI with plain films done. The results were: Anterior disc bulging with spondylosis noted predominantly at L2-3, L4-5 and L5-S1, posterior narrowing noted at L5-S1, conus medullaris normal at T12-L1, no disc herniation or protrusion at any level, minimal bulging of disc into the neuro-foraminal, bilaterally at L3-4 and L4-5, greater to the right, slight effacement of right dorsal ganglion of L3, no stenosis at any level, moderate neuro-foraminal stenosis bilaterally at L3-4 and L4-5. Since I filed a workman's comp claim, I'm playing the waiting game because they have to approve any treatment and this can take forever. In the meantime, I've picked up some books from the library, and I have been doing exercises from them. I have been taking celebrex for about 2 weeks. While I have noticed a big improvement in my pain, I still cannot lay flat on my stomach without severe pain in my hip. I'm afraid of nerve damage. I do still feel some prickling and numbness, and sometimes when I step up on my right leg it feels like I may fall (not all the time). I've been on light duty at work to keep me active, but when I try to strap a satchel over my shoulder, the pain radiates down the hip, front of thigh and groin. Is there anything else I can do while waiting for approval from workman's comp?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Fell, Scoliosis occurs relatively frequently in the general population, and its frequency depends upon the magnitude of the curve being described. Scoliosis of greater than 25 degrees has been reported in about 1.5/1000 persons in the United States. Most curves can be treated nonoperatively if they are detected before they become too severe. However, 60 % of curvatures in rapidly growing prepubertal children will progress. Therefore, scoliosis screening is done in schools across America and several other countries. This screening is probably not necessary until the fifth grade. Beyond that point, boys and girls should be examined every 6 - 9 months. Generally, curvatures less than 30 degrees will not progress after the child is skeletally mature. Once this has been established, scoliosis screening and monitoring can usually be stopped. However, with greater curvatures, the curvature may progress at about 1 degree per year in adults. In this population, monitoring should be continued.  If scoliosis is neglected, the curves may progress dramatically, creating significant physical deformity and even cardiopulmonary problems with especially severe curves. Currently, scoliosis is treated successfully by special braces, electrical stimulation, surgery, or by combinations of these three techniques.   Generally, scoliosis is treated by orthopedic surgeons with special training in spinal problems. However, radiographic scoliosis examinations are ordered by a wide variety of other physicians, most of whom look toward the radiologist as the local musculoskeletal expert, after the orthopedist. Therefore, one must know how to read these films and how to dictate a coherent and helpful interpretation of them.  The treatment prescribed for scoliosis, kyphosis or lordosis varies with the individual patient. Severity and location of the curve, age, potential for further growth and general health of the patient all must be taken into account. A mild curvature (up to 20 degrees) generally needs only periodic observation to watch for signs of further progression. Bracing is the usual treatment for children and adolescent with curves of 25-40 degrees, and in other special circumstances.  As for the stretch marks was your son overweight and then lost it?? I don't see a connection but I could be wrong.   I hope this helps.\n\n",

I have been living with lower back pain ever since, This August I reinjured my back and i went to a neuro surgeon who ordered an MRI. The MRI showed a huge disc herniation in the L5-S1 region. The pain that I experiecne is not only in my lower back but in my tail bone and I get pain in my butt and numbness in both legs and feet from time to time. However, Just recently when I get my period I experince severe pain in my anus which is bothersome when I strain to go the bathroom and when I try to sit. I was wondering if this is normal, when you have a herinaition in this area of your back. By the way I will be having microdisc surgery as soon as I get approved from workers compensation.  Thank you, Beth\n\n",

Primary diagnosis was herniated L45.  Two days after I noticed pain after poopin.  This was not any ordinary pain.  It was the most you could ever imagine coming from that place.  I asked my Doc, he said maybe the vicadin stiffened the stool, but it didnt.  I went to a GP, and was checked.  He was not able to even check the anal cavity because of the pain.  His diag:  A common every day fissure.  A dry crack in the lining or wall of the anus.  There wer a few treatment options, some had dangers of eating away at the lining.  Nitro was one that was referred  quite often.  I used Tucks pads, and layed on the couch with tears down my face.  It's kinna wierd, it didnt hurt while going, or, for about 5 minutes after, but then it was the most painful thing I ever had.  No pain killers would touch it. It lasted 1 month, all I used was a iced cloth, aspirin and tucks.  I was very careful not to lift.  Just when I could no longer take it, it went away.  So good luck, and with something that painful I would still see a Doc about it in case it's something else.\n\n",

A diagnosis of osteoarthritis in the neck and spinal stenosis have been made by one neurologist.  In addition, the neurologist stated that the spinal fluid flows from the brain to the neck area, then is absent from the spine for about two inches, but is visible again, and continues downward, after the \"empty\" area.  Numbness, pain and active spasms are present in the left arm. I have had no luck researching this and not much more luck in getting straight answers.  I am hoping someone can give me any information, even if it is minimal, about what may be  causing this and if there are treatment options available.

The pain is directly behind my ovary area - but in the back, at the hip area. Maybe this is related??  I have no extended health coverage therefore can't afford physio, chiropractor, other therapy.\n\n",

    "content": "I am 38 years old and I hurt my lower back when trying to move a heavy box.  My MRI says 1. Mild Posterior Disk Bulge at L3-L4,L4-L5, and L5-S-1. 2. Moderate Central Canal Stenosis at L5. 3. Facet Hypertrophy at L3-L4, L4-L5 and L5-S1. 4. Mild Bilateral Neural Foraminal Narrowing at L4-L5.  I realize there were some changes going on but I never had any pain before I moved the box.  The pain was acute and it was eight months ago.  The episodes of pain would come and go but now that I am at a different job which requires me being on my feet sometimes eight hours a day; this episode that started about month ago will not go away and continues to get worse.  I wear a lumbar support brace, I have tried all medications to no avail, I have had a steroid injection, and do therapy along with home exercises.  The pain has gotten so bad now that it is all I can do to work.  Even sitting on light duty hurts.  I go to therapy and wear my brace.  My legs and feet are always tingling and will go completely numb; worse on the right side.  The pain is getting excruciating and yet my doctor says that it helps to work all day and has me at full duty.  All my life is just working because I need my job, the rest of my life is spent in bed or on the couch.  I have three children to raise and I am scared that it is going to get worse and worse.  My doctor says that therapy will cure me even though I am working forty hours a week and my therapist says that the therapy is not going to work if I do not rest it.  Is therapy going to help?  What are my options?  I am at my wits end, is there a cure?  Will I always live in this pain?  Am I hurting myself more by working forty hours a week?  What does all this MRI mean?  It really hasn't been explained to me, I just know I hurt.  Sitting hurts, standing hurts, my legs and feet always tingle and go numb when I sit, I have given my life up to pain this time and it has been a burden on my family and I have no quality of life in this pain.  I am having another epidural, will this hurt me? Cure the problem? Hurt the problem?  I am desperate and all I get from my doctor is \"you will get through it.\"  What tests can be done other than an MRI? What will they show?  Since the numbness goes away, does this mean that I do not have nerve damage?  What could I be doing to make it worse?  Thank you for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Mrs\" In Pain\",  I am sorry to hear about your discomfort. Lets see if If I can start be explaining your MRI findings first., and I apologise if you know all this already.  Your spine as you know is made of vertebrae (the bony part) joined together in a chain by discs (like bags of jelly) and facet joints (sort of like hinges), and ligaments.  Through the spine as you, probably know, runs the spinal cord and the nerve roots that supply the rest of your body with sensation and motor function.  The cord and the nerve roots lie just behind the discs, and in front of the hinges, and the nerve roots leave the spinal canal through narrow gaps called the foramens (actually foramina).  The bags of jelly that allow the movement of the spine, can, because of degenerative chnages or do to an injury develop a weakness in its wall.  This results in a bulge in the disc.  The wall may actually rupture leading to extrusion of the jelly like material in the disc.  The facet joints undergoing an arthritis process may enlarge.  The  ligament may appear to become thickened.  On top of  these four,  there may be inflammatory swelling. All these narrow the space for the cord and the nerve roots in the canal and the foramina.  This narrowing is called stenosis.  A lot of these changes can be occuring causing little symptoms over many years.  Two types of pain occur.  One is pain in your back itself. This is usually mechanical, due to the injury to the back, the arthritis in you facet joints etc.  Then there is the radicular pain that is the pain caused by pressure on the nerve roots.  Pins and needles are caused by irritation of the roots, numbness and weakness are caused by the compromise to the function of the roots.  Conservative (non-operative) treatment is based on the fact that most situations the pain is self limiting.  The disc prolapses tend to shrivel over time, the swelling around arthritic facet joints also improve with the use of anti-inflammatory drugs, and physical therapy can sometimes \"untrap\" a nerve (although the main purpose of physical therapy is to maintain mmuscle tone in your back).  Although corsets may reduce the mechanical component of the pain, they also induce wasting of the muscles. Muscle tone is important as a person in pain moves less, so the muscle weaken, and this leads to less intrinsic support of  the back, leading to further mechanical pain.  It is this the physical therapy is targetted against.   The inflammatory swelling is addressed by the use of anti-inflammatories.  Sometimes an epidural nijection of steroids may also calm down the angriness of the tissues and give the roots a little more room.  Operative surgery is indicated when there is intractable pain, when there is sustain eveidence of nerve function compromise (e.g. numbness that doesnot resolve, or weakness, e.g. a foot drop).  If there is a large central disc prolapse, then there is a potential for a serious conditioan called cauda equina sysndrome to develop. Problems with your \"water works\" or your bowels, numbness in your \"saddle\" area are warning signs and need immediate attention, and possibly surgery.  Surgery however has its own complications (some graver than the problem that led to it), which is why there is a reluctance to use this as a first resort.   Please don't feel abandoned to your pain.  Your doctor will try his (or her) best to find the best solution for you.  Unfortunately, initially the best solution is patience, unless some of the critical signs I have mentioned are present.  If things do not improve other interventions, including perhaps  surgery will I am sure be offered.to you.  I do hope things start to settle down, and hope that this information helps.  Saif\n\n",

    "title": "LS Spine MRI",
    "content": "Can someone make sense out of this MRI:TECHNIQUE:. Multiplanar MRI of the lumbar spine was petforrned using spin echo technique. T1 proton density and T2 weighted sagittal images as well as T1 and T2 weighted axial scans through the L1-2, L2- 3 L3- 4, L4-5 and L5- S1 disc spaces were performed.  FINDINGS:. Coronal imaging demonstrates a normal appearance to the spine. In the sagittal plane however there is obvious malalignment with a first-degree anterior listhesis of L4 on L5. The etiology is bilateral pars interarticularis defects. (The L5 vertebra is sacralized; a small diminutive L5-S1 disc is present and normal.) At anatomical T12-L1, L1-L2, and L2-L3, there is a normal appearance to the disc margin, to the contour and size of the thecal sac, and to the exit foramina. At L2-L3, there is some fluid in the soft tissues immediately posterior to the left facet joint, likely a small synovial cyst. The canal at this level is normal. At anatomical L3-L4, there is desiccation and narrowing of the disc height. There is circumferential bulging of the posterior disc margin, accompanied by some osseous sparring to the left of the midline. Mild impingement on the base of the left foramen is present. At the malaligned L4-L5 level the medial aspect of the right foramen is moderately narrowed; because of the rnalalignment the foramen is elongated in the anterior/posterior dimension and narrowed in the superior/inferior dimension. On the left side at this level a severe degree of foraminal impingement and likely compression of the exiting nerve root is observed. In addition, lateral recess narrowing is present. Some stress response in the left pedicle of L4 and in the left lemma of L5 is seen as T2 signal increase.  IMPRESSION:. 1. A transitional lumbosacral vertebra, with sacralization of the L5 vertebra and a normal-appearing but small disk at L5-S1 noted. 2. Just above this level, at anatornical L4-L5, bilateral pars interarticularis defects have led to a first degree anterior listhesis of L4 on L5. Moderate right and marked left foraminal narrowings are observed. Lateral recess stenosis is present bilaterally but the canal itself is not compromised and demonstrates typical anterior/posterior elongation. 3. At the anatomical L3-L4 level, the disc shows narrowing and desiccation. Mild left foraminal impingement due to left-sided osseous ridging is seen. The canal is normal in size at the disc space and shows some mild coronal narrowing at the upper endplate of L5. 4. All of the visualized interspaces above anatomical L3-L4 are normal. Each of the vertebrae, including L4 and L5 demonstrate normal contour and signal in the marrow space.  This is what a CT Scan indicated:\"bilateral spondylolysis and a resultant grade 1-2 anterolisthesis of L5 on S1. mild proliferative changes in the facet joints at this level together with the spondylolisthesis is resulting in a mild posterolateral central spinal stenosis. otherwise normal computed tomography of the lumbar spine from L1-S1.  My general physician told me when an x-ray first showed my problem that the orthopedist he was referring me to would give me a PT program to follow and that surgery was the last resort. When I went to the orthopedist the only thing he said was surgery.  When he went over that above MRi with my wife and myself he said that he thought therapy would not help in my situation but I opted for it anyway to see if I can get relief that way. I am just weary about back surgery and also wondering about the two differences in opinions of what route to go with my condition.  anyone have any ideas?\n\n",

    "title": "DDD, DJD...Oh My!!",
    "content": "This may be an unanswerable question...at least in layman's terms that I can understand...but I'm hoping someone can tell me how a simple fall can cause so many problems in one body. About 6 months ago I fell on a wet cement floor and have had a host of problems ever since. Through MRI's, Xrays, etc. I found out I have cervical DDD and stenosis, hip and L4-5 DJD and facet degeneration, and have had problems with a ganglion cyst (wrist), vertigo, SI joint and sacrum problems, etc.. My neck has no natural curve left, has almost started to curve backwards, and I have a spondolitic disc. Some of the problems are most likely because of the fall, like the SI joint and sacrum problems, but many of the issues, like the DDD, have obviously been around a while...how is it  that I had no idea they were there until after I fell?  The orthopedist told me the fall probably made the issues I already had symptomatic (i.e. the arthritis in my hip, lower back, and neck) but I could never get him to talk to me long enough to find out how. Is it that the fall activated some kind of chemicals in my body that aggrivated the arthritic areas or something else? I'm also interested in suggestions on how to minimize the discomfort and progression of as many of the issues as possible. I do home exercises that the physical therapist gave me, and they help some, but are there dietary changes, vitamins, or other things I can do to help so I can minimize taking medications? I have a great deal of trouble with side effects. Any suggestions and information would be greatly appreciated as I find I can definately identify with the wicked witch in the Wizard of Oz lately...I feel, most days, like a house fell on me.  Take care and thanks! Aimee\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Machela,  Your lower back pain can be due to a number of things, and included in that is of course pain related to an old injury.  To determine if this is the case requires a more detailed history, however and preferably an examination.  I would recommend this...however, as we are here to try and help here are a few things one can think about...  You say that the pain is constant.  1) How long have you had it?  Ever since this injury aged 5, or did it come on sometime later?  If the former, it is possible that the injury is releted to your pain. 2) What makes it worse...if movements of the back it worse, but rest helps it, then it is possible that the pain is mechanical in nature.   Do you think it is realted to the job that you do? 3) Where exactly is it...can you out a finger on a tender spot?  Young adults can get sacro-iliitis, which may be the couse of pain and sometimes this is associated with other problems, e.g.  tummy problems, or gynae problems...do you have any abdominal, pelvic pains?  Some causes of back pain are things like fibromyalgia...this causes multiple focal tender luimops in the back. 4) Does the pain go anywhere else?  Pain going into your groin, or abdominal or varying in intensity, that comes and goes without warning, and that is not affected by rest of exercise may suggest a problem not related to your back at all.  Pian radiating down your leg and associated with numbness, pins and needles, and weakness may be related to a prolapsed disc...although this is less likely at your age. 5) etc...we could go on...  But as to whether it could be related to your injury as a child... the answer is yes.  You say you couldn't walk for a few seconds....a few seconds is quite a short time actually, and I will presume this represents just the shock of the fall rather than an actual transient neurological functional loss.  We can discuss these options further if you wish, but it is impossible to wade through the enormous number of possible causes of back pains...a visit to your doctr may help...but a large number of patients with low back pain can remain unexplained....

    "content": "I had similar symptoms for months after a fall and my physical therapist finally figured out it was SI joint disfunction. They did an MRI when I had trouble with lower back and hip pain as well as numbness/pins and needles in my right leg and sometimes in my feet after sitting...along with a few other symptoms...all they found was some minor bulging and minimal arthritis and facet joint degeneration. As you said, not enough to explain the symptoms. From my understanding, especially if they are out of \"whack\" over a long period, your SI joints can cause all kinds of problems/pain including symptoms that mimic sciatica and lower spine problems. If you look up SI joint dysfunction in a google search or on Medline plus, Mayo clinic, or e-madicine I'll bet you could find information enough to see if you think it may be what's going on. My PT was able to change my exercise routine from a lower back routine to one that worked on the muscles that were messed up because of my SI joint issues and it worked wonders. I still have bad days and if I don't do my exercises I really regret it but the exercises really do help. Hope this helps give you some information that might help and good luck in getting some lasting relief.\n\n",

    "content": "I have been having pain in my left shoulder/scapula and down left arm since last week. It has been so bad at times that I experience nausea. I have had no known injury. The only time I am pain free is when I am recumbant or semi recumbant in bed. I've had an EKG and it was normal. Does this sound like a pinched nerve in my neck or is it something else?  Some fellow coworkers have suggested pinched nerve, Thoracic outlet Syndrome. I've been doing some online research and some of my symptoms point to other possibilities such as Angina, Thoracic aneurysm.  I hope to get an appointment with DR. Tomorrow. I wonder if I should see Primary Care physician first or push for Orthopedist.\n\n",

    "title": "Lower Back Pain and Chiropractic Care",
    "content": "I am a 21 yom that has been experiencing some lower back pain.  The pain when it is at it's worst is aboout a 7 and on a normal day it is about a 2 or 3.  I work 12 hour shifts on an ambulance about five days a week.  I thought that maybe a chiropractor could posibly help me out with the pain.  So I went to a chiropractor and had a consultation and had numerous x-rays taken of my spine.  the x-rays showed that I had a slight curve of my spine towards my left side.  He noted that no spurs or herniated disks were present.  The x-ray also showed that my left leg is about half an inch shorter that the right leg.  The x-ray of my neck showed that instead of my neck having a natural curve- my neck was straight.  The chiropractor stated that he would like to start a course of treatment that included 5 visits a week for four weeks and then would decide if it was helping my back.   So far I have done 3 visits which included neck manipulation, back manipulation, electro therapy of the back with cold treatments.  I am just wondering if anyone else has this similar problem, and is the chiropratic therapy gonna really help my spine and pain?  Every visit I go to I have to pay a $40 co-pay.  So if I have to pay this much money, is the therapy really gonna make a difference?  Sincerely, Michael C.\n\n",

    "content": "Sorry to hear about the back problem.  As a Doctor of Chiropractic myself, I can reassure you that the chiropractor you are seeing has been straight forward with his treatment recommendations.  Although, it is impossible to see disc herniations/bulges from an x-ray alone.  An MRI is more sensitive for soft tissue lesions.  If you job requires alot of sitting, that may contributing to the cause.  Consider using an exercise ball to increase low back endurance and core stability.  Hang in there, chiropractic is kinda like physical therapy...it takes a series of sessions and time to get results.\n\n",

    "content": "I have had chronic back and neck pain resulting from a car accident 8 years ago. I currently see a chiropractor once a week, but I do not hold the adjustments for more than two days. I have been to an orthopedist, a neurologist, my regular practioner, and three chiropractors. I have had x-rays, 2 MRIs and an EMG. All came back negative. The pain is so bad sometimes, that I cannot go to work. I work on a computer all day, which I know is not good for my situation, but I have a good chair and I try to walk around a lot during the day. Also, I usually try to do an aerobics with weights routine three times a week. I am 30 years old and 100 pounds. I eat healthy and take a multivitamin. Is is possible to have weak muscles that cannot be strengthened? I am at my wit's end with this pain. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Yours is an all to common problem after neck/back strain, long term.  It very rarely shows up on testing.  If you have no history of ulcers, take an antiinflammatory as directed daily to keep some of the pain and inflammation down.  It does help immensely.  Also, there are some reports that although adjustments give you relief temporarily, they can actually make the problem worse.  Try backing off the adjustments for a few weeks.  You may find the pain lessens a great deal.  Also, weights are not always a good idea, as even correct positioning does put some strain on your neck and back and particularly crunches.  Make sure you are not overtraining, wear a supporting belt and if it hurts, stop.  I know you don't want to hear any of this, but you have to change something, obviously what you are doing isn't working, and I have seen this work very well in many cases.\n\n",

    "content": "Since late February, early March, I've been having moderate to severe back pain in between my spine and up toward my left scapula. The pain doesn't descend past the 10th or 11th rib, but doesn't go past mid-scapula area. At times, there are specific points that are painful to the touch, other times a slight push on the general area makes for a painful rib crushing-like feeling. During the pain which can be all day, certainly after activities (but not only), and at night, it's tough to breath. Some days there is no pain, others there is a lot.  The pain can subside with various positioning of my left arm, and when I curl my spine. It's probably obvious that I should see a doctor, but what should I be expecting?  Any help would be great.\n\n",

    "content": "I am confused.  I have had severe pain in my left arm, shoulder and shoulder blade area as well as the middle of my back from the shoulder blade up to my neck.  I had an x-ray and an MRI and was told that I \"had a pinched nerve  and was ruptured big time and it was going down my spinal column and I needed to see a neurologist right away because surgery was the only option I had\".  I went to see a neurologist who looked at my MRI and my x-ray and gave me medicine (cortizone & scalaxin-- might not be spelled right), had me do cervical traction at home, and exercises for my left arm and my neck.  I had to stop the traction because it made the pain around my shoulder blade and middle of back more painful.  The doctor told me to stop if it hurt.    My confusion is that one doctor stressed a sense of urgency to see a neurologist and told me my only option was surgery.  The neurologist tells me to do  the cervical traction, take the medicine, and do the exercises and that I don't need the surgery unless I just want it.  He is more than willing to do the surgery but only if I say it's necessary.  I told him that he was the doctor and I needed to go by his expertise as he knew more about what was going on inside me than I do (no one has fully explained it to me nor explained what would be involved if I had surgery).  I was told by the first doctor that my 5th and 6th discs were in bad shape (or it may have been the 4th & 5th) and my nerve was probably being pinched in that area and that I have spurs.  My question?  Who do I listen to--the one that tells me surgery is my only option or the one that tells me he'll do the surgery if and when I want him to because he treats the patient and not the x-ray?\n\n",

I have now been running for a year, and have begun to develop a sharp pain in my hips.  This pain started in the flexors and has now moved to the side, under the hip socket, if that makes sense.  I have a suspicion that this is related to my back injury, but haven't been able to find any information about it.    Thank you\n\n",

The pain that I am expericining is so hard to explain. I have had X-Rays, MRI, and alot of medications.

You should probably be seeing a bone specialist; I think your second doctor was probably right to order another x-ray. If you can, try to hold off on the chiropractor treatment until after you get the results from the second x-ray just to make sure there isn\u2019t anything that can become loose through manipulation.

I went to see him for a few months and my pain is pretty much gone except in the mornings, and I no longer have constant pins and needles in my legs, feet, and toes. My grade was also reduced to 25 percent compare to over 50 percent a little more than a  grade 2. You should know that my chiropractor is also a M.D. in orthopedics and was a M.D. for a NFL football team. I feel you should extensively research your chiropractor, because I know many of them out there would only make your matter worse. However, the right one with a great reputation could help if you don't want surgery.\n\n",

    "content": "about 2 months ago i was fishing with a buddy, i was rowing a drift boat and also pulling up an anchor which was about 45 pounds, to pull the anchor, u have to bend over while rowing and pull it up through the pulley, anyway i pulled something in my lower back, the pain lasted for about a week, the symptoms included sore lower back, and also it felt like my hamstring was pulled too. its hard to describe, but when it first happened i noticed that i was even experiencing cramps in my left calve. well after  a couple of weeks the lower back pain went away  and the only pain seemed to be coming from my hamstring.  almost three months later, i have re-injured it, not even sure how, now i feel pain it seems near the tailbone from there it goes down my left leg to my hamstring.  It hurts to sit for more than 10 minutes at a time, i noticed that it hurts really bad to put my left sock on.  it also hurts to drive.  I am not sure if this is a muscle, nerve tendon, slipped disk or what.  i plan on going to the doctor tomorrow, i am aware that x-rays will probably be needed, but i don't have health insurance for another couple of weeks until my paperwork goes through.  i was just wondering if anybody has any ideas on this. thankyou.\n\n",

When it all started it was falir up then go away for more than a year then it just got worse, causing me to go to the dr's and the only option fo rme was surgery.....  Good Luck..\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I am a stage IV breast cancer survivor for 3 years , stage II for 6 years.  The cancer spread to my bone t-9 and pubic bones.  I had radiation to both and was put on a drug called zoladex.  This drug prevents estrogen from being released by the ovaries.  I'm wondering if the radiation or the zoladex could have caused these problems.  My cancer is stable and in remission.  A MRI showed herniated and bulging disks.  My right leg is weak and my right foot is numb with a constant cold sensation.  It has been this way for about 2 years.  My onc says he doesn't know the cause.  I'm just wondering if there is some correlation between this and my treatments.  I have never had any back problems in the past.  I am 36 years old but feel like I'm 80.  Any words of wisdom??  Thanks, Carrie\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Carrie,  I am sorry to hear about your cancer, but am pleased that the cancer is in remission.  Certainly the weakness and numbness suggest a nerve root compromise.  The disk bulges could be the culprit, but radiation neuritis can also cause this problem very rarely.  It the T9 was treated with radiotherapy, then the neuritis that in some cases develops can cause permanent damage to the cord here. This is an unfortunate side effect, but really the treatment of the tumor has a greater importance here, and is a sacrifice worth making.  If on the other hand, it is related to the disc lesions, then surgical decompression and evaluation needs to be considered.  Some clinical and  neuro-physiological tests may help distinguish between these...  regards  saif\n\n",

If there is nerve compression associated with the herniated disks it may cause numbness in the leg or foot. Your primary care physician can order diagnostic studies, xray, MRI, etc. to evaluate for possible nerve compression and refer you to the appropriate specialist which will probably be an orthopedic physician.

    "content": "Dear Jilly Jack,  The kind of pain that you are describing could be due to a number of causes, although it is difficult to make a diagnosis on-line, let me see if I can help.  It is unusual to fracture a rib during coughing, if you are otherwise healthy (i.e. not suffering from osteoporosis etc)  but I guess it is possible.  Muscular problems are more likely, and as you say can give similar symptoms, and the treatment is pretty much the same as you suggest with ice, pain killers and rest.  Costochondritis again can give similar pains and may be associated with a viral illness.  Another cause of this knid of pain is pain from withing your chest, in the lining of the thoracic cavity, called the pleura.  This can be inflamed, particularly if you had a chest infection (other causes exist).  One way to distinguish this type of pain and the musculoskeletal pains described in the previous paragraph is by local pressure.  If pressing the area where you have the pain on inspiration causes pain then the problem is likely to be musculoskeletal otherwise, the pain is possibly pleuritic. The latter would, i would suggest need a consultation with a physician...  Regards  Saf\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Southern,  Ah yes, I guess your problem is slightly complex, and I am only mildly surprised at your level of symptoms (....sorry abut that  ).  Some features that you describe can cause pain, others are incidental findings, but many are also found in normal individuals without any symptoms.  The mildness or the severity of the disease, sadly doesn't always corrspond to the amount of pain you get.  To complicate things further, the signs on X-ray often reflect a disease that occured in the past and has now resolved.  It is likely that the the scoliosis, and the Sceuerman's diesease actually was at its peak in adolescence, and these findings are just what is left behind.  Certainly Spina Bifida is present from birth.  These features can of course still be responsible for pain now, just as they can be found in patients with no symptoms whatsoever.  I would classify back pain into three overlapping groups...mechanical (because of abnormal distribution of stresses)...e.g. due to scoliosis, or facet joint arthropathy, or instability.  Inflammatory (e.g. due to active Scheuerman's, other arthropathies, \"discogenic\" pains), and radicular (due to nerve root entrapment).  You have reasons for any of these to cause the pain that you are getting.  I guess your specialist will be able to elucidate what is the most likely cause of your symptoms...and the best way to address them...  Hope this is at least slightly helpful  Saif\n\n",

    "title": "spine prob during rehearsal?",
    "content": "Yesterday I went to our high school's dance rehearsal for our upcoming musical. I was tired, but I danced anyway; as I was doing a spin in the air, I think my body spun faster than my head and neck - the next thing I knew, my tongue and eyelids were really heavy, and while I could still keep my eyelids open, I couldn't move my tongue at all. The music seemed to suddenly get really soft and on the back of my neck I sensed pain even though I couldn't really feel it. After what seemed like half a minute, my neck and tongue tingled back to life, but my neck had become stiff. By the time rehearsal was done a few minutes later, the stiffness was gone. I'm not sure why, but I completely forgot about it until the memory of it woke me up this morning. My mom thinks I might've shifted one of my discs and possibly paralyzed myself for a few moments from the neck up. That kinda makes sense, but how much truth is in her explanation? (p.s: I think I explain all this better on my website, on the most recent entry) Thanks in advance!\n\n",

    "content": "G'day Ellie,  A dent in the back eh?  Its difficult to know exatly what the diagnosis is without you being here in fornt of me...but tell me, is this a new dent, or do you think it has been there since birth?  My colleague is absolutely right about the possible need for referral and investigation if needed.  A cuple of diagnoses worth considering, in view of the limited info we have are if you can pardon the rather long words...medics have a habit translating everything into greek.. 1) spina bifida occulta.  this is a problem where the spine has a small defect from birth, sometime associated with a an area of darkened or hairy skin overlying it.  In the majority of situations nothing needs to be done about it. 2) spondylolisthesis.  This is a slip of one vertebra over the other and this can cause a bump here. 3) A defect in the pars interarticularis...(yawwwwn...I can see I have bored you already...sorry)  With these the pains can be due to either instability in the back or due to nerve root entrapment.  Instability is often relative...so that it only appears symptomatic when you do significant amount of exercise in which case as my colleague said ther is nothing for it but to give exercise a bit of a rest.  Or it is absolute...when normal day to day activities cause pain.  Stabilisation surgically is potentially hazardous, but can be considered in these situations.  Nerve entrapment causes pain by trapping nerves and may need surgical decompression.   Other causes exist su=ometimes a hip problem can make the spine curve a bit more, and give the impression of a dent in the back...but then you would possibly have problems in your groin.   Hope this satisfies...but diagnosis over the internet is more or less impossible  Saif\n\n",

The pain is in my lower back and in my lower right side as well. Last time I had pain similar to this was when I had kidney stones. The pain went away soon thereafter, so that is why I don't think it's kidney stones this time. I'm not exactly sure what to do about it, or if I should go see a regular doctor. The pain hits whenever I have been standing for a period of time (even just after taking a shower).  If anyone can help me with this I would greatly appreciate it! Thank you!  Crystal\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Crystal,  Sorry to hear about you pains... You say that you have had renal colic and these pains are similar to that...so this is still a possibility I guess.  Renal colic is gripey (feels like someone squeezing and letting go, coming in waves), often localised to you our loin, and radiating down to the groin.  Sometimes associated with blood in the urine, as the stone is passed  the pain disappears comletely.  A person who has had renal colic once is more likely than the average person to get it again.  The one distinguishing feature between renal colic and low back pain originating from the spine is that renal colic is not relieved or worsened  by posture, but musculato-skeletal is aggravated by movement and relieved by rest.  If it is musculo-skeletal the treatment is usually rest, anti-inflammatories, and gentle exercise.  You say that the pain occurs more frequently if you have been standing, for sometime...and this makes it possible that it is mechanical.  Most are usually self limiting, however if they persist beyond 3 or 4 weeks then formal medical advice should be sought.  Regards  Saif\n\n",

    "content": "Hi moomom,  Hmm, toughiee...At a guess I would say that you have progressive scoliosis, which is a curvature of the spine, possibly brought about by the degenerative arthritis in you back.  This makes you walk tilted, and gives the appearance of one hip being more prominant than the other.  I am not sure what is meant by \" something moving around that should be attached to tailbone\", but again at a guess I would suggest that you may have spondylolisthesis.  This again can be due to degenerative spinal disease.  Essentially on vertebra in your lower back  slides forward on another.  The lowermost luimbar vertebra (L5) sits on top of sacrum(S1).  The sacrum is not technically your tail bone but I guess it is possible that this is what is meant.  Both scoliosis and spondylolisthesis may reflect the instability in your spine.  Both can cause or aggravate sciatica.  Both can be painful by themselves.  While both may be a result of degeneartive disease, other causes need to be evaluated.  Treatment depends on the cause of pain, and various therapeutic options range from physio, corsets, upto surgery.   But as I say this just a guess from your description...I would suggest a visit to your friendly neighbourhood spinal surgeon might be in order  Saif\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Debi,  Sorry about the delay...the day job itself is fairly hectic for me at present. Difficult to say what could be the cause...you seem to have been through most of the investigations necessary.   One can try Occam's razor way of trying to get some clues as to the cause... If it is musculoskeletal then musculo-skeletal activity will worsen pain.  Bending, stretching, will aggravate pain. If it is due to abdominal or pelvic pathology then these movements will not aggravate the pain, but things like associated nausea, bowel disturbance and a colicky nature might indicate a Gastro-Intestinal pathology.  Urinary problems can also cause back pain, colicky pain occurs if the pain is ureteric (a cause of back pain in children is due to narrowing of the ureter in ceratin places).  Non.colicky renal pain can be due to problems within the kidney substance itself, but such things (e.g. pyelonephritis) usually give clues in blood tests.  Neuralgic pain usually follows a pattern that reflects the distribution of a nerve.  If we decide the problem is musculoskeletal, then the next step, if X-rays, MRI etc are all normal, perhaps may be a bone scan may be indicated...this gives a vague idea if we should be focusing on certain areas or not.  It is difficult to advise without your daughter in front of me, but it seems you have already been through a fairly exhaustive battery of tests...  Regards  Saif\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Piet,  No, a nerve can not be cut to relieve you of this pain.  Nor should it, even if it were possible.  The muscles in your back that would also be affected would be greatly weakened and aggravate pain further.   There are lots of reasons for such pain, and is important to rule out the non musculo-skeletal causes of the pain, such as kidney problems (e.g. renal colic), as well as address the back itself.  If you have ruled out all these possibilities, and are keen to adress the symptoms, muscle spasm can be helped by physiotherapy and massage, and TENS machines and acupuncture.  If stress is the cause of the problem, then addessing the stress may be more appropriate!  Saif\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Heather,  Sorry Ii was unable to reply earlier...had some dodgy connection problems. Please see my response to hole-n-one...you seem to have fairly similar problems, although your problem is in the neck and not in the lower back.  the only thing I would say in your case lies not with your disc, but with the muscles and ligaments in your neck and back. The symptoms your describe suggest to me that the problems may be related more to the muscuo-skeletal structures in your neck and upper back rather tha a trapped nerve that might be helped by a neurosurgeon...  If this were the case, then some physio might be more appropriate.  If on the other hand, you are also getting pins and needles, numbness or weakness, or pain in your arms or limbs...then certainly neurosurgical advice may be warranted.  saif\n\n",

Disorders in the lower back may cause pain that radiates down in these areas. If the above mentionen testing was not completed and the pain is still persisting I would suggest that you contact your physician and inform him/her that the pain has not subsided. I hope this is helpful and again I apologize for the delayed reply. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "title": "re-herniated disc - surgery or not?",
    "content": "I am 29 years old and had a laminotomy/micro-discectomy 2 years ago that I thought was a complete success.  My back has felt like I was 16 years old for the past 2 years then all of a sudden the disc reherniated for no reason.  2 docs (neurosurgeon and ortho) recommended I go in for another surgery because the chances of a re-occuring disc herniation going away without surgery are minimal due to the nerve not having much room to move away from the disc due to the scar tissue surrounding it from my 1st surgery.   A couple of chiropractors said walking and adjustments may help break up the scar tissue and give it a few months before going into surgery. Its been 2 months since onset of pain and my symptoms have gotten a little better but still feel pain in leg and lower back.    Question:  Is another laminectomy/micro-discectomy (recommended) the best choice considering what I described above?  I am worried that I will have 2 surgeries under my belt before age 30 although the docs said percentage of reoccurence the 3rd time is less than 5%, but I'v also read that the more surgeries you have the greater the risk of future problems.  Can anyone provide me some insight?  Thanks so much.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for your reply DR. Tamer Fouad.The car accident happened on 5/17 /02, I have been being treated at the pain clinic since 1998 shortly after my first two surgeries.At this time I had a laminectomy,and a week later they went back in and had to repair a spinal fluid leak,and had lots of theripy to follow.My pain increased and so did my medications.In 2000 I had the reconstructive surgery that involved cages screws,and other hardware.Pain increased awhile after this surgery,prior to all this I had many injections ,stymulators none of which helped.After going to the pain clinic and all that they have done there diagnosis was failed back syndrom.I am now in the prosess of getting social security after being denied 2 or 3 times I cant remember.My memory also has gotten bad which drives my wife nuts. Anyway,back to the car accedent.My doctor did faucets to see if this would help with the pain ,at least 50%.And it did so she went to the next phase and burned the nerves that led to the pain from the whiplash.And that hurt like you wouldnt believe.My first pain right after the accedent was mostly on my left and that is what I told my doctor,that the pain was on my left.6 months later I was still having pain in my neck,My question Dr. is even though my pain was mostly all on my left could not this type of injury effect the entire neck right and left side .Any help on this would be greatly appreceated Dr. and I thank you for your time .I hope I gave you enough infomation. Thank you .Mr. Randy Ashland\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Mr. Randy, The accident that happened may or may not have affected your back depending on the site and force of the collision the way in which you fell to the ground and many other factors. The only to tell this would be through the scans which I am sure you have done. If I understood correctly the pain clinic is helping with your back pain. Your last question regarding whether this type of accident should cause the pain to be on the whole neck rather than mainly on the left depends again on the which side was affected more. Which nerves were traumatized during the accident. There are nerves coming out of the neck on either side, generally a whiplash would tend to affect one side more than the other as far as I can tell.  If I have failed to understand your question properly please correct me.  Regards.\n\n",
