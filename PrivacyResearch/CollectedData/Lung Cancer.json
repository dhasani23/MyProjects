    "content": "Hello Doctor,   My friend has been detected with Lung Cancer, Stage 2. She is a non-smoker and is aged 28. She had been to TATA Memorial Centre, Mumbai wherein the doctors have asked her to undergo a lobectomy then have around 30 sessions of chemotherapy.  She is totally against undergoing either of them. I am very concerned about her health due to this. She has now regular vomiting of blood (which i believe is due to the tumor in the lungs damaging the nerves in that area). Sleeplessness is another concern, which has been addressed by the doctors with sleeping pills. She is going through this alone and has not informed any one in her family too. It's lot of suffering that she is going through all alone and i cannot see it happen in front of my eyes doing nothing. Seek your help doc.  I seek any help you could give me to -  A) help her fight the battle (i am there for her supporting at each moment but can there be any medical help which could aid her other than lobectomy/chemo) B) is there any means that i could benefit from to get to know if she is right or wrong in her decision to dealing with this medical condition.   Can a proper diet as well as good rest plan she can prolong her fight. Am i correct. Please advise.  P.S. After a month of coaxing she finally agreed to TMC visit. She says she wants a happy life ahead.  Please let me know in case you need further details.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Stage II Non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) represent patients with T1-2N1 or T3N0 tumors. By definition, patients with tumors invading the chest wall apex, mediastinum, diaphragm, or even the mainstem bronchus may all have T3 tumors.  A general approach to the management of stage 2 NSCLC is as follows. Surgery is the treatment of choice for stage II patients.Stage II patients who are not candidates for surgery may be recommended to undergo radiation with curative intent. Use of chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting of stage 2 NSCLC remains controversial.Gene therapy, although an option, has not been studied extensively in stage 2 patients. Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Therapy is at present investigational and has the potential for use in selected cases(Patients with adenocarcinoma, bronchoalveolar carcinoma, non-smokers and light smokers).  Regarding the specific case of your friend, it is difficult to give a precise opinion, as many details are lacking and precise clinical assessment is not possible.The TNM classification of  NSCLC is also undergoing changes. For example, Tumors > 7 cms will be classified as T2 according to the 6th edition of TNM classification and as T3 by the newer 7th edition. Separate nodule(s) in the primary lobe will be T4 and T3 respectively. Similarly,separate nodule(s) in a different ipsilateral lobe will be M1 and T4 respectively.  'N' descriptors have not been changed. There are some changes in the 'M' descriptors as well. Ref: http://www.doctorslounge.com/index.php/ ... s/page/340  Therefore, it is best for you to discuss her individual case with her surgeon and oncologist so that an individualized treatment plan may be arrived at.In the meanwhile, a balanced diet and refraining from smoking will be beneficial for in terms of outcomes.  Good luck!\n\n",

    "title": "LUNG MASS AT THE RIGHT LOWER LOBE: TB OR CANCER?",
    "content": "Hi,  My father, 62 yrs old, non-smoker, and a retired bank employee, was diagnosed as either having TB or cancer -- his pulmonologist apparently isn't pretty sure.  Back in 2005, he was diagnosed to have Pulmonary TB through X-ray although negative in sputum test. He started taking anti-TB medicines given by the government's department of health but stopped after 3 months because of his severing arthritis which he had already been suffering since 1998 (he had been taking NSAIDs for this).  In March 2010, he was diagnosed to have Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia and was taking Finasteride for 1 month then followed by Terazosin. He was admitted to the hospital by this time, sharing a room with someone who apparently had a pulmonary disease. After being discharged, he began coughing and was losing weight and appetite. He was given Ciprofloxacin but the symptoms never improved. We thought this could just be a side-effect of Terazosin as indicated in the medicine's literature.  In the same month, he was again diagnosed with secondary Pulmonary TB through X-RAY by a radiologist in our community hospital.  To verify if it's really correct, a pulmonologist in a private hospital, again conducted another X-RAY and found a lung mass at the right lower lobe. He suggested a biopsy. This is the CT-scan guided biopsy result:  6/21/2010 Preliminary CT Scan of the right lower lobe density shows a lobulated density (atelectatic) seen in the posterior segment of the right lower lobe encasing the right lower lobe bronchus. No calcification seen. There is also loculated minimal left pleural fluid. With introduction of G20 spinal needle with patient in prone position shows the tip is within the central aspect of the right lower lobe density.  Specimen: FNAB, Lung Microscopic Examination: The smears show numerous red cells, moderate polymorphonuclear and mononuclear leukocytes enmeshed in mucin and a few clusters of benign columnas epithelial cells. There are no definite tumor cells seen. Diagnosis: CYTOLOGY SUGGESTIVE OF INFLAMMATORY PROCESS  Specimen: CELL BLOCK, LUNG MASS Microscopic Examination: shows amorphous eosinophilic materia in which embedded are abundant red blood cells moderate polymorphonuclear leukocytes and few lymphocytes. There are no tumor cells see. Diagnosis: NO TUMOR CELLS SEEN  Given this result, the doctor is still suspicious and is considering Bronchoalveolar Carcinoma. His final diagnosis is: LUNG MASS RIGHT PULMONARY TB versus MALIGNANCY.  Now, he is suggesting open surgery biopsy. This suggestion is really impossible right now since my father is weak due to shortness of breath when doing any activity -- although his breathing is ok when at rest and he can even breathe without oxygen support. Only when coughing hard sometimes that usually appears at night or early in the morning that makes his breathing hard. He also experiences fever at night or early in the morning.  He had been given Cefixime for one week, and his fevers became infrequent and the phlegm became white from yellowish. However, after several days, fevers came back that caused shortness of breath and his phlegm turned yellowish again. Now the doctor has given him Levofloxacin (Levox 750mg tablet) and Sporanox ( Itraconazole) for 7 days. Again, fever was gone and his phlegm was turning into white. But a week after, he had fever again, night sweats, and his phlegm yellowish.  He has been taking anti-TB for one month and a week already and he has somehow felt some improvement in the symptoms -- though he is still having fever and sweating every now and then.  Could this really be TB or Cancer?  Are Levofloxacin and Itraconazole safe to continue despite the fact that he had already taken these more than a week ago? (he stopped taking them last July 21).  Can combination antibiotic therapy help aside from anti-TB?  Any advise or suggestion? What are the necessary steps to take given my father's condition -- this situation is so paradoxical for me since we cannot easily transport my father from the rural province to Manila where the sophisticated medical equipment and service are available -- we don't even have bronchoscopy in our place. So we have to make him, at least, feel better before transporting him -- the reason I'm asking about antibiotic therapy in the hope that this might improve his condition.   Thank you very much in advance.  Sincerely  MARK\n\n",

    "title": "Re: LUNG MASS AT THE RIGHT LOWER LOBE: TB OR CANCER?",
    "content": "Hi, There are several lung pathologies that are very difficult to distinguish on clinical and radiological grounds from lung cancers.Modern imaging also may not be able to sort these out.  The most important clue from the history that you have provided is perhaps the presence of the \"amorphous eosinophilic material\" that was found on CT- guided lung biopsy.Therefore, let us take it from there.  I do not know if special stains were used to identify this material.I will discuss in brief a few important conditions in which this type of material may be seen.  - Nodular Parenchymal Amyloidosis, - Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP),and - pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia.  Amyloidosis: The clinical syndromes pertaining to amyloidosis involving the respiratory tract are  (a) Tracheobronchial amyloidosis - this is usually localised and tend to recur. (b) Diffuse alveolar septal amyloidosis(diffuse parenchymal) - this occurs in systemic amyloidosis or with underlying monoclonal lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma. (c) Nodular Parenchymal - presents as solitary or multiple nodules with a predilection for the lower lung zones, often attaining a size of upto 15 cm. Pulmonary nodular amyoidosis (PNA) may be detected incidentally on imaging, during bronchoscopy or may present with clinical symptoms(progressive dyspnea). These lesions are often called \u2018Amyloidoma\u2019s. They are not associated with systemic amyloidosis.  On light microscopy, amyloid appears as an amorphous, eosinophilic, PAS -ve or scantly positive, extracellular substance. Congo Red stained specimens with the characteristic apple-green birefringence in polarised light are invaluable in the identification of amyloid.   Apart from these forms of pulmonary amyloidosis, localized amyloid deposits have been seen to occur in - Pulmonary marginal zone lymphoma (a type of low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) and - Primary Sjogrens syndrome, which has been reported in association with solitary or multiple pulmonary amyloid nodules.  Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP): Young adults in the third or fourth decade of life are frequently affected. Male to female  ratio is about 3:1. Nearly 70% of affected individuals have a history of cigarette smoking. A significant minority of patients may be immunocompromised. Most common presenting symptoms are dyspnea and dry cough. Low grade fever may also occur, but may indicate the possibility of a superimposed infection. Digital clubbing is seen in about a third of patients. Diagnosis requires demonstration of the distinctive amorphous, granular eosinophilic exudates, very typical of PAP.These granular exudates are PAS-positive and are also immunoreactive for surfactant apoprotein.  Frothy eosinophilic material with \"bubbles\"(foamy) in an inflammatory-to-necrotic background is often seen in Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia.   Tuberculosis can masquerade in numerous ways and can be confirmed only by appearances on biopsy, a positive culture, or using the newer Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) testing.  In your father's case, nodular amyloidosis appears to be a strong contender. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "hi i am a 22 yrs old male and the past few months a have just felt off. i went to the doctor about chest pain and he sumed it up to be anxiety. well recently i have had a sharp pain in my chest when i take a deep breath but it has went away for about 2 weeks now. then i woke up this morning and when i clear my throat there was bright red blood in the spit ( i spit  about 6 times). there is also blood in my nose when i blow it. went to the hospital about a month ago because i thought i was having a heart attack and they took a chest x-ray and ekg ( everything came back fine). went to a cardologist and had a echo test and another ekg (everything seemed fine).sometimes i feel like i cant get a full breath of air but i don't know if this is just because i am worried about something being wrong with me or if their is something wrong. i have not worried so much until i saw the blood in my spit. so do you think i might just have a sinus problem ( i work outside cutting grass) and the chest might just be from the anxiety or do you think i might have a blood clot or something. i also lost about 40 pounds in 6 to 8 weeks for no reason and have elevatued blood pressure ( 140/89)             thank you for your time\n\n",

    "title": "Re: chest pain and blood in spit",
    "content": "Hi, Whenever there is blood in the sputum, the source of the blood has to be investigated.Basically, blood in the sputum can originate in - the respiratory passages or the lungs, - the pharyngeal region (oro, naso or the laryngopharynx) or - the nasal cavity/paranasal sinuses.  In your case, you had definitely noted blood while blowing your nose.This very much lends support to a diagnosis of epistaxis as the underlying cause of the blood noted in your sputum.This may happen even with trivial trauma such as caused during nose-picking.Although sinusitis is one other possibility, in your case it seems less likely.  For a start, you should be examined by an ENT specialist. If nothing turns up, then, based on the clinical findings, further investigations such as a a sputum smear, sputum culture,coagulation profile,chest X-ray and CT chest scan may be needed. Good day!\n\n",

Her PET scan results today to check for a reoccurence of the lung cancer revealed that her mediastinal lymph nodes were enlarged 3.0 cm,but her doctor and the person that read the scan do NOT think that it is cancer, they think it is due to recovering from the surgery. I cannot locate any info online that tells me that enlarged lymph nodes can be from postop, most seem to be due to an infection of reoccurence of the cancer.

    "title": "Re: Enlarged lymph nodes postop pnemonectomy ??",
    "content": "Hi, Let me try and explain to you the intricacies involed in the elucidation of a lesion that appears on a PET scan following treatment(primary/adjuvant) of lung cancer.  On imaging, It is important to be aware of normal, benign findings that occur after surgery and/or radiation therapy, and to distinguish such findings from those which may indicate a recurrent tumor.   Following pneumonectomy, the ipsilateral hemithorax normally fills with fluid which gets organized , appearing as low attenuation material on CT imaging.  The presence of a mass within the low attenuation material  suggests  local tumor recurrence.   Post-radiation pulmonary necrosis is an uncommon,but severe complication of adjuvant post-operative radiation therapy. It manifests as cavitation within a fibrotic space (usually in the  apex of the lung ) and occurs 1\u20137 years following treatment of the primary. Such an appearance may simulate recurrent tumor. The diagnosis is generally by exclusion, usually made after a negative biopsy of the lesion and/or stability on follow-up imaging.   FDG-PET imaging has a role in distinguishing persistent or recurrent tumor from post-treatment scarring or fibrosis. It is more sensitive than CT of the chest in detecting recurrent tumor (sensitivity of 95\u2013100%). However, it has a specificity of 60\u2013100%, sometimes yielding false-positive results due to  active inflammation, particularly in the acute post-operative or post-radiation phase.   Therefore, FDG-PET scanning should be obtained no earlier than 4\u20135 months following radiation therapy.  I have to apologise for being too technical, but,it hopefully gives you an idea how difficult these diagnoses may be!.  Most experts in this field would perhaps tend to base their final diagnosis (on a finding discovered on imaging) by performing a biopsy. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for your response. For follow up..she never took chemo or radiation therapy, just the pnemonectomy . The CAT scan that she had done in July, and most recently a few weeks ago (Dec.) showed that while the mediastinal lymph nodes are still slightly swollen, they have not changed in  appearance nor grown in size since July. Also, these did not \"light up\" on her PET scan. Would this lead one to believe that these are not cancerous, given these facts?  Please advise, Lindsey\n\n",

My father, almost 60 now, has been a smoker for most of his life. He probably has 6 - 8 a day. Some days more, some less.  Recently, he's been complaining of sudden chest pains. Like a tightening or constricting pain. He says it hinders his breathing for a few minutes. Also, the pain extends to his upper back. Before, this pain would occur for a couple of minutes. A few hours ago, it lasted at least 15 minutes. In addition, he'll have small fits of coughing throughout the day.   I figure it's either his lungs or maybe a problem with his heart, considering the chest pains. But, of course, I don't really know. Any help would be incredibly appreciated. Thank you.\n\n",

This should help determine the cause.   Smokers usually have what is known as a smoker's cough. Any change in the character, timing of the cough is significant and should prompt for an evaluation. If this pain is exertional (related to effort) then it could suggest a heart origin albeit with an atypical presentation (again smoking puts him at risk).   Please have him undergo a checkup ASAP!

    "content": "Hello,  There are many causes of chest pain which are differentiated according to the character of the presenting complaints as well as the risk factors. The fact that you are young and a female in addition to character of your symptoms makes heart disease less likely.  The fact that you smoke (as stated in your social history) does raise your risk of certain diseases including cardiovascular disease and cancer. Again, if there are no associated symptoms such as cough, blood in sputum, shortness of breath then these possibilities are unlikely.  Pleurisy, and musculoskeletal disorders (inflammation of the muscles / bones of the chest wall) cause a chest pain that can increase on deep breathing. Musculoskeletal causes of chest pain may also be associated with tenderness in the chest area.  Another possibility is post-herpes zoster infection which causes pain on one side of the body occupying a characteristic dermatome and should be accompanied by the characteristic skin manifestations of herpes zoster.  Other less likely causes include GI causes, neck problems with referred pain, to name a couple.   Is the pain relieved with OCT analgesics? As always, you are recommended to seek direct medical attention and evaluation.  Best regards,\n\n",

This is not the first time she has had NSCLC  all most 2 years ago they found that she had a 2cm mass in her right lung and in a cupple limpnods she went trough 8 month of chemo and it was gone they seen this by a pet test.About 2 months after that they done a ct to make sure it was still gone they found a very very small spot and the Dr said he thought the cancer had came back but the Dr said we will wait a few months to check it agian.I thought this was not the right way to do things I think that if the Dr. had started the chemo then that my mom cancer would not be this bad.I asked her over and over to get a second opion but she would not do this because she is afriad her Dr. will not see he no more.The first time they done a bisopy to make for sure it was cancer this time they did not do one should they always do one to make for sure that it is cancer?This is my moms life on the line I fill that she needs a second opion do you think that a cancer patient's should have another look at this?Should it been treated as soon as they seen that small spot?I think it should have been treated right then and not give it time to grow,but I no Dr. Could you please help me this is so hard to go trough my mom is my best friend I am only 25 years old don't want to let her go!!!!!

    "content": "Hi, I'm not a doctor or nurse but I lost my mom to Stage IV lung cancer this summer, she was only 55 years old. I know how you feel, my mom was my best friend too and it was horrible seeing her go through this evil disease.  I would always, always recommend getting a second opinion. It can't hurt, and her doctor will not refuse to see her anymore if she gets another opinion. Do some research in your area and find an oncologist who sub-specializes in lung cancer, and see what he says. In my mom's case, the second opinion doctor agreed with what her primary oncologist was doing, but it was still peace of mind to hear it from another source.  Another piece of advice - don't spend too much time wondering if something should have been done that wasn't. It's too late to go back and change it now, and wasting energy on that won't help. I spent a huge chunk of my mom's 8-month battle with cancer angry that her primary doctor didn't give her a lung x-ray/CT earlier (she asked for it 2 years before diagnosis and her doctor told her she had anxiety and referred her to a psychiatrist), and it wasn't worth the energy I put into it.  Re: adenocarcinoma - there are two main types of non-small-cell lung cancer, squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. It basically just refers to the types of cells that make up the tumor.  My mom started with Taxol and then moved on to Gemzar/Gemcitibine, and eventually Navelbine. None of these really worked on her cancer. She wasn't able to try Avastin because of the type of cancer she had, but perhaps it will work for your mom! She also used Erbitux, which is a growth inhibitor. Is radiation an option? That might be something to look into. As far as I know, Stage III means the cancer has spread to some lymph nodes but not any other organs in the body.  Again, if you feel unsure about the care she is getting, I recommend getting a second opinion. I know how scary it is and I hope she will be successful fighting this disease!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Lung Health After Quitting Smoking",
    "content": "Hello,  A meaningful risk assessment is impossible without an extensive medical examination and 'exposure' history.  Smoking is the single most important risk factor in lung cancer accounting for 80-90% of all cases of lung cancer.   Chronic heavy smokers have a 30 fold increase in relative risk compared to never smokers. Heavy smoking is usually defined as more than 10-15 cigarettes a day.  This risk varies according to the age at onset of smoking, degree of inhalation, life time duration of smoking, use of filter and the tar/nicotine content of cigarettes.   Other factors such as occupational asbestos exposure also affect risk. I say this only to stress that there may be many other risks that we still don't know about.   The good news is that abstinence, even smoking reduction results in a decreasing risk. Abstainers had an 80 to 90 % reduction in risk of lung cancer compared to current smokers. However, lung cancer risk remains higher than in the never smoker (twice).  I hope this helps answer your question.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "title": "MULTIPLE TINY PULMONARY NODULES: CT ARTIFACTS? PLEASE ADVISE",
    "content": "I am a 47 year old female with good general health and fitness levels.  Last October I had a CT scan for ongoing swallowing problems, which found a 'large substernal mass' which was subsequently removed.  It was ectopic thyroid tissue and there was no cancer.  I then had a neck lymph node biopsy, again no cancer.  The CT scan also found a small mass in my uterus which, from U/S follow-up, my OB/GYN believes is a fibroid.  So far, so good!    My question concerns another incidental finding from the CT scan...  'On lung windows in the right hemithorax there are multiple non-calcified tiny pulmonary nodules (it then lists 5 image numbers) to 3mm.  Recommend close CT follow-up in three months to ensure decrease in size or resolution'.  From researching this I understand these are extremely small and typically folllowed-up with regular CT scans to monitor size etc.  I used to smoke cigarettes - a pack/day for 18 years - but gave up in 1997.  I have had bronchitis twice (in 1997 and 2005) and used to have exercise-induced asthma occasionally (I am a recreational runner).  My father had fatal esophagal cancer (with matastases but unsure where located) and my mother had cervical cancer.  I discussed this report with my thoracic surgeon (who operated as above) and he seems pretty confident that I may not even have any lung nodules!  He suggests it is some kind of effect from how the CT images are taken or 'sliced' (he used another term).  He says I should wait 5/6 months for my first repeat CT scan. My specific questions are:-  - Any ideas re what he may mean re the slicing or endings of the images? - How concerned should I be? - What follow-up do you recommend? - Has anyone reading this actually had lung cancer develop from 'multiple non-calcified tiny pulmonary nodules' such as this?  I would appreciate any help/experience because I am concerned and surprised by my doctor's laid-back recommendation.    Many thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  New CT techniques (eg, Helical CT) use computer aided techniques and may also compress the image (similar to what happens with a computer image). This and many other things can lead to artifacts. A CT scan as you know takes serial x-ray 'slices' in the area being scanned.  Certain characteristics can help in determining the nature of a nodule. The small size of the nodules of course favors a benign nature. The multiplicity of the nodules and their location can help also. Lung cancer usually presents with a dominant mass. Lung metastasis usually presents with multiple nodules of variable size that are located at the periphery of the lung field.  I really don't think you have reason to worry since you do not have any other symptoms. I understand your concern but I think active surveillance is the right approach. During the 6 month period should you feel any complaints you should report them immediately to your doctor.   Best of luck!\n\n",

However, if you are anxious about ]your CT that alone may be a good enough reason to conduct a follow up sooner. Usually when I am faced with a patient is anxious I tend to compromise and do the CT sooner than later ie, for example at 4 months.   Again, I haven't seen the CT. Sometimes, it's so obvious that there is no reason for concern.   I think you should discuss your concerns again with your doctor. I think your concerns are legitimate.

However, main artifacts are streak artifacts causing linear rays, and rings which are like target rings from a blown detector. Then there is motion artifact, again not likely to cause the appearance of nodules. Volume averaging is another phenomenon but that is not an artifact and usually results in missing 3 mm nodules when the slice thickness is 5mm for example.  Small nodules like that can be granulomas, related to sarcoidosis, mets, miliary TB or a whole host of things. Nodular interstitial disaeses are also included.  Hope this helps!

It may be that the 'artifacts in your scan are not exactly 'nodules'. As you can see it's very confusing.  You need to discuss this again with your doctor and if needed seek a second opinion.

    "content": "Hi,  Nomad, I'm glad you posted this thread because I had a similar question.   I recently had my second CT scan due to an ascending aortic aneurysm.  New in this year's report was the appearance of \"3 tiny less than 5mm noncalcified pulmonary nodules.\" They are in the apical segment of the right upper lobe, the anterior segment of the right upper lobe, and \"what is probably\" the left lower lobe.   So I got concerned until I read the bottom of the report, which says that they are of \"doubtful significance.\"  I won't have another CT until next year but frankly, I wish they'd check these again before then.    However, Dr. Fouad made me feel better when he said the fact that they are small favors a benign nature.    I have a question for the doctor, though.  Both my father and grandfather (who were smokers) died from lung cancer.  I have never smoked due to heart problems but was around second hand smoke while growing up.  What are the chances that a non-smoker can get lung cancer?  Is it fairly rare?  Thanks in advance for any information and good luck, Nomad.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Good question regarding second hand smoke while growing up.   There is a point I would like to make before I forget, there is a familial risk especially with first degree relatives who are diagnosed at a younger age.  Regarding your question it is hard to determine the individuals risk of developing lung cancer from second hand smoke. There is a dose response relationship and estimating the amount of exposure is obviously difficult to determine.   That said, several studies give us a general idea about risk in the case of second hand smoke (also known as environmental tobacco smoke).  Environmental tobacco smoke is estimated to be the cause of 2% of all lung cancers.  According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), approximately 3,000 nonsmoking adults die from lung cancer each year because of breathing the smoke of others' cigarettes.  Analysis shows that sidestream smoke emitted from a smoldering cigarette between puffs contains virtually all the carcinogenic compounds that have been identified in the mainstream smoke that is inhaled by smokers. Beside nicotine, side stream smoke contains one of the highest environmental exposures of benzene (a risk for leukemia).  The risk of lung cancer is doubled after exposure to household smoke for over 25 smoker years. The risk of mortality from lung cancer was 30 fold higher in one report for a nonsmoker living with a smoker compared to a nonsmoker living with a nonsmoker. Whereas, less than 25 years of exposure was not associated with an increased risk. This may answer your question. In addition to that lung cancer that occurs in nonsmokers has been attributed to childhood exposure to second hand smoke in 17% of these cases.  The risk may also be influenced by genetics. Risk increases in those with polymorphisms of GSTM1 gene (which detoxifies carcinogens in tobacco).  Lots of numbers but I hope this gives you a general picture of the complexities of estimating risk.  Best regards,\n\n",

On the other hand, my father was 53 when he passed, which is a fairly young age.   I do have a couple of other questions, if you don't mind.     Last year's CT scan did not show the nodules but did show  \"califications within the lung and spleen consistent with old granulomatous disease.\"   Is there any kind of a relationship between these nodules and granulomatous disease noted last year?   Also, prior to my scan I had either a cold or sinus infection that caused me to do a lot of coughing.  This may sound stupid, but could this have caused the nodules?   Thanks in advance for any information.   Cheers!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  It can be very misleading to give an opinion about a CT that I haven't actually seen. So please be cautioned about taking anything I say except in the most general sense.  Calcifications are unlikely to be confused with nodules unless these calcifications appear within nodules. That said there should be some mention of the calcifications in the new CT.  Its the questions that our guests call 'stupid' that are usually the most scientifically challenging! :)  But to answer again in the most general terms, coughing can lead to congestion which would cause an increase in vascular markings. Sometimes, vascular markings when viewed head on can mimic a nodule. However, my opinion is no this is usually something a radiologist would keep in mind.   Good luck to you!\n\n",

    "title": "Stage IA Lung cancer - alternative treatments",
    "content": "Hello,  My 68 yr old father recently had a CT scan where 3 nodes in his lungs were detected. Based on the results (shown below), the oncologist is suggesting for him to have his chemotherapy port reimplanted for treatment. No biopsies have or will be taken due to the size of the masses (to small to biopsy according to doctor).   I have a few questions:  1. Please correct me if I am wrong, but based on the results, this is stage 1A. At such an early stage, where it has not yet affected the lymph nodes, is it reasonable to administer chemotherapy? Aren't there more efficient ways (i.e. RF ablation, cyberknife, etc.) to destroy these cells?  2. Is chemotherapy unavoidable in this situation? I don't know too much about cancer, but if the cancer has not spread into the lymph nodes, why use a systemic form of treatment like chemotherapy when we can go with a localized approach like RF ablation? Is it because such alternative treatments are too risky? I understand chemotherapy is used as a preventative measure, but is it really worth it in terms of the damage endured by other systems in the body?  3. How quickly should his CEA levels drop in order to determine that treatment has been effective? Is this a treatment-dependent response?   Here are the results:  \"HISTORY   COLON CANCER   Comparison is made to the prior CT of 08/24/2007  There is interval worsening with the appearance of three separate pulmonary nodules. The largest is in the left upper lobe measuring 1.4 x 1.3 cm. The next largest is also within the left upper lobe posterior segment. This measures 1.1 x 1.1 cm. The smallest is within the right middle lobe measuring 1.0 x .8 cm. There is no consolidation. No bronchiectasis. No pleural effusion no pericardial effusion. There is no mediastinal or hilar lymphoadenopathy. There are no lytic or sclerotic bony lesions.   IMPRESSION:  Interval development of three separate metastatic nodules as described in the involving the left upper lobe and right middle.\"  Your help will be greatly appreciated! Thank you so much in advance!  Thank you, regalado106\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I am sorry to hear about your father. After reading your post, I think it would be wrong to assume that this is lung cancer. Rather this is colon cancer that has returned and spread to his lungs. As such, the good news is that his doctor thinks that his condition is good enough to warrant chemotherapy.   Usually chemotherapy is used when any cancer has spread (metastasized) since the only way that it would have reached the lungs is by spreading through the blood. Hence, it makes sense to give treatment in the form of chemotherapy that ultimately reaches the blood.  Again, depending on an elderly patient's condition several chemotherapy options are available depending on how fit he is and what therapy he has previously received.   FOLFOX or a similar regimen FOLFIRI are the usual options for fit elderly patients. Infusional 5FU/LV is another option. Capecitabine (Xeloda) oral capsules are another valid option for those less likely to tolerate combination chemotherapy. Many avoid bevacizumab (Avastin) in elderly.   Several other options are available for second line chemotherapy which include cetuximab (Erbitux) and panintumumab (Vectibix).  Best regards,\n\n",

(Unlikely things do happen, though, so it is certainly worth thinking about.)  I think there are a few different things that are much more likely.  You may be having a severe asthma attack or a lung infection such as a pneumonia.  I would recommend you have some testing done, including a chest x-ray and a CBC.  These would be a good place to start.  You may also want to consider having a ppd placed to test for tuberculosis.  Follow up with a doctor is very important.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Please note that depending on your smoking history, smokers remain at risk even after abstinence. They are twice at risk than never smokers after 15 years of abstinence.   Please keep us updated.

    "content": "Hi,  It would be difficult to tell without seeing the density first hand. There are certain criteria within the density that favor benign and others that favor a malignant pathology. So I will just have to do with the information you have provided.  Certain types of lung cancer can occur in the periphery. In addition, lung cancer is a type of cancer that can carry a familial risk especially in first degree relatives and more so when it occurs at a younger age.  The fact that you are a nonsmoker reduces the risk significantly.  As regards size, 1.2 cm favors a benign rather than a malignant condition. Of course all other criteria should be available to make a better assessment.  A history of benign lung conditions / lesions especially COPD carries a risk.  I hope that helps. Please keep this thread updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Von Hippel-Lindau is a rare genetic disorder which is characterized by the occurrence of hemangioblastomas which are tumors of the vascular system as you mentioned. These vascular tumors occur mainly in the CNS especially the cerebellum, spinal cord and retina (which is considered part of the CNS).  I think it is unlikely that your mother's tumor is a manfestation of Von Hippel-Lindau. First of all an angioma (vascular tumor) would appear quite clearly on CT scan. Certain criteria of solid nodules may suggest malignancy. These include size (>2cm are more likely to be malignant). Border of the nodule is speculated. The location of the tumor can help. The density of the tumor on CT. The doubling time which is the time it takes for a nodule to double in volume, so this is where the comparison between the old and new CTs comes in.  Another important point is that a PET scan is a highly sensitive test and can strongly suggest a cancer versus an inflammation. A PET scan would not be positive in the case of an angioma.   Given her age and her investigation results which I am sure her doctor must have gone through, she is lucky to be at an early stage where surgery is an option.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "title": "8 cm spot on lung scans, but nobody knows what it is",
    "content": "Hello,  My husband, 51, non-smoker, had pneumonia a few weeks ago. However, on the X-ray an 8-cm diameter spot of unknown origin was also found. It showed up later on another X-ray as well as on a CT scan. A PET scan showed only mild uptake and today the doctor said cancer would be very unlikely (my husband feels well and is recovering well from the pneumonia). However, the doctor still wants to do a lung biopsy (bronchoscopy), even though he suspects the problem might be with the heart. What could this spot be, what should we expect? Is it part of an existing organ (lung, heart), or a growth - the doctor could not answer, but should the CT scan not provide the answer? If it is a growth and it is benign would surgery solve the problem? Are we looking at surgery at all? Thank you very much in advance. I simply cannot understand why after all these scans we cannot even be told whether this is a lesion or a tumor, whether it's on the lung, heart, or something else...\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there, It would be impossible for me to give you a definitive answer of course. However, are you sure it's 8 cm? not 8 mm? You seem to be describing a spot - 8 cm would be quite a large mass.  Apparently this spot is located central in the scans - a CT should be able to suggest what the origin is. If it is a mass certain criteria may help to differentiate malignant from benign but if its a small spot this would be rather difficult.  A bronchospy may be the only way to tell whether it is benign or malignant. However, the mild uptake on PET is comforting as this may be a residual effect of pneumonia.  Lesions that are larger than 3cm are mostly malignant. Lesions smaller than 2cm are more commonly benign. Border spiculation (jagged edges) suggests malignancy as opposed to rounded borders which suggests benign lesions.  Calcification generally suggests a benign lesion but eccentric calcification may suggest a carcinoma.   Lesions that are malignant tend to have a volume doubling time (growth to double volume) between 20 and 400 days, where volume doubling of a nodule corresponds to a 30 percent increase in its diameter. Increased density argues against malignancy. I hope this helps!  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Thank you very much for taking the time to reply, it is greatly appreciated. It is indeed an 8 cm diameter \"mass\", the word \"spot\" was not the best. In the meantime, the doctor changed his mind about doing the bronchoscopy. My husband is scheduled for a sonocardiogram and also an MRI this week, instead. The doctor, a pulmonologist, said that the \"mass\" has a round, smooth appearance, which would be good (non-cancerous), but we are looking forward to obtaining more information as to what this mass really is and where exactly it is. The doctor mentioned the possibility of it being a blood \"bubble\" - but considering the size would my husband's life not be hanging from a thin hair right now? Also, no doubt all these tests are needed, but it is all taking too long. We are very scared, to say the least...  Best wishes and, again, thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Sorry for the delay in replying. Pneumonia do not usually present with a solitary lung mass. It is also unusual to occur in young healthy adult with no underlying cause. It is a serious infection that usually mandates hospitalization and IV antibiotic. Only mild to moderate form of infections can be treated outpatient with adeqaute oral antibiotic therapy.  Stopping medication early or inadequate antibiotic course may cause recurrence of pneumonia as well as complications like lung abscess.   From the brief history you have mentioned, I understood that she has been diagnosed with (pneumonia) for some time that was not resolved on antibiotics then the presence of a persistent mass was discovered while being on antibiotic treatment for pneumonia. I assume also that sputum culture and sensitivity was done and antibiotics are chosen based on the results.  In patients with no history, symptoms, or clinical signs suggestive of malignancy, many physicians would start with a course of antibiotic therapy and follow up their patients with both clinical examination and radiological assessment. If their symptoms improve with radiological evidence of the resolution of the lung lesion(s), patients continue their treatment and are followed up till complete recovery of both the symptoms and the radiologic findings.  If symptoms or radiologic findings proves persistent or recurrent disease, more investigations are needed like bronchoscope and biopsy.  So, patients with unusual presentations should be excluded for atypical forms on pneumonias, TB, as well as tumours.   Carcinoids tumors are typically an indolent type of neuroendocrine tumours. They develop within the large airways and can cause bronchial obstruction. This would result in atelectasis, recurrent pneumonia, or pulmonary abscess. Radionuclide studies specific for this type of tumours (using somatostatin analogues) are used to diagnose and stage the disease.  These tumours also may secrete neuroendocrine substances in the blood, although uncommon. Patients should be tested and looked for these substances like 5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), ACTH, growth hormone (GH), and other hormones, especially if their symptoms are suggestive.  Symptoms of one of the following makes carcinoid tumour more suspicious like  cough, wheezing, blood-tinged sputum, pneumonia that is resistant to antibiotics, recent weight gain, facial flushing or diarrhea.  Physicians can make the diagnosis based on both the bronchoscopy and the radiologic findings.  The primary treatment is surgical resection and is the only curative approach in non metastatic patients.  It is essential to follow up with her doctors to complete her investigations for proper diagnosis and treatment.  Hope you find this information useful. Best regards.\n\n",

Radiological investigations and complete work up are essential to exclude bone metastases and disease relapse. Investigations include Bone scan and CT Scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis. PSA level should be also evaluated.  Management will be taken based on the previous therapy given and his disease status including the presence of medical comorbidity (e.g. cardiac, renal, hepatic function).  Other causes like primary bone or soft tissue mass is evaluated according to radiological results and the result of any taken biopsy.  I advise you to follow up with his doctor.

I am now having pains (feels like a strain) in my right shoulder blade and sometimes under my right arm only when I cough. I do not cough during the day. Could I have strained or pulled something from coughing? Could it be lung cancer and they did not see it on the xray? I do not have any other symptoms. No chest pains or arm pains. No bloody mucus. Lastly, should I go have another xray done?  Thank you again!!!!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I am pretty sure that your doctor was thinking of excluding something as evil as lung cancer when he ordered the chest x-ray.   Lung cancer which usually appears in the elderly (median age 70 years) is primarily a disease related to smoking. The amount per day as well as the duration in years, the age at which you started smoking are all very significant risk factors.   You mention in your profile - that your aunt and uncle had lung cancer. A familial risk has been reported but is usually seen with first degree relatives and especially when family members were diagnosed with lung cancer at a young age.  Symptoms of lung cancer are notoriously nonspecific, especially when smoking causes much of the same symptoms.  Your symptoms do match the diagnosis of bronchitis, muscle strain (from coughing), pleurisy (from the infection) can all cause the pain you describe.  I think since you are worried, its a good chance to preach you a bit about quitting smoking! :) Lung cancer is a preventable disease. It's currently the commonest cause of cancer related deaths and it's considered a very common disease. So the idea that 'it doesn't happen to me' is completely unjustified. 90% of all lung cancers are caused by smoking cigarettes. Historically speaking, in the early 1900's an epidemiological study of cancer in the US reported that \"the study concludes that lung cancer is a very rare disease not accounting for more than 1% of all cancers\". That was before the cigarette industry! Tobacco has been around for a long time but cigarettes have only become part of popular culture since it was publicized during World War I!  Good luck to you - just follow up with your doctor and STOP SMOKING PLEASE! :)\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Here is some information from an important study on smoking cessation reported in the American Journal of Public Health:  \"Men who smoked at age 35 years and continued to do so had a life expectancy of 69.3 years, compared with an expectancy of 76.2 years for those who stopped smoking at age 35 years, an increase of 6.9 years (Table 5 [triangle]). After adjustment for the subsequent quit rate among current smokers at baseline, the life extension from cessation at age 35 increased to 8.5 years.\"  To sum it up: \"...cessation at any age yields substantial increases in life expectancy.\"  These findings reinforce the urgency of emphasizing smoking cessation to all smokers, irrespective of age, and the importance of never assuming that a smoker is \u201ctoo far gone.\u201d  There are important factors we don't even understand when it comes to effects of smoking and/or second-hand smoke on health.  It is believed that we all have certain genetic tendencies that appear to make us susceptible to certain cancers.  Some people without that predisposition will avoid that cancer even when exposed while others will get it with very little exposure.  At this time we do not know who is susceptible and who is not.  We do know the many health risks involved with smoke and smokeless tobacco - even beyond cancer.  So, the best thing is to avoid it now that we know it is harmful.  You can't change the past but you can affect the future by quitting now.  There's nothing to lose and everything to gain.  Check with the organizations that help people quit.  There are programs that can help through public health departments, the American Cancer Society, and your doctor who can prescribe medications.  It is definitely worth it - do not continue this health-damaging habit because maybe there has already been damage done.   Many of the symptoms you experience now will likely be reduced or eliminated.    Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "My 61 yo mom had a chest xray last week due to a cough and trouble breathing for 2 weeks (non smoker). After the breathing trouble she did develop a high fever for about 4 days then went on zithromax and that fever went away.Xray showed mass on left lung. Then she had a ct scan yesterday .Her results state abnormal ct scan. Mass left lun 4\"x4\"x2\" and multiple metasizes in right lung of various size. Nodule on chest. 12mm nodule in left breast.Swollen lymph nodes.No lesions liver or spleen. Normal cea bloodwork. Her doctor said possibilities are TB . Or llung,breast,or lymphoma cancers.We are confused on the TB .He is not suggesting testing her for TB. I have 3 small kids she has been around and am now concerned if that is a real possibility.Can that prsent on ct like this? She gets a biopsy Monday.  I read these results to mean a stage III or IV cancer.Can you interpret what these results would mean to you? thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi beachfamily5,  The bacterium that causes tuberculosis is Mycobacterium tuberculosis, an infection that primarily affects the lungs. TB specifically refers only to disease caused by M. tuberculosis, but other mycobacteria occasionally infect humans, like M. avium and M. intracellulare causing the Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) disease.  Pulmonary TB may exhibit a variety of radiological features and may imitate other lung diseases, including cancer. Cough, fever and shortness of breath are common symptoms of active pulmonary TB, but high fever is not usual; typically there is a slight fever accompanied by night sweats and chills. Additionally, the fact that fever went away after a short course of azithromycin only is not consistent with TB. Standard therapies commonly used for bacterial infections, like azithromycin (Zithromax) do not work in tuberculosis, although azithromycin have been found to be effective against MAC disease when used in combination with other drugs, but after months of treatment.  Concerning the diagnostic options, the chest CT shows a mass in the left lung, and multiple nodules in the right lung for which the radiologist precisely uses the term metastases to describe them in the report. Also, a 12 mm nodule was found in the left breast. Thus, I consider that TB is not the first diagnostic possibility, neither lymphoma. Unfortunately, the outcome and the radiological findings you have described are more consistent with a cancerous disease, lung cancer more likely. Except for size, I do not have the attributes of the breast nodule, but if distinct clinical or radiological characteristics of benignity are absent, breast cancer with pulmonary metastases may well be an option. But as I said before, TB may mimic other diseases.  On your question about my interpretation of the results, it could be either stage IV lung or breast cancer. I truly hope to be wrong.\n\n",

Deep breathing causes the inflamed lining to move against the other lining producing pain.  The pain can be quite intense.  It is typically treated with anti-inflammatory medications.  I would recommend you discuss this with your doctor to get a full evaluation and look for any other possible causes.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "My ribs are hurting - is it lung cancer? costochondritis?",
    "content": "First, thank you so much in advance for your time in answering my questions.  I am a 39 year old female, former 20 year, pack a day smoker. I quit in the middle of January of this year. I have been extremely healthy my whole life. I rarely get a cold.  Anyway, the end of January my ribs started hurting. The right side, front, side and back. For the most part the pain moved around. Went to my doctor. He took x-rays(which were clear) and diagnosed me with Cosochondritis.  A few weeks later I still had the pain so I decided to see my Orhopedic Doctor(I have arthritis in my lower spine). He took an x-ray(which was clear) and also said I had Costochondritis. Prescribed steroids which actually cleared it up for a few weeks.  Two weeks ago I started having severe middle of the chest pains plus burning in the chest and upper back. Went to my doctor and he said I had GERD. I also have a hiatal hernia which was diagnosed by a barium x-ray 10 years ago. He took a chest x-ray(which was still clear) and did an EKG. He gave me Nexium and told me what foods to stay away from.   For the most part the burning and chest pains have gone away. Occasionally I still have it happen. But my ribs still hurt, mainly on the side and back, sometimes in the front. The pain is not  constant but it is daily. Also, this past week I have developed pain behind my right shoulder blade. It also is not constant but it is daily. At times, movement makes it worse. Sometimes the shoulder blade pain is stabbing and severe. The rib pain is also stabbing and severe at times.  My question is, could I still have lung cancer with three clear chest x-rays in 4 months? Is all of this really caused by GERD and Costochondritis? I am so scared. I cry everyday thinking I am dying. My husband started a new job so we will not have insurance again for 90 days. I can't go all that time without another opinion.   I am sorry for the long post and again I am extremely grateful for your services.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi auburntigergirl,  First of all congratulations for quitting smoking.  I will answer your second question first. You were diagnosed with a hiatal hernia, a very common cause of GERD; both conditions can explain all your symptoms, particularly the burning sensation in your chest. Besides, the back pain, the stabbing sensation behind your shoulder blade, and the fact that movement makes it worse, is very consistent with your diagnosis of spinal osteoarthritis.  Also, in healthy people, chest pain frequently is caused by musculoskeletal problems of the chest wall (ribs, breastbone, articulations, and muscles). The most common cause of chest pain originating in the chest wall is costochondritis, which is consistent with the symptoms you described too.  Sometimes, the symptoms of the conditions described above may overlap. Is all of this really caused by GERD and Costochondritis? Due to the nature of the pain and your previous diagnoses, the answer is yes.  About your first question on the possibility that lung cancer could be missed by chest x-rays (CXRs), the simple answer is yes. CXRs detect lung tumors when they reach 1 cm in size. Also, small nodules may overlap with ribs, clavicles, the spine, and the heart silhouette, making detection very hard. There is a 30% of lung nodules not recognized by radiologists in CXRs. At present, low dose computerized tomography (LDCT) is the method of choice for lung cancer screening (for tumor detection), and high resolution CT (HRCT) is superior differentiating between benign and malignant lung tumors. Anyhow, a lung tumor that generates the kind of pain you describe must be seen on the CXRs.  If the pain gets worse or is accompanied by other symptoms, you should call your doctor.\n\n",

    "title": "Brake shoes & asbestos",
    "content": "I am a 25 year old male, and for the last year I have been having chest pains. It's on the daily basis and the pain varies on where it hits. I have never been good at describing pain, such as sharp, dull etc.., but I do believe it is getting a bit worse.  To give some background. I have ate poorly for most of my life, so when I had the pain I checked the dcotor for heart problems. I have had a blood test done, urine test, that echo test(they send sound or something through your chest) and I have had x-rays. So far the only thing we've found out is that I have a low iron level, so I am still going for more tests.  However, there is another piece of the puzzle that I should mention. For four years, I was working with brake shoes, and I was told that they don't use asbestos, nowadays. But I am not a 100% trusting of the source of this info, and I don't know how old those brake shoes are. I did wear a mask sometimes, but othertimes they didn't have them. I did some research and went back to the doctor to book a lung test. He told me that it won't show up until at least 20 years. But I forgot to ask him some questions, so I was wondering if you could give me some information before my next appointment.  Is there something I can do to find out what's causing my pain? Or at least narrow down the possibilities. Can asbestos affect me after four years if I had a lot of exposure to it? In layman's terms, what else could be causing this? thx for any help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi dranderhilt81,  Sorry for not answering earlier. Chest pain has many causes, of cardiac and non-cardiac origin. In young adults, without previous cardiac illness, pain is usually related to musculoskeletal problems (chest wall origin), gastrointestinal diseases (acid reflux), and anxiety (or depression). Chest pain originating in the chest wall (ribs, sternum, articulations, and muscles) is frequent among young adults, and costochondritis, an inflammation of the cartilage that connects a rib to the breastbone, is the most common cause. Acute irritation of the pleura can also cause severe pain. Although, the pain caused by the conditions described usually resolves in a few weeks; mild pain may persist only associated with some body positions or movements, and no further than 6 months.  About your concern on brake components containing asbestos, is true that many auto manufacturers do not use asbestos in brakes any longer, but not all. Due to some regulations, asbestos is still used in brake and clutch linings. Products in which asbestos fibers are well bound in the material are permitted, including disc brake pads, drum brake linings, and brake blocks. And, it is hard to tell if brake components contain asbestos, because product information on labels and safety data sheets only report asbestos content if it is more than 1% of the piece; for older cars or with replaced brakes is still harder.  Almost every country in the world has laws and regulations protecting from workplace exposure to asbestos. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), from the U.S. Department of Labor, established the exposure limit to 0.1 fibers per cubic centimeter. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) considers there is no known safe level of asbestos exposure. During brake repair, dust containing asbestos fibers can be inhaled, and dust masks do not protect from this. There are other preventive measures and control methods, recommended by and under OSHA regulations.  Regarding your question on the amount and duration of asbestos exposure until symptoms develops; asbestos diseases are generally dose dependent, associated with prolonged exposure, on average 20 years. Though, time frame varies from around a year (some pleural diseases) to more than 40 years (mesothelioma). Occasionally, short, severe exposure to asbestos is enough to cause harm. Asbestos can cause cancer and benign (but serious) diseases. Most common cancers are lung cancer and mesotelioma, a deadly cancer of the pleura, the thin membrane investing the lungs (visceral pleura) and lining the walls of the chest cavity (parietal pleura). Benign asbestos-related diseases are: asbestosis or fibrosis of the lung (lung scarring), benign asbestos-related pleural diseases, and airway obstruction (chronic obstructive airway disease).  There are four types of benign asbestos-related pleural diseases: pleural effusions (fluid in the pleural space), fibrosis involving the visceral pleura (diffuse pleural thickening), fibrosis of the parietal pleura (pleural plaques), and rounded atelectasis (collapse of the lung). These are the most common benign asbestos-related diseases.  Chest pain is not unusual in asbestos-exposed people, frequently described as a vague chest discomfort. Persistent severe pain is a rare complication of benign asbestos-related pleural disease, and usually there is radiographic evidence of either lung or pleural disease. Also, pleural thickening not related to asbestos exposure is common, generally due to past infections.  Plain chest radiographs are limited detecting cases of mild asbestos diseases. Currently, computed tomography is the gold standard for the detection of benign asbestos-related pleural diseases, and identifies pleural thickening not visible on the plain radiographs.  As you can tell, with the information at hand it is not possible to determine if your pain is asbestos-related or not. Remember that chest pain is very common and most often caused by a benign condition. I suggest you to get an appointment with an occupational physician or pulmonologist to rule out an asbestos-related disease.\n\n",

    "content": "History: 31 yr old female, previous smoker of 2-3 packs a week for 5  years, quit last year. Late October 2006 I developed chest wall pain after really bad virus. I had a echo-cardiogram, ekg, bloodwork and chest xray (all done Nov 2007) all normal and was determined costrocondritis. The pain gradually became less, went away but has now returned full force.  The pain now is frequent but not constant and is on specific ribs (when it hurts, I can push on my ribs and feel specific sore spots, always on the front of my ribs). The pain occurs on the ribs on both sides above and below my breasts but only one sore place at a time. Also the center of my rib cage sometimes hurts as does the top of my shoulder and armpits sometimes. I have no congestion or cough, but I do have allergies and a slight sinus issue due to them.  Could this reoccuring issue indicate lung cancer (or some other serious issue) that was missed a few months ago? Also, should I go have the tests run again? Thanks in advance, V\n\n",

Specifically, if you can push on the bone and it reproduces the pain, this is very likely to be costochondritis.  The best treatment is anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen.  If the pain is worsening or not improving I would recommend that you be evaluated by your doctor.

You have to wait again for the results of the pathological examination of the biopsy he will take through bronchoscopy or CT guided according to the mass location (tissue biopsy is mandatory). In addition, you have to complete her work up with abdominal Ultra-Sound to determine the stage of her disease. The treatment approach and prognosis differ according to the pathological type and the extent of the disease.  If the results show benign nodule then a radiological follow up is advisable,  stable nodules on follow up are usually benign.   Keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Dotbowels,  In order to offer you a more accurate answer it is essential to know your past medical history, particularly concerning smoking status and respiratory diseases. Although, I found your previous post, and noticed you were diagnosed with Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) in 2003, at age 54. Mainstay of therapy for ABPA is oral corticosteroids: a high dose of prednisone in acute attacks, followed by a lower maintenance dose. Simultaneous itraconazole (Sporanox\u00ae) therapy is also helpful. After reading your posts I believe you received initial adequate treatment.  Unfortunately, important details are missing: the stage of your disease (ABPA I-V), duration of therapy, previous pulmonary function tests.  Regarding your question about antibiotics or prednisone, I can\u2019t suggest which one, because both require to be prescribed by your doctor. Therapy should be given according to the patient\u2019s clinical condition, however most patients require prolonged low dose prednisone to manage their symptoms and reduce relapses.  With the information at hand, it is very hard to suggest any change of therapy. But, your doctor knows you are having those preoperative evaluation tests, and if he recommended Advair you should follow his instructions.  If you could send me more details about your medical history, I will be glad to give you further information.  Sincerely,  Dr Alberto de la Guerra.\n\n",

My tumor was 10 cm.  I've been cancer free since.  This summer I had an angiogram which showed my right coronary artery was 100% blocked which required two stents, each about 3 cm long.  My left coronary artery was unremarkable.  I'm wondering if my blockage was caused by;  A.) possible radiation spray to heart  B.) pulmonary hypertension due to lobectomy  C.) just high cholesterol ?  Of course I have been going to cardiac rehab and have lowered my cholesterol to below 130 and am exercising daily.  I'm worried that if this is caused by pulmonary rearrangement from surgery and radiation, then situation could become worse.  Thanks.  Barb\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Blaze100, Coronary artery disease may be present for a significant amount of time (years) before the deficit of blood supply is slowed to the area in such an amount to produce symptoms or become apparent on diagnostic studies. One of the most common causes of Coronary Arterey Disease results from atherosclerosis (build up of plaque). Damage to the coronary arteries by, for example, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, high triglycerides, smoking, etc. may result in damage and blockage. It would be almost impossible for me to state whether or not this condition was present prior to your surgery and treatment or if it is a direct result of such treatment. Your physician, whom is the most familiar with your history would most likely be able to give the best answer regarding this matter. Congratulations to you! I sincerely wish you future good health.

    "content": "Hello.  I have Crohn's disease,  scleroderma which has been localized to my right lateral chest wall since I was 12, and Behcet's disease, and valve regurgitation of 3 valves.  All of these conditions are basically under decent control with medications, however I am tired and feel generally unwell quite a lot recently.  I cough at night even though my bed is elevated, and sleep 4-5 hours a night. ( I had an episode of extreme chest pain and pressure in July which was relieved by Nitroglycerin.  No reason was found, except perhaps a pulmonary embolism originating from an arm surgery 2 days prior.)  A lung nodule was found on a CT scan (for a bowel obstruction) about 14 months ago.  I have had repeat scans done a few times since, and the most recent scan revealed a very slight increase in size, from 2.5 to 3 mm, but also an additional lesion.  The original nodule is at the base of the left lung and is described as similar in appearance to study of 9 months ago.  The new one is a subpleural nodular density with some linear component in the left upper lobe, thought to be scar tissue. I receive Remicade infusions every 8 weeks for Behcet's disease and since the nodules are undiagnosed as far as malignancy is concerned, I am uneasy about continuing with Remicade.  I also take 6-Mercaptopurine for Crohn's.  The nodules are not in a position easily accessed for biopsy and I have already had 8 breast biopsies due to a very strong family history of cancer, so surgery isn't planned.  I seem to get such different opinions from my various doctors that I would like to have some help deciding my next course of action.  Thank you.\n\n",

Pulmonary complications include: - Respiratory air way: Bronchiectasis. Chronic bronchitis Chronic bronchiolitis.  - Parenchymal Interstitial lung disease. - Pulmonary infiltrates with eosinophilia.  - Auto immune Pleurisy.  -Vasculitis associated with Behcet disses leads to high incidence of pulmonary embolism.  The CT findings of these small lesions could be could be due to pulmonary complications of the systemic disease you have.   Since you are taking Remicade (anti-TNF therapy), exclusion of pulmonary complications like certain infections or cancer should be excluded.   Researchers recently, concluded anti-TNF therapy can increases the risk of developing cancers, especially in patients treated with high doses of this type of therapy. The risk for Lung cancer is increased with anti-TNF therapy.  You should discuss with your physician regarding the risks and benefits of this treatment in your situation.

    "content": "Dear premed3341,  As Dr. Tamer said,  Your Dr. has already determined by examination a supraclavicular Lymph node enlargement.  An enlarged supraclavicular Lymph node is always an indication that malignancy should be excluded.   A Conventional  US study with or without Doppler can help in confirmation of the nature of this swelling.  CT scan  also would confirm the presence of a Lymph node.  A Study showed that, Nodes of a diameter of 22. 3 mm can be  palpated in 50% of cases.   In this study, The sensitivity of ultrasonography was triple that of palpation for the detection of metastases in supraclavicular Lymph nodes and CT scans were found to be as sensitive as ultrasonography.   PET scans have been reported to be more sensitive than CT scans in the detection of malignant disease in Lymph nodes. However, PET scans are expensive and not always availablee.  The personal and medical history as well as the clinical examination gives a good idea about the possibility of this node to be of malignant Origin. Further investigations include, US guided FNAC or biopsy.  Keep on follow up with your doctor and keep us updated. Thank you for using The Doctors Lounge.  Best regards,\n\n",

I normally take Vitamins A,C,E Betacarotenes, Zinc, Copper, Selenium, Gluthathione and NAC and this keeps the ache away. When I stop taking these antioxidants for a week the soreness return. I am very concerned . whatever is going on seems to be counteracted by antioxidants - the usual anti-cancer supplements - so there is some unusual oxidative reaction taking place i guess.  I am afraid to stop taking the supplements in case its a tumour flaring up. Now i have a constant slight ache which is there all the time, near the windpipe. I have heard of Asymptomatic lung cancer.  Should I go for CT or EBCT? what is the difference? or should I wait till it gets worse (which in the case of Lung cancer usually means too late)\n\n",

    "content": "Dear sorechest44,  Eearly stages of lunge cancer the disease are curable, thus the benefit for early screening has been studies by many. Chest X-ray CXR is a commonly used diagnostic rest for suspected chest disorder. CXR can detect a nodule of 1 cm size.  Computed tomography (CT or CAT scan) is a diagnostic imaging technique in which combined x-rays and computer technology is used,  giving cross-sectional images for any part of the body (horizontally and vertically 2D).   A CT scan provides detailed image for the bones, muscles, fat, and organs. CT scans of the chest is used also to detect injuries and/or diseases of the chest (thoracic) and to follow up tumors and other chest lesions.   A spiral CT (another form of CT Scan) can accurately detect nodules as small as 5 mm.   Electron beam CT scan EBCT scan is a new procedure for imaging which gives 3D images making the diagnostic accuracy is higher than other conventional imaging techniques. It can detect any small lesion (2 mm)  in the lung as well as any parhynchymal changes like emphysema at very early stage. However, the rapid spiral or helical CT, is more recommended by many as it gives more defined pictures than the EBCT at the same time,  less radiation exposure than conventional CT scans.   Studies showed no superior sensitivity of CT scanning over the conventional procedure. Until clear evidence for mortality rate difference is found, spiral CT scanning is not recommended as a standard procedure for early detection and secondary prevention of lung cancer.  After complete history and clinical examination, The physician is the one who  can consider the overall utility of  one of these screening test.  I advise you to follow up with your docotr.

    "content": "Hi, I have been having strange symptoms for the last month, and would like some clarification and possibly recommendations.  First I am 30 years old on Wednesday   .  The symptoms I've been having are faint but nonetheless they are bothering me. I woke up one morning (about 30 days ago) not feeling well (mild diarehea, a mild fever [ ~ 100 F or so]); no cough, or any other symptoms I could associate with a cold or flu, etc. Coincedently, I started the path to not smoking at this time as well (patches; then no more patches, no more smoking, no cheating  it's been a month!!).   I noticed an odd feeling in my chest, not a pain, just different. I am now able to \"crack\" my xiphoid process/sternum and sometimes it feels like I'm squishing something when I press on it. I've also noticed an odd sensation in my left arm as well, again not really pain, just odd, sort of tingling, almost like it's colder then the rest of my body.  I immediately scheduled an examination with my doctor. He asked about family history (My father has been diagnosed with lung cancer and is going through various treatments). My doctor didn't seem to have any concerns. Said that I probably never noticed the xiphoid process thing before, and I seem to be under a lot of stress. Basically I was dismissed and told I have nothing to worry about and to learn to better manage stress now that I'm not smoking. I'm contemplating getting a second opinion (at least a chest x-ray or something). This is really starting to freak me out; so definitely not helping with stress management.  I know I'm young, and getting lung cancer at 29-30 is like winning the lottery (some twisted evil lottery, but nonetheless it happens). Should I go get a second opinion, or am I being a 'cyberchondriac'?  Also, I just found out recently, that friends of mine that attended a party with me the night before I woke up the diarehea and fever were diagnosed with strep throat. Am I just presenting this in some weird way?? Again, the dr I saw didn't seem too worried about it (I'm pretty sure he dismissed everything as stress related)  Thanks so much for your attention!\n\n",

Viral symptoms seem to have been making another round ranging from upper respiratory infections to gastrointestinal complaints, ie, fever, vomiting, diarrhea, etc. It seems as though you had the gastrointestinal symptoms, which I hope by now have subsided. Inquire with your physician about a chest xray. This will  alleviate any concerns and is a relatively easy diagnostic study. Identification of any underlying abnormality can be identified.

The method of diagnosis as well as its relation to previous radiology is also very important.   It could be lung cancer or cancer that has spread from another area. At the same time it could be many other benign diseases of the lung.  Smoking is a major risk factor as I am sure you are aware.  Best of luck to him.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Onelildarlin2u,  Sorry for not answering earlier. Cough persisting for more than 3 weeks is called chronic cough, and might be due to more than one cause simultaneously. Cough related to cigarette smoking should significantly improve or disappear within 4 weeks after quitting smoking. Doctors take into consideration two important items when looking for the origins of chronic cough: patient\u2019s smoking history and the chest x-ray (CXR) findings. In nonsmokers who have normal CXR, chronic cough is likely due to postnasal drip syndrome (e.g. runny nose), asthma, and/or gastroesophageal reflux disease, nearly 100% of the time.  Common causes of chronic cough in smokers are chronic bronchitis and lung cancer. Chronic bronchitis is characterized by the production of phlegm with the cough most days of the week (diagnosis is established when lasts 3 months or more in at least 2 consecutive years). Even though lung cancer is a rare cause of chronic cough (less than 5% of all cases), it should be rule out in adults with persistent cough, particularly in current or former smokers. Usually, when CXR findings are abnormal, a biopsy is necessary to exclude cancer. Certainly, there are hundreds of other causes of cough, but are less common.  About the CXR findings, as you can imagine it\u2019s very hard for me to assess, neither interpret the films over the internet. Although, I will attempt to make a general analysis, based on your descriptions, for which I will assume that by cobwebs the doctor meant fibrosis. Pulmonary fibrosis is a consequence of many types of lung diseases, in particular chronic inflammatory ones; normal lung tissue is converted to scarred tissue, called fibrotic tissue. Most common causes of bilateral upper lung lobe fibrosis are old tuberculosis and non-specific fibrous scarring (not known cause). Additional causes of localized lung fibrosis include previous bacterial (e.g., pneumonia) or fungal (e.g., valley fever fungus) lung infections. Localized fibrosis could also be due to sarcoidosis, pneumoconioses (mineral lung deposits), histiocytosis X, and ankylosing spondylitis.  I hope you find this information useful.  Sincerely,  Dr. Alberto de la Guerra.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear doctors,   Foremost, I am grateful to have found this site. I've been scouring the internet for days for some expert's opinion.  Below is my dad's most recent CT Report: [quote]Comparison made to a previous study dated Sept. 27, 2005 again shows the multiple pulmonary nodules in the right lung base, some of which are about the hemidiaphragm showing mild interval progression in size. The largest measures 2.1 x 2.1 cm, (previously, 1.6 x 2.0). The tiny subcentimeter nodules in the right middle lobe are stable in size and number. The hyperdense / enhancing pleural based nodular density in the right apex is unchanged in size and appearance. A new pleural based pulmonary nodule is now demonstrated in the right apex measuring 1.2 x 1.3 cm.  The lobulated large anterior mediastinal mass with punctate calcifications is slightly bigger in size measuring 6.2 x 4.7 cm. (previously 6.0 x 4.2 cm). The marginal to small-sized lymph nodes in the prevascular space and AP window are unchanged. Small sized lymph nodes in the right hilum are the same. A small subcarinal lymph node is now noted.  Emphysematous changes in both upper lung fields are stationary. The atelectasis in the superior segment of the lower right lobe has slightly progressed.  There is slight progression in the pleural nodularity in the right posteromedial region. No pleural efflusion.  IMPRESSION: OVERALL FINDINGS ARE INDICATIVE OF MILD DISEASE PROGRESSION COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS STUDY DATED SEPTEMBER 27, 2005.[/quote]   The onc explains that the progression might be because he has stopped taking Tarceva twice for two weeks each because of infections. The total of 1 month without Tarceva (From Oct. to Present) might have caused the progression.  She recommends Tarceva for another three months. Do you think this a proper prescription? Seeing as his main tumor grew about .2cm to .5cm, and his right nodule grew about .5cm x .1cm, and a new nodule measuring 1.2cm x 1.3 cm popped up.  Would you accept this treatment plan? I am confused. Thanks so much, your opinions are very much valued and I am always grateful.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi francesbean,  Sorry for not replying earlier. At present, preferred first-line chemotherapy for patients with IIIB NSCLC are platinum-containing combined regimens. Docetaxel (Taxotere) plus Carboplatin have demonstrated to be effective as first-line therapy; as well Taxotere extends survival among patients with disease progression after platinum-based chemotherapy, and is also indicated alone as second-line treatment.  Unfortunately, few treatment options can be offered to patients after failure of first and second-line therapies. In such cases, some patients could benefit from third-line therapy. Erlotinib (Tarceva), a new drug approved for third-line treatment (unless a patient has already been treated with it, since it is also approved as second-line treatment), can prolong survival in patients for whom standard chemotherapy was no longer working.  Another valid option is best supportive care (called palliation). The purpose of supportive care is to identify and resolve problems related to the comfort and support of the patient as they come up so the symptoms can be minimize and the patient can carry on as many of their prior activities as possible. This option is commonly used for patients who would not benefit from, or are not able to tolerate further chemotherapy. It is also an option for patients who choose not to undergo anti-tumor treatment.  About your concerns on whether to accept or not another 3 months on Tarceva, it depends on many aspects. Two of the most important factors needed to decide the right treatment are the stage and the performance status of the patient (general health status). For patients whose cancer has progressed, performance status is a decisive issue to make the best choice. For patients who need help caring for them and are in bed greater than 50% of their waking hours due to ill health, best supportive care is generally recommended rather than chemotherapy or targeted therapy (Tarceva). This is because the worse the performance status, the more likely it is that patients will have significant complications during treatment, and are less likely to gain improved survival.  Because circumstances, aspirations, and life choices are different from one patient to another, the choice to have best supportive care rather than Tarceva is an individual decision that your father should discuss with his love ones and the oncologist. His personal situation is unique and the outcome of his choices may be similar to or very different from what others had experienced. Sorry to say but there is no one right answer applicable to every patient.  Hope you find the information useful.  I wish luck to you and your Dad,  Dr. Alberto de la Guerra.\n\n",

About your concerns on mild disease progression, remember that Tarceva prolongs survival and improves quality of life, but unfortunately can not cure cancer. I think Tarceva is a good option, but if both of you have doubts about it, and as long as the disease stays stable or shows only mild progression, and your dad maintains a good general health, he might benefit from newer approaches to lung cancer treatment, within a clinical trial.  I will wait until April for the results.  Good luck,  Dr. Alberto de la Guerra.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello olexak,  About your question on life expectancy, it is hard to give you an accurate answer. First of all, survival rates are based on statistics. In cancer, overall survival is often shown as a 5-year survival rate, which refers to the percentage of patients who live at least 5 years after their cancer is diagnosed, but many patients live much longer than 5 years after diagnosis. Besides, survival figures are averages obtained from a large number of patients, so they don\u2019t estimate individual outcomes. As well, collecting information takes time, thus survival statistics are not able to weight the impact of novel treatment until several years later.  Certainly cancer survival statistics are useful, whilst used within the right context, such as evaluate the benefits of more appropriate research design and analysis, more appropriate health policy development, etc.  The conclusion from all the above mentioned is pretty clear, statistics can\u2019t predict what will happen to you, since each patient is unique and some react differently to cancer and its treatment than do others. Because the predictability of population survival outcomes is of limited usefulness to clinicians and surgeons, due to the diversity of the patients comprising the overall population, we use prognostic factors to separate the patients into subgroups in order to improve medical decision making and survival estimation, among other subjects.  To offer you a more precise answer I need to evaluate your prognostic factors, unfortunately, important details about your disease are missing.  Anyhow, the 5-year survival rates for stage IIB lung cancer ranges from 10% to 45%. Consider that these statistics vary significantly depending on the type of treatment (surgery has better survival), and the prognostic factors. Also, since stage II cases constitute less than 10% of the total number of patients with lung cancer, and nearly only 25% of these patients do not undergo surgery, not much is known about the outcomes after radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy.  I can provide you additional information if you give me more details, like:  -What chemotherapy drugs did you received, and what form of radiotherapy (and total dose). Your response to treatment (complete, partial).  -The size of your tumor, and if it was a T2N1M0 or a T3N0M0. If it was a T3, did it involved your chest wall, the diaphragm, the mediastinal pleura or the parietal pericardium; or if it invaded a main bronchus.   - How is your overall health, what are your symptoms, are you active or in bed?  Best luck,  Dr. Alberto de la Guerra\n\n",

    "content": "Hi dv,  Coughing up blood is known as hemoptysis; it refers specifically to blood that comes from the lower respiratory tract, below the vocal cords (trachea, bronchus and lungs). Sometimes this is confused with bleeding from the mouth, nose, throat, or gastrointestinal tract. When blood originates outside the respiratory tract is known as pseudohemoptysis (false hemoptysis). Thus, the first problem is to determine the source of the bleeding.  Hemoptysis can have many causes, including infections, heart diseases, cancer, and vasculitis (blood vessel inflammation). In addition, causes differ greatly depending on geographic settings. For example, in the USA the most common causes of hemoptysis in adults are bronchitis and lung cancer, and least common is tuberculosis. On the other hand, tuberculosis is the leading cause of hemoptysis in developing countries.  There are many factors that have to be evaluated to get to the cause of your problem and rule out its seriousness. This evaluation has to be completed by a doctor based on your medical history, a physical examination, x-rays, etc. Although, I can tell you that blood-streaked sputum in a healthy young person usually indicates an infection and is generally no cause for concern.  If the blood comes from the respiratory tract, a chest x-ray must be done. To determine this, I strongly suggest you to see a doctor. Beware, usually, hemoptysis stops momentarily, which does not excludes the possibility that a serious illness may be present, and still requires medical evaluation.  Sincerely,  Dr. Alberto de la Guerra\n\n",

My friend who is male, 19 years old, smoker, and light drinker was having problems breathing the other day, he had also been wheezing and coughing up phlegm.  He went to see the doctor yesterday and he had blood samples and saliva samples taken.  The doctor told him that his blood pressure was extremely high and that he had bad lungs.  The doctor (perhaps after tests had come back i am not sure) said that the skin of his lung is peeling, and some of it was coming up (pressumably up through his throat and he was coughing it up).  I am really concerned what this all means.  I am very worried that this could be a serious health issue.  Obviously smoking may not be helping the issue...I thought the smoking had just burned his lungs but may be worried it could lead to cancer...  From what i am aware, him having trouble breathing isnt a regular thing.  Last year he went to the doctor and found his heart was weak, and in a poor condition.  Is this related to his lungs, i don't think so, but thought i should mention it.    Thankyou for your time,   Marsi10.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi marsi10,  Your fears about smoking are correct. Smoking is the largest single preventable cause of death and disease in Australia, killing more than 19,000 men and women each year. Lung cancer (80% caused by smoking), kills more Australians annually than any other kind of cancer.  I\u2019m not saying that your friend has lung cancer, and I don\u2019t think his problem is caused by a lung cancer, but if he doesn\u2019t quit now the chances will increase. Also, as you pointed out, smoking is not helping him.  About the specific cause of his breathing problem, I don\u2019t have enough information to tell you if this could be a serious illness. The unpleasant sensation of difficulty in breathing is known as dyspnea, which is more frequently caused by diseases of the heart or lungs. To determine the possible cause is important to evaluate several factors, such as the duration of the dyspnea, when and how started (on exertion or during rest, at daytime or nighttime, etc), the occurrence of other symptoms, and exercise tolerance. Other important information that may help includes allergies, job record, and past medical history, particularly respiratory and cardiac problems.  Although several pieces of information are missing for a more precise answer, at the end of your post you mentioned he has a heart condition, which might be the origin of his problem.  I wish luck to you and your friend.  Dr. Alberto de la Guerra.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Blaze100,  Is not true, not all lung cancers return.  There are two main types of lung cancer, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). NSCLC represents almost 80% of lung cancers, and has 4 subtypes. Adenocarcinoma is the most frequent type of NSCLC (also have 4 subtypes). Bronchioloalveolar adenocarcinoma (BAC) is a special type of adenocarcinoma that tends to be slow growing and seems less likely to metastasize than other forms of NSCLC. For this reason, BAC has a more favorable prognosis than other forms of NSCLC. As well, BAC has a higher incidence in women than men compared with other lung cancer types. Women tend to be younger at diagnosis, and never-smokers. Overall survival is higher for BAC compared with other lung cancers, especially in female patients.  To predict outcome, oncologists consider specific factors related to the patient, to the tumor, and to the treatment (the prognostic factors). I will try to correlate these prognostic factors with the information you provided.  1. Patients with early stage BAC who undergo curative surgery have a better survival.  - I don\u2019t have all the information necessary, but from what you wrote I\u2019m pretty sure you had an early stage lung cancer, possibly stage I B, and underwent curative surgery.  2. Survival for patients who undergo major resections (lobectomy) is higher than those who have minor surgical resections.  - You had upper and middle right lobes removed.  3. Patients with a right lung tumor have a longer survival than those with a left lung tumor.  - Yours was in the right lung.  4. Survival is better for patients with no nodal involvement.  - Your lymph nodes were negative.  5. Female patients have a better prognosis than male patients.  - You\u2019re women.  6. The longer the disease-free survival, the longer the overall survival.  - You were treated 5 years ago, and all your tests came out okay.  Nobody can predict the future, however, because of all the above, I strongly agree with your oncologist.  Sincerely,  Dr. Alberto de la Guerra.\n\n",

    "content": "I\u2019m a 59-year-old male; I have had a persistent chest pain, right side back, for one year. The pain ranges from 1 to 5, on a 1-10 scale, depending largely on how I move. The pain is similar to muscle ache. I\u2019m concerned because I worked in shipyards from 1968 to 1980 and a coworker recently developed some type of lung disease. I described these symptoms to my doctor who prescribed blood and urine test and a chest x-ray. The blood test reveled high cholesterol, for which I\u2019m now taking Vytorin. The findings of the x-ray were: \u201cThere is mild apical pleural thickening. The lungs are clear. Cardiac silhouette and mediastinal shadows are within normal limits. There are moderate degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.\u201d I would appreciate any opinions on what could be causing the pain and a cure, if any.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Lyle,  Sorry for the delay in my answer. The origin of back pain can be the vertebral column and discs, ligaments, nerves, muscles, pelvic or abdominal organs, and the skin. However, pain is usually originated in the musculoskeletal structures of the back, due to strenuous lifting that follows a previous period of inactivity, improper body positions, overweight, etc. Pain itself is caused by strong spasms that make back muscles severely stiff. Properly treated, pain withdraws in 4 to 6 weeks. Pain that lasts more than 3 months is called chronic pain.  Based on the duration of your pain, I think you\u2019re suffering from a chronic back pain. Since it\u2019s related to certain movements, it\u2019s more likely of musculoskeletal causes. The degenerative changes found in your spine, reveal osteoarthritis, also known as degenerative joint disease. With degeneration of the spine, the cartilage that covers the bone becomes rough, and causes the joint halves to rub against each other, creating inflammation with pain. This is one of the most common causes of back pain in people over 50 years of age. Less frequently, upper back pain on the right side may be caused by gallstones or an infection of the gallbladder, often related to abdominal complains.  About your worries on lung disease and shipyards workers, it\u2019s assumed that all workers involved in ship building and maintenance have been exposed to asbestos. Asbestos fibers can cause pleural and lung diseases, which can be seen more often 10 to 40 years after exposure. Pleural diseases can be benign or malignant.  Benign pleural disease is the commonest manifestation of asbestos exposure. Benign pleural thickening can appear as circumscribed parietal pleural plaques (lining of inner chest wall), or as more diffuse thickening of the visceral pleura (coating of the lungs). Chest pain can also be caused by pleural abnormalities. Your x-rays showed mild apical pleural thickening, but there can be a lot more explanations for it, including a variety of inflammatory processes involving the pleura. As well, apical pleural thickening often occurs with increasing age, forming an apical cap, usually less than 5 mm thick. I cannot tell you if the asbestos exposure has originated the pleural thickening.  I suggest you to see a pulmonologist or a thoracic surgeon to find out if it\u2019s an asbestos related pleural disease.   Sincerely,  Dr. Alberto de la Guerra\n\n",

    "title": "Lung mass - conflicting diagnosis",
    "content": "I took my grandmother to the ER a 3 weeks ago and the ER doctor did a CTscan and an Xray and determined that she had malignant lung cancer.  She was a smoker for 50 years and quit in 1997.  This diagnosis was a surprise since she had seen her pulmonologist 2 weeks prior to that and he did the same tests.  The pulmonologist has put her on 2 heavy antibiotics (AFTER THE ER VISIT) and wants to see her tomorrow, which will have been 2 weeks since she started them.  In the CT scan, the mass was very jagged and had black lines which the pulmonologist seems to believe are air pockets. When she initially went to the pumonologist and had these scans done, he mentioned TB or some other infectious disease.  He said cancer was a remote possibility.  She had a breathin test done last week and all of her numbers were in the 90s except the one where she exhales which was in the 40s.   I just got her blood work from the hospital back and the results are as follows.  Does any this give any indication on whether this might just be an infection or if it is lung cancer?

    "content": "Hi Titasgirl,  I will be glad to help you, though some important information is missing (why did your grandmother went to the pulmonologist the first time, why was admitted to the ER, where is the \u201cmass\u201d localized and what size is it, does she has or has had any pulmonary disease, and her age).  Regarding your question about the possibility that a blood work might rule out cancer, unluckily lung cancer can not be diagnosed with any type of laboratory test (neither breathing tests). Lung cancer can only be confirmed by a trained pathologist after microscopic examination of a sample of the lung lesion. Therefore, a biopsy is required to obtain that sample. However, blood tests are very useful to bear out infectious diseases, like pneumonias. The results you have posted appear to be inside acceptable ranges, and do not suggest any infection. About her breathing test, smoking is not only responsible for 90% of lung cancer (and more than 30% of all cancers), but also causes (and much more often) COPD, a chronic pulmonary and irreversible disease, that impairs lung functions (showed by the \u201cexhalation\u201d value in the 40s).  Typically, almost 90% of young adults with pneumonia have fever, chills, cough with phlegm, shortness of breath, and chest pain; less than 40% of elderly patients have those symptoms. That\u2019s the reason why diagnosis of pneumonia in the elderly is not an easy task, and 30% of the patients are initially misdiagnosed as not having pneumonia. Another problem is that chest X-rays (CXR) may not return to normal after appropriate treatment; only 50% have normal CXR after 2 weeks, 75% after 6 weeks, and it may take up to 3 months in elderly individuals.  As well, unfortunately, sometimes pneumonia is a complication of an underlying lung cancer. About 4% of adults with a diagnosis of pneumonia are found to have lung cancer on investigation. In current or ex-smokers, aged over 50, cancer is found in as much as 16% of the cases.  I don\u2019t have enough information to estimate the likelihood of a pneumonia, but I feel one of the reasons why the pulmonologist considered that chance is the presence of black lines within the lung \u201cmass\u201d (based on the description you made of it), which is a CXR feature commonly associated with pneumonias and other lung infections. But unfortunately, while chest CT is extremely specific for certain benign lesions, most abnormalities remain indeterminate and lung cancer cannot be excluded, and patients may then proceed to an invasive procedure for diagnosis.   What do experts recommend about pneumonia:  1.\tPatients who still have symptoms or physical signs or who are at higher risk of underlying cancer, especially smokers and those over 50 years, should have a CXR done after 6 weeks of finishing treatment. 2.\tFurther investigations, which may include bronchoscopy or biopsy, should be considered when signs, symptoms, and radiological abnormalities persist at around 6 weeks after completing treatment.  Although I said that symptoms and radiologic signs are not always reliable to assess pneumonia in the elderly patient, considering it has been more than 6 weeks without a consistent diagnosis, and most important because of your grandmother\u2019s risk factors for lung cancer (age, I guess she\u2019s over 50, smoking history and COPD), my advice is to think in the possibility of lung cancer and try to rule it out by whatever method is easiest. Sputum cytology is a reasonable first step when the tumor is centrally positioned, but diagnostic accuracy depends on many factors (acquisition, handling, and interpretation of samples), and flexible bronchoscopy is more useful in those cases, whereas in peripheral lesions, transthoracic needle biopsy is the best method.  I will be looking forward to the results.  Best luck,  Dr Torax\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Dr. Torax, We took her to the ER on 1/10 because we thought she might have pnemounia.  The doctor there did a chest x ray and a CT scan and diagnosed her with malignant lung cancer which was a shock seeing as we just had seen her pulmonologist 2 weeks ago and had the same tests.  We took her to see a pulmonologist because she is a former smoker (50) years probably and she has emphysymia and COPD.  on the 12th her pulmonologist prescribed 2 heavy antibiotics for her thinking that the mass was an infection and wanted to see her in 2 weeks to do a chest x ray.  That was this past Thursday.  He did the x ray, but there was a lot of fluid on the right lung and he said he could not really see the mass, but he thought it had shrunk.  He gave her lasiks and wanted her to take 1 pill that day and 1 the next and get another CT scan the following day.  She ended up being allergic to the lasiks.  She had the CT scan and here is the report.    FINDINGS: Again noted is a ill defined right apical pleural-based mass with adjacent pleural thickening.  Pleural mass measures approximatly 1.9x4.5 cm, (back in September it was 2.5cm) not significantly changed.  Extensive underlying pulmonary emphysematous changes are noted.  Multiple small bilateral pulmonary nodules are present.  2 right lower lobe nodules are increased in size with the largest measuring 1.3x0.7.  Punctate left lower lobe nodule appears new.  Mediastinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy is not significant changed with subcarinal node measuring 4.4x2.7 cm.  The right effusion is increased.  IMPRESSION:  1. Right upper lobe pleural based mass likely representing primary bronchogenic neoplasm.  This is amenable to CT guided biopsy. 2. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy without significant interval change. 3. Additional pulmonary nodules concerning for metastatic disease.  Several are increased in size.     Today she had thoracentesis and they removed 1 liter of fluid.  Her oxygen level went up 10 points immediatly.  I spoke with her doctor and than later the radiologist and he said that the pleminary findings on the fluid were inflammatory.  The radiologist said this was very good news suggesting infection not cancer.    Does this sound plausable to you and should I have any hope????  Thanks for your previous response :)\n\n",

    "content": "Hello again Titasgirl,  Thank you for the additional information.  The CT scan findings don\u2019t look very well, and the radiologist\u2019s impression is consistent with lung cancer. Compared with the scans done in September it shows more and bigger lung lesions. I think the probability of lung cancer is very high. In addition, lung cancers can cause fluid to collect in the sac surrounding the lung; this is called pleural effusion. Sampling this fluid can confirm the presence of cancer, however, malignant effusions can be diagnosed by pleural fluid alone in only 60% of cases, so if the first pleural cytology specimen is negative, this should be repeated a second time. Certainly many other pulmonary and systemic diseases can be the origin of a pleural effusion, thus, regarding the preliminary findings on the fluid, as I point out on my previous post, definitive diagnosis of cancer is made under a microscope, therefore, is better to wait an see what does the cytopathologist has to say.  I saw you posted a question in a new thread here: http://www.doctorslounge.com/oncology/f ... hp?t=11960 I will answer it with more detail in a few hours, but remember to keep all related posts in a single thread. In advance I can tell you that doctors have said it might be inoperable because lung cancer patients who have pleural involvement, mediastinal lymph node enlargement and other tumors somewhere else in the lungs are not good candidates for surgery. There are other options of treatment.  I truly hope it is not cancer, I wish the best for you and your grandmother.  Sincerely, Dr Torax.\n\n",

So since we are looking at most likely a diagnosis of lung cancer, based on what you have seen, does she have a reasonable chance of survival for the next few years???  I know there are different types, and staging is important too, so I don't know if this is a question that can be answered at this time.  Also, is there anything indicitive to you in these reports that would cause you to believe that this is an infection?  We are seeing a pulmonologist who has a wonderful reputation and came highly reccomended and I am just not sure how he could look at the same films as the radiologists keep looking at and up until last Friday he was still pretty certain this was an infection.

    "content": "Hi Titasgirl,  Even though your recent posts are pretty clear, as you can imagine is not easy to be convinced of any diagnosis based only in the information provided. Basically, a patient with a heavy smoking history, aged over 50, with a lung \u201cmass\u201d that was not present on a previous CXR (or if no CXR are available to compare), symptomatic or not, needs to be evaluated to exclude lung cancer, unless the \u201cmass\u201d has unmistakably characteristics of benignity on a CT scan. The same is true when the \u201cmass\u201d was present on a CXR, and has grown. PET scan is a non-invasive test, highly sensitive for identifying malignant nodules, but is not always available. Observation and follow-up is a valid option, but in my opinion, too risky. In these situations I recommend a biopsy, either by transthoracic fine needle aspiration or through a bronchoscopy (except for tumors only reachable by open surgery). My opinion not only relies on your grandmother\u2019s age and past medical history, but on the duration of her disease, and on the fact that although she has been under broad-spectrum combination therapy, her condition has worsened, as deduced from the radiologist report. An unusual lung infection could have a similar outcome, but in that case, also a more aggressive approach to diagnosis will be justified, which may include bronchoscopy and even needle aspiration of the lesion.  Regarding your question if something indicates this can be an infection, as I said somewhere else on this thread, diagnosis of pneumonia in the elderly is not an easy task. As well, I\u2019m missing an important piece of information to answer: the CXR and CT films. Sometimes pulmonologists and thoracic surgeons can have a very clear approach to diagnosis after meticulous examination of the CXR. At this time, with this information I cannot tell this is not pneumonia, nor it is. So, if the pulmonologist is still pretty certain this is an infection, we should trust him and wait for the cytology test.  About your question on survival (if it\u2019s cancer), you are right, can\u2019t be answered at this time. To decide on the appropriate treatment and give a prognosis we need to know the stage of the disease and the performance status of the patient. Furthermore, even for the most experienced cancer expert it\u2019s complicated to predict how long someone will live; patients are unique individuals and diseases affects them differently.  I will be waiting for the results.  Sincerely,  Dr Torax.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Titasgirl  Yes, we posted at the same time (1 min), lol.  About your concerns on the size of the \u201cmass\u201d. Mainly. there are two ways to evaluate if a lung lesion has grown: one is determining its growth rate by comparing its size on a current image with that on prior images, using the maximum diameter; the other is to judge against volumes. On September the diameter was 2.5 cms, and on the last report it was 1.9 x 4.5 cms, being 4.5 the largest. Anyway, I was not talking about that particular value, the radiologist reported more lung lesions that where larger than previous ones:  FINDINGS: Again noted is an ill defined right apical pleural-based mass with adjacent pleural thickening. Pleural mass measures approximately 1.9 x 4.5 cm, (back in September was 2.5 cm) not significantly changed. Extensive underlying pulmonary emphysematous changes are noted. Multiple small bilateral pulmonary nodules are present. 2 right lower lobe nodules are increased in size with the largest measuring 1.3 x 0.7. Punctuate left lower lobe nodule appears new. Mediastinal and right hilar Lymphadenopathy is not significant changed with subcarinal node measuring 4.4 x 2.7 cm. The right effusion is increased.   IMPRESSION: 1. Right upper lobe pleural based mass likely representing primary bronchogenic neoplasm. This is amenable to CT guided biopsy. 2. Mediastinal Lymphadenopathy without significant interval change. 3. Additional pulmonary nodules concerning for metastatic disease. Several are increased in size.  About explaining what are \"unmistakably characteristics of benignity\". There are some highly reliable findings of benignity on CT scans, like degree of enhancement of the lesion, type of margins and contours, and other internal characteristics, like presence of fat inside the lesion, some patterns of calcification inside the tumor (central calcification in benign tumors), etc.  Hope you find the information useful.  Good luck,  Dr Torax\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Titasgirl,  I\u2019m really sorry to hear they confirmed it is lung cancer.  About the stages of lung cancer, if the pleural fluid shows malignant cells it is IIIB, but if a pleural biopsy is positive it is stage IV. Also, if the CT shows other lung tumors, even if they are small, it is also classified as stage IV disease.  Patients with stage IIIB or IV do not benefit from surgery and are best managed by chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or a combination of both, depending on the sites of tumor involvement, and most important, on the patient\u2019s performance status (general health condition). That\u2019s because, even though there can be many treatment alternatives, the patient may not be able to tolerate them. Patients with excellent performance status can have combined therapy; however, patients with malignant pleural effusion are not always candidates for radiotherapy and usually are treated like stage IV patients, with chemotherapy.  Currently, in patients with inoperable stage IIIB or IV disease, specialists recommend as first-line chemotherapy (initial drug preference) a combined drug regimen (platinum-based or not). For patients with adequate performance status who have failed on first-line, platinum-based therapy, Docetaxel (brand name: Taxotere), is recommended as second-line therapy.  Unfortunately, treatment with those kinds of drugs may be contraindicated in elderly patients because of age-related impairment of organ functions and/or the presence of other diseases. Doctors must evaluate performance status and other illness co-existence rather than age when choosing treatment options for elderly patients.  Erlotinib (brand name:Tarceva) is recommended for the treatment of patients after failure of both platinum-based and docetaxel chemotherapies. This drug has a different mechanism for stopping cancer cells from growing and multiplying than those of chemotherapy and hormonal therapy. Erlotinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.  Because elderly patients with advanced lung cancer typically have few treatment options, investigators carried out clinical trials using Erlotinib as single therapy in elderly patients without prior chemotherapy; studies demonstrated tumor shrinkage good enough to help restore quality of life so that patients can carry on recreational activities. Other benefit of the drug is it can be taken once a day by mouth.  Age itself should not preclude an elderly patient from receiving chemotherapy. Currently, single-agent chemotherapy and nonplatinum or platinum-based doublets can all be considered as appropriate treatment for elderly patients with good performance status. Doctor\u2019s judiciousness, drug toxicity profiles, presence of other diseases, and patient preferences are fundamental to decide on which drug to use.  If your grandmother\u2019s health condition isn\u2019t good enough to tolerate regular chemotherapy regimens, Tarceva is a good choice.  I wish luck to you and your grandmother,  Dr. Alberto de la Guerra\n\n",

The pain only occurs when i twist my body to a certain position. Im not a heavy smoker but i have been smoking on/off for about 1 and 1/2 year. I went to a doctor and he said said my lung is clear and my heart is fine and he also said that it is probably caused by inflammtion, so i didnt need an x-ray. He told me the pain will go away soon. But i'm still having the pain.  Could it be lung cancer eventhough he said i have clear lungs? I have a little bit of coughing in the past few days...but don't know if it is related. I don't have any other syptoms.   I will quit smoking and be healthy if i make it through this time. Thank you.\n\n",

The actual diagnosis is done with a biopsy or a CT scan. Your MD does not see any signs of lung cancer otherwise he would run tests. The coughing you are experiencing could simply be due to the smoking.  I also believe that the sternal pain you are experiencing could be directly related to the smoking as well. I would not be concerned about cancer at this time. If these symptoms do not subside with you quitting smoking I would follow up with your MD again. good luck to you and bravo for kicking the habit!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Elo*,  I totally agree with Angela, although you have a smoking history, at your age, the probability of lung cancer is extremely remote, and rarely, cancer involving the chest or cancer that has spread from another part of the body can cause chest pain. Even more, when lung cancer causes pain it reveals an advanced stage of the tumor, and should be accompanied with other signs and symptoms. Thus, if the doctor said your lungs are clear and you don\u2019t have other complains, I think you don\u2019t have to worry about it. But if you continue smoking, in the near future you may be concern not only about lung cancer, but on cancer of the mouth, lips, throat, esophagus, stomach, anus, kidney, bladder, liver, pancreas, and leukemia, among others (tobacco smoke is responsible of at least 30% of all cancers).  As Angela pointed out, the chest pain you are experiencing could be related to the smoking, but if you are not a heavy smoker, your chest pain might have other origin.  Chest pain has a lot of causes, and they fall into two major categories: cardiac and non-cardiac causes. In young adults, without a history of previous cardiac illness, a non-cardiac problem is likely to be the origin of the pain. In this category the more frequent causes are musculoskeletal problems, gastrointestinal diseases (usually stomach acid reflux causing heartburn), and panic attacks, a form of anxiety (unexpected fear accompanied by chest pain, fast heartbeat, rapid breathing, sweating and shortness of breath).  In young healthy people, chest pain usually is caused by musculoskeletal problems of the chest wall (ribs, sternum, articulations, and muscles). The middle chest bone is the sternum, also called breastbone. The sternum articulates with the ribs 1 through 7 on either sides of the chest. When chest pain is felt along the edges of the breastbone, and appears when you take particular positions or make some movements, and is not related to exercise or gets worse with it, the most probable causes are costochondritis, Tietze\u2019s syndrome, and benign chest wall pain.   Costochondritis is an inflammation of the cartilage that connects a rib to the breastbone, and is the most common cause of chest pain originating in the chest wall. Costochondritis causes your chest to hurt when you push on your sternum or on the ribs near your sternum. Most commonly the cause of costochondritis is classified as 'idiopathic,' or unknown. This means that there is no identifiable cause for the condition. Frequently costochondritis and Tietze\u2019s syndrome are mistaken as being the same disease. Costochondritis typically presents with pain around the second to fifth costochondral joints, without swelling of the affected zone; in Tietze's syndrome there is swelling and pain of the articulation.   Benign chest wall pain is a transient and brief irritation of the pleura, the membrane that lines the lungs, and is very sensitive to pain. For unexplained causes, its transitory irritation can be a severe painful sensation. This condition has no medical significance at all.  The pain caused by these conditions usually improves within a few weeks. While some pain may persist, it is usually mild and only associated with some body positions or movements. All symptoms of pain should resolve within six months. If the pain gets worse or persists for a long time you should seek for medical attention.  Hope you find this information useful.  Sincerely,  Alberto de la Guerra.\n\n",

He is continueing on the clinical trial drug (oral) and will have scans in 1 week.  He is having mental confusion, light colored stools, fatigue, some pain.  So far he is not jaundiced.  My questions is how long does it take once the liver starts to fail till death?  I know you cannot say exactly, but if this continues to progress are we looking at months or weeks?  Will he have much pain?  Will he decline slowly or could it be sudden?  I know these are hard questions, but I desparately need some answers.  He does not really even have a local doctor, we travel 3 hrs to a cancer center hospital.  He does have a P.A. at the VA that he sees periodically and has an appt. next week, however, he is not involved at all in his cancer care.  Thank you again for all your help.\n\n",

About your husband\u2019s life expectancy, you are right, it is a hard question, perhaps the most complicated for a physician to respond; even for the most experienced cancer specialist it\u2019s usually difficult to give an accurate answer. This is because every patient is a unique individual and will be affected in a different way by their illness.  Altough I may be able to give you an estimate, keep in mind that it's a guess, because predicting how long someone will live is not exact. Based on the condition of your husband (confusion, liver function), it seems that time is short, perhaps weeks. As I said, these are only averages, some patients live long past the time the doctor predicted, and others live a shorter time. Also, an infection or other complication could happen and change things.  I think you should talk to the doctor and ask him about the prognosis and what to expect in the next weeks.

    "content": "Hi Karen, Merry Christmas,  Sorry I couldn\u2019t reply earlier. I think that your husband made the right choice with the phase II trial. About liver function tests and dangerous levels, it\u2019s a complex question to answer.  First of all, the commonly used liver function tests primarily assess liver damage rather than hepatic function. Indeed, these blood tests may reflect problems arising outside the liver, like bone disease (elevated alkaline phosphatase level). Abnormal values often, but not always, indicate something wrong in the liver, and provide clues to the nature of the problem. However, normal values do not always mean that the liver is normal. Of the routine liver function tests, only serum albumin, bilirubin and prothrombin time provide useful information on how well the liver is functioning.  I can give you the normal adult male ranges, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be of much help. Interpretation of liver function tests is a sophisticated process that physicians make use of in the context of a medical history, physical examination, and other tests such as X-rays or other imaging studies of the liver.  Laboratory analysis are ancillary tests, their values, single-handed, are not useful to estimate the severity of liver illness. Doctors must be aware that values can be higher or lower depending on patient\u2019s nourishment status and vitamin levels, previous diseases, medication intake, hormones levels, etc. Also, values are not linear numbers; an AST that is 300 is not twice as bad as 150 (normal is less than 40), and an AST of 94 and 80 are essentially the same to a liver specialist. Moreover, normal ranges may fluctuate somewhat according to the brand of laboratory assay materials used. In conclusion, these tests have a meaning, but they generally cannot be interpreted without clinical information.  I feel you must let the doctors take care of the liver tests. Although, there are some signs you can be aware of, which are related to liver impairment, like jaundice (yellow color in the skin, mucous membranes, or eyes), confusion, abdominal growth (due to ascites, an abnormal accumulation of fluids inside the belly), swelling of the feet and ankles, and abnormal bleeding. More reliable than lab tests is how is your husband feeling right now.  Hope you find this information helpful.  Best regards,  Dr Torax\n\n",

    "content": "Karen,   I read your husband\u2019s brief history, and I think he\u2019s been properly treated. I\u2019m going to give you an overview of current treatment options for lung cancer recurrence and liver metastases.  When lung cancer recurs (appears again) we need to evaluate some issues to select the proper treatment: like previous therapy (surgery, chemo, etc), site - number - size of new tumors, and most important the patient\u2019s general health status. This is important because, although there can be multiple treatment options, the patient may not be able to tolerate them. I guess your husband has good enough strength since he is ongoing second line chemotherapy.  Regarding your question about what to try next to stop progression, it\u2019s hard to tell. Unfortunately at this time there\u2019s no evidence supporting which treatment (second-line chemo) is more effective to control disease progression; besides, prolonging chemotherapy beyond 4 cycles does not get better results.  About liver mets treatment options, I don\u2019t think liver cancer drugs are a good alternative, among other reasons, because chemotherapy cannot cure liver cancer.  In some cases, where the liver is the only site of recurrence, there are some treatment alternatives, others than surgical resection or chemotherapy. Currently there are 5 minimally invasive techniques for the treatment of secondary malignant hepatic tumors: tumors radio-frequency ablation, microwave ablation, laser ablation, cryoablation, and chemoembolization. As well, some requisites have to be fulfill previously.  For example, treatment with radio-frequency ablation is feasible when there are 4 or fewer liver tumors, 5-cm or smaller and no extrahepatic tumor. Ideal tumors are smaller than 3 cm in diameter and 2 cm or more away from large hepatic vessels. Based on review of the CT scan, the doctor will decide if it is the appropriate treatment.  My advice is to wait for the scan results, then, if needed, ask the doctors about other treatment options. Also consider the possibility of clinical trials. Have no doubts that your husband is getting the best treatment currently available in one of the top cancer centers worlwide.  I wish the best for you and your husband.  Sincerely, Dr_Torax.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for your reply to my earlier post.  My husbands last CT scan showed slight growth in one of the liver tumors.  More troubling is suggested possible new small ones.  We do not know how many he has, but they have been measuring 2 and remarking on multiple others.  My ? is could having a procedure such as RFA or cyberknife on the larger tumors extend his life?  He does not have any symptoms from the liver tumors.  His small lung nodules are stabe.  I realize that getting rid of the bigger tumors will not help with the other smaller ones.  It does seem that it would at least slow down the progression in his liver.  Right now I am just trying to but time.   How much of your liver can be compromised and still be able to function?  Thank you so much for your very informative site.\n\n",

    "content": "Karen,  Unfortunately, based on current scientific evidence, I cannot tell you if reducing the tumor\u2019s burden will slow down the progression in his liver. There have not been many reports of liver metastasectomy after treatment for lung cancer. Reports published before 1988 did not consider that resection of metastases was worthwhile. More recent reports have been more favorable and this reflects the improvements in liver surgery that have since taken place.  There are guidelines as to which patients can have surgery for liver metastases. In general patients should have 5 or less separate metastatic sites to the liver. These need to be localized in one area such that they can be removed. A functional portion of the liver will need to remain, approximately 2/3rds of the liver can be resected and due to the liver's regenerative capacity a patient with a normal liver prior to surgery can do quite well.  Surgery for metastatic disease to the liver is not indicated when there are multiple tumors or extrahepatic disease is present, because to achieve control of disease progression we need to get rid of all the tumors. Chemotherapy is the best treatment option in those cases, or if disease is stable and there are no symptoms, maybe just follow-up and take care of the problems as they appear.  I wish the best for you and your husband.  Sincerely, Dr_Torax.\n\n",

    "content": "I have a question about cancer detecability.  I have been having some strange symptoms for about 6 months (lightheadedness, diaphoresis (only during lightheadedness episode, not at night), palpitations, dry cough, and left sided chest and scapular pains).  I have had lots of tests including 2d echo, ekg, stress, endoscopy, and chest CT (with contrast).  I was wondering  1. How good the chest CT is at screening for lung cancer and possibly lymphoma.   2. Can they tell how good the coronary and/or pulmonary blood supply is from the echo?  My concerns are some kind of undected cancer, poor Coronary artery circulation, or possibly pulmonary hypertension.  I will be seeing a Pulmonologist for a possible Bronchoscopy and wanted to know what kinds of questions I should ask him... I thank you in advance for any information you could supply -Sam\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Sam9, About your first question, CT scan is the best non-invasive diagnostic test to rule out lung cancer in a symptomatic patient (screening is looking for cancer before a person has any symptoms). About screening, The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force concludes that the evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against screening asymptomatic persons for lung cancer. At this time we are waiting for the National Lung Screening Trial conclusions to see which test is better for early detection (screening) of lung cancer. I don\u2019t think you have to worry about lung cancer, because usually symptoms appear when the disease is in an advanced stage (lung tumor or metastases are present), and the CT didn\u2019t find a lung tumor or thoracic lymph node. About lymphoma, the most common finding is a swollen lymph node; others include decreased numbers of blood cells (red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets), fevers, night sweats and weight loss. In a patient with symptoms a chest CT scan can detect disease inside the thorax. Infrequently a CT scan detects a lymphoma in absence of symptoms or other findings.  Regarding you second question, there are a number of tests available to diagnose a heart disease, like electrocardiogram, CXR, blood tests, stress tests, echocardiogram and cardiac catheterization. According to the recommendations of the American College of Cardiology Foundation and the American Heart Association, the standard workout to diagnose an ischemic heart disease includes EKG, 2D echo, stress test, and blood test. However, they still consider the patient\u2019s history and physical examination the most important part of the evaluation. So if your doctor didn\u2019t find out anything wrong, and your tests came out normal, you don\u2019t need to be concerned. The most common symptom of pulmonary hypertension, and virtually everyone who has the condition develops it, is shortness of breath upon exertion. Based on the symptoms, a doctor may suspect pulmonary hypertension in people who have an underlying lung disorder. To diagnose pulmonary hypertension doctors may order pulmonary function tests and all the others I mentioned for cardiac diseases. Definite diagnosis may require cardiac catheterization.  I hope you find the information helpful.\n\n",

    "content": "I guess the best place to start is the beginning. Well I'm 41 yrs. old and smoked for 26 yrs. 1-2 packs a day. I went to the ddr. about a month ago because of something I coughed up it was a very thick looking substance he said it could be phlegm, but never really looked at it. He said I had acute bronchitis but from what I've read on the internet it wasn't that because I wasn't doing any coughing and didn't have fever etc.He did chest x-rays and said everything was normal. I quit smoking then which has been a little over a month ago and that's when all my problems began. I first had a pain in my chest right below my rib on left side of chest about 2-3 inches from my breast bone, then it was followed by pain in my back from shoulder blade to bottom of my rib cage then that was followed by pain and numbness it's not all the time, and it's usually a dull pain. Now I've started having numbness on right side of chest and back. I have also recently been having a problem of burning when I urinate and having kidney pain. I gave myself an at home uti test and it showed no infection. I have also had numbness occasionally in my throat area between my adams appl and where your neck is attached to your body. If there's anyone here thast can help me it would be very greatly appreciated. I don't know that nicorette gum would have anything to do with the numbness in my throat or not but I've been using it since I quit smoking. If there's anything else I can help with please let me know. Thanks for your help!!\n\n",

Many of the symptoms you describe are related to nicotine systemic effects, like muscular pain and numbness. Also local effects can be seen, like hoarseness, abdominal or stomach pain. I suggest you should check with your doctor to see if any of the symptoms you are having needs special attention. Other side effects may go away during treatment as your body adjusts to the medicine.  Hope you find this helpful\n\n",

    "content": "It does sound as though your problem is in your GI tract and not your lungs although severe reflux can certainly result in some respiratory type symptoms.  You don't mention whether your \"stomach\" doctor has done a procedure called an EGD to get a look at your esophagus, stomach and upper part of your small bowel or whether you are taking medication for the severe reflux.  You mentioned Vioxx so I\"m assuming that you are aware that this medication can cause irritation and even bleeding of the esophagus or stomach.  Often finding the appropriate treatment for a disorder requires perseverance and a good deal of testing.  You should return to the \"stomach doctor\" you have been seeing, who knows your case and make certain that he/she is aware that you are still having troubling symptoms so that you can decide together what the next step in your treatment should be.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for the reply. The original question I  posted to you was by a son for his mother. I am always very sceptical of what doctors prescribe. My mother has been diagnosed with a large tumor in her lung last year.  she was successfully treated with chemo and radiation. and the tumor in the lung disappeared.   Then the  cancer has spread to the brain with two small tumors which caused her dizziness. The tumors were radiated 11 times at 10 minutes over 10 weeks.  Her health has declined tremendously since her last treatment and she sleeps most of the time and is no longer able to care for herself.  Of course the arrival of the new medicine tarceva raises some hopes for her getting better.   Is  there a possibility to try the new drug tarceva  even if no data has been researched or published for small cell.? I could get the medicine from a friend .  I am pretty sure her oncologist doctor would not agree as she is extremly conservative in her approach including not having any room of suggestion or support for  any type of alternative treatment.   What do you think? My mom is 68 and has always been very healthy till last year. Yes, unfortunately she was a smoker till about 3 years ago.  thanks for your input\n\n",

    "content": "This is a great forum, thank you to all the doctors and nurses who give their time.  Ok.  I am a 30 year old female, non-smoker.  I had been having a pain in my right side around my waist so I saw my doctor, who drew blood and took a urine sample.  Actually she only took the urine because I thought she'd want it and I filled the cup just in case.  Turned out I had a kidney infection and a fever, blood was normal so I got antibiotics and was sent on my merry way.  A month later and I still have the pain.  She re-examined me (I'd also had a normal gyno exam in the meantime) and ordered a CT scan.  I got the results today because I called and asked about it, and was told that they didn't find anything that would cause me pain.  It was mostly normal but they found a nodule in my left lung, one on my liver and one on my spleen.  They want me to have another CT in six months to see if they've changed.  Other than that, that's all the info I got from them.  I'm nervous because you can't search on \"nodule\" without finding cancer.  I would like to think that they would have called me right away and ordered more tests sooner if they felt it was something to worry about, but is a \"wait and see\" approach appropriate at this time?  Other than the side pain (I'm starting to examine my diet for clues on that), I have had no problems and feel great.  My doctor just called and said I have nothing to worry about since I'm young and healthy.  She said that most people have little things like this come up in a scan and that they're just imperfections like a mole on your skin, but since the nodules came up in a scan they want to follow up with another to be safe.  The radiologist seems to agree.  Does this sounds right?  Thank you!\n\n",

    "content": "Emilie05, what I understood is that the CT scan was taken because you complaint about a back or lower abdominal pain, which was attributed to a urinary infection, and did not disappeared with medical treatment. The doctors also told you they didn't find anything that would cause you pain. So what they found on the CT scan is called \"incidental finding\"; it is very common to find minor, \"incidental\" structures on CT scans. Is called \"incidental\" when someone goes to the doctor for another reason and they find something else (by chance), that was not bothering.  On screening CT exams, the following types of incidental findings are common: benign nodules or masses that do not cause any symptoms, or small benign tumors that do not grow. Variations of normal anatomic structures (I can have 6 fingers in a hand but I'm not sick). Changes related to surgical operations or from old trauma (scars).  Minimal areas of scarring are not uncommon in the lung, and are often a sequela of prior infections such as pneumonia. Lung granulomas, which are small benign nodules that are caused by certain kinds of old, healed infections, are also very common, specially in the Midwestern United States, including Wisconsin. Most pulmonary nodules have benign causes. In fact, the most common lung tumor is the hamartoma, a benign one. Over 90% of suspected abnormalities seen on screening studies prove to be benign.  Small lesions in the liver are not uncommon, and are typically either simply cysts or hemangiomas. Hemangiomas are benign vascular tumors that can be seen in 10% of the population. Hemangiomas are typically in the 1-2 cm size but can be as large as 5 cm. Simple cysts are also common and are typically several millimeters to several centimeters in size and rarely grow.   Splenic lesions such as hemangiomas or cysts are also common findings. Malignant splenic tumors are rare, so small lesions in the 1-2 cms range are recognized as benign (by definition a nodule is no more than 3 cms in diameter).   At last, the worst case scenario: I find a nodule in the lung, other in the liver, and another one in the spleen; if I suspect it is cancer, I will have to assume that the primary tumor (the one that appeared first) is the lung nodule (by frequency). But, when a pulmonary nodule (3 cm or less) is found in a woman, less than 50 years old, and non-smoker, the chances of cancer are very, very little.  So I think your doctor is right.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  Recently had a chest x-ray finding of \"very minimal nonspecific density in the anteroinfeior tip of lingular segment.\"  Radiologist stated this could be \"fibrosis or fat or peripheral atelectasis.\"  Follow-up x-ray not scheduled for another 6 months.  Doctor is not too concerned but I am.  I am a 44 year-old female smoker.  Went for x-ray because of chronic \"phlegmy\" cough and symptoms of pleurisy.  Is this finding significant?  Shoud I request a sputum test or CT scan intead?  Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for your response Doctor.  My greatest concern about the finding is the reference to Atelectasis. I researched this lung disease and found that tumors that obstruct the airway may lead to Atelectasis.  Consequently, I've made the leap to lung cancer because of my history as a smoker.  I did mention to my physician that I would like a CT scan instead of a follow-up x-ray and he indicated that at this point it would be unnecessary.  Only if the follow-up x-ray revealed a \"change\" in the finding would a CT scan be necessary.  He did mention that about 20% of all chest x-rays come back with findings that are insignificant and that the radiologist is \"obliged\" to mention even the most insignificant findings.  Yet, I fail to see how potential Atelectasis would be considered insignificant.    Finally, would this lung disease affect a PFT?  Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Doctor,  I am having the same symptoms I described in this post back in February.  Specifically, phlegmy cough (greenish sputum) and bad pleurisy pain.    The follow-up x-ray I had was OK.  Subsequently, I had a PFT which showed mild asthma and mild diminshed lung capacity.  Beginning last week, I began to have the same symptoms I described in this post back in February.  Specifically, phlegmy cough (producing greenish sputum) and bad pleurisy pain.   This is the fourth bout of this in twelve months.  My pleurisy always seems to be preceded by a chest cold/cough.  Is pleurisy something that can recur this often and not be serious?  When I saw my Internist back in February he did not precsribe an antibiotic because he said pleurisy (if caused by an infection) is typically viral in nature and not bacterial.  He also stated that greenish phlegm in not always indicitive of an infection.  Is this recurring pleurisy something people just have to live with?  I am taking more than the recommended dosage of Aleve (3-4 tabs a day) for inflammation & pain and also using heat/cold compresses.  Is yet another chest x-ray (3rd in 3 months) necessary or should I request a CT scan or should I just assume this is how my body will always react to a chest cold?  Your thoughts are appreciated.  Thanks! Cindy\n\n",

    "content": "This is posted, like Angela pointed out, a bit late. But just to round the previous answer, I agree with Angela, if you find a pulmonary nodule on CXR, CT or PET scan in a heavy smoker, more than age 50, there is a high propability of cancer. When there is high suspicious of cancer, and/or the nodule is not easy to reach by transthoracic needle biopsy, most thoracic surgeons prefer to go directly to open surgery. If during surgery the diagnosis of cancer is confirmed  then a lobectomy is performed and the lymph nodes in the area are removed. That is the standard procedure for Stage IA non small cell lung cancer (a tumor less than 3 cms without invasion of surrounding tissue, no lymph nodes seen on CT or PET, and no evidence of spread to other organs), which is ,apparently, the type of cancer that, maybe, your father has. If the tumor is completely removed with the lymph nodes, there is no need for radiation or chemotherapy. If complete resection of the tumor cannot be achieved or the lymph nodes are positive,  then further therapy is indicated (radiation and/or chemo).\n\n",

    "content": "I'm not sure if this is the right place to post or not but any help would be appreciated!  I'm 27 years old and have been smoking for 10 years.  I have never smoked cigarette's but I'm afraid I have smoked 5-6 joints every night for the past 10 years thinking they helped me relax and helped me get to sleep, but in actual fact it was just nicotene addiction.  Now I know smoking a joint (due to no filter) is apparantly the same as smoking 3-4 cigarette's...  So I guess I've been quite a heavy smoker for 10 years.  I stopped smoking a week ago after watching a DVD (The Easy Way To Stop Smoking by Allan Carr) I would say gave up smoking, but in fact I haven't actually given anything up (if a smoker thinks they are depriving themselves of something then it only makes it more precious...)  Anyway, I broke the 3 day barrier (the worst bit) and now physical cravings have gone and I know I'll never smoke again.  I'm just worried about the damage I've done to my lungs....  Now I swim regularly and never have any breathing problems, out of breathness etc.  However I know my lung capacity is not what it used to be.  I assumed over the past week I'd cough up the cr*p from lungs due to them cleaning themselves (the body is so remarkable!) but nothing...!  : (  Anyway my main question is there anything I can do (apart from exercise) to speed up the removal of cr*p from my lungs?...  ie. would taking a bronchial dilator help at all?...  Any help appreciated!\n\n",

    "content": "there are a couple options.......... first, you can either cough and deep breath on your own or you can use an incentive spirometer. If you cough and deep breath on your own take a nice breath in, followed by a long breath out...when you are breathing out and feel as if there is no more to give....hold your breath. this may force you to cough, otherwise just cough on your own, a nice big cough. do this as often as you would like. I would recomend every hour while you awake. This may take some time  but you will notice a difference. If you go the Incentive Spirometer route, it has the same effect however it is an actual device that allows you to measure each expiration, that way you can monitor your lung impovement. Good luck to you and Congrats for quitting. One more thing.....smoking pot has different effects on the body than smoking cigarettes. You, my friend, are saving some brain cells...good for you!...................................Angela,RN\n\n",

    "content": "My dad is 73 yrs old and quit smoking 18 years ago. About two months ago, his voice went really hoarse and it was eventually determined that his vocal chord was paralysed. About the same time, an X-Ray showed a spot on his lung. He had a MRI last Friday and we have an appt with a doctor next Wednesday to discuss the results of the MRI. From all I've read, I think this may be lung cancer. I know that there is no way of knowing for sure until we have a biopsy but I feel that I need to be realistic so I can be strong for him. He is so anxious and worried sick. If he didn't have the paralysed vocal cord, I would be more hopeful, but I feel that his two symptoms combined are likely lung cancer. (His other symptoms are anxiety, difficulty breathing, and pain in chest -- but I have to mention that these started after he was told there was a spot on his lung and they may be anxiety-related.)  Does anyone know the likelihood of NON cancerous lung tumors? In other words, would it be ridiculous for us to hope that it's a benign tumor? I really appreciate any feedback. Thanks.  P.S. We are located in Canada, if that makes a difference in terms of treatment, access to medicine, etc. THANK YOU!!\n\n",

I think they say the LU stands for Lung and the P and the E are for the (-platin and Etoposide) drugs?  Anyways, he is doing really well. The tumors have shrunk considerably. We know that they will come back but after this next round of chemo (his fourth and last) he will hopefully have some time to start getting energy back again. But, I know, I know, it is terminal, but we are hoping for a year or two rather than a few months. Only time will tell. He is so tired and weak now. Actually today the doctor said his Nutralites (those  important white blood cells?) are at 0.9 so he will take another week off before doing chemo again so hopefully he will be feeling better when he starts next week. Thank you again for your time. It is so amazing that people like you volunteer your time. Everyone really appreciates it. It's not until cancer touches your life that you realise how many truly special people work in this industry. Regards, Suzanne\n\n",

After a few times of hard coughing I will sometimes bring up phlem (sp?) it started out clear and now is more yellow - not profuse or anything.  I just got my chest xray results today and they are clear - also bloodwork came out normal.  My internist thinks I just have a viral infection and feels a CT scan is not necessary.  I am also having pain in my back between my shoulder blades that is new.  Should I push for a CT scan or just \"relax\" as Dr. has told me and give myself time to get over this viral infection?

    "content": "kwmills, It would be hard for me to interpret your scans over the internet. The whole case should be taken into consideration. The duration between your remission and these findings is very important. The longer the duration the more in favour that this is not cancer. Your symptoms are vital. If you have recently had pneumonia then this could be a result of pneumonia. It seems that your doctor is not certain that this is indeed a recurrence which is why he sent you for a PET scan. This is good news. However, the possibility of recurrence remains and must be ruled out by every means possible. Hopefully the PET scan would clarify everything.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 32 year old female smoker. I have smoked 1/2pack to pack a day since the age of 16. 3 years ago, after my first child I was experiencing chest pains, had an EKG done - normal, so doc sent me for chest xray. Nodule found in lower right lung. I was then sent for CT Scan, doc reported the nodule was scar tissue. Over the course of 2 years I have had 2 additional ct scans with no change in the tissue. Last October I had bronchitis, then in May of this year I had pleurisy. Doc sent me for another xray of my chest to be \"safe\" - reported my xray showed lungs normal. This month I have had an awful non-prductive cough and a recurring bout of pleruisy. On the mend again now. I do have other issues that concern me: leg pain constantly, always tired, and dizziness episodes throughtout the day. I am so worried that I will not be around to take care of my 2 daughters, yet I can't seem to stop smoking. As scared as I am, I think I must have a problem with my brain more so than my lungs.  Can these symptoms I have experienced in the past and currently be more significant than doc seems to say? Can scar tissue be mistaken for tumors on CT scan?  What is best advice for smoking cessation......wellbutrin? Even if I quit now, isn't the damage already done?  Any advice will be much appreciated....\n\n",

Yes, some damage has been done, but the lungs can heal dramatically.  People who continue to smoke, even \"light\" cigarettes or just a few a day end up doing irreperable damage.

    "content": "My dad was diagnosed in October 2004 w/ inoperable Lung Cancer. Stage III. Since the begining of treatment Dad has had horrible, horrible, irregular bouts of hiccups, I've preferred to call it \"a hiccup attack\", his whole body shakes with each \"hiccup\" after another, at times he feared he couldn't catch his breath. They are not normal like you or I would get them, and we've struggled to find a medicine that would continue to work for him. Some would work for a day, maybe two, possibly even a week. But eventually, almost inevitably they return. I can't seem to understand why no one can tell us what this is caused by? In late December he started to feel extremely ill and his stomach started to bloat...he was admited a few days after Christmas and had surgery New Years day. From what I understand it was a large tumor inside his intestines. They do not know where it came from or how long it exsisted? He was released, and continued to live a hiccup free life for a short time....until we continued with the chemo, and again they started. Late last month he was again admitted for the bloating and nausea, and they inserted a tube up his nose down to his stomach t :( o pump out \"the blockage\"....he's home now, and he had his \"last chemo\" treatment yesterday. Could someone please help me make sense of the hiccups and bloating?  :(\n\n",

    "content": "Hi ninafly64, Here is some general information regarding lung cancer and hiccups. Sometimes when lung cancer is present it may metastisize (spread) to other areas of the body. In men, lung cancer may spread to the heart causing malignant pericardial effusion which causes symptoms such as shortness of breath, cough, chest pain, swelling in the upper abdomen, extreme tiredness and weakness, and hiccups. This would be one explaination for the hiccups that you may want to discuss with his physician. If an intestinal obstruction is present from disease, twist in the bowel, etc. this also causes bloating and one of the reasons for the tube down his nose into his stomach was to not only remove gastric contents but to allow the gastrintestinal tract to \"rest\" so the blockage or twist could resolve. Keep in mind that the hiccups alone cause bloating. Some of the medications used for hiccups are thorazine (relieves hiccups in approximately 80% of cases), reglan, valproic acid, phenobarbital, etc. If any of these medications have not been tried, you may also want to discuss this with the physician. Cancer of any type is a difficult disease not only affecting the person who has it but loved ones around them as well. My thoughts and prayers are with you and yours for grace, guidance, and understanding. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

You already know that malignancy is present (lung cancer) There are instances where the cancer spreads to other areas of the body which you and he are probably already aware of. The best suggestion I can make to you is, you and your dad sit down together, write down your questions and concerns. When he returns to the office for an evaluation, present this list. If there is an explaination that you don't understand, stop the conversation and say I don't understand what your saying. Regarding the chemo treatments and his progress, ask an honest question, what is the prognosis or outcome of this disease since chemo has been completed. If it is not terribly much to ask, I hope you have the opportunity to provide an update from time to time with his progress. Take care. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

I spoke with the thoracic surgeon who showed me pictures, and told me the tumors encompass the entire lining...to me it looked like bumps covering the entire lining.  He instilled sterile talc to help with the fluid production which was done in Jan.  She was started on chemo,  Alimta, and cisplatin , her first treatment was 2weeks ago and has another scheduled this upcoming week. Oncologist says this is very rough treatment and that she came through the first treatment very well , is hoping this will help stop fluid buildup thus giving her a \"little longer\".  CXR last week showed small amt of fluid.. O2 sat at rest is 94%..exhausted all the time. lightheaded when she gets up. Mom is ready to give up..says she no longer has any quality of life, and she is only going to die so why bother?   A CT also showed a very small spot on the liver, which basically I am assuming this has spread.I was told the disease \"is advanced\"  Reports not back from Mayo yet so we don't know what type of cells we are dealing with... If she stops the chemo will she have any better quality of life until the meso advances?  Does anyone know what we can expect from here on in?  She doesnt want outside help (she was always a strong independent woman) I have difficulty talking with my dad as he thinks she is going to be around \" a few years\", my friends who are nurses are telling me more like a few months..I don't know how to prepare myself or them..The docs have difficulty really telling her because she gets understandably upset, and I know no one can tell us how long as every patient is different.. Im hoping someone out there can help guide me for what to expect from where we are\n\n",

    "title": "Mesothelioma",
    "content": "Thanks for posting your question here at The Lounge.  Pleural mesothelioma (i.e.- the type that arises from the lining around the lung) can be a difficult cancer to treat.  It is often found when it is advanced.  People with the cancer usually have or do smoke cigarettes, so can have underlying lung disease (such as emphysema) that can complicate treatment.  Cisplatin and Alimta (also called pemetrexed) is one of the best regimens available to treat mesothlioma.  With that said, it does have limited benefit in that more people than not do not have their cancer respond to the treatment. The treatment does have various side effects.  Alimta needs to be given with various vitamin (i.e.- B12 and folate) supplements.  B12 and folate blood levels should be monitored since patients with low levels can have significant toxicity form Alimta.  Cisplatin itself can cause nausea, vomiting, kidney problems, hearing loss, hair loss, fatigue and decreased appetite.  As people get older, they tend to tolerate it less well than younger patients, although if someone is in good medical health otherwise, then cisplatin is usually given.  There ae not a lot of non-surgery options for treating mesothelioma.  If someone has difficulties tolerating cisplatin, then sometimes carboplatin is used since it can have less side effects than cisplatin.  However, we do not know if Alimta works as well with carboplatin as it does with cisplatin.  As mesothelioma grows, it can cause more fluid to build up even it the prior fluid problem was treated with talc powder.  Usually as the cancer grows people's health and overall condition deteriorate.  There can be worsening problems with the affected lung.  Even with treatment, mesothelioma tends to remain \"under control\" from the chemotherapy for a limited period of time.  Unfortunately, survival with mesothelioma tends to be measured in months, not years.  There are certain subtypes of msothelioma that behavemore aggressively than other subtypes.  I wish you Mother the best.  Jeffrey A. Gordon, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Dr. Gordon I wanted to thank you for your information regarding my mom's diagnosis of mesothelioma.  She has had 3 rounds of Alimta and cisplantin..has been rough on her but she seems to be stable at this point, getting back to her old self which is amazing to me.  The oncologist said she is to have 3 more treatments and a cat scan in 2 weeks..says that symptoms are well controlled.  I asked  what happens when this begins to grow again and she stated that mom can take the alimta.   My question : is there any statistics at how long she can remain \"stable\"?  I look at her and think gosh, how can she be dying?  My nurse friends all tell me not to be fooled. But if this chemo interferes with the DNA what happens if you remain on Alimta?  I mean does the cancer  just stop responding to the therapy or change somehow to replicate itself and advance the disease?   Thank you once again for your time. Barbs\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I have been experiencing chest pains now for roughly a couple of months, the pains seem to come from under my lowest rib on the left side of my chest, obviously concerned about this I consulted my GP who prescribe me Pain Killers and told me if was nothing and would more than likly go away in time. Well a few weeks later it hadnt gone away and I was experiencing different symptoms such as pins and needles in my left arm, strange sensations that felt like what i can only descrive as a skipped heartbeat, I sometimes had the feeling i needed to gasp for breathe as If suffocation was occuring. So after numours trips back to my GP and refereals to Hospital I have had serveral ECG's which have come back fine, bloods tests which have come back fine, I have recently had a Barium meal which showed no problems and an Echo-Cardiogram.  The Echocardiogram showed my heart to be fine with no problems to my heart Valves or the size/shape of my heart, and no inflammation. However the Dr. did inform me that there was a liitle more fluid between the heart and the sac the heart sits in than usual.   The Dr told me not to worry about this as it was no major problem, however i am finding it diificult not to worry about this, especially as the sensations and pain are worsening as time go's on. I did a search via Google to see if i could bring up any information relating to the excess fluid situaiton and there were serveral links to Lung Cancer. I was just wondering if I needed to be worring as much as I am about this or not, whould the blood tests i have had show any hint of Cancer or not?? Is this Excess Fluid problem common??  THis is now begining to effect my everday way of life, in the fact it is casuing me sleepness nights and worried days, any advice or answers would be gratefully received and may go as far as easing a confused mind.  Many Thanks  Sean\n\n",

    "content": "I am 41, and was a moderate smoker (sometimes heavy, quit for 6 years, heavy for 2, quit for 3, moderate for 2) and quit for good in January.  In 2003, I went to the doctor because of a palpable mass that was painful when pushed with fingers, right below the end of my right collar bone.  The x-ray showed nothing. I've since moved temporarily to Japan, so have not done further follow-up.   Just this weekend, it seems the pain in my right side chest is constant.  I noticed three or four yellow bruises along my pec that are sensative to touch too, and I wasn't hit or anything.  I don't typically bruise at all.  I've had physical contact with my partner, but nothing violent or aggressive that would have done that, I think.  The pain is dull, not very significant at all, but constant. I'm worried because of my past smoking, my Uncle's death from smoking lung cancer, and my mother's recent death from malenoma.  I had a basal cell carcinoma removed in 2003 from my face.  I have moles all over my body, but none in the specific areas of pain in my chest.  I'd like advice on what to tell the doctors here in Japan at a health check.  I need to have my requests given by a translator.  If this sounds like any OTHER kind of symptom, please refer me to the appropriate people.  Thanks!\n\n",

I was really sick back in June of last year and then I was fine.  I then started to come down with it again in January I went to see my doctor.  I was diagnosed with Plueracy.  I was put on antibotic and ofcourse my inhalers.  The pain was not going away.  I went back and she put me on a steroid.  I was concerned about lung cancer and she told me that she is positive it is plueacy.  I never had an Xray.  Now where I am is that I am so much pain.  My side of my chest hurts when I move.  No longer when I breath and the pain has now taken over my entire back.  Upper and around the neck.  Some days its better than others.  I am scared of lung cancer.  I think that I need to find another doctor but I don't know whot to see.   I am breathing fine, no coughing no phlem just a lot of back pain and right side chest. I have had back trouble before but nothing like this.  The chest pain on the side pretty much feels like a cracked rib but I do not see how that happend, again this pain comes and goes but the back pain is continous.\n\n",

    "title": "To Have a Bronchoscopy or Not?",
    "content": "Here is my question and background information.   My mother's doctor is suggesting a Bronchoscopy after being very adamant that she do nothing that would invade her lungs. More than one doctor has stated that she could NEVER go under any kind of anethesia or anything like that as she would die due to the state of her lungs.   Background:   My mother is 71 years old.   My mother had Uterine Cancer in 1960. Breast Cancer 7 years ago.   My mother has SEVERE Emphezema.   She has 33 1/2% lung capacity. This is the total of BOTH lungs.   3 years ago a spot was discovered on her lung. Small spot that did not have the characteristics of Lung Cancer.   She had a test done each year and the spot had NOT grown or changed in anyway.   1 week ago my mother had her yearly test. This was about 3 days after she just got over a bad cold or Flu which affected her lungs with a lot of coughing and phlem.   The test showed the spot had grown and appeared quite cloudy around it.   The spot STILL does NOT have the shape of Cancer according to the Lung Specialist.   The Lung Specialist said that he is \"Very Concerned\" about the spot. However when asked what the possibilities of it being Lung Cancer were, he stated 50/50.   She is NOT coughing up blood.   She is having NO lung or chest pain.   The Lung Specialist now says that he wants her to undergo a Bronchoscopy despite the Risks. He wishes to get a closer look in the lungs and if he feels it prudent to get a Biopsy.   He says that her Lung could collapse during the procedure. He stated \"I haven't lost a patient yet\". Though he did say that he wasn't real sure that the second lung could carry the load while they got the collapsed lung going again.   -------  My question is this: Do you feel that my mother should go through this?   Is it worth the risks?   Would you advise doing this type of a procedure considering the condition of her lungs at this time?   Should she wait 6 weeks, perhaps 3 months and repeat the test BEFORE undergoing the Bronchoscopy? My thinking there is that if the change in the spot was caused by some lingering affects of her cold or Flu that they may dissapear in the interim.   I might mention that she was coughing a whole lot when she was ill. However, the coughing has decreased considerably in the last week.   Do you feel that this procedure could potenially cause MORE harm than good?   The doctor stated that if it is Lung Cancer that he could NOT operate on her. His only treatment would be Chemo and Radiation.   Therefore is this procedure even necessary?   I guess basically... what I'm saying is that there seems to be a whole lot of risks with this even for a person with HEALTHY lungs. My mom is far, far from having \"Healthy\" lungs. It scares me to think that this procedure could actually kill her.   At this point in time, to me at least, I'm thinking that she should not do it. That she should just continue to have it checked every few weeks.   If you have any thoughts, suggestions, advise, etc on this, I sure would appreciate it. She is going to cancel her appointment for Monday. I would like to give her something to go on from another Physician to help her make her final decision.   If I have writen to the wrong section or the wrong Physician, could you please pass this on to the right person or section.   Thank you very much for your time.   I look forward to hearing from you.   PPole\n\n",

Based on the information you have provided I do not think she should undergo bronchoscopy. My reasons are: lung cancers do not wait for 3 years, benign lung tumors do not turn malignant, the image results are not conclusive and if it were lung cancer the best treatment would be supportive care. Radio and chemotherapy are too hazardous and do not provide significant survival benefit. So I would assume that the best option would be to follow up after 3 months. I think you should seek the opinion of a medical oncologist. Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Last week I was Dxed with Hypertrophic Osteoarthropy. I have had three negative Chest xrays in last year and in Dec 04 had a negative Chest CT. It did show moderate emphysema and a pre tracheal node of 1 cm. .  I had PFTs done which showed mild obstruction but my DCO was only 33 per cent of expected and my DXLO/VA was only 59 per cent of expected.  FVC was 91 % and FEV1 was 79%.  MY TLC was 84 per cent.  O2 at rest is 96 and dropped to 93 with walking 600 feet.   I have read that 88 per cent of HOA is caused by LC.  What else could be causing it? What tests should they be ordering now?    I have never read a case history of HOA being caused by emphsema, so I am not convinced this is what is causing it.  I am afraid that they wont order more testing.  Is there any way to treat it IF is is caused by emphysema?  I have had clubbing for at least two years and the burning pain and arthralgia intermittantly for a year.  I did quit smoking two years ago. I am 49. Very worried and in a great deal of pain. The pain is a burning pain almost throughtout my body. I take 2400 mg of nuerontin.  Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "First let me say that I am so frustrated at this point.  I will try to explain in a timeline.  I began gaining weight approximately 1 1/2 years ago.  I have never had a problem with my weight.  I have gained 50 pounds to date and I weight 170 pounds.  I am 5' 4\" tall.  The most I ever weighed was when I was pregnant and that was 140.  I have went from a six 3 to a size 16 in pants.  I have had increasing muscle weakness in mostly my left arm but now also my right.  I am extremely tired all the time.  In June of this year I woke up one day in extreme pain around my chest and back.  I went to the emergency room and they diagnosed pneumonia with pleurisy.  I had no symptoms until this day.  I took 3 courses of antibiotics and finally started to feel better, although I still have pain through my back.  I have developed a hump in my upper back and all my weight gain in in my middle section and back, and I have developed \"jowls\" now.  I wake up 3 or 4 times a night with night sweats.  My doctor ordered another catscan in July to follow up the June diagnosis which still showed pneumonia but this time a 3mm nodule was noted in my right lung.  A complete PFT was ordered which I didn't do so well on and carbon gases were low.  She referred me to a pulmonologist.  He ordered another catscan which was done this week.  This one shows the 3mm nodule is now 5mm and there is now another nodule on my left lung which is also 5mm.  He also said that I have fluid build up around my lungs which is what is probably causing my pain in my back.  I get very very short of breath very easily.  I have always been somewhat active.  I don't exercise on a routine but I do walk daily and I hike very frequently.  Along with climbing stairs all day etc.  I have started to have a hard time falling asleep even though I am extremely tired and the night sweats are getting worse.  I have had a couple of sharp pains through my low back and when I eat I get full very easily.  I have been coughing up blood since June, although now it is only once or twice a week.  I am so frustrated about this weight gain.  Doctor order cortisol and dhea.  Cortisol was normal but dhea was twice the normal level.  She has not ordered anything else.  I don't know what else to do.  Any advice would be appreciated.  Thank you so much in advance.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Kathy0824, Although you did not mention anyone of your doctors suggesting that this may be cancer of the lung you have posted your question in this forum. Several things are important in my opinion. First the innappropriate weight gain should have been investigated earlier; second, pneumonia in an otherwise previously healthy person should not only be treated but an underlying cause should be sought. I cannot judge whether lung cancer is a clinical possiblity or not because i have not seen any of your investigations or had the chance to examine you directly. Given the information you provided here, I would want to rule out lung cancer before anything else.  Several criteria support ruling out lung cancer: 1. Family history suggests increased risk of cancer and the possibilty of hereditary types of cancer. 2. Lung nodules and unexplained pneumonia and effusion and coughing of blood could all be a manifestation of lung cancer. Especially that they are growing in size. 1. Weight gain could be a manifestation of something called paraneoplastic syndrome which could be seen in small cell lung cancer.  You are advised to seek the help of an oncologist as soon as possible. Please update your information here as we are concerned about how your condition will turn out.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for replying doctor.  I posted here because it had to do with the lungs.  I went to my doctor before the pneumonia incidence about my weight gain.  She gave me bontril to take 3 times a day, which I did faithfully for one month and I gained an additional 4 pounds during that month.  I recorded my diet and total caloric intake is under 1000 calories a day at most.  Many days I don't eat but I drink a lot of water and I also drink ensure.  She just tells me it is because I am getting older.  Of course I don't believe that a person gains 50 pounds in less than 2 years at the age of 34.  I pulled out pictures of myself and what a difference.  I have asked her about hormones but she said she doesn't think that is what it is.  I asked her to run the cortisol and dhea.  When the cortisol came back normal, she dismissed it and she told me she didn't know what to do with the dhea being twice the normal limits.  The pulmonologist she sent me to called yesterday and I have a bronchoscopy scheduled for monday.  He told me he is not really concerned about the nodules that sometimes people just have them and they are not a problem.  He did say that he is perplexed though about the pleural effusion and the coughing up blood.  I only cough up small amounts now and it is only once or twice a week.  It was several times a day.  The funny thing is though, that would be the only time I coughed, to bring up the blood.  I don't cough otherwise.  The extreme fatigue is what has me drained and the pain in my back through my shoulder blades.  Doctor says that is where the fluid is.  The one thing that has me scared is the fact that in just a few months another nodule was noted on the other lung.  I don't feel like the doctors listen to me and that is frustrating.  My grandmother died of lung cancer.  And every female in my family on my mothers side has had uterine or ovarian cancer before the age of 25, my mother included with uterine cancer.  Breast cancer has also been prevalent and I had breast lumps removed 2 times that were precancerous.  I have taken it upon myself to order a hormone test through a lab.  I ordered estradiol, testosterone and another dhea-s.  The shortness of breath is getting worse.  I just feel very frustrated right now.  I have been telling the doctors for about a year now about this stuff and they tell me to exercise more and send me home.  Any suggestions on what else I can do?  And I have a question,  this is what the most recent catscan said on my chest: \"A stable 5 mm nodule in the lateral aspect of the right upper lobe.  Partial resolution of the faint posterior infiltrates of both lungs which may represent atelectasis.  No new infiltrates appreciated.

    "content": "\"A stable 5 mm nodule in the lateral aspect of the right upper lobe. Partial resolution of the faint posterior infiltrates of both lungs which may represent atelectasis. No new infiltrates appreciated. A new 5 mm nodular density left upper lobe superior lingular segment. Partial reduction of bilateral posterior infiltrates or fibrosis compared to prior exam.\"   A stable (no change since previous measurements) nodule 5mm in size situated in the outer aspect of the right upper lung. Certain lesions that appear as tiny dots (infiltrates) in the back of both lungs have partially gone away, this maybe caused by lung tissue collapse (atelectesis). No new such lesions seen. A new lesion that appears to be formed of nodules is about 5mm in size and is located in the upper superior part of the lingula (a middle portion in the left lung). Partial reduction of the dotted lesions in the back of both lungs or fibrosis compared to prior exam.   This CAT scan report is more suggestive an infection than a tumor. However, I think you will benefit alot from the bronchoscopy. They will of course take a biopsy from any suspicious lesions.   Please let me know how things turn out.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "title": "Risk of minor (possible) asbestos exposure",
    "content": "With regards to asbestos-related lung cancers such as mesothelioma, how common are minor residential exposures?  I live in an older house which  contains asbestos.  I've had some ongoing water damage problems periodically which have caused minor damage, separating paint from wallboard and plaster and dripping very small amounts of water into carpeting.  This damage is very localized (less than one square foot), none of the underlying material appears to have disintigrated or become damaged, and only a very small amount (a few ounces at most) of water has drained into the carpet.  Essentially, my question is this:  Since presumably any asbestos the water picked up would become airbone when the water dries, how much asbestos exposure is cause for concern?  Obviously I'm working to correct the underlying problem, but it just dawned on me that this process is probably causing minute amount of asbestos fibers to become airborne.  All the stories I've heard about asbestos-related cancers and diseases deal with occupational exposures, but is disease relating to minor exposure as common?  Thank you very much for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello AaronMH, This is a very difficult question to answer really. Occupational Safety and HealthAdministration (OSHA) has set exposure limts for thw workplace:  \"Employee exposure to asbestos must not exceed 0.1 fiber per cubic centimeter (f/cc) of air, averagedover an 8-hour work shift. Short-term exposure must also be limited to not more than 1 f/cc, averaged over30 minutes. Rotation of employees to achievecompliance with either permissible exposure limit (PEL) is prohibited.\"  As you can see it is very difficult to apply this to the residential setting. But you can also tell from the quote above that even short term exposure can be hazardous.  I did some research on the internet for precautions to be taken when dealing with possible asbestos exposure at home and came up with this interesting link: click here!  You can also call the OSHA for more advice on this matter toll-free at this number: (800) 321-OSHA (6742).   Hope this helps.\n\n",

One more question - when oncologists or pulmonologists diagnose a patient with an asbestos related cancer, does it generally match the patient's lifestyle as far as their past occupation/location/risk factors?  In other words, are there times where a diagnosis of asbestosis or mesothelioma comes from \"out of the blue\"?\n\n",

The diagnosis of any cancer in the lungs or pleura is suspected by signs in a chest scan and then confirmed by pathology. The risk of developing asbestos related mesothelioma or lung cancer is increased dramatically in smokers. In some, mesothelioma is diagnosed without an apparant association with asbestos.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Lainie,  i am not an oncologist but i can try to help you understand simple things.  i am not sure about your previous calcium level but a high calcium can be caused by recurrence of cancer. In cases of lung cancer, a high calcium is associated with a specific type, so if a patient has lung cancer and high calcium, the bets are high that the patient has this specific type of lung cancer. To be able to interpret the results in the context of your case, i should have previous results of your calcium levels.  Regarding pulmonary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy, this is growth of the bones around the ankles and wrist and it is present in cases of what is known as chronic toxemia, so it is not specific to cancer but can be caused by other things such as lung infection (an abscess for instance). But if found in patient, it should trigger looking for cancer as it can be caused by it. The areas affected are painful and tender on touch.

They give chemo and radio therapies together most probably in your uncle's case as a part of palliative therapy so that he has less symptoms secondary to the cancer and its growth, but unfortunately, he will most probably experience side effects of both chemo and radio therapies as well.  He also has the choice of not receiving any treatment because i think that in your uncle's case, treatment is not going to change the outcome. So, he can choose to receive pain medications if he has pain, medications to relieve shortness of breath when he experiences that and so forth.

    "content": "Dear Jukhurrum,  The ct scan interpretation is consistent with a lung mass that is most probably a malignant tumour.   A biopsy is needed though to confirm the nature of this mass, if your father does not have any other signs of disseminated malignancy anywhere else (so at that time the biopsy is not needed) and he is fit enough to have it done.   Though, i am not an oncogist, if the mass proves to be malignant, i think treatment will depend on the nature of the cancer itself and whether or not it is disseminated to other organs in the body. It looks that on the ct scan, there could be an indication that there already is lymph node involvement. Your father needs a ct scan of the head and abdomen, if he has not already had them.

    "content": "Dear Jukhurrum,  From the ct scan results, the mass is close to the lower bronchus and there is consolidation as well, so, the mass is most probably obstructing the bronchus by protruding into it or at least very close to it, so it is amenable to biopsy by using the bronchoscope, so this is a good step.  Blood tests to test are divided into  1. General:     a. Present in all types of inflammation and malignancy.     b. Examples include erythrocyte sedimentation rate and c-reactive protein. 2. Specific (also sometimes known as tumour markers):     a. Specific cancers produce specific substances in the blood.     b. Examples include psa for prostate cancer.  Regarding lung cancer, i can not really think of a specific tumour marker, but you have to put in mind that i am not an oncologist.

    "content": "Hospice care can do a lot for a patient with an end-stage disease or cancer.  It can also be a big help to the family.  Hospice is available to be of service 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  However, Hospice is not in the patient's home all the time.  Hospice care does requirethe  family to be part of the care.  For my patients, most of the them wish to be at home and their families wish for them to be at home.  Sometimes, if the care is too much at home, a nursing or Hospice facility can be of help.  I would talk with your Father-in-law's Hospice nurse about what homecare services are covered by Hospice.  Unfortunately, not all services are covered.  It is important that your Father-in-law receive his pain medications safely.  Too little, and the pain will not be controlled.  Too much, and side effects will occur.  The Hospice program will have a good talk with you about what services your Father-in-law needs and what services he may be needing in the near future as the mesothelioma progresses.  My experience with Hospice care has been a positivie one.  It is a great help to my patients and their families.  Jeffrey A. Gordon, M.D.[/img]\n\n",

    "content": "My husband's oncologist erred in writing the Etoposide prescription for his second treatment session for small cell limited lung cancer, writing a prescription for 3 pills for 2 days instead of what he was supposed to get#6 pills for 2 days.  Dr. said \"maybe it's a blessing in disquise and will keep the blood levels balanced for the next treatment.\"  Sounds like a casual reaction.  We're worried and scared about it since this form of cancer is fast growing and fast moving.  Is she just covering her rear or is this no big deal?\n\n",

    "content": "I understand your concern regarding what you mentioned about the etoposide chemotherapy pills.  I am not trying to avoid answering your question, but since I am not privy to your husband's lung cancer case and I am not participating in his care, I am not able to answer fully your question.  In situations such as you describe, I would recommend that you speak further with your husband's Medical Oncologist.  That way, you can make your concerns known in full and have a discussion about them.  There are different versions of using etoposide chemotherapy in treating small-cell lung cancer.  This includes not just using the etoposide IV or oral, but evenat different doses and over different number of days.\n\n",

    "content": "Lanousha,   I have read your post about your lung cancer. Could you provide more information? How many lesions in the brain were removed? Were they all removed? What is the status of your lung cancer outside of the brain? Is is growing or not?   Standard treatment of brain metastases from the lung is to seriously consider neurosurgical resection. This cannot be done all of the time. If the lesions are too large, if they are in delicate areas of the brain that surgery might cause permanent brain dysfunction, or if the lesions are too multiple in number, then surgery cannot be done. If a lesion is removed, then whole brain radiotherapy is given. A recent study presented at a national Radiation Oncology meeting has shown that using stereotactic radiosurgery after whole brain radiotherapy can be of even better benefit than using just whole brain radiotherapy alone, in select situations. The concern about just doing surgery without any follow-up radiotherapy is that any microscopic disease near where the surgery was done will grow and that further surgeries cannot be done, and that other areas of the brain may harbor microscopic disease and these areas can grow. As cancer grows in the brain, neurologic problems can develop. My best to you.\n\n",
