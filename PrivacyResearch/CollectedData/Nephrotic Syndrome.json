    "title": "Vasculitis condition- Who to see, OB/gyn? Nephro? Derma?",
    "content": "Hello,  I'd appreciate if a medical professional can advise me which doctor should I see to consult my condition. This might not be the best forum to post this but I'm hoping someone can advise me what to do.  I am 28 years old, just arrived in US last Feb 2009 and had a history of kidney infection and UTI back home, although not much of skin problems.  Currently, i am experiencing a recurring vasculitis in my lower body. I first had this last winter of 2009. The derma diagnosed it as vasculitis, or inflammation of blood vessels, without even explaining to me what caused it. This recent appearance of my vasculitis (for 3 weeks now) appeared immediately after I had few infected insect bites (I think bed bug or mites) in my legs. My infected bites already healed but i notice the rashes are not fading away, instead it is worsening and starting to get itchy.   I am worried that the burning itch will wake me up again in the middle of the night like the last time I had it. But I am most worried of the cause of this vasculitis. I am worried that it might be something internal, or a system disorder (God forbids!). That is why I want to see the right specialist/doctor. I am looking at 3 possible causes: Viral infection due to my infected insect bites, kidney problem/renal problem, or a form of infection from my recent miscarriage.  In June 2010, I had a miscarriage in my 8th week, but did not have to undergo any procedure since I was said to have had a spontaneous miscarriage. About two weeks after, I felt a burning sensation while urinating, which I believed was UTI. I opened these conditions to my Obgyn during my last visit. OB advised a urinalysis. OB said shes gonna call me if they find something alarming from any of my blood test results and urine tests. I was not called since then so I believe I was fine, this was sometime July 2010.   Until now, two months after my miscarriage, I have not had my period back yet, and I started feeling a lump and mild pain in the left side of my tummy, that part which hurt most when I had my miscarriage contractions.   Please advise whether I should see an OB/Gyn, or a Nephrologist, or a Dermatologist.   Would appreciate any suggestions.  God bless you!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,The information you have given other than diagnosis of vasculitis is too little to give you a proper answer,yet I assume you have a cutaneous vasculitis,from the present episode details.Vasculitis can range from a single organ involvement to multiple organ failures.Cutaneous vasculitis could involve small or bigger vessels.This is an inflammation of blood vessels caused either by viruses,drugs,inflammatory disease(Mainly connective tissue disorders),malignancy(2%),and cause unknown(50%).Special mention is to be made about hepatitis B and C with some forms of vasculitis associated with cryoglobulins.While pulmonary,renal and other system vasculitis may be difficult to identify dermatologists can easily identify the skin lesions due to visual appearance.While ordinary urticaria rash do not leave behind pigmentation these do. Aso the red rashes are palpable(Palpable purpura).High ESR,hypo complementemia,Posive ANA,hematuria are some of laboratory features. Most important will be to rule out systemic involvement.If there is nothing it can be tackled with out much problem.A doctor with internal medicine specialization would be ideal to consult. Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 15 year old male. I was diagnosed with minimal change disease when I was 6 and still currently have the condition. I have bubbles in my urine, ranging from a medium large amount to an extremely large frothy mass sometimes, but there has always been bubbles in my urine for about the last 9 months (maybe a little more I'm not sure). What's interesting though is that I'm currently in remission. I test my urine with the dipstick and it comes up negative for protein. I am currently taking 1000mg of mycophenate myfotil twice a day and have been on cellcept for the past 2 and a half years. (mycophenate myfotil is the same thing as cellcept I suppose, because recently those are the pills I have been getting in the prescription. I am extremely active, being a three sport athlete. I train heavily, including weight trainging, calisthenics, and an assortment of sprints and cardio. I'm not sure if maybe that could affect anything. I don't drink or smokeat all. I'm not sure why my urine is so frothy sometimes, although it seems to increase in frothiness the morning sfter I have been in cold conditions while inadequately dressed, which worries me that it could be connected to my condiition. Sometimes in the morning I wake up feeling slightly swollen around the eyes, but I could just be overworrying. Could you help me out?\n\n",

A little over a year ago i stopped going to my doctor and stopped taking the medication in fear that it was making me sicker. It seemed like all my symptopms went away including thank god the adema. I just moved and i don't have a doctor and have to work on getting my insurence back. I have not had a period since jan i have taken two home pregnency test the first was a few days before my period in jan so it came so i was not longer scared besides the fact that it was negative. And i also took an ept test a few weeks back i took it all wrong by drinking a huge amount of water so i don't know if that affected but i don't think im pregnent because even though my period was irregular that month it still came. So what i really want to know is \"Can I be going into renal failure without any symptoms beside mentration issues\". Because besides that and a few headaches and once in a while some nausea I am ok.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  Well the good news is there is nothing bad that jumps out from all the tests. This is promising. As to what might be causing it, yes, possibly thin membrane disease or some equally obscure problem. However, while I am not especially knowlegeable in the field of nephrology, I have to ask you this: are you, by any chance, a serious runner? The reason I ask is this is often seen in people who run, and is then attributed to literal \"bouncing\" or \"pounding\" of the kidneys. If you're not a runner then that becomes a moot issue, but it should be ruled in/out first. If the answer is no, then  you probably will need to be followed for thin membrane disease, but complications from this are fairly rare.   I hope this is helpful.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi.  I am 22 and generally healthy.  Since fall of 2007, though, I have had bubbly/foamy urine on a pretty regular basis.  Also, sometimes I only urinate a little bit of liquid, though that seems consistent with my intake of fluid.  When this first began happening, I went and saw my doctor.  He did a dipstick test, said it had tested positive for protein (and didn't get into specifics), but said something about that not always being right.  The only other thing he did was schedule a kidney ultrasound for me.  The ultrasound was normal.  A few months into 2008, I saw another doctor, who actually had my urine sent out for urinanalysis.  He said that no protein was traced at all and that the related blood work he had sent for (including kidney function) was all fine.  He told me not to worry unless I have other concerning symptoms.  The bubble/foam problem still persists today and I am wondering if there are ever any cases where this just happens and doesn't mean anything.  The fact that the ultrasound and more recent tests came back clean seems encouraging to me, but since the bubbles/foam have not gone away, I'm wondering if I should be looking into this further.  Thank you for your help.  I appreciate everything that the doctors and nurses on this site do to help people.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Scooter5052,  Foamy urine is often a sign that there is protein in the urine.  If this is persisting I would recommend that you see your doctor again for a repeat urinalysis to look for protein.  Protein spilling can be intermittent.  If, by chance, the formal urinalysis simply missed the protein spilling, a repeat may help determine if protein is present.    If there is still concern,  seeing a nephrologist may be helpful.

I have read a little about adrenal crisis and adrenal insufficiency which may occur due to abrupt withdrawal of prednisone.

Patients may experience lightheadedness or dizziness, weakness, sweating, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, or even loss of consciousness or may even lead to death.'   My question is Can adrenal crisis or adrenal insufficiency occur while someone is still on prednisone (if it does then in what prednisone dose range it can occur) ? or adrenal crisis or adrenal insufficiency can only occur when someone is completely off prednisone?  thankyou very much  kind regards\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Munda_kamaal,  This is an excellent question.  When one is taking prednisone it suppresses the normal release of steroids from the adrenal glands.  Basically the glands see the exogenous prednisone and determine that more is not needed.  It takes the adrenals a little bit of time to recover from this so anyone that is on long term prednisone should be slowly weaned off it.  At higher doses, adrenal crisis really doesn't occur because the steroid is there.  It can occur when the prednisone dose is abruptly stopped or when it is very low and not sufficient enough to cover stress.  If the wean has been slow this is pretty unlikely to occur.  If you are beginning to wean down your prednisone for your nephrotic syndrome I would recommend you ask your doctor to review this with you to be sure you are on a nice, slow taper to prevent adrenal problems.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Testing the urine for protein during an illness can most definitely cause it to become positive.    With the elevated blood pressure and protein in your urine I would suggest that you see your doctor for another test once your illness has subsided.  Home urine protein testing can be done by using protein dip sticks (I think they can be bought over-the-counter) but given your BP issues also it is a good idea to follow up with your doctor.  There are several \"incidental\" reasons for your findings such as most people have a slightly higher blood pressure when a little anxious for some reason (often referred to as white-coat syndrome).  It is quite likely that you are well but best to be sure.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for the details (protein dip sticks) and I appreciate your added info.  I have been drilling the internet for this issue and am aware of the wide array of potential causes for proteinuria and I'm surmizing my cause to be diet, but mostly  a result of a tooth infection I have ignored for nearly a year as it seemeded to have been clearing up until recently when I began noticing what seems to be my kidneys have become a bit sore or achy at times, that and my blood pressure has been elevating, and even some chest discomfort, all I attribute to chronic infection (which today I obtained a script for 500 mg amoxicillian), plus I'm scheduling a general anesthia extraction asap.  I feel much better with the Doxazosin and Amoxcillian, but one of my two biggest concerns are that I clear up my urine so that that my likely (to be prescribed) 24 hour sedimentation test and/or the albumen blood workup DO NOT result in any 'unfit for work' prognosis.  I am immediately seeking medical treatment (tooth extraction) and exam/testing, plus in the interim I plan on trying an ACE inhibitor as well as water pills, but as I am also taking 4 mg Doxazosin (soon increasing that to 8 mg), I am unaware if the inhibitors are avaialble over the counter (and what if any effects one might cause with the Doxazosin and Amoxicillian).  I would greatly appreciate any added comment towards my obtaining a 'fit for work' prognosis.\n\n",

    "title": "Pneumaturia",
    "content": "Hello,  Bubbles in urine can be caused by the presence of excess protein in urine or it may also be something as simple as a forceful flow of urine that could make a foamy type of appearance due to excess trapping of air in urine as it contacts water. You will not be able to tell just by appearance.  This can however be established using a dipstick test for urinary protein or a simple urine analysis. For a more precise measurement, you may need to collect urine for 24 hours (microalbumin study - positive between 30 - 300 mg albumin per day).   Diabetes maybe associated with excess protein in urine.  On the other hand, passing actual air bubbles in the urine, is very rare - a condition known as pneumaturia. It is most often caused by a fistula between the bladder and the colon, usually as a result of a diverticular abscess, Crohn's disease or cancer of the colon, bladder or female genitalia.   I would recommend a visit to the doctor's office to evaluate your pain and maybe do a few tests.  Best regards,\n\n",

Creatinine is a substance that is produced by the muscles. Creatinine levels are related to the muscle mass of the person. If the person has a small muscle mass then his creatinine will be low (and this is absolutely normal for him/her). Also, if the person has a big muscle mass, his creatinine could even be higher than normal (and this would be absolutely normal for this person).  So, it looks that you have more muscle mass than your wife.  Once more, thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.

Are my impressions correct? 2.  Can the foam in urine be caused by some benign process or is it always the case that kidney disease is involved.  The reason I ask is because some people mentioned that they have foamy urine but their urine protein tests come back negative. 3.  I've had some foam in my urine for as long as I can remember, so how much foam is too much?  Thank you very much.\n\n",

Is your urine a normal yellow color? Any swelling? A urinalysis and a microalbumin study (24 hour urine collection) are a couple of easy methods to determine kidney function. If these tests came back normal then I wouldn't give it much concern at this time. It may be something as simple as a forceful flow of urine that could make a foamy type of appearance.

    "content": "Hi Vicki, Hydronephrosis is defined as a dilation of the renal pelvis and calyces. This happens in response to the interruption of the flow of urine. That is, once something obstructs the flow of urine the backpressure causes the expansion of the ureter (hydroureter) and the kidneys (hydronephrosis).  Causes of this condition are many, basically anything that obstructs the outflow of urine either from inside such as kidney stones (common) and blood clots, tumors etc... or from outside such as lymph node enlargement or tumors or even pregnancy compressing the ureter from outside.  A search for a possible cause is mandatory. This would require other imaging modalities such as pyelography and or magnetic resonance imaging.  Prognosis and outcome depends on the cause and the delay in receiving proper therapy which may include surgical relief of obstruction. You must be referred to a urologist asap. Any delay can lead to irreversible loss of renal function.   Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Sran, Treatment of nephrotic syndrome depends primarily on the cause, however, it frequently involves the use the glucorticoids given over long periods of time. Especially in cases of minimal change disease. Here the role of steroids is to suppress the autoimmune basis for this disease. The use of cytotoxic agents maybe required in some cases (e.g. cyclophosphamide). Dietary salt control, treatment of hypertension and hypercholestrolemia is also recommended. ACE inhibitors, in addition to controlling blood pressure have also been found to decrease the protein loss. Diuretics may help control the edema and the hypertension.\n\n",
