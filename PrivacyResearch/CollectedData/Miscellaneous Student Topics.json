    "title": "Benefits to Measuring Blood Pressure in the Carotid Artery?",
    "content": "Hello, I am an electrical engineering graduate student, and I have been solicited to design a noninvasive means of measuring blood pressure at the carotid artery.  I understand there are accuracy benefits, given the proximity to the heart, but as near as I can tell the sensors will have to be at the end of a pencil-like rod to get at the artery, and achieve just the right applanation to get an accurate pressure measurement without affecting the pressure very much.  But my question, is what are the medical benefits to measuring the blood pressure at the carotid artery as opposed to the radial or brachial artery?  Can it help in earlier detection of heart disease or strokes?  Are there some papers you can direct me to?  I've found a few biomedical papers, but none articulating a clear need for such a device.    Before I throw myself into this topic, or start applying for grants, I just want to make sure I would be working on a device that would be helpful to the medical community.  Thank you very much for all your assistance, ~V.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,While noninvasive measures to study the carotid artery function are in the form of Doppler as non invasive methodologies certain factors are to be borne in mind while selecting the carotids to study blood pressure.Ageing and the loss of elasticity acquired during hypertension,inability to hold the blood volume,the baro- receptor sensitivity at the carotid sinus all have to be borne in mind. \"Arterial alterations with aging and high blood pressure.

    "content": "Hi, With the exception of perhaps a cardiac arrest scenario, in routine blood pressure monitoring in clinical settings(including critical care), \"absolute\" blood pressure (systolic, diastolic or mean blood pressure) readings are not to be relied upon excessively. More important than the site of recording or the actual blood pressure value, is the \"change\" in the value in real time - what is known as \"TRENDING\" , is the most useful information to be gleaned from monitoring. This holds good for most parameters in monitoring. The critical questions while monitoring are, \"what is the \"trend\" like? Is it showing an increasing trend or is it decreasing, or remaining steady?\" Absolute readings are only of secondary value.  In the cardiac arrest scenario however, while external cardiac compressions are on-going, the critical question is the blood pressure in the coronary arteries (blood supply to the heart) and the carotids(the blood supply to the brain).Your proposed technique may find an application in this context to assess the efficacy of the cardiac compressions(external cardiac massage). Good luck!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: what field deals with chemical exposure?",
    "content": "Hi, I will confine my answer only to your question regarding the adverse effects of  breathing Teflon fumes in an industrial set up.To say that this is a highly charged and controversial topic is an understatement.  Invented at DuPont's Jackson Laboratory in 1938, Teflon\u00ae (registered trademark of DuPont's)- a resin, is a fluoropolymer polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). Ammonium salt of  the perfluorinated compound, perfluoroctanoic acid (PFOA) or C-8 is used as a surfactant in the emulsification process during manufacture of PTFE.   In its polymer form, PTFE is non-toxic and physiologically inert, but upon heating, PTFE resin generates polymer fumes. As temperatures rise, the pyrolysis of Teflon has been seen to occur. releasing pyrolytic gases, that are known to cause respiratory problems (temporary flue-like symptoms, known as \"polymer fume fever\" in industrial workers, with symptoms such as chest pain, dyspnea, and cough. Typically the fluoropolymer starts to degrade above 500\u00b0F. Fumes are not typically given off until the fluoropolymer starts to melt (660\u00b0F-according to Dupont).   A relatively rare but severe lung condition is acute pulmonary edema, due to inhalation of pyrolytic products of PTFE, although few cases have been reported in the literature. (Lewis C, Kerby G. An epidemic of polymer fume fever. J Am Med Assoc 1965; 191: 103\u2013106)  It is well known that facial birth defects in the new born, an effect observed in experimental studies on the effects of PTFE on rats, occurred with the children of two out of seven female DuPont employees from the Washington Works facility from 1979\u20131981. DuPont did not accept any liability from the alleged \u2018toxicity\u2019 of PFOA based on their studies.  DuPont had conducted human experiments with Teflon-laced cigarettes in their employee volunteers. Nine out of ten who smoked 0.4 milligrams of Teflon developed \u201cPolymer Fume Fever\u201d. (Clayton JW. 1967. Fluorocarbon toxicity and biological action. In Fluorine Chemistry Reviews. 1(2),197-252).  Dupont\u2019s studies indicate that breathing Teflon fumes at high concentrations for a full workday is equivalent to 0.4 milligrams of Teflon  per cubic meter of air over eight hours exposure.   DuPont employees are required to wear respiratory protection. As early as 1962 the company required their workers to wear respirators when working with Teflon heated at or above 400 \u00b0F in poorly ventilated areas.  (Zapp JA. 1962. Toxic and health effects of plastics and resins. Arch. Environ. Health, 4, 335. 1962).  There is also consistent evidence on associations with higher cholesterol and uric acid in people exposed to higher levels of PFOA. Whether or not these potential effects result in an increase in cardiovascular disease is unknown.   As far as your industrial setup is concerned, you need to only look into the prevailing work culture (work hours, availability of respiratory protection, level of awareness of risks involved among workers, presence or absence of surveillance mechanisms to identify toxicities early and to monitor of levels of toxic products in fumes, quality of ventilation in the work place, just to name a few). Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, mikeytuna,  You have posed an interesting question.  When first introduced into cookware, there were many complaints that it made people sick.  There have been multiple studies and evaluations of Teflon, and there has been no evidence that it is injurious to health under normal circumstances.  Teflon is used in body piercings due to its flexibility and compatibility with the human body.  Teflon grafts are used to replace arteries in vascular diseases when a suitable vein isn't available.  In tests, Teflon is stable and non-toxic.  Fumes of many ordinary cooking oils have been measured as more toxic than the fumes from cooking with Teflon.  However, there is an exception:  when Teflon is heated above 500 degrees Fahrenheit, it begines to deterioriate.  At 662 degrees F, the fumes can be lethal to birds and may cause flu-like symptoms in humans.  Based on this information, if your work does not involve heating Teflon above 500 degrees F, there is no known health risk.  Good luck to you!\n\n",

    "content": "Your question is an excellent one, and continues to be debated to this day.  Doctors are learned professionals.  They are experts in whatever medicine they practice.  Some are more charming than others.  If a doctor has bad bedside manner, that does not mean that the doctor is inferior as far as his skills to maintain and restore your health as a patient.  Doctors also strive to delay the progression of any chronic illness you may have- usually by utilizing pharmacological therapy, and monitoring this therapy.  Doctors do in fact have ethical obligations and legal duties as they care for you as one of their patients. They have to apply standards of care, and any treatment they offer or apply to you as a patient must be reasonable and necessary.  Yet unfortunately, many visits with a doctor are brief and to the point.  So most patents do not form what may be viewed as a relationship with their health care provider.  Most visits between the doctor and patient are simply situational acquaintances, at best.  Finally, keep in mind that doctors are very objective, and rely on their objectivity to practice medicine with quality,  Dan Abshear\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Just like any other profession, there are good doctors and not so good doctors.  I know for a fact there are many who care about their patients very much, who establish ongoing communication and eduction programs with them.  The doctors here are volunteers - they don't have to take time for this kind of help but they do.  This is evidence of some very caring medical professionals who want to reach out to people around the world.    It is important to have a trusting relationship with your doctor so sometimes a little shopping is in order to find that right fit.  A doctor who is perfect for one patient may not be a good choice for another one because of his/her goals for health care management.  Patients must take an active role in their care and decisions that are made by getting all the information they need to make informed decisions and to ask the right questions.  This will help them to feel comfortable.  Doctors can only help if the patient discloses full information and history, if the patient follows the recommendations, takes the medications that are prescribed properly and if the patient trusts him or her.  I don't know if this is what you were looking for but I hope it helps.  Best wishes\n\n",

    "content": "The biggest disadvantage to being a doctor in the US where I practice is not having as much curing of disease and illness as one would expect. It seems medicine moves slowly for obvious safety reasons and when we donot move carefully, we pay the price or should I say our precious patients pay the price w side effects, missed diagnoses, later then desired diagnosis of disease, and then many times you may reflect and realize the huge strides we have made over the years in helping people cope w pain, suffering and complications of disease.  I also think there is a big disadvantage in that ONLY NOW at this time in history are we finally getting back to realizing that being a physician is much more  about the..... size of your heart.... then the size of your brain or wallet.  There have been similar periods in hx where being a physician was easier in that there were less distractions and greater morals, but we seem to be getting back to that type of time period now again as the superficial rewards of being a physician are fading away. Also, some of the worst times in medicine have been when patients are mistreated or assigned to a handy neat, quick diagnosis when there is much more going on clearly. Dealing w insurance companies that only want to save money by not approving tests, treatments, referrals as a knee jerk first response w/o first considering each patient as an indiviual first is very difficult if you truly care for the profession.  Dealing w hospitals that are only concerned about paying their bills and making profits . These are only some thoughts about the negatives.....  As for the positives... truly there are SO many, many precious rewards.... that  you can only feel and appreciate in your heart and inner being that all the above disadvantages stem from a healthy concern of truly caring for the ill that have placed themselves in our sacred trust to do our very best.\n\n",

    "title": "20 years old rapid hair loss",
    "content": "Hi I've always been self consicious about my hair. I have very thin hair and on top of that it seems it's falling out more quickly than ever. I'm always had an spot in the front left side of the hairline that had a little less hair than the rest of my hair line. When I was about 17 it seemed to be receeding but I didn't think much of it. Now it seems my whole head is losing hair little by little but that front left side is falling out more rapidly. About a year ago my doctor told me I had \"abnormal cells\" and \"signs\" of HPV I supposed. I don't know if that had anything to do with it but I did get my shots for it. I also know I do not get proper nutrition as well. I'm so confused and at the time I don't have health insuance. I want to cry every night about it because I'm so scared that I'm going to have hair resoration or I'm very sick. The stress about it may even be making my hair fall out even worse.  Do you have any explanation for this? Or have any idea what it may be? I'm so desperate for some answers because I feel like I'm TOO YOUNG for it to be happening because of age.  I know I have high cholesterol as well but I'm only about 10 pounds overweight. I'm aware it's very high for my weight and I'm not sure if this may be a reason for it as well.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,The causes of hairloss in your age group for women is of two types.Generalised and localised.The localised patterns are seen with an area of hairloss.Alopecia areata is an auto immune problem,and fungus infections again localised, but scaly.In your case it is generalised.The commonest cause is Telogen effluvium in which after an illness,or due to general weakness the growing hairs suddenly turn to telogen hairs.This is a normal cycle in all but the sudden change results in excess hairfall.The reason in a young female to develop this would be iron deficiency.Sure the telogen hair would turn back to anagen,ie new hair growth in time.But you may need iron and protein suppliments.Also best to get your thyroid study becaue hypothyroid states lead to hairfall.Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "I got Caulk Residue on my skin",
    "content": "About four weeks ago in my garage, i was picking up a broken Caulk tube that was split in half. I put two latex gloves on each hand and picked up the chunks of Caulk that were on the garage floor, immediately throwing it in the trash. There was some Caulk stuck on the garage floor so i started scrubing it with a metal brush. As i was scrubing i noticed the handal had a sticky residue on it. at the same time my hands started to feel a little sticky even with two gloves on each hand. I quickly went to wash my hands about ten times scrubing the heck out of them. My hands still felt sticky, by this point i was really scared. Later that night i went to urinate and forgot my hands were sticky and accidently touched my penis all over especially the opening of my foreskin at the tip. I also touched my lips and the skin on my torso when i was changing my clothes that night. The next morning my stomach was really burning and felt like i had to go real bad, I went three times in a row. My lips also started feel sticky. Later that night my genital region started to feel a little sticky. About two days after that my hands still felt really sticky and the tip of my penis started to really burn. Since then i used acetone on my hands twice but still feel pretty much the same. My skin still feels a little sticky and my penis still hurts and burns a little, it is very uncomfortable. Im afraid the Caulk residue is stuck on the tip of my penis and underneath my foreskin. The Residue must have gone through the latex gloves. Will this ever go away. PLEASE HELP!\n\n",

    "title": "A Patient's Perspective In the Modern World",
    "content": "\u201cBy now I am resigned to the fact that if after trying so hard, and doing my best to be patient, and if dealing with all the of these things I have been dealing with are going to be the status quo, then I will probably toss all my medicine out and get a room with a view!\u201c  Really, I guess this has become a testament to how probably many patients feel nowadays. But, why is everyone so sick nowadays anyhow? Was it always like this before the advent of modern medicine and the commercialized world? How does one decide to continue on and pursue care as opposed to giving up, crawling into a shell, or even worse. It makes me sad to see how there are so many people suffering out there, and not enough resources, and not enough time, and not enough answers. I myself am blessed to have some answers and some resources, but I think it is normal to want to just give up on trying to get help. Why should this be normal? From what I have observed from personal experience and what I have seen in others, I am not the only one who feels this way. I can always offer a bit of advice, but I cannot hardly get the help I need. I can always be there for someone, but when I need someone to be there for me they just aren't around. This is life for the chronically ill patient of the day it seems. I have seen this over and over and over again, and there is just not enough love and help to go around. If I could spread myself thin enough to take away all the pain in the world, or to help even a few of those out there who cannot get the care or answers they need, I would do it regardless of any impact upon my own health. Those who have cared and taken time are a blessing, and since many do not have the resources readily available to them, or because their own families or practitioners are overloaded, or unavailable, then the individual is given no choice but to look on their own for help. How does one find an advocate to facilitate health care when they are too tired and weak to do this anymore for themselves? I was blessed enough to have a friend who represented me years back when I just wanted to give up completely. However, she could not get the help she needed though and eventually only was given a few years to live. I guess suffering is a big motivator for some, and concern and empathy for others. Perhaps the world would be a better place if we didn't know so much, or if we all could have the simple innocence of children. I really think it would. With all the hype, stress, over immersion of stimuli and fast paced craziness that seems to permeate through our own walls, even in our own homes in this modern world...I cannot help but wish I lived in a peaceful setting without a care but to care for those around me. Family values have changed. The Nuclear family has declined in my opinion into some morphed and mutated dream of what a real family used to be.  Many kids are raising themselves. Parents cannot afford to stay at home, and so many children grow up as latchkey kids, or in some kind of day care setting. Were mental health illnesses really so prevalent even at the beginning of the last century? Sure, there were no computers or such a news oriented high tech world in existence, but I really believe that people are suffering more than ever because of a lack of fundamental basics such as values, structure in the home, work that involved the human being as a whole and not just taxed the brain. Stressors have definitely evolved into something beyond the typical olden day worry. Now we have to try to figure out who we are more than ever. Faith is in a great decline, and money and greed have replaced the need for compassion, fidelity, and overall common sense. So mental illness seems to be on the rise. But, what can we expect in a sick world without a remedy to cure what ails it. It is hard not to be disillusioned with the plight of the world today. So, here is my view and it is only one view. It may not matter at all. If I really had the energy, I would research this and add the ideas and world views of others...especially of patients who are suffering in the modern age, particularly in the Western world. Cultural differences seem to make a big difference on how we see things. It also seems to me that things are much simpler, even if chaotic in places where such innovation and the rush for success does not exist. The Amish are a good example of a culture where family values, spirituality, and simplicity still hold true. They form together as a community to help each other out, despite the lack of health insurance or governmental help which they do not normally look to for help. They access modern health care, but they help each other. Maybe we could learn a lot from cultures such as that. Maybe if there were more family farms, and less factories, families who lived together could eat, work, learn, live, love and play together too. Sure, I enjoy modern convenience...but isn't convenience sometimes just another way to not have to actually work hard and care about each other.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear SoTired76,  The tone of your post is so sad and frustrated, I just wanted to reach out to you to say that I am sorry for your suffering.  I do not know what kind of health problems you are experiencing but you indicate that you have a chronic illness and have difficulty obtaining the support you need.  I wanted to suggest to you that you seek out a support group in your area, or even online.  It sounds like you have a lot of knowledge and experience that might be helpful to others in similar situations, and likewise you may find others who can offer their understanding, knowledge and experience to you.    I agree that our health care system is at times seems overloaded and imperfect, as are many facets of our modern lives.  I also see that great progress has been made in medicine in recent years.  Globally the rate of life expectancy has increased, many diseases that once caused widespread death are now successfully treated, even eradicated, more people do have access to quality health care than ever before.  I think you're also correct that we as humans need to examine the impact that our lifestyles have on the health of our bodies, our communities, our planet as a whole, because there is a lot of room for improvement.  I also believe that change  must start within each of us.  I love the quote from Ghandi, \"Be the change you want to see in the world\".  You seem to have a lot of passion and great ideas about what change would do the world good.  I am certain you are not alone in that!  Good luck to you, I hope you will seek out and find ways to help yourself and others navigate towards good health.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for your response. I really want to make a difference somehow. I wrote this sort of in an essay format, because after being on two websites that are for support and patient questions, and I have been been vigilant in trying to help in whatever (even if in a piecemeal sort of way), trying to help those I can. Here I am more limited understandably. I thought that the topic would be a good one for those who are on here and to see what it is like from the point of view of not just me, but several people whom I have learned much from over the past month. It is sad and frustrated, but also I tried to make light of things as I see it. I am very much affected by the suffering I see around me, and I feel very powerless to help in the way I really want to. So, I am doing what I can as best as I can. I am also trying (having some difficulty lol) trying to get a blog going but it takes me more time than normal. So, if I write things on this one board on here, even if it is not always the most cheery view, maybe even one person who is learning will think about being on the other side of the fence. I have a few friends who are nurses and my brother is going to college for nursing. My aunt is a PA, and my uncle is a nurse as well. I was going to be a psychologist, but my health put that on hiatus. At least I finished my undergraduate degree and if nothing else I have learned a lot about the world, different cultures, and emotional issues. So, the next thing I write will be more upbeat. I also really appreciate your feedback. It helps give me a more positive outlook in spite of everything. But truly, I do yearn for a beautiful place in the country and not have to deal with so much anymore. Peace and blessings to you and to all.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Raistlin,  I'm not familiar with all the business aspects of the process but I can tell you what I know from my perspective as a physician.  Most insurance companies require a referral from a primary care physician for the insured person to be able to see a specialist.  The reason for this is to have the primary care physician (PCP) screen patients to see who truly needs to see a specialist, since specialists are more expensive to the insurance company.  The thought is that if people are allowed to go to the specialist directly more people who don't need to see the specialist will anyway.    When I, as a primary care physician, decide to refer a patient to a specialist I submit a form with the necessary information.  This is then forwarded to the insurance company and the patient can then make an appointment with the specialist.  The form serves as notice to the insurance company that I have recommended the specialist.  I hope this helps a little.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Thank you for your time and effort. Have a good time. ^.^  1. How long have you been a Doctor/Nurse?  4 years  2. On a scale of 1 to 10 (1 being the least important), how do you rate the importance of communication between you and your patients? Why?  At least a 9, it is crucial that the patient be aware of the condition and treatment plan.  A patient needs to be able to trust their doctor.  Understanding the medical plan is crucial to this.  Communication is the only way for this to occur.  3.  Why do you think communication between doctors and patients has worsened over the years?  This makes the assumption that it has.  For the most part I think you are correct.  There are some physicians that have maintained good communication but it definitely is a challenge.  Medicine has become much more business oriented.  As such, doctors are finding more and more demands on our time.  In many cases it simply is not possible to spend 30-45 minutes with each patient.  Some physicians find themselves in a position where they can only spend 10-15 minutes with each patient.  The trick is learning to communicate well during this limited time to allow the patient to feel their needs were met.  4.  How do you think communication affects the way health care is provided? (Would it help or hinder?)  This gets back to the issue of trust.  Communication enables a patient to understand what is going on and allows the patient to trust their doctor.  If this trust is not established care is often hindered.  Patients may be uncertain about taking their medications, for example, because they have not had their questions properly answered.  5.  As a doctor/nurse, in what ways do you think would help improve communication?  One of the most important issues is for physicians to make communication a priority.  Simply asking patient if they have anymore questions before leaving the room goes a long way.  I hope this helps some.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I worked in a doctors office and there are some doctors who love to spend an hour just talking to their patients and then there were the ones who did the In-and-out thing, and then there was everyone in between. And I saw how the patients reacted to each type.  But that's not what i'm getting at. You stated that for the most part I am correct in my assumption. So which part did you think otherwise or what did you think of as you read that?   JP\n\n",

    "content": "I am so glad you are concerned with communication, as it is the key to being a good doctor.  If you do not take the time to listen and to explain, you can and will probably miss important information.  There is so much care passed on to nurse practitioners and physicians assistants and not enough with the doctor.  I have had erroneous diagnosis from those that are not doctors.   It would seem alright to see the nurse for bloodwork or a flu shot etc. but especially as patients get older and more serious symptoms present themselves, it is important to have a doctor speak to them.  I hope you take the time to get to know your patients individually.  They all have their own personalities and histories.  You will find it helpful.  Most doctors have way too many patients to handle alone.  Is it necessary to have so many patients?  Why are waiting rooms packed and people waiting for hours along side contagious people?  Is this really the best way to treat people?  Obviously, I don't think so.  Take on a work load you can handle.  This way you won't miss vital information that can prevent a patient from a delayed diagnosis.  Good for you, doing research on this topic.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Zles,  This is a very interesting question.  I don't think we can definitively say at this point if there are any longterm effects from shifting your sleep cycle.  There are many people that do this.  Probably as long as you are getting enough sleep you'll adapt just fine.  There could potentially be some long term health effects but to my knowledge, most people who have been studied regarding this have really not been adjusting well.  They stay up late but then don't sleep that well while they are asleep during the day.  I suspect there will be more information about this in the coming years as more studies are done.  Sorry I can't give you a solid answer on this.    Best wshes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Murphy1982,  The body will shift its usual schedule if working for extended periods of time.  So, basically your body is flipping its days and nights some.  This is why you are more tired during the day and able to stay up while working at night.  Children will also adjust their internal clocks if they are moved to a different schedule.  So, most likely, in an effort to spend more time with you your daughter started staying up later and subsequently started sleeping in later.  This can be difficult to overcome.  Some things you can try are to keep the room very dark when sleeping and bright when awake.  It will probably take you a day or two to readjust so trying to bunch your days off so that you can avoid having to flip back and forth.  This will give you the most opportunity to adjust to your schedule.  Best wishes.\n\n",

There are several ways for women to track ovulation including analyzing cervical mucous changes and basal body temperature changes.  As to your second question, ovulation for a 29 day cycle would generally be considered to occur on day 15 (April 7th).  Sperm can survive in the vaginal tract for about a week.  As such, it is very slightly more likely for fertilization to occur from intercourse on April 1 and April 3 but this in no way excludes the 29th.  The 29th would be generally considered about the limits of when fertilization could occur.  Really, though, there is no way to know for sure unless DNA testing is done after the baby is born or if an amniocentesis is done during the pregnancy to look at the baby's DNA.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I just finished my second year of medical school at Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland (second year consisting of anatomy, biochemistry, physiology, etc) and am thinking of transfering to The Cairo University Medical School ( Kasr al Ainy). Firstly, I can hardly obtain any information on their site, so I don't even know if they except transfers, but if anyone knows of someone I could contact there-I would greatly appreciate it. Secondly, I am a U.S. citizen and am thinking of returning to the US for residency, so does anyone know if such a transfer to Egypt would be detrimental to my future? Lastly, I would really just like any advice on this matter, so if I could talk with anyone privately through email, that would also be helpful. My real motivation in the move is that I am of arab origin, and so being in an arab country would be much preferable to me. thank you for your time, Dania\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Dania, 1- Yes you can transfere to finish your medical school in cairo university, however they have to check for the courses you have finished. You must pass all the exams for the first 2 years courses before starting 3rd year. So, if any courses left not studied, you have to do study them and to pass their exams in cairo university. But i really do not know how they organize this. 2- such a transfer to Egypt would not be detrimental to your future future, However to do postgraduate studies in USA you have to to pass USMLE exams which can be done also in egypt at anytime starting from  your first year of transfere. 3- Who to contact , i think by emails is more or less unsuscessfull, the best way to do this is to go to the embassy (egypt embassy , or any egypt cultural centers, accadimy  in your city) ask them . They can contact the university so easily and they know very well how to do this. Also, any new informations we can get will be posted, keep in contact. Best of luck.\n\n",

I'm an Egyptian whom happens to be an American citizen in her first yr of undergrad *I take Pre-Medical subjects though* in the USA. I've practically lived in the USA for my entire life but I need to go back to Egypt because my family is there now...and for almost the same reasons as Dania: I'm Egyptian!      So you said that international students can transfer to Kasr El Aini,  but do you have more details on that issue now? I know they need to check the subjects I've taken(and I've specifically taken all the subjects they take here during the 1st yr), but do you know exactly who I can contact...maybe something more direct than the embassy since I'm in Egypt right now and can practically go anywhere? I hope someone who will give me real info tho, I've spent the past month going from office to office with no luck . I need to transfer next yr. (which will be my 2nd. yr) and they all say just come back then. But I need to know now. So if anyone knows how I can get an approval for transferring and who to contact please let me know! Thanks! ~Rana\n\n",

Some other sites rate doctors, but sometimes these are in the insurance company sites.  Note that it is of course not fair to judge a doctor just by a very small number of comments.  In some states such as Massachusetts at the website of the agency that registers doctors, or at the state medical association, you can find out whether there have been disciplinary measures against a doctor, lawsuits, and what specialty boards that doctor is listed as being certified by.  Occasionally a doctor will claim to be a specialist when he / she is not registered by a specialty board.[/url]\n\n",

I am not a doctor, however I know many teenage girls that get this white discharge you are talking about.   When you had sex, did you use a condom? Birth control? What methods do you use to protect yourself if you used none of these?  Do not panic yourself into thinking you are pregnant when you may be not. But also don't ignore the problem and hope it goes away.  Sorry my help is very limited. There are many people who can help you better than I can.  -Joshua\n\n",

I do not have insurance and he knows this.  I asked him how much it would cost and he said between $500 and $800.  He told me he knows it's expensive for me, but recommended I do it.  Long story short, I just received the bill for the CT scan/s and it is almost $5,000 for apparently two cat scans (didn't I realize I needed two), a contrast media, and a seperate bill from a company called Radia.  What should I do about this?  I depend on my doctor, not only for medical reasons, but to I depend on him to be looking out for my best interests in all areas and to explain all my options medically and financially.  Any advice is appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Jennifer,  Lidocaine will work to numb the vocal cords and abolish the gag response which is the most feared thing during intubation for fear of aspiration if the patient vomits during intubation.  Lidocaine can administred to the throat by spraying, using a gel like formulation that one can swalow and keep in the back of the mouth for a while and by a liquid formulation that could swished and gargled.  The effect of lidocaine is short lived, if you give a patient lidocaine intravenous, its half life is between one and a half and 2 hours.  About esophageal intubation and the blood coming out, it could be from any where because most probably this is trauma secondary to intubation attempt. Could be from teeth, tongue, throat or from the esophagus itself.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.

    "content": "Well, I am going to go to Med school next year. Right now I am in a Paramedic Program, we are just having a \u2026learning experience, mostly for fun during our free time. No we weren\u2019t doing this with the supervision of a Medical Doctor. We have intubated before,  and we know how to. But we have done it in an OR were everything is prefect\u2026the patient is sedated and is limp, and the table is prefect reach. We were trying for something a little less controlled, like on the ground, mostly awake but not in an emergency situation. A few of us do not have or have very good control of the gag reflex and are able to sustain it to the point where a Laryngoscopy is possible with the Laryngoscope blade, but when going to advance the tube  (I\u2019ll use myself as an example) I start to get a little nervous and loose control of the reflex, then gag. So we got the great idea of using Lidocaine as a local anesthetic. We just didn\u2019t know how to administer locally to the vocal cords.   I have the feeling that the program is a little more lax on training regulations then the Med schools.  I was given a choice between having a ET tube done or a NG tube. I am just scared I would throw up with an NG tube and was promised that the ET tube would only be in for a few seconds.  Anyway, would it still be unethical to go on? We were planning on trying it tomorrow after classes, but using a spray. Thanks for your time Jennifer\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Jennifer,   i would encourage you all not to do that. As a paramedic most probably you will have the opportunity to intubate people in non-perfect conditions a lot and i don't think that what you are doing now is the perfect way to practice non-perfect conditions intubations because still it is a somewhat controlled situation.  Intubations have there own risks and lidocaine as well has its own severe and serious side effects. So, something might happen and then you will get into real problems.  Training programs have regulations and rules and these were put by people who have thought aobut the best way to train students and i think that if they thought that using each other for practice would make people trained better, most probably they would have gone with it and i think you have to go by the rules even though if you think they are not good enough because if you break the rules and the life of a person is endangered or lost it is going to be because the rules were broken.  i would urge you not to participate in such activities.

Is it the drug that you are worried about or is it the complication of Intubating the wrong tube ( that happened Monday)  Anyway  Thanks for your time  Jennifer\n\n",

What concerned me about what was being asked by this particular student was the extreme lack of knowledge about intubation and airway management.  The student asked numerous questions but not one bordered on being an intelligent one.  I want to reassure anyone who reads these postings, that the level of absolute ignorance illustrated is not reflective of the profession.  I only hope that these questions were posted VERY early in this paramedic student\u2019s education and that her class mate\u2019s attempts at performing this advanced procedure was a sign of an eagerness to learn.\n\n",

    "content": "Good Day to you all\u2026I am sorry, I haven\u2019t been on this site for a while and forgot about this posting until I received an e-mail this last week. As Emskyle comments are concerned, when we were playing around with this we were still in the \u201cVERY\u201d begging of learning about the airway system.  The professors did know that we were doing with the lidocain and airway instruments, in fact they even encouraged it.   A little background on my questions\u2026I was in the beginning of Paramedic School, and the youngest of my class (I was very gullible).  The teacher had said that if we would attempt to stand an ET we wouldn\u2019t have to try the NG tube.  Honestly I was disgusted by the thought of having anything go down my nose so I and a few others opted for intubation.  I was concerned about this because of all the soft tissue in the throat and the damage that could be done so I asked questions on here. NOTE: The Medical Director never did know that we did this and I am sure he would a more then a little mad if he knew the many things we did in that class. There were many things that happened in the class I took that were wrong and later I took some of those problems to higher authorities.  Since then, the Paramedic Director no longer works here, and they are getting new teachers. Another NOTE: We got the Lidocaine, Nitroglycerin and Adenosine from one of the teachers who was a nurse.   I am glad I did ask that question because it is through questions that we learn what is wrong and right. While I was learning I am glad that someone that knows more then I was there to answer my questions and be concerned about that I was doing. (Thank you to the people that responded) I don\u2019t know if I ever posted anything about Nitro but we used to drop out BP to see the effects (very stupid!!) The teachers and Program Director were removed do to my reporting after I posted questions and received answers that it was wrong I did finish school\u2026healthy and alive, did a paramedic internship at Grady and have moved on. There are new people in charge of the Paramedic Program I went through and a new Medical Director. Thank you for your concerns and comments. Like the Web Medic said the things that we did in that class are not reflections on the National Registry for Paramedics in the U.S.. Thank you again Jennifer\n\n",

    "content": "DEAR NurseNancy, Thanks for your question. However, you didn't indicate in your profile whether u r a student nurse or any other medical professional or whether the ques. is an assignment,etc. As a result I don't know how to respond because I haven't a clue as to what exactly u are looking for. Kindly let me know if my answer below was of any help to you. I would now proceed with my answer to your question:  Biochemically, starvation implies prolonged fasting. When the obese man enters the starved state, after 3-5 days of fasting, biophysiological changes occur in his body. --- His muscles decreases its use of ketone bodies and oxidises fatty acids as its primary energy source. --- Due to decreased muscle usage, blood ketone body levels rise.--- His brain then takes up and oxidises the ketone bodies in order to derive energy. Consequently, the brain decreases its use of glucose, although glucose is still a major fuel for the brain. --- HEPATIC GLUCONEOGENESIS DECREASES. --- MUSCLE PROTEIN IS SPARED. --- Due to decreased conversion of amino-acids to glucose, LESS UREA IS PRODUCED FROM AMINO-ACIDS IN STARVATION THAN AFTER AN OVERNIGHT FAST. --- The body uses its FAT STORES AS ITS PRIMARY SOURCE OF ENERGY DURING THE 10 DAYS. --- Overall, LIPIDS ARE QUANTITATIVELY THE MOST IMPORTANT FUEL IN HIS BODY. --- The LENGTH OF TIME THAT A PERSON COULD SURVIVE ON 2 SLICES OF BREAD (source of carbohydrate), VEGEMITE & WATER DEPENDS MAINLY ON THE AMOUNT OF FAT STORED IN ADIPOSE TISSUE.--- Even after 3-4 weeks of starvation, blood glucose levels are still in the range of 65 mg/dL. IN SUMMARY, starvation causes muscle to decrease its use of ketone bodies. As a result, ketone body levels rise in the blood, and the brain uses them for energy. Consequently, the brain needs less glucose and gluconeogenesis slows, thereby, sparing muscle protein. These changes in the fuel utilisation patterns of the obese individual enabled him to survive for 10 days without SOLID FOOD. REMEMBER: TO LIVE LONGER, LESSEN THY MEALS.        (Benjamin Franklin)I SINCERELY HOPE THAT THIS IS WHAT U WERE LOOKING FOR. KINDLY LET ME KNOW A.S.A.P.

It's hard to hear anything with the sirens going, the patient moaning or crying, people talking and the road noise rumbling through the floor but the Littman would come through for me. Nice lung sounds, good heart tones, good B/P's, I could hear wonderfully well when the place was quiet. Littman is my choice too. Only one problem I found with them, they grow legs real fast. You will need to figure out a way to mark it so it won't be taken. Keep your eyes open, you'll see interesting ways people have thought up to mark their \"ears\".\n\n",

Have your eating habits changed? Have you experiences additonal stresses that you didnt have before?  Stress and tension takes a huge toll on the body and can cause extreme fatigue.  Often the things that cause stress come on gradually so that we do not realize how much stress we are under.  How do you sleep at night?  Do you experience any pain in the joints or muscles? People tend to always look for a physical disease that causes fatigue and forget that often it is the mental stresses of life that wears the body down.  Let me know about these things and perhaps we can narrow it down to one or two possibilities. Regards, Carolyn\n\n",

    "content": "Hello: Females usually stop growing at age 16 and males at age 18.  However, there is a wide variance in when one stops growing and it all depends on genetics.   Some males have been known to continue growing into their late 20's and in rare instances up to the age of 30. HGH or human growth hormone is responsible for our rate of growth.  Studies are being done with HGH to help children with exceptionally short stature to grow taller.  I do not know of any studies being done with those in their late teens however.  Taking a poll will only give you peoples guesses and one guess is as good as another.  It is genetics that plays the important role here.  Ask your parents about their age when they stopped growing and if your grandparents are alive I suggest asking them also.  That would be a better estimate of when you will stop growing than a poll can give you. Regards, Carolyn\n\n",

From my own experience I would say that just taking a few courses would not be of much benefit to you in your career if you don't plan on going into medicine or a field of Allied Health.  If you are considering Medicine as a profession I think it would be beneficial to spend time volunteering at a  hospital or other facility where you could see first hand what goes on to determine if this is really something you want to spend your time studying. Any career in the medical field relies heavily on the study of Anatomy and Physiology. After that an in-depth study of Pharmacology would be the next course I would take. These courses are a far cry from networking.  Are you thinking of changing your major? CmMerritt\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Tanya,  Is it \"cephalalgia\" or did it sound french like \"tic doulereux\"?  And regarding the intubation practice, there are models (dummies) to practice on but there is nothing like the real thing. Of course, it should never be practiced on alive healthy awake people without an indication for intubation.  One of the ways of practicing which is known is to practice on dead bodies and there are certain hospitals who have policies regarding this and they have to take the consent of the family of the deceased which allows the medical personel to practice such procedures. One of the ways to practice intubation is to go to the operating room but this is more of a controlled environment.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

If I had some of your symptoms I'd be visiting my personal Doctor for an evaluation.    Many replies are site Doctors advising posters to visit your Doctor.  Have you?  I'm curious if you found an answer to your inquiry, yet there are no futher follow-up postings.    From what I've read, this site is not a substitute for visiting your Doctor in the flesh.  All I can say is go visit your Doctor if you have any out of the ordinary symptoms.  Don't depend on the Doctors on this board.  They can only advise you based on the detail wording of your posting.  That is it.    I wish you all relief of your medical problems, so please if you think your condition warrants questioning a physician, please go see one.  thank you,  Ken\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Ken,  Thank you very much for using our website.  You are right.  There is no substitute for visiting one's own personal physician.   Some of the posts here on the website are patients who already saw their physicians and want a second opinion, some of them need support, i feel sometimes that some of the patients just want to get the load off their chests.   Sometimes, you will notice that some of the posters will mention that they don't have insurance or some of them like the patients in the United Kingdom don't have access to their doctors for a regular non-emergency visit except after a few months because of how the health system is constructed over their so instead of waiting and do nothing why not get an opinion from here or there.   There are few patients who give feed back on the website but i wonder about the other patients that don't give any feed back.  My explanation is that people nowadays like to talk to computers more than humans, no wonder, we are now living in the digital world era.  Once more, thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and waiting for more of your posts.  Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

If you have taken the time to read enough of the messages posted you will see there are cases that this board has prevented someone from becomaing seriously ill or worse.  Aside from anything else, every doctor on this board in every message I have read always insists on users going to thier GP should the symptoms suggest something serious. did you know in the UK and Ireland combined there is in excess of 350 million UK pounds wasted on pointess visits to the doctor?  And also, if you aren't a GP which i suspect you aren't qualified to comment.  I appreciate your remarks but do not agree that this board dissuades people from visiting their doctor. In fact, I firmly believe it to be quite the contrary.  Kind regards,  Egan\n\n",
